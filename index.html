								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like every Windows user, I have had a lot of frustrating experiences with the abusive behavior and dark patterns that have taken over the platform. Like when they started having Skype silently run in the background logged in with the user&#39;s Microsoft account without any notice or human intervention, and removed the setting to disable it from launching at startup so that it couldn&#39;t be prevented. I had to completely uninstall it, which didn&#39;t really help, because they still kept bringing it back after every update. I assume that they&#39;re going to do this with Teams now.For every egregious user-hostile behavior, you can search and find a ton of forum threads where people discuss at length how to reverse or mitigate them. The fact that Microsoft is aware of this and continues to prioritize this kind of abusive growth hacking over user trust, knowing fully how that impacts the company&#39;s reputation among enthusiasts, is perhaps more damning than the actual practices.Nobody at Microsoft who has decision-making authority actually cares. Contempt for the users is so deep in the DNA that this will never get better. It&#39;s disappointing, because it ultimately undermines all of the great effort that people elsewhere in the company have put into features like WSL that might otherwise make the platform attractive to modern developers.It creates a really adversarial posture between the user and the platform. When they introduce new features, I&#39;m reluctant to even try them because I don&#39;t trust their intentions. It&#39;s like being in an abusive relationship."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article nails a lot of the issues with Windows 11.I bit the bullet and upgraded to Windows 11 late last year thinking it must be an improvement over Windows 10. It turned out to be a big step backwards.- Changing the default browser is a lot of work instead of a single click.- I can&#39;t move the task bar to the side, even though almost every monitor nowadays has much more horizontal space than vertical.- All apps are not readily accessible from the start menu; I have to click another button to get to them.- I have a 2-in-1 laptop, and turning it into tablet mode is wonky.- I can&#39;t choose to not have grouped buttons on the taskbar.- The context menus UX is horrible. Some context menu items are now two clicks away instead of one. Also what&#39;s with the excessive rounded corners and slim selection padding?- The stacked notifications is confusing, and always shows the calendar when I open the notifications panel.- Lots of crap pushed on me, like chat (aka Teams), widgets (which require a Microsoft account), 3rd party apps that look like they&#39;re installed but actually get downloaded/installed on first use.I was able to fix a lot of those issues with ExplorerPatcher [0]. However, one day after a Windows update, Explorer didn&#39;t start at all after login (black screen, I thought Windows was hosed). This has since been fixed. But I decided enough is enough, and finally &#34;upgraded&#34; back to Windows 10.The only good thing about Windows 11 is wslg, which provides out of the box support for Linux GUI apps (not available on Windows 10). But I can get the same result with an X server and some work.[0] https://github.com/valinet/ExplorerPatcher/wiki/All-features"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see any mention of Cortana or how hard that is to rip out of the OS, but I think it&#39;s worth mentioning. The tool called &#34;Everything&#34; by https://www.voidtools.com/ is so insanely better than Cortana and blazingly fast that I&#39;m not sure why they&#39;re still trying to push Cortana.https://www.getblackbird.net/ helps a lot and it&#39;s one of the first things I do to Windows installs when I need to use them, but it can break stuff if you&#39;re too aggressive with it (e.g. Windows store / Xbox stuff, which for some reason is how to record screenshot videos in Windows... https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/record-a-game-cl... ).The article also didn&#39;t mention the Microsoft Store and how awful everything around that experience is, especially compared to macOS, where the worst part is how signing apps works ( https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Se...  vs https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/msix/package/signin... )."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having lived in Shanghai during 2005-2012 and seeing the construction boom there, I noticed some differences immediately after arriving in the US. It&#39;s common to hear about transportation projects taking decades to expand a few stations here. Mean while, since the time I left the Shanghai subway station has opened 21 new lines composed of 516 stations.Certainly, the air/water was worse in China but workers also had to work much harder (later nights, weekends, etc). But perhaps most importantly, the government would waste no time in getting land that it needed, and it certainly wouldn&#39;t ask for your consideration if it needs to do construction on a Saturday morning.While I appreciate that there is an inherent trade off between environmental consideration and speed, I think the author makes it clear that it&#39;s reached comic proportions in the US. The article is short, but I think the main premise is overwhelmingly accurate: The system exists to protect the status quo.There&#39;s also the reliance of transportation agencies on consultants:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m trying to build a house on empty land in Los Angeles. It’s about 15mins from downtown in Mt Washington. We bought the land in April of 2019 and started on the design and permitting process immediately. Despite it being in populated Los Angeles, we need a septic system, to widen the road and add curbs, move a power pole, relocate 3 trees, and extend a water line. We won’t have gas as we want to go all solar. All of this the city is making us pay for.Our permit for a small septic system took 14 months to approve.The power department has told us it will likely take 12 months for them to approve the pole movement (the city is making us move it as part of the road widening).The water main needs to be extended 12 feet, and it’s mandated that the utility company must do that work and it will cost us $75k.The tree permit took us 12 months to get and requires us to get a bond too.We still haven’t got approval for the road widening, it’s been almost 18 months. Keep in mind this is just the road in front of our house in a residential area of Los Angeles. There are lots of homes on our street already.I’m originally from Australia. The American bureaucracy is insane. The agencies don’t talk to each other. Often times we have been acting as the go between for different departments that worked in the same building!Los Angeles has a huge housing shortage. If my experience is anything to go by, it’s because the bureaucracy is so dense it takes years to just get the permits in place. It would be cheaper and better if I could just pay a bribe and get it done quickly.Americans seem to know what the problem is, but just accept that nothing can be done about it. Like you all know the DMV sucks and the USPS sucks, but everyone has just accepted that’s it’s just the way it is and decided to live with it. Why?! Hold your officials accountable to actually run government effectively."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For public transit in particular, the US has billionaires and politicans who actively campaign against such projects [1]. The effect of this cannot be overstated. People buy into the propaganda that their taxes will go up and/or it will bring crime to their idyllic locales (where otherwise property prices keep the riffraff out).Landowners in the US have very successfullly voted in measures that limit further construction (including higher density housing and public transit systems) and increase the value of their holdings.I&#39;ve mentioned housing here because it directly impacts a lot of potential construction, particularly public transport. You cannot build anything other than single-family homes in much of the US. This lowers population density and makes public transport less viable. It also diverts tax revenue to build infrastructure for the required cars: highways, parking lots, etc.There are a lot of local problems here too eg NYC&#39;s scaffolding laws [2], corruption in NYC construction projects [3] and CEQA in California [4].[1]: https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/19/climate/koch-brothers-pub...[2]: https://www.insurancejournal.com/news/east/2020/10/08/585902...[3]: https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/28/nyregion/new-york-subway-...[4]: https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/03/signature-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Higher education in the US is trying to fulfill so many roles it&#39;s unsustainable.    - teaching marketable skills so people can get jobs
    - teaching &#34;how to think&#34; and learning about art and culture
    - Performing cutting edge research
    - minor league sports teams

The large state schools are trying to fulfill all these conflicting roles. We should probably break them out to separate entities.If you have a physicist who&#39;s at the leading edge of research in their field, you want them doing that research, not teaching 18 year old&#39;s Newton&#39;s laws of motion. And they&#39;re mostly not doing that teaching, that gets farmed out to an adjunct paid starvation wages. So the kid who&#39;s paying through the nose to attend a top university with the best researchers doesn&#39;t get to interact with them much and gets an inferior education compared to one where they hired and properly compensated someone to actually focus on teaching.If we want to train people for specific jobs - create institutions that do that. If the upper class want someplace to send their kids to read poetry and binge drink for 4 years before they get a jr. associate position at their Dad&#39;s investment bank, create a separate institution for that. Major league sports should create and manage their own feeder leagues to develop players, no reason to cram that into a university. We should create dedicated research institutions so researchers don&#39;t have to pretend to care about teaching."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sam Altman makes a lot of grandiose predictions and statements.For example, in 2019 he said “Human radiologists are already much worse than computer radiologists. If I had to pick a human or an AI to read my scan, I’d pick the AI.” [0] However, most people with domain knowledge in this space still would not want their scan not to be read by a human. The AI radiology apps are generally narrowly focused and useful for consultation not diagnosis. [1]In 2015 he predicted: “Self-driving cars are going to get here much faster than people think,” Altman said. He thought we’d see them in three to four years. [2]I think he would be wise to learn from Bill Gates that it&#39;s a bad idea to over-predict what will happen in the short term. &#34;We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten.&#34;I&#39;ll add to this that it&#39;s generally a bad idea to make big predictions outside of areas that you have strong domain knowledge in. I doubt Sam Altman has strong domain knowledge around US higher education. Unfortunately, Silicon Valley culture is full of people who feel that because they&#39;ve succeeded in one domain they have some kind of hidden insight into others.[0] https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/26/sam-altman-on-ai-jobs-may-go...[1] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00330-020-07230-9[2] https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/06/elon-musk-sam-altman-say-s..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the writing on the wall is clear regarding student loans.The entire notion of taxpayer funded student loans is a scam on both taxpayers and students.  It’s a system that allows the colleges/universities to charge any tuition they want and guarantees there will be an artificial demand.For about a decade at least 1M student loan holders default per year. Long before the defaults reached that high, everyone involved knew that student loans were far outpacing the economic value, and yet not a single college or university stepped up in goodfaith to blow the whistle, they continued to suckle at the tit to the detriment of their own students.Education is supposed to benefit students and the nation as a whole but the ridiculousness of loans has ensured it ruins lives and at &gt;$1.5T in taxpayer funded debt that continues to grow exponentially it is a detriment to the country.Collapse of student loans will of course have an impact of the college/university landscape, but the industry as a whole will not collapse, rather tuition will “collapse”, or come down, to what students can actually afford out of pocket without going into debt.  And if the universities/colleges somehow can’t survive on existing taxpayers subsidies from the Dept. of Educations $68B annual budget plus out of pocket tuition rates, then welcome to the real world your university/college is a failed business."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Stormlight Archive (series) by Brandon Sanderson has probably changed my life the most. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve enjoyed a book as much or have had one mean as much to me as I&#39;ve have with this series.The series is incredibly inspirational since despite being a high fantasy novel. In fear of spoiling the plot, I&#39;m being vague: it tracks the stories of (multiple) people who go through difficult life situations and learn to heal from depressive moments while having incredibly, intricate worldbuilding (which is excellent for taking your mind off of reality) and a twisty plot. If you go on the subreddit for this series, r/stormlight_archive, you&#39;ll see people talking about how this book (literally) saved their lives. I can tell you that in the most off-putting moments of life reading inspirational scenes from the Stormlight Archive has helped me stand up again. The messages and themes about life are simple, but also on-point. Overall, an excellent series. I recommend it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First and foremost: The Bible. Not the watered down &#34;everybody goes to heaven&#34; theology that most people subscribe to, but rather an evidence based approach that uses the Bible to interpret itself as it was designed to do.Secondarily, this book saved my life in the sense that it helped me understand my depression, a clinical depression so deep that my psychologist had never seen such a thing previously:Get Out of Your Mind and Into Your Life: The New Acceptance and Commitment Therapy - Stephen C. Hayes https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0054M063A/Its scientific approach to understanding our own thought patterns gave me control- coping mechanisms- for dealing with my own feelings instead of ignoring (&#34;Burying&#34;) them and letting them slowly destroy me from the inside out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a really well written article, one of the best summaries of NAT traversal I have ever read. I started to laugh mid-way, because it&#39;s amusing (and a bit sad) the lengths we have to go to establish communications using the IPv4 addressing space.It&#39;s good to learn about ICE too. I had&#39;nt thought about the security implications : indeed this whole mess makes it very easy for an unprivileged attacker to trick the endpoints into relaying the traffic to their own gateway. For example, if I understand things well, another user behind the NAT can easily make the NAT device relay the traffic to them by sending probes at the same time. I&#39;m not sure how can this be defended against, and if it&#39;s even possible.Is anyone aware of any interesting reading on the subject of MITM of NAT traversal ?Are there any good software libraries that abstract away all these details"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Librewolf is not primarily intended as the definite browser but a sane base template for easily customizable and extendable firefox builds.The librewolf AUR package is a great starting point to make custom builds of firefox; between two json files in the settings repo you can tweak basically any relevant setting, bundle extensions (e.g. use custom forked ones without needing to either sign through Mozilla or disable security), search engines, use your own fxa/syncserver, handlers, branding, etc.All in a git repo and you won&#39;t have to redo things next time you reinstall the browser or get a new machine (anyone else ever scratched their heads trying to recall that one about:config setting?)Building and tweaking vanilla firefox yourself is quite an exercise. Librewolf makes it a breeze. The sane privacy-by-default standards is just the cherry on the top.https://gitlab.com/librewolf-community/settings"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was one of the two guys who came up with the original concept for Librefox.I was responsible for including uBO as default, among other things.Great to see that the project was brought back to life as LibreWolf - Mozilla lawyers had threatened us with legal action because the name was too close to their brand. They expected us to drop the &#34;Fox&#34; part of the name.Everytime I see LibreWolf on HN I feel proud that the spirit of Librefox is still alive.The biggest issue with LibreWolf and what&#39;s stopping it&#39;s further adoption is lack of auto-updates (especially on Windows) and lack of usability - it should work out of the box for everyone. Currently the security settings are too strict in default mode. There should be different levels of pre-configured security levels users can chose in the settings (i.e. &#34;standard&#34;, &#34;strict&#34;, &#34;very strict&#34;).(I don&#39;t use HN for commenting, which is why I created a throwaway account)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been using LibreWolf for a week or so since someone mentioned it in a comment elsewhere - UX-wise, it&#39;s pretty much identical to Firefox. I&#39;m happy it doesn&#39;t have Pocket and the rest of Mozilla&#39;s recent product launches arguing for space in my life. My Firefox setup was already pretty solidly &#34;paranoid/misanthropic&#34;, so I haven&#39;t really noticed any new issues from Libre, but you may.Overall, it&#39;s a pretty good implementation of &#34;Firefox By Mozilla-the-Foundation not Mozilla-the-Corporation.&#34; I&#39;ve been using Firefox at least in part because I think a mono- or even duo-polistic internet is a Bad thing, but Mozilla&#39;s been indifferent-bordering-on-hostile to me as a user class, so I appreciate LibreWolf as a kind of &#34;Chromium for Firefox.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is misleading. The copyright office simply needs the work to be registered under a human name, since a machine or AI cannot hold copyright. The process used to create it is irrelevant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems like a good thing to me, because with &#34;AI-generated works&#34;, there&#39;s the potential to generate a massive amount of images and essentially try to pre-copyright a lot of content, so you can then sue people who produce legitimate works that somewhat resemble what you&#39;ve already copyrighted. Something similar could be done with programming code and transformers.We already have a problem with copyright lasting long after the original author(s) are dead..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From Russell and Norvig, a famous story about difficulty in publishing with probably the first such AI-generated work:&#34;Two researchers from Carnegie Tech, Allen Newell and Herbert Simon, rather stole the show [at the original Dartmouth AI Conference].  Although the others had ideas and in some cases programs for particular applications such as checkers, Newell and Simon already had a reasoning program, the Logic Theorist (LT).... Soon after the workshop, the program was able to prove most of the theorems in Chapter 2 of Russell and Whitehead&#39;s Principia Mathematica.  Russell was reportedly delighted when Simon showed him that the program had come up with a proof for one theorem that was shorter than the one in Principia.  The editors for the Journal of Symbolic Logic were less impressed: they rejected a paper coauthored by Newell, Simon, and Logic Theorist.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is how NYC raises money - when the revenue dips they send out the sidewalk inspectors, health inspectors, tow trucks, etc. and write up a bunch of fines.Most restaurants have a way to signal the kitchen that an inspector has arrived and they&#39;ll quickly toss everything they are cooking into the garbage because it&#39;s cheaper than getting a fine. Former mayor Bloomberg&#39;s planned crack down on soda drinks was more about issuing fines for not serving precisely 8oz of liquid - though the next mayor dropped it and all the special order measuring cups for the health inspectors went to a warehouse.I&#39;ve witnessed a fleets of NYPD tow trucks clearing out streets of UPS and Fedex trucks. They know what time the delivery companies hit various parts of town and they are ready for them.Recently the New York fire inspectors have started fining landlords for debris in the hallways (debris = amazon deliveries left at the door). So now if the delivery comes to the door you have to get it before the building super throws it away to save the landlord from being fined, if it gets left by the mailbox then the food delivery people steal it on their way out. No winning.About ten years ago there was a good samaritan going around feeding parking meters to keep people from being fined. He was arrested and taken to jail. They let him go without charges but not before he spent the weekend - because the person who processes releases doesn&#39;t work on weekends they said. I think he sued and ended up settling out of court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some context for those not in NYC:* Illegal parking and idling are out of control throughout the city. This has been the case for years, but it’s reached new heights since the pandemic. Trucks and cars often idle because they’re parked illegally.* The city DOT, for a variety of reasons, is reluctant to redesign streets to prevent this behavior (e.g. by adding loading zones)* The police are reluctant to ticket for this behavior, and frequently idle in their police cars throughout the city.If a bounty system feels desperate/problematic, it is. Our city agencies have failed to deal with this problem and people are pissed about it. My hope is that this program is a bandaid until larger structural issues with the DOT and NYPD are addressed. We’ll see."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Mr. Slapikas said he pulled in $64,000 in rewards in 2021 for simply paying attention on his daily walks for exercise: “I would expect to get three a day without even looking.”That’s almost 10% of the total fines paid out last year, according to the article.I wonder what the distribution of payouts looks like. I assume it’s a small number of people collecting the bulk of the fines.Regardless, it looks like it’s working. Idling cars may not be producing the bulk of emissions, but it’s one of the easiest places to start cutting as it’s otherwise wasted fuel and emissions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used and extended this tutorial to write the rayvertex [1][2] package, which is a deferred parallel software rasterizer in R. Explicitly building the rendering pipeline really helped me understand the underlying data flow and rasterization techniques, which in turn made me understand GLSL much better. And extending the rasterizer with order-independent transparency, multicore rendering, antialiasing, and other niceties made me appreciate the work that goes into modern renderers.Highly recommend.[1] https://www.rayvertex.com/
