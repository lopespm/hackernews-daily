								<p class="story__comment_others">"For better rendering on high-DPI screens and (more subjectively) screens of people that have zoomed in because HN’s text sizes are unreasonably small, add c.style.imageRendering=&#39;pixelated&#39;.I was going to say that the insertion of these 24 bytes allows you to save ten bytes elsewhere by halving the size of the image (making features one pixel in size, rather than two), but then you’d also have to set the doubled image dimensions, and that’d cost more than ten bytes.(Me, I use HN at 120% on top of a native scaling factor of 150%, which is currently implemented as downsampling of 200% rendering because Firefox hasn’t got fractional scaling right yet under Wayland, and widget.wayland.fractional_buffer_scale has some fairly debilitating side-effects on popup windows including non-rendering and crashes, which is a pity because it improves rendering so very much.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m extremely skeptical of this story, at least as written.It makes great clickbait, but it doesn&#39;t really make sense. Where would someone implant a bluetooth earpiece into their ear? There&#39;s not really a lot of empty space in that area unless someone is very overweight and the device is implanted in layers of fat adjacent to the ear, which aren&#39;t great at conducting sound. Did someone really wrap an earpiece in some bio-compatible material, put it in someone right before the test (battery life is limited), and that person was then in a low enough level of pain and/or on enough painkillers that they could still complete the test? I&#39;m extremely doubtful.But the bigger question is: What use is a 1-way communication device? Did the student have a second cheating instrument to photograph the test and send it to someone off-site? Or did they have someone with the test answers reading them off in real-time (&#34;Question 34 - Answer is C&#34;)? It seems this would only be useful in an extremely narrow set of circumstances, if it could be pulled off at all.Really though, why wouldn&#39;t someone just grow out their hair or wear a wig and put an earpiece under their hair? The idea of surgically implanting something that could be easily concealed seems like a modern urban legend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my undergrad days, my sibling&#39;s medical college (KMC Mangalore) had an interesting case where the student had hired the service of a rice-engraving artist to etch complete medical manuals onto the sides of metallic ballpoint pens. He was wearing a high powered lens as bifocals.He was caught because he was noticed shuffling a wad of pens too often &amp; then the bifocal glasses were peculiar, prompting some investigation.He had paid the grain-engraving artist to the tune of $30,000-35,000 for the whole set (2006). It is a lot of money!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people are missing the bigger point here.This person was just one who got caught. The likelihood that they’re the first one to think or do this is very low.There are probably more sophisticated ways of using tech to cheat and I would be very surprised if they haven’t been employed in high stakes exams like this before."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at Microsoft around the time of the Windows Vista disaster, and one of the big lessons that came out of that era was solve distractions, not discoverability. Windows and other Microsoft products tried to make features (and products) &#34;discoverable&#34; by pushing them on you with alerts and banners, but the result, when multiplied by dozens of product teams and PMs, was an overall user experience that was noisy and unpleasant.Looks like a new generation of engineers and designers is ready to learn this lesson the hard way again!"</p>

  - ads on the lockscreen
  - ads as notifications
  - ads in the start menu
  - ads in the &#34;change file association&#34; dialog
  - ads in the apps (e.g. solitaire)
  - mandatory updates that cannot be disabled and reboot your machine without asking
  - pc turning itself on in the middle of the night OR when in my backpack to install updates

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone make a serious OS for people who need to get real work done on their computer anymore?Some recent frustrations with the big 3 OSs:1. MacOS: The File&gt;Save dialog has a unchangeable 35 character limit for what can be viewed in the file name field. WTF?! It&#39;s like these jokers have never worked in a real office where people create documents with dictated naming conventions like [Customer Name]_[Project Name]_[Project subtask]-[Date]. Maybe they think it is a way to force businesses to use Tags? Dear Apple, your OS seems toy like.2. Linux: There is an age old Ubuntu bug (which bleeds into many Ubuntu based Distributions) where the installer wipes out the bootloader of a drive that you aren&#39;t even installing the OS on. Dear open source community: your desktop OSs are still hobbyist tweaker mode. I3. Windows: First data mining telemetry and now you are going to show me ads? Dear MS, you keep trying to be Google or Facebook and all it has done is undermine a once serious OS.(note that this is just a &#34;what pissed me off this week list&#34; and not intended to be a comprehensive criticism)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I could be wrong here, but, I think the lawsuit is totally misdirected. Restaurants should be upset with the ordering platforms (e.g., DoorDash) instead.The problem is the ordering platforms enabling this integration without restaurant consent. (Or, perhaps worse, offering orders without restaurant consent?)Google just provides an API that allows restaurant ordering from Maps, Search etc.  It connects to the ordering platforms (e.g., DoorDash) [1].  The ordering platforms integrate with this API by uploading data feeds and implementing a server with specific interface. [2]I don&#39;t think Google even takes a cut!I worked on an integration to a similar API, &#34;Reserve with Google&#34; [3]. With that one, at least, it can be enabled/disabled at the restaurant level.  I assume that &#34;Order with Google&#34; is similar.[1] https://developers.google.com/actions/food-ordering[2] https://developers.google.com/actions/food-ordering/guides/b...[3] https://www.google.com/maps/reserve/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen this when searching for restaurants, and I spotted it right away. It&#39;s a classic dark pattern and I&#39;m surprised that more restaurants aren&#39;t suing them over this.Google search results have become dangerous (for lack of a better word) and really hard to use when searching for some things lately. I shouldn&#39;t have to carefully scrutinize every link ON Google and then double check I&#39;m actually ending up where Google said it was sending me. I understand they want to squeeze every possible dollar out of every search, but I no longer trust them for certain searches.I&#39;m not even talking about the results, this is just what&#39;s on the actual Google search results page. There&#39;s just way too many ads and other tricks like this happening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had this happen to me. Went to order something for pickup from maps. I thought it was the restaurant&#39;s page but the order went through postmates. When I arrived to pick up my order, the staff seemed to think I was an employee of postmates.Anyway, when I got home I did some searching and found out the restaurant had a different webpage from what I ordered from. The prices I paid were a little higher than the actual business websites. It seems postmates charged me more, taking a cut while doing nothing to make the food or deliver it. What a parasitic business to inject yourself as a third party like that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unless you work at a company that “gets” it (as listed below): instead of hoping or arguing for a raise that puts you and your colleagues in tech in-line with the market, just go out and interview for offers that should increase your total compensation 30-50%.I’ve been writing about this topic for months, including publishing how much companies in 2021 did one-off adjustments as discussed on HN [1] (a list of about 50 companies, between 5-30% as one-off increases outside annual raises) and suggesting to those in charge of budgets to do one-off adjustments ASAP to retain their engineers.Although many CTOs and VPEs read and understood the rationale, the majority could not get meaningful budget increases. The reason? Their non-technical CEO and CFO.This very hot market is only the case for tech and the rest of the business struggles to understand why tech should be any exception at annual budgeting.I see it as the typical story of execs assuming tech leaders are crying wolf when there is no wolf. By the time the wolf takes away most the sheep, it’s too late.The only exceptions I’ve seen are:1. Companies seeing attrition impossible to ignore. In May 2021 a company in the UK announced no pay raises till Apr 2022 answering an all-hands question. 25% of senior engineers left the next 3 months, and the company did an emergency 15% raise across engineering in November.2. Companies that collect, and act on market data. This is mostly Big Tech. It’s why Amazon has been decisive in increasing base salaries, and why Meta increased RSU refreshers by ~20-25% this year. They know the market better than any salary benchmarking company does (which companies’ data is outdated).I still get messages of engineering managers asking how they can make their leadership understand their dire situation. I tell them that unless their company is in the #2 category, the only way is to put them in #1, and suggest these engineering managers lead by example in securing much higher offers, leaving, and after enough people leave, non-technical leadership might eventually act.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29320889"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is just my anecdotal view but it’s based on a few decades in non-tech organisations, from startup to emerging-into-enterprise to enterprise (my path was enterprise -&gt; startup -&gt; e2e) and I think we’re a while out from non-tech organisations understanding the value of their own development resources.Its everything from how IT is still often viewed as a “them-and-us” resource drain similar to HR but less understood (and this less valued by the organisation) even though 95% of the people in every organisation now works with IT devices that wouldn’t operate without IT. To how development continues to live in the weird spectrum of the business that actually needs something more than excel, being under digitalisation (efficiency) and IT (operations and development are natural frenemies).It’s having to live in a 2022 where the “standard” solutions, the “document libraries” the “data-warehousing”, the “data-management-systems”, the “enterprise-architecture”, the “data/ml/bi-architecture “ is still just a bunch of really shitty systems and drawings that can’t connect together and quickly become a nightmare for anyone trying to do any real work leading back to massive excel usage and a constant need for “connection-inhouse-solutions” to make things actually work.Leading to developers still being one of the best paid resources inside organisations with almost limitless tolerance for their non-conformity and rolling eyes in management meetings because most of us simply don’t understand the organisation lingo or the internal political power plays (yes, the bullshit).Anyway, I’ve seen no change in change management to suggest that developers are going to be more valued going forward. If anything I think the want and belief in “standard” solutions might just birth the opposite in the coming decade, until the money managers once again realise that developers are simply necessary in a world where every “standard” solution is just as shitty as it was 20 years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HR isn&#39;t getting any memo, they are threatening me with disciplinary measures because I refuse to follow their return to the office location policy.
They even proposed to cut my salary in half if I persist in preferring to stay remote to save on expenses.I think some fast growing tech companies are causing many developers to leave their jobs for better pastures, and that&#39;s mostly because some tech companies are performing poorly hence not keeping up with decent salary increases.Easy to get a job with a salary bump ? My recent attempts took well over 6 weeks each, with 3 to 5 interview rounds, mostly being screened by developers and managers having significant tech skills gaps, making the questioning a painful dissonance exercise.But sure. The market is hot for developers and compensation are on the rise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m currently reading through Johanna Rothman&#39;s &#34;Manage Your Project Portfolio&#34; and related literature and a bunch of this resonates:* Finishing work is more important than starting it* Teams working together on a single priority (&#34;swarming&#34;) seem to be more successful than teams where each person is doing 1-2 things on their ownA few subtle points in this article that made me think:* Keeping existing features working as well as customers expect is a great zeroth priority but it can be hard to know what customers actually expect. Absolutely the worst is when you carefully maintain a very reliable, feature-rich thing that no one particularly wants or uses. In an org without a dedicated PM, I&#39;m never quite sure how to account for time spent on the product-management work of &#34;listen to my customers about what they want from my service&#34;.* The article talks about engineers and stakeholders caring about &#34;project X&#34; and &#34;feature Y&#34;. A bunch of literature suggests that anyone who is thinking this way is probably a bit lost -- they have lost sight of the business outcome that the team&#39;s work is supposed to be getting (more sales, quantifiably happier customers, fewer pager alerts interrupting engineers, whatever). If you can tie particular features/projects to outcomes maybe you can make it easier to explain why you&#39;ve prioritized other work first (it makes bigger outcomes sooner)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience/opinion (disclaimer: small teams only) this single-item paradigm misses a lot of opportunities. I prefer the 60-30-10 approach (see https://minimal.app/603010) as it is more experimental/open while still capturing great focus.To back that up, I’d like to acknowledge that almost all significant contributions I’ve witnessed weren’t the top priority item (instead, they’re some weird experiment). I am generally suspicious of the human ability to form a hierarchy of needs/opportunities, so I try to favor qualities like experimentalism, curiosity.Of course, this is all circumstantial. I’m sure some teams have hard deliverables where there is little value in exploring or doing things with no known measurable impact."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a self-employed person, this is essential. I&#39;m constantly using Things3 to take down notes on ideas for things I want to do, or could do. But there&#39;s only so much I can do in my waking hours. So when it comes time to &#34;prioritize&#34; and make my plan for the week, I throw everything that&#39;s not on fire in a secondary list called &#34;brain vomit&#34; that I simply never look at, while filtering out the important and urgent stuff to the main actual list of things I&#39;m actually going to do.This probably sounds insane but it&#39;s working for me. I think part of the reason is that I often don&#39;t have the mental bandwidth (or discipline) to recognize at the moment of task creation whether something is a good idea or not. I&#39;m simply moving too fast, multitasking too much, to make those calls. So I batch every new idea into the inbox and review it later. And even if I discover good ideas in there later, if they aren&#39;t essential to my work or life they go in the brain vomit folder. So I get all the satisfaction of stream of consciousness &#34;ubiquitous capture&#34; (a la GTD) without the emotional burden of having to actually do all that non-critical stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel a bit contrarian about design pattern lists.  These always seem to contain a list of solutions and after some fancy gymnastics, a list of potential problems they might solve. I feel it might be more useful to create a list of common software problems and follow them with a pattern that helps solve the problem.  I think this would help address the issue of these pattern guides being applied overzealously."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re interested in Python anti-patterns instead, we wrote an open-source book on them a while ago: https://docs.quantifiedcode.com/python-anti-patterns/Hasn&#39;t received any updates in the last years but it still holds up quite well, disregarding the Python 2 specific anti-patterns of course which become less and less relevant, as well as the Django-specific ones, which probably are hopelessly outdated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not idiomatic Python. Don&#39;t model your best practices in Python based on what makes sense in e.g. C++ and Java."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s pretty depressing how many of the comments are purely answering the title and not discussing the content of the article. In particular, the comments seem mostly focused on consumer product build quality whereas the article is more focused on e.g. businesses trying to outsource something (like same day delivery) and getting a worse result even when they pay more than doing it internally. And the cultural obstacles that make these problems difficult to fix or even sometimes perceive.I will note that I often wish Dan Luu was a bit less apparently-uniformly-confident in some of the statements he writes. He does back up what he says, but he&#39;ll use the same tone for something he&#39;s seen anecdotally and something he&#39;s spent a month personally investigating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s that you don&#39;t notice things that work well. House foundations, light switches, filesystems, silicon manufacturing, water delivery, grocery store logistics, etc etc etc.These are all things that most people never notice because they just work. It doesn&#39;t even occur to people day-to-day that these things can fail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looking through old Sears catalogs and seeing the prizes on older game shows, I think some of our memory is selective. Even in photos and SD video you can see the terrible build quality on many consumer products from those earlier times. This seems to be especially true for furniture and exercise equipment. When you convert into current dollars, this low quality junk often is more expensive than what is available today. There&#39;s plenty of junk being sold today too and paying more doesn&#39;t guarantee quality but the notion that it&#39;s more difficult to find quality today than in the past doesn&#39;t seem universal. We have plenty of items that survived earlier eras and are examples of durability but the landfills are full of junk that we don&#39;t see."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Couple things:- C4 fixation is a characteristic of smaller, monocot plants.  Trees are slower-growing dicots.  There are more pathways to these organisms than just increasing energy production efficiency.  For example, have you proven that trees actually reinvest the excess glucose into growth, rather than trigger negative feedback pathways to slow glucose production?- Also, you claim that the plant is faster growing with harder wood.  Typically with trees, the speed of growth is inversely proportionate to the strength of the wood - i.e. cottonwoods and box elders grow fast but are terrible woods, while oak and maple are the inverse.  Given the long lifespan of these organisms, have you any preliminary data to back up these claims that these trees are growing faster and stronger?I used to do plant transgenics in a past life, and while skeptical, I do see projects like this as a solution for the future - though more along the lines of faster growing algae because ultimately the bottom line is the variable cost of converting sq meters of sunlight into carbon energy.  It&#39;s just super easy to fall for hype and go straight to science fiction rather than focus on the science."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow - this post is getting a lot of great discussion. We are working on responding to the comments directly. A few key points to add that help frame how we think about the role biotechnology plays in carbon capture and removal.Similar to how advanced biotechnology was able to help develop covid vaccines in record time, biotechnology can and should be used a tool in our fight against climate change. Living Carbon works on a broad array of biotech projects to help improve the carbon capture and sequestration of carbon underground.We chose to share our work on photosynthesis-enhancement as an example of one of the biotechnology tools that can be utilized because 1) there is precedent in literature for similar pathways working in other crops and RuBisCO engineering has been worked on for decades 2) many of the solutions to storing carbon underground for longer are metabolically taxing to plants and can benefit from biotechnology.In response to vague fears around genetic engineering, if Living Carbon’s work resulted in ecosystem destruction we would not have achieved any of the goals we set out to achieve as a company. We have warmed the world so quickly plants do not have the time to evolve to survive in the harsher world we have created.It would be silly to think that our trees alone could or should stop climate change. We view each pilot project as an opportunity to study trees in different ecosystem and understand any impacts they have on underlying ecosystems.We’re intentionally planting trees on land that human previously degraded - such as abandoned mine lands. We’re working to restore ecosystems that have already faced the consequences of human intervention, rather than integrating our trees into already-thriving wild forests.Many of our test pilot projects include the testing of different microbial treatments to help quantify the impact on photosynthesis and the growth rate of trees.75% of the earth’s land has already been degraded by humans. 60% of plants are struggling to survive because there are fewer animals and arable land to spread their seeds and maintain a meaningful population. Whether it’s through paving over our rivers or our urban sprawl, we’ve been modifying our world for centuries. Evolution, which is essentially sums of averages over, cannot move at the speed that humans have moved to degrade our plant and warm it.There is not silver bullet to climate change. Many solutions like mineralization, biochar, and DAC can increase their rate of carbon removal using biotechnology and more efficiently remove carbon from the atmosphere. We need to use human technology to help reintegrate ourselves into our ecosystem and understand how carbon farming using many different carbon removal technologies can help remove carbon from our ecosystem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;ve got excellent mechanisms for improving the efficiency of plants through engineering and breeding that doesn&#39;t involve a for-profit company controlling IP and maximizing short term returns (the way that YC works). There is an academic community supported by governments and NGOs that works, even if agribusiness siphons off some of the expertise. I am happy that software companies can be created and destroyed quickly if venture companies want to support them. A 5-7 year return on capital doesn&#39;t really work for the carbon budget or agricultural heritage of the planet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Holy crap! They&#39;re actually doubling the pricing (for some important products)!I actually followed the links and found this:    &gt; Coldline Storage Class B operations pricing will increase from $0.05 per 10,000 operations to $0.10 per 10,000 operations.

    &gt; Coldline Storage Class A operations pricing in regions will increase from $0.10 per 10,000 operations to $0.20 per 10,000 operations.

    &gt; Coldline Storage Class A operations pricing in multi-regions and dual-regions will increase from $0.10 per 10,000 operations to $0.40 per 10,000 operations.

    &gt; For all other storage classes, Class A operations pricing in multi-regions and dual-regions will increase to be double the Class A operations pricing in regions. For example, Standard Storage Class A operations in multi-regions and dual-regions will increase from $0.05 per 10,000 operations to $0.10 per 10,000 operations.

This announcement is just an eye wash to hide the fact that they&#39;re doubling their pricing structure for some products. And they claim most customers will see a cost decrease.Sigh, I was just thinking of moving all my stuff, projects and even websites from cloud hosted solutions to my own home server and slapping a cache like CloudFlare on top of it and calling it a day. This is only pushing me in that direction, haha.Reference: https://cloud.google.com/storage/pricing-announce"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google cloud has to be the most confusing product suite known to mankind. What an unbelievable mess.After merging two companies I had to move a bunch of stuff over to a new bankaccount. three weeks later and I&#39;m still not 100% sure that I got it all, the interfaces are so opaque and the different ways in which you can get billed so confusing (never mind the bills themselves) that it is nearly impossible to get a clear picture.This does not feel like it is an accident, and this message is very much in line with that.I always wonder how such systems come about. The number of confusing error messages you have to deal with for pretty basic stuff is off the scale. You can name anything, except of course when it actually matters and then only some cryptic UID is shown. Don&#39;t get me started on users and permission management, or how it is perfectly possible to orphan an entire project[1] if a person leaves your org. (Gsuite and GCP may superficially appear to share a bunch of stuff but that just sets you up for some very cute surprises, from which it can be extremely difficult to recover.)[1] https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/project-suspe..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Will customers’ bills increase? Decrease? The impact of the pricing changes depends on customers’ use cases and usage. While some customers may see an increase in their bills, we’re also introducing new options for some services to better align with usage, which could lower some customers’ bills. In fact, many customers will be able to adapt their portfolios and usage to decrease costs. We’re working directly with customers to help them understand which changes may impact them.There is a zero percent chance they haven&#39;t ran the analysis and concluded what % of customers would see a bill increase. It&#39;s high. If its low-to-zero, cloud companies are clear about how the prices are changing, and usually outline how many customers are would be negatively impacted. If it&#39;s high, they&#39;re ambiguous about what is changing, and shift the blame onto customers; if its still expensive for you, you&#39;re just not using it right."</p>
