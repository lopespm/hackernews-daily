								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why is self hosting exactly? §
Self hosting is about freedom, you can choose what server you want to run, which version, which features and which configuration you want. If you self host at home, You can also pick the hardware to match your needs (more Ram ? More Disk? RAID?).Self hosting is not a perfect solution, you have to buy the hardware, replace faulty components, do the system maintenance to keep the software part alive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who self-hosts a lot of different apps, self-hosting is really a slippery slope. Once you start enjoying the control over the system and data, you want to self host everything.The most important aspect is the security and you learn this by doing it.My entire self-host apps are hosted behind a private VPN called Pritunl, it provides self-hosted corporate VPN like setup where you can manage users and access to servers.I host these following apps/products right now:- Pritunl (corporate like VPN)- Superset (Analytics)- Bitwarden (Password Manager)- OpenVPN with Pihole (Personal VPN with Adblock)- Wireguard with Pihole (Personal VPN with Adblock)- Drone.io (CI/CD)- Posthog (Web Traffic Analytics)- Papercups (Web chat support)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest most successful and best run organizations I&#39;ve worked for have not worried about hosting their software. They&#39;re concerned with delivering value to customers and doing it quickly.The most fractured and worst run companies have been concerned with self-hosting and frankly they sympathized with a lot of the stuff I&#39;m seeing on here.But I recognize we still need people self-hosting because it drives innovation and competition. I believe there are ways of doing things well while self-hosting, but I&#39;m not sure what those ways are."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fun fact: you can overload the Python import system to work with other languages that you create.I use this for my Python-based Lisp: https://github.com/shawwn/pymen/blob/ml/importer.py  import foo

checks for &#34;foo.l&#34;, and if found, compiles it to foo.py on the fly and imports that instead.It&#39;s so cursed. I love it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two things that are annoying about Python&#39;s import system.Number one is that relative imports are weird. My intuition about imports is good enough that I never bothered to learn all the rules explicitly, but sometimes something simple is just not possible and it bites me. I think the case is importing files relative to a script (and not running with python -m ...).Number two is, in order to do package management, you have to create a fake python installation and bend PYTHONPATH. Virtualenvs are the canonical way to do it, but to me it feels like a hack - the core language seems to wants all packages installed in /usr. So now I have all these virtualenvs lying around and they are detached from the scripts.Why couldn&#39;t the import system resolve versions, too? You could say `import foo &gt;= 1.0` and it would download it to some global cache, and the import the correct versions from the cache."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Python import system is by far the worst one I dealt with. Using Setup.py and regular or namespace packages, relative import, having complex sub packages and cross importing, running a script from somewhere inside one of your sub packages, and many more craps like these. Import system must be intuitive and easy to use!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In particles physics, they have a different explanation of electromagnetism that is also very natural, almost inevitable. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics#Mathem... The explanation in particle physics is compatible with Quantum Mechanics and Special Relativity, but no one is sure about how to extend it to General Relativity. I&#39;m not sure how compatible is it with the proposal in the article discussed here.Non technical version (ELI25):In quantum mechanics the wavefunction Ψ is has complex values. If you multiply everything in the universe by -1, nothing changes because all the physical results use ΨΨ* (where * is the complex conjugation). You can also multiply everything by i or -i. Moreover by any other complex number of modulo 1 because ΨΨ* does not change. (The technical term for this is U(1) global gauge symmetry.)But you can be more ambitious and want to multiply each point of the universe by a different complex number of modulo 1. ΨΨ* does not change but the derivatives of Ψ change and they are also important. (When you use the same complex number everywhere, the derivatives is just a multiple of the original derivative. When you use a different number in each point, it changes.)The only way to fix the problem with the derivative is to add a new field A. When you and multiply each point of the universe by a different complex number of modulo 1, then A changes in a simple to calculate but not obvious way. The change in A fix the problem with the derivatives of Ψ.So now the equations of the universe with Ψ and A don&#39;t change when you make this change. (The technical term for this is U(1) local gauge symmetry.) When you write carefully how a universe like this look like, the new field A is electromagnetism. (Actually, you can get the electric field and magnetic field using the derivatives of A.)This explanation looks more complicated than the explanation of the article, but the article is full of technical terms that you really don&#39;t want to know, like:&gt; Riemann curvature tensor is more than just Ricci curvature—electromagnetic fields stretch and bend the spacetime"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maxwell&#39;s equations and general relativity—what are these all about?Maxwell&#39;s equations are the key linear partial differential equations that describe classical electromagnetism. The equations relate the electromagnetic field to currents and charges. On the other hand, in general relativity, the Einstein field equation is a set of nonlinear partial differential equations describing how the metric of spacetime evolves, given some conditions, such as mass density in the spacetime. Both equations are ultimately of second order, if seen properly.Therefore, we thought that perhaps we are talking about the same governing equation, which could describe both electromagnetism and gravitation. Indeed, it becomes clear that Maxwell&#39;s equations hide inside the Einstein field equations of general relativity. The metric tensor of spacetime tells us how lengths determine in spacetime. The metric tensor also thus determines the curvature properties of spacetime. Curvature is what we feel as &#34;force.&#34; In addition, energy and curvature relate to each other through the Einstein field equations. Test particles follow what are called geodesics—the shortest paths in the spacetime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are some great comments here, incredibly enlightening.Yet somehow, I still find myself on Wolfram&#39;s side, suspecting that the entire QM/GR formulation is going to turn out to be the wrong way to understand the universe and that something quite different (e.g. cellular automata) will eventually be seen as much better.The situation seems quite analogous to the one with fluid mechanics: we can use the continuously valued models that involve concepts like rate, turbulence, friction, etc. and be happy that we can reason about the system even though we fundamentally do not know what these properties are and can reasonably doubt that they are real. Or we can use cellular automata models, which use discrete math and have no &#34;properties&#34; that we can reason about. The outcomes are broadly similar in terms of prediction, but the approaches are totally different.I will not be alive in 300 years, but if I were to be, I&#39;d be willing to wager right now that most of the QM/GR formalisms will have been replaced by something entirely different."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When they say 10k miles, do they mean 10k miles of land or of cable?  Asking because my military unit used individual cables to exaggerate numbers.  i.e. 6 strands at 1 mile would become &#34;6 miles of cable run&#34;.  Either way, great they are doing this.  I hope they prevent some fires and save some lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re taking a different approach in Australia (the state of Victoria specifically), and not only are we replacing bare wire overheads with buried cables [0], we are also implementing Rapid Earth Fault Current Limiter (REFCL) technology to lower the risk of bushfires due to downed wires. [1]When powerlines come into contact with the ground or a tree, arcing can occur. If the line remains live and continues arcing, the risk of fire is quite high.REFCL tech works by detecting the phase-to-earth faults that occur when a one of the three-phase powerlines breaks and falls to the ground. REFL instantly reduces the voltage on the fallen line, and boosts the voltage on the other two phases. REFCL will then test the faulted line after a few seconds, and if the fault was intermittent full service is restored. If not, the whole line is removed from service to prevent fires and make the line safe to work on.On Total Fire Ban days (very high risk of fire due to weather conditions), the REFCL settings operate at increased sensitivity.There&#39;s a requirement in Victoria that by 2023 all high risk zone substations have to install REFCL technology, and all HV customers connected to those zone subs have to be REFCL compliant (their equipment must be able to handle the over-voltages that occur during REFCL operation).[0] https://www.energy.vic.gov.au/electricity/powerline-replacem...[1] https://www.energy.vic.gov.au/safety-and-emergencies/powerli..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a question I haven’t seen anyone address so far: how much can we expect this to reduce the frequency of wildfires? Intuitively, to me, the effect would seem to be negligible. All of the conditions for wildfires will remain in place. It’ll simply be something else that lights the spark. If it’s not power lines it’ll be lightning.So then to follow up: what is the point? To deflect blame from PGE? And who pays for it?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with the author that the real estate agent described something most people want, and not necessarily what the author himself wanted. I think it&#39;s unfortunate that the agent didn&#39;t hear what the author wanted and just pointed him to the general public&#39;s preference anyway.However, I disagree with his take that America&#39;s housing development model is to develop into outskirt suburbs, let middle class move in, let it deteriorate in 30 years, and build more outskirts.Now, maybe I live in California and things are different. In the bay area even old areas with very old houses rise in values, and in fact, they rise more than newer developments. Demand for housing everywhere in the bay area + surrounding areas are high regardless of how new they are and how deep in town or out in the outskirts they are. Areas developed 30+ years ago continue to have high demand from middle to wealthy families. These areas didn&#39;t just not deteriorate but have grown into larger and more modern areas and in some cases developed their own downtown.Admittedly California and bay area specifically is probably a bubble and behaves differently than much of America. But I have a feeling more than a few popular cities are going through something similar. Appleton might not be, and maybe he&#39;s right that the new development outskirts will deteriorate in 30 years, but I doubt that&#39;ll be the case in new developments around Phoenix or Denver."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"| All of America’s institutions are focused exclusively on churn.Planning prior to 1990s was predicated on the assumption of continued  upward mobility, middle class persistence and strength of US production of goods and services (a/k/a wealth).Instead, the US exported all of that to China, and praised its new service-led, consumer-based, greener economy. Of all the self-inflicted (likely fatal) wounds inflicted upon great societies throughout history, the civic ignorance (and arrogance) of our body politic is the greatest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can anyone explain the &#34;We’d rather have the iceberg than the ship&#34; expression? I understand the overall point of the article, but I&#39;m having trouble parsing the last paragraph, where he seems to assume that one reading of that expression is somehow obvious. Is it the ship that&#39;s ephemeral, or the iceberg? (It seems like a reference to the Titanic, and at least in my mind, both the Titanic and the iceberg were ephemeral.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;&gt; In 1995, 2% of schizophrenia diagnoses in the country were associated with cannabis use disorder. In 2000, it increased to around 4%. Since 2010, that figure increased to 8%, the study found.Worded that way, causation isn&#39;t the first thing this suggests to me. If percentage of cases associated with marijuana rise, it could also be that a larger percentage of the population is smoking and admitting to smoking marijuana regularly. If cases themselves rise, it could also be increases in the percentage of cases that actually get diagnosed, etc.It could very well be that marijuana puts you at higher risk of schizophrenia - I certainly have an acquaintance in mind for whom recreational drug usage seems to have led them to a paranoid and narcissistic personality described here in other comments - but the connection in this article feels weak. Certainly weaker than the connection we see between marijuana law enforcement and the negative fallout of that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can only speak from personal experience, which is of course limited.  I smoked occasionally in my 20s, but not since (I&#39;m middle-aged now).  I&#39;ve been friends and acquaintances with many people that smoke a lot.  I see a trend among these people - not necessarily schizophrenia (I&#39;m not a psychologist and probably wouldn&#39;t even notice a mild case) - but instead a consistent arrogance and self-importance.  It&#39;s peculiar - they may be contributing very little to society (or maybe a lot), but regardless there&#39;s a sense of superiority that seems to crop up among them all.  Maybe even narcissism?I could be completely wrong.  I don&#39;t express this to assert it, but rather to ask if anyone else has noticed anything similar."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As usual, a sensational headline averring a research article&#39;s causal hypothesis, of which the PI even calls for reproducibility. Reading such paltry science articles makes me really appreciate papers like Quanta, whose reporters seem to actually have a semblance of domain knowledge.Indeed, no discussion of the existing link between schizophrenia and tobacco smoking, in conjunction with the increased availability of marijuana?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just reading the title it sounded very much like &#34;Single Point of Failure: The (Fictional) Day Google Forgot To Check Passwords&#34;: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4GB_NDU43Q"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article:&gt; The line should read &#34;if (key_data_.has_value() &amp;&amp; !key_data_-&gt;label().empty()) {&#34; but instead of &#34;&amp;&amp;&#34;—the C++ version of the &#34;AND&#34; operator—the bad update used a single ampersand, breaking the second half of the conditional statement.Someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but this seems like it wouldn&#39;t be possible in a language that didn&#39;t conflate boolean values with bitvectors.Edit: I was wrong[1].[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27923785"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bet the post-mortem for this is going to be fun. How this wasn&#39;t covered by multiple unit tests, a code review and a roll out strategy is.... impressive."</p>
