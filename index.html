								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;But the biggest potential is in ability to fearlessly parallelize majority of Rust code, even when the equivalent C code would be too risky to parallelize. In this aspect Rust is a much more mature language than C.&#34;Yes. Today, I integrated two parts of a 3D graphics program. One refreshes the screen and lets you move the viewpoint around. The other loads new objects into the scene. Until today, all the objects were loaded, then the graphics window went live. Today, I made those operations run in parallel, so the window comes up with just the sky and ground, and over the next few seconds, the scene loads, visibly, without reducing the frame rate.This took about 10 lines of code changes in Rust. It worked the first time it compiled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; C libraries typically return opaque pointers to their data structures, to hide implementation details and ensure there&#39;s only one copy of each instance of the struct. This costs heap allocations and pointer indirections. Rust&#39;s built-in privacy, unique ownership rules, and coding conventions let libraries expose their objects by valueThe primary reason c libraries do this is not for safety, but to maintain ABI compatibility.  Rust eschews dynamic linking, which is why it doesn&#39;t bother.  Common lisp, for instance, does the same thing as c, for similar reasons: the layout of structures may change, and existing code in the image has to be able to deal with it.&gt; Rust by default can inline functions from the standard library, dependencies, and other compilation units. In C I&#39;m sometimes reluctant to split files or use libraries, because it affects inliningThis is again because c is conventionally dynamically linked, and rust statically linked.  If you use LTO, cross-module inlining will happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;Clever&#34; memory use is frowned upon in Rust. In C, anything goes. For example, in C I&#39;d be tempted to reuse a buffer allocated for one purpose for another purpose later (a technique known as HEARTBLEED).This made me laugh"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am so excited for this software. I have used Airtable extensively, and it&#39;s a pile of garbage. Here are just a FEW of the &#34;features&#34; Airtable charges $24/user/mo for:- Reliable 1-5 hours a month of downtime. There are months where it&#39;s literally 1 nine of uptime. Their status page was actually down for a while (I think they forgot to renew it?)- Simple and obvious bugs in the official API clients have not been fixed for years (for example, Promises in the official JS library throw the string `[object Object]` for all exceptions.)- The API has no way to query the structure of a table, you have to infer it from the first few records. (The auto-generated API documentation is actually wrong if you don&#39;t have a fully-filled-in row somewhere in the first few rows.)- You can&#39;t modify a table configuration by API... except you can _sometimes_ by adding a parameter which is documented to try to convert dates, but actually modifies field definitions for a number of fields. Documentation for which fields is entirely in scattered forum posts from users.- Booleans in the API are `true` or `undefined`. Seriously.This is all /barely/ worth it because Google Docs doesn&#39;t work when you need a large structured database with many collaborators. But man is it bad software."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will be using this, and dropping a lot of my paid AirTable bases...and let me please explain why.Airtable makes it VERY hard to collaborate with people outside my organization. We are a team of 7 people. No longer a scrappy 1-person startup, but not an enterprise client by any-means.If I want to add a single person to an Airtable base, that&#39;s $24 a month please. I have one client with 12 people that want to collaborate on the base by posting comments. I can&#39;t justify $288 a month just to keep the comments for all time.I contacted Airtable about this and was told the &#34;Enterprise Plan&#34; would be a perfect fit. Minimum $15k a year commitment.Why is this happening in the SasS world??? Everyone seems to be either single Pro user, or Enterprise. Do they really think there is nothing in-between?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m one of the maintainers of one of the implementations of eth2 live today (https://github.com/prysmaticlabs/prysm) and can help offer more context on this. Ethereum proof of stake has been live since December 1st and it currently secures over 6 billion USD worth of value https://beaconcha.in/. Currently, this is a chain that lives in parallel to the proof of work chain we know as Ethereum today. The idea is that over this coming year, the entire state of Ethereum will be &#34;merged&#34; into this new chain that uses proof of stake consensus via a docking process. &#34;Escalating the eth2 merge&#34; means there is more expedited work from researchers and developers when it comes to performing this critical decision. Since eth2 consensus is already live and running correctly with a large set of validators, miners cannot censor this new chain and therefore cannot really stop the merge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regardless of the current issues with the updates, gas prices, different opinions on the community, devs vs miners vs users...Am I the only one who thinks people underestimate Ethereum and its EVM invention? In 2013 this guy (who I think is a visionary) wrote a document with a proposal that led to the creation of a world-wide turing-complete distributed computer. And still, people are just starting to realize its potential. This month a layer-2 solution called optimism will launch a virtual machine called OVM (optimism vm) on top of ethereum smart contracts that can solve most of the current scalability issues (and there are other solutions being tested in parallel: zkrollups...). We are also starting to realize the potential of Dex and Defi (distributed exchanges and finance), DAOs (distributed organizations), NFT (non-fungible tokens) and a bunch of things more that 7 years after are appearing out of thin air. So even if Ethereum wasn&#39;t updated at all (although, we probably all agree that PoW is not environmental friendly and should be replaced with a better alternative: PoS) it could still thrive in the long term thanks to its most fundamental design choices (turing-complete...). I am truly amazed by this technology and Vitalik. I wish I knew a little bit more of the underlying fundamentals. What do you think?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not an expert, but if 51% of the existing hashpower doesn&#39;t want a change, it sounds less a 51% attack and more like miners voting against something that isn&#39;t in their interest. The whole point of blockchains is that the incentives are supposed to be aligned between miners and users. If that isn&#39;t the case here, it sounds like a problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So many of these start or end with an `x*`, `(x|y)`, `[xy]` or `[^xy]` that I only see two characters I can fill in before I need to start looking at multiple constraints for the same cell and either doing combinatorics or guess-and-check.This might be fine for hard mode, but as someone who considers themselves a regexpert it&#39;s not very approachable as a first puzzle IMO.A more gradual introduction to the format would be to give a few clues that give you confidence on specific characters, that then let you lock in some other characters in other hints, and so on.For instance, replacing `.*H.*V.*G.*` with `.{3}H.*V.*G.*` would go a long way because you could confidently place an `H`.  And say that intersected with `(DI|NS|TH|OM)*` on the `H`, you could then place a `T` from the second clue because of what you learned from the first clue.It could just be that I&#39;m missing something or not as good at regex as I thought, and please let me know if that&#39;s the case.   Either way though, when I&#39;m trying a new kind of puzzle I&#39;d like to feel like I made some sort of progress after trying for 5-10 minutes, and here 2 chars does not feel like progress."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Database startups suffer from an extreme case of an important truism in startups generally: the product you think you are selling is not the product the customer thinks they are buying. No one buys a database per se, they are just a means to some other end.People that love database technology — that would be me — tend to start database companies. It is very difficult to sell a database. It is much, much easier to sell a compelling solution to a somewhat boring but very valuable business problem that just happens to require an amazing database capability behind it. That’s your moat, the customer doesn’t actually care that there is an amazing database engine behind it but it makes it difficult for competitors to replicate.Filed under “lessons I learned the hard way”."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is akin to everyone’s dream to start a cozy, atmospheric coffee shop. These types of coffee bars fold very quickly or at best give founders years of servitude below minimum wage. The reason is that the type of behaviour this kind of establishment encourages - lounging, book reading, laptop work is exactly the opposite of the quick serve model that is  conducive to high revenue. The customer loves this model, the owner hates it.Analogous to it, the nosql DB market is the exact wrong market to enter. Large companies willing to pay big bucks for enterprise features will pay established vendors for the stodgy but battle tested stuff like Oracle or DB2. The hipster startup market pays nobody for anything as there is a myriad of free choices in every common flavour and the few that will pay will mostly do so to purchase managed hosting. And that’s only if their PoC built on your new and untrusted database ever makes it to production. And then it’s probably your cheapest tier. Don’t be selling to paupers!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Developers love building developer tools, often for free. So while there is massive demand, the supply vastly outstrips it.This is key, and plays out over and over again in different forms. There are no points for difficulty, only supply and demand. PG puts this well [1]:&gt; That&#39;s the essence of a startup: having brilliant people do work that&#39;s beneath them. Big companies try to hire the right person for the job. Startups win because they don&#39;t—because they take people so smart that they would in a big company be doing &#34;research,&#34; and set them to work instead on problems of the most immediate and mundane sort. Think Einstein designing refrigerators.[1] http://www.paulgraham.com/bronze.html"</p>

The major one for us has been their maintenance window every Thursday from 2:00-3:00pm Pacific Time. Usually there&#39;s no outage, but sometimes there is.

I&#39;m not too experienced with electronics to know if there&#39;s any issues I could run into, so I&#39;ve been holding off on it. I would love to see if anyone else has done something like that.* Unfortunately, it possible that my attempt to fix a dead fan is what busted the header. I&#39;m not sure because the previous fan was dead and the new fan I put in didn&#39;t spin, but that&#39;s part of why I don&#39;t feel comfortable just winging it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Don&#39;t get me wrong, Flameshot is a great tool, but this feels a bit like celebrating every turn after reinventing the wheel."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started using Wayland about a month ago on both my work computer and my laptop (On Pop_OS! 20.10). After seeing too much graphical glitches and weird behavior, specially because Alacritty (my favorite terminal) did not have any window decoration (I read through the whole issue on Gnome&#39;s issue tracker for server side decoration and got a little disappointed), I stopped using it on my work PC. But still I&#39;m using it on my laptop. I haven&#39;t had any issues there, but I just use my laptop for some web surfing and zoom. 
Screen capture is a hassle too. I was trying to capture only a part of my screen and had to do an hour worth of research to finally decide to just switch to X.org and get the job done. 
It&#39;s great that Flameshot is now supporting Wayland, and it&#39;s great that it is trying to support all the common protocols."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used Flameshot for a while and can say it is definitely the best of many tools I&#39;ve tried. The direct upload to imgur is particularly nice."</p>
