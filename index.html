Several models have mainline LineageOS support, I&#39;m running Lineage on my Mix 2S and hope to have years worth of updates going forward.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Furthermore, follow https://twitter.com/_brohrer_/status/1425770502321283073&#34;When you have a problem, build two solutions - a deep Bayesian transformer running on multicloud Kubernetes and a SQL query built on a stack of egregiously oversimplifying assumptions. Put one on your resume, the other in production. Everyone goes home happy.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was very keen on machine learning for some time- I started working with ML in the mid 90s.  The work I did definitely could have been replaced with a far less mathematically principled approach, but I wanted to learn ML because it was sexy and I assumed that at some point in the future we&#39;d have a technological singularity due to ML research.I didn&#39;t really understand the technology (gradient descent) underlying the training, so I went to grad school and spent 7 years learning gradient descent and other optimization techniques.  Didn&#39;t get any chances to work in ML after that because... well, ML had a terrible rep in all the structural biology fields and even the best models were at most 70% accurate.  Not enough data, not enough training methods, not enough CPU time.Eventually I landed at Google in Ads and learned about their ML system, Smartass.  I had to go back and learn a whole different approach to ML (Smartass is a weird system) and then wait years for Google to discover GPU-based machine learning (they have Vincent Vanhouke to thank- he sat near Jeff Dean and stuffed 8 GPUs into a workstation to prove that he could do training faster than thousands of CPUs in prod) and deep neural networks.Fast forward a few years, and I&#39;m an expert in ML, and the only suggestion I have is that everybody should read and internalize: https://research.google/pubs/pub43146/
So little of success in ML comes from the sexy algorithms and so much just comes from ensuring a bunch of boring details get properly saved in the right place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recall attending a technical talk given by a team of senior ML scientists from a prestigious SV firm (that I shall not name here).  The talk was given to an audience of scientists at a leading university.The problem was estimating an incoming train speed from an embedded microphone sensor near the train station.  The ML scientists used the latest techniques in deep learning to process the acoustic time series.  The talk session was two hours long.  This project was their showcase.I guess no one in the prestigious ML team knew about the Doppler shift and its closed form expression.  Typically taught in a highschool physics class.  A simple formula that you can calculate by hand: no need for a GPU cluster."</p>

I know some here have compute to spare, but it makes a big difference on my Pinephone :)It&#39;s still early days for Waydroid, but it&#39;s also decidedly a step forwards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Has anyone had success getting any of these containers to work with a camera?Recently, my bank discontinued their website based deposit system for checks in favor of their app.  I&#39;m reluctant to keep an app with full access to my account on my phone, so a container system like Waydroid or Anbox would be great if I could just emulate the app when I need it.  Has anyone else run into this issue and, if so, how have you dealt with it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just installed it. First impressions:* The good  - It is very responsive and smooth

  - Install just following instructions described

  - F-droid works

  - Apps installed from F-droid works

  - Full screen videos from Newpipe play smoothly

* The bad  - Had to enable &#34;invert colors&#34; to get correct colors

  - Mouse scroll is inverted

  - Can&#39;t choose correct layout of physical keyboard because android thinks there&#39;s no physical keyboard connected

  - Android gestures on the desktop are annoying

  - Can&#39;t access whole screen of vertical apps and they appear sideways on my screen

  - Multiwindow mode didn&#39;t work at first

* The ugly:  - Nothing is actually ugly. Everything mostly works as expected"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Only thing which prevented me going fully into Phoenix was that there was no good library for authentication and admin interface at that time.Are there any good libraries like devise and activeadmin now ?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We use Phoenix and LiveView to power all of our non-video interactions on Glimesh.tv[0] and the immediate out of the box features and performance are unmatched. LiveView allowed us to get a completely real time updating channel where streamers can edit their metadata (game, title, viewer count, etc) and all of the viewers can see it in real time. Not to mention we implemented a distributed chat system that sends message updates in real time to both browser clients and API clients. Both of these features combined amount to less than 1000 lines of code and &#34;just work&#34; across multiple web nodes.It can be daunting to jump into such a strange world as a LiveView environment may look (Elixir syntax, OTP terminology, etc) but honestly once you dig in deeper, everything just makes sense. LiveView (and HEEx) continue to be very simple to understand abstractions on top of the rock solid OTP platform. It&#39;s a joy to build real time applications using it, and I very much appreciate the &#34;developer experience&#34; focus both Chris &amp; Jose have for us Elixir devs!I&#39;m excited for the launch of Phoenix 1.6 and HEEx is shaping up to be a complete replacement for your traditional SPA + Backend API, and using one consistent language for your full stack really has very freeing &amp; powerful benefits, especially for small teams![0] https://github.com/Glimesh/glimesh.tv/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Creator of Phoenix here. I&#39;m happy to answer any questions folks have about LiveView, Phoenix, or Elixir in general. We&#39;ve had some big LiveView features land recently with uploads and HEEx so now&#39;s a great time to jump in!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If anyone is curious, the origami stellated [1] icosahedron in the second image is built from Sonobe modules [2][3], a kind of modular origami. Basic structures formed by Sonobe units have 3-sided 45-45-90 pyramids on top of an underlying polyhedra with triangular faces.Each Sonobe unit functions as an edge in the underlying structure, so building a structure around an icosahedron, which has 20 faces and 30 edges, requires 30 units, and yields a stellated icosahedron with 60 faces and 90 edges.You can also build a stellated octahedron from 12 pieces, and a stellated tetrahedron (which actually just appears as a cube) with 6 pieces, but that&#39;s just the beginning [4]![1]: Strictly speaking, it&#39;s not a true stellation, which is formed by extending the planes of faces until they intersect.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fred Rogers really appreciated the world from a child&#39;s perspective.  The idea that when you&#39;re doing everything for the first time it can be very exciting and also scary. He often talks about the &#34;drama&#34; of everyday life. Imagine going to get a haircut for the first time, sitting in a chair that moves up and down and tilts in a way that no other chair you know does, experiencing all the sounds and sensations of scissors and clippers around your head.I hope that we all can see the world from a young person&#39;s perspective sometimes and realise that we don&#39;t need to inject any additional &#34;drama&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The show’s final cuts reflected many similarly exacting interventions. Once, Rogers provided new lyrics for the “Tomorrow” song that ended each show, to ensure that children watching on Friday wouldn’t expect a show on Saturday, when the show didn’t air. And Rogers’s secretary, Elaine Lynch, remembered how, when one script referred to putting a pet “to sleep,” he excised it for fear that children would be worried about the idea of falling asleep themselves.Rogers was extraordinarily good at imagining where children’s minds might go.The more I learn about him, the more I feel he was underappreciated in his time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My mother took me to meet him at a book signing when I was very young. She was a kindergarten teacher who studied early childhood development. I got to speak to him briefly, and thought it was neat.Later in life I asked her about it, and she admitted that she only brought me because she knew how much I enjoyed the show, and that she personally found his manner of speaking (on the show) to be a bit grating. However, she said that upon meeting him in the flesh, all her prejudices immediately dissipated, and she could immediately tell that he was one of the most wholesome, honest, charming people she&#39;d ever met.I haven&#39;t watched the semi-recent film about his life because I&#39;m a big softie and I&#39;m sure I&#39;d bawl, but I do know that he was a very good man who will be missed for a long time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am one of the people responsible for making these lists. The fact that the general public as well as journalists think this data is accurate in anyway is really funny. This an exercise of futility that only increases the overall cost and provides job security for me :)No one working in a hospital knows how much do we acquire things for, or how much we get paid for doing things in advance. And only like 8 people can tell you that information 3 months after the fact.Take the simple exercise of figuring out cost/revenue of an aspirin administration.Cost depends on:
1. Are you an outpatient/Obsveration v. inpatient v. ED?
2. Are you on Medicaid?
3. Is the hospital a part of GPO organization or not?
4. Is contractual obligations of GPO includes/excludes Aspirin?Reimbursement depends on:
1. Insurance
2. Group which you are under the insurance from
3. Contract language whether its a fee/service or bundled
4. Is the visit covered or not
5. how the visit/procedure was coded (most important and opaque factor)Everybody in the know, knows that these lists are a joke, but no one can prove it."</p>

Wired headphones never run out of battery and have superior audio quality- I can take real photos wiht high quality instead of relying on ever newer iPhone models for thousands of dollars which will always have lesser quality than a mirrorless camera for the same price- I have fun again discovering bands and artists on Bandcamp instead of mind numbing listening to Apple Music playlists- Coding via neovim on a terminal and just being on my keyboard navigating not only tmux and co, but also my OS is way more productive and fasterWhich of these can I not do on a Mac?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found this bit very interesting&gt; I realised that my life while using Apple products is 
&gt; controlled by Product Managers/Owners who want to get a
&gt; raise, rather than by technology people who share the same 
&gt; passion as meMainly because I feel exactly the opposite. I don’t find Windows, Linux or x86 technologically exiting anymore.Apple makes (IMO of course) the most technologically exciting CPUs, their GPUs are a breath of fresh air, I love their approach to UI, APIs and OS security."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Once I got cussed out by a business owner. Showed it to my wife and she told me to quit my job. Said we’d figure it out, but that she didn’t want me working for somebody like that.I knew it needed to happen but I’d been stressing about how to tell her for nearly a month. The amount of relief that came from her approval and endorsement was incredible. I was less nervous about quitting than I was nervous about telling her.Props to you man. Well done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great read. Thanks for sharing and congrats on your success!I&#39;m in a similar situation. I&#39;m working on a thing and my wife has been supporting me for some time now.Years ago she told me to leave my job and focus on my thing, but I was afraid. I&#39;ve been working since I was 19 years old and I have trust issues. It was very difficult for me to believe in myself and jump into the void but I&#39;m 42 and if I don&#39;t do it now I will never do it.Anyway, I&#39;m a couple of months from the first beta launch. I&#39;m happy, anxious, afraid, hopeful... all at the same time. I hope I&#39;ll be able to write a similar blog post in a year or two."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re a keygen.sh user for our Modality product at Auxon. It&#39;s excellent. Some folks on the team have experience with some of traditional &#34;giants&#34; in the space like Nalpeiron and Flexera. Working with keygen.sh is an absolute joy by comparison. It&#39;s not without a few oddities and caveats of its own, but the experience writ large is so incredibly positive that those few issues are easy to forgive and forget.It&#39;s really interesting to get some backstage access to how this fantastic product came to be and what underpins the motivating thesis behind it.From one founder (also with little ones and a fantastically supportive partner) to another, my hat&#39;s off to you. My many thanks to both you and your partner. Being able to just grab keygen.sh and integrate licensing into our product helped us go from MA to GA in about a week and was also essential in getting some investors over the hump to funding (because we could show traction and an easier path to more of it). As a result, I got to reduce my stress level and spend more time with my kids over the summer."</p>
