								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The New York Times did some decent reporting into the pseudo-brands which comes closer to answering the question in the title: having a registered trademark unlocks a lot of on-platform seller tools (predictive analytics, early review program, etc.), and the easiest path to a trademark is to have an utterly unique, nonsense name. Some Chinese municipalities were also offering cash incentives for citizens who obtained foreign intellectual property registrations, further exacerbating the problem.Full article at https://www.nytimes.com/2020/02/11/style/amazon-trademark-co..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The scam is enormously profitable for Amazon and the Chinese black hats. You can tell it is really profitable because Amazon will compensate you for up to $1000 for damages caused by this junk. https://www.bbc.com/news/business-58163915I believe that Amazon probably could not turn the screws on these companies even if it wanted to. It would be a massive loss to their revenue and share holders would revolt. It would bring prices up in aggregate if these companies could not sell junk on the platform.The best they can do is play coy and hope the US government or EU does not crack down hard on them. Caveat Emptor my friends!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it correct to say that when you get something &#34;shipped and sold by Amazon.com&#34;, it really comes from them? It&#39;s the &#34;fulfilled by Amazon&#34; (the infamous FBA) that you need to watch out for.It&#39;s a bit screwy, but you can filter by seller by clicking into a specific product category, and then selecting Amazon.com in the bar on the left. Then all the items should be &#34;shipped and sold by Amazon.com&#34;.But I&#39;ve been sort of shocked to find recently that Amazon&#39;s prices, even with free shipping, are often not competitive with buying first-party, even with paying the shipping. For a lot of products these days, if there&#39;s a recognizable name brand associated with it, I just by first-party. You get it slower, but you know what you&#39;re getting, and probably end up giving more money to the seller too.I would not have seen myself doing this ten years ago."</p>

There is another project doing a similar thing, but they don&#39;t have bluetooth nor an OLED display (they reuse the same display) so it&#39;s not nearly as useful in daily life, though still very impressive work nonetheless.But this is really amazing work. I hope you find some collaborators to continue!!I recently got an F-105W which I had when I was a teen (which is basically the F-91 but with a cool glowy EL backlight). And one thing that really surprised me how small that thing is. It seemed bigger at the time.I&#39;m really amazed how much technology this project managed to fit in that tiny case. Battery, OLED, bluetooth.. Just wow.I would pay for this, I was thinking of buying that other project on crowdsupply but without BT connectivity I just don&#39;t really have any use for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People both uncerestimate and overestimate what PV can do. In summer and around noon, here in western Europe, there is so much PV-electricity produced that it is _almost_ enough to fulfill all demands. In winter, the amount is like a drop in the desert.I have built a 30 kWp PV at home 2 years ago - you would think this is quite big, for a private plant. It is not enough. If I want to power a heat pump (with drilled holes), e.g. to cover the heating for the house from November - February, I calculated I would need about 70 to 80 kWp (optimized for winter sun angle, e.g. pretty steep modules at 60° or 70° that relatively produce less in summer, but more in winter).Now I imagine all the people that buy tiny 5 kWp plants. The only way this would work is collaborative, with buffers at the medium-voltage level.So the biggest problem is really energy transfer or relocation, between different time&#39;s and regions´ needs (winter, summer; night, day; or from different regions worldwide)... btw. here&#39;s a graphic for the calculation [1]. Blue is an imaginary heating pump electricity consumption over the year, red is the predicted pv production for a 60 kWp plant, where 30 kWp are at 60° angle - calculated with Europe&#39;s pvgis tool [2].[1]: https://ibb.co/WKsHPKX[2]: https://re.jrc.ec.europa.eu/pvg_tools/en/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re going to need a lot of solar panels and an efficient way to transport power from a very sunny place to another location where the loads are.For instance: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_DC_IntertieThe pacific DC intertie right now often ends up being used to transport power from hydroelectric dams in WA/OR to California. But there&#39;s nothing to say that something couldn&#39;t function the other way if there was enough willpower and budget to cover, for instance, a huge chunk of the desert near Edwards AFB in CA with hundreds of megawatts of photovoltaics.I searched for &#34;high voltage DC&#34; in that article and didn&#39;t see a mention of it, or anything much else about long distance transport of power.The technology now exists to theoretically cover many hundreds of square km of Libya in photovoltaics and take the electricty to Europe through a sub-sea cable, or series of cables. It&#39;s a matter of the political will and budget to do it.https://powertechresearch.com/the-worlds-longest-submarine-h..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this is the most hopeful thing I&#39;ve read about renewable energy in ... years, maybe ever?Even ignoring whether the fuel-from-air thing will pan out, the idea posed here that solar will get so cheap that excess energy can be used for stuff like this is insane.Not only did they explain the implications, but the author does a decent job at showing the math behind all of the insanely optimistic graphs. Thank you for sharing this OP! This is why I come to HN"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am so grateful the FastAI team exists. It wasn&#39;t until I discovered their &#34;Machine Learning for Coders&#34; course that I really started to grok ML. I was in grad school trying to pivot my career from finance to data science. I didn&#39;t come from a computer science / math background and things just weren&#39;t clicking for me. I remember feeling angry, embarrassed, dumb, and overall that I wasn&#39;t smart enough to learn this stuff -- I was incredibly discouraged and felt that I didn&#39;t belong there. I was lucky enough to stumble across one of the course videos on YouTube (thanks recommendation algorithm!), and the rest is history.The amazing thing about these courses is how simple Jeremy (and team) are able to make machine learning. I didn&#39;t need to understand python dependency management in order to learn how to train an really good image classifier. Their approach helped me have lots of little wins, gave me confidence, and helped build the motivation to slog through the harder stuff when I needed to.From the bottom of my heart, thank you @jph00. You changed my life immeasurably for the better. I learned that I AM good enough, I AM smart enough, and I CAN do hard things... I just had to find the right way to learn them. Your courses completely changed my perspective on what was possible for me and opened the door to some of my life&#39;s greatest passions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi folks - I&#39;m the creator/teacher of this course. I&#39;d be happy to answer any questions that you have about the course, learning deep learning in general, or the state of deep learning in 2022."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first Fast.ai course back in around 2016 changed my life.I was studying a masters in statistics and computer science that had 1 neural networks lecture and nobody knew anything about deep learning. Fast.ai and Jeremy’s teaching style helped me start playing with deep learning models really quickly and I changed my thesis topic to computer vision.I ended up consulting on the topic and doing various startups leading to the startup I’m working on now which just finished YC (AiSupervision W22).I doubt be here without fast.ai. I highly recommend and appreciate all the work that Jeremy and the rest of fast.ai do!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huh, seeing their full argument written out makes the temporary CDL policy make a lot more sense.They were already contracting with other libraries to increase the amount of out-of-circulation copies they could lend, and with 90,000 libraries closed they assumed removing any restrictions would still keep them well under the amount of out-of-circulation copies available.And they were likely right, if &#34;The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe&#34; only had 888 lends at most a few books would reach anywhere near the total out-of-circulation copies. It makes the publishers argument look less like &#34;we were robbed&#34; and more like &#34;we should have made even more cash off the pandemic.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For non lawyers: a request for summary judgment is something any lawyer will do, possibly multiple times in a case. And the vast majority of the time, they’re denied. It does not mean that their case is a slam dunk or anything; just that they want the judge to prematurely end the matter in their favor.It’s almost a useless motion, but because it has worked sometimes, your lawyer would be stupid to not try it.In other words, an article saying that a party requested summary judgment doesn’t really mean anything. I’m almost certain the other party filed one as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think there&#39;s something special about websites where everyone gets the same thing. Like how Wordle was so popular, or Hacker News -- I often mention to my wife some article from here, and she already read it so we have an interesting discussion. Compare that to TikTok &#34;have you seen that one? no... well they&#39;re talking about this roman battle, but the soldiers are all birds...&#34;That was a small part of the thread, but I mention it because of what he said about the power of human curation -- that the curator picked out these great treasuries from the sea of shirtless dudes. Because if you have the same frontpage for everyone, it&#39;s feasible to have an expert just pick that instead of needing some weird flaky NN that&#39;s expensive to develop, train, and run, and produces bland (or disturbing)  recommendations anyways.(Even algorithmically-driven sites like HN benefit from that, like dang manually emailing people to resubmit interesting stories.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a reminder that many of the most popular sites we encounter are not phd level rocket science behind them, but in fact piles of duct tape and random scripts shoved in there along the way. So next time you think &#34;I couldn&#39;t possibly build a site worth $100MM&#34;, know that most of the people who did probably shouldn&#39;t have been able to either."</p>

If you&#39;re any other business or the government, then go on ahead... Collect our biometric data, read our emails, track our movements. No need for consent."</p>

It&#39;s hard for an MP to vote against it and then try to justify it to their constituents who, let&#39;s face it, aren&#39;t that knowledgeable or interested even in the subject. When you have the cost of living crisis (which is now used  to justify a host of other things...) and an upcoming winter where heating/electricity costs could keep on rising, something like messaging encryption isn&#39;t the first thing on your list. Hell, most people are juggling 3-4 social media apps hoovering up their data, this is the LEAST of their concerns.And I can&#39;t blame them.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just did a two week long back country road campervan trip from Tahoe down south through each of the forests... Stanislaus, Yosemite, Sierra, Kings, Sequoia. It was amazing boondocking in the middle of nowhere, no cell signal and taking baths in what is left of the rivers and lakes...Once you get past Yosemite, pretty much all of the reservoirs are empty to less than half full. Majority of the streams are gone.It gets worse the further you head south. Kings and Sequoia are pretty much decimated forests from the fires and beetles. Dead trees for as far as you can see. Given the lack of water, I expect them to be desert in just a few more years.There are quite a few hydro power generation stations deep in the mountains that I had no idea existed. I suspect they will close down as well. I wonder what effect that will have on California power supply over the coming years. That said, it was pretty clear that PG&amp;E is working on updating the infrastructure as they are all over the place working on things.If I hadn&#39;t seen it for myself, I wouldn&#39;t believe it. The extent of damage is pretty massive and it would take quite a lot of rain to &#39;fix&#39; things. So much so that it would probably end up just flooding everything, creating just as much of a mess."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The wild political madness involved in the grand project to water the American West is detailed in Marc Reisner&#39;s &#34;Cadillac Desert&#34; (1986), and is a must-read for anyone wanting to understand the current situation.  It was written before a climate-related megadrought was really on anyone&#39;s long-term radar, but it really explains a lot.For example, dams are only part of the water storage picture, there&#39;s also groundwater, and the water projects often had the goal of protecting groundwater (keeping the water table closer to the surface), but then once they&#39;d provided water via a dam or aquaduct, the farmers would just expand the areas they were farming and groundwater extraction would often increase as a side effect.Humans really aren&#39;t that good at long-term planning, is one conclusion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you’re the kind of person who learned orbital mechanismcs through Kerbal Space Program and deepened you understanding of backpressure and supply chains with Factorio, and you are looking for a similar way to get a deeper feel for water resource management, can I suggest taking a look at Timberborn, the post-apocalyptic beaver simulator. You have to figure out how to engineer a reliable water supply in the face of epic dry season droughts."</p>
