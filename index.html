								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love technical content like this. Not only is it incredibly interesting and informative, it also serves as a perfect counterpoint to the popular &#34;why does Netflix need X thousand engineers, I could build it in a weekend&#34; sentiment that is frequently brought up on forums like this one.Building software and productionalizing/scaling it are two very different problems, and the latter is far more difficult. Running a successful company always requires an unlimited number of very smart people who are willing to get their hands dirty optimizing every aspect of the product and business. Too many people today think that programming starts and ends at pulling a dozen popular libraries and making some API calls."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have some experience serving static content and working with CDNs. Here is what I find interesting / unique here:- They are not using OS page cache or any memory caching for that, every request is served directly from disks. This seems possible only when requests are spread between may NVMe disks since single high-end NVMe like Micron 9300 PRO has max 3.5GB/s read speed (or 28Gbps) - far less than 800Gbps. Looks like it works ok for long-tail content but what about new hot content everybody wants to watch at the day of release? Do they spread the same content over multiple disks for this purpose?- Async I/O resolves issues with nginx process stalling because of disk read operation but only after you&#39;ve already opened the file. Depending on FS / number of files / other FS activities, directory structure opening the file can block for significant time and there is no async open() AFAIK. How they resolve that? Are we assuming i-node cache contains all i-nodes and open() time is insignificant? Or are they configuring nginx() with large open file cache?- TLS for streamed media was necessary because browsers started to complain about non-TLS content. But that makes things sooo complicated as we see in the presentation (kTLS is 50% of CPU usage before moving to encryption offloaded by NIC). One has to remember that the content is most probably already encrypted (DRM), we just add another layer of encryption / authentication. TLS for media segments make so little sens IMO.- When you relay on encryption or TCP offloading by NIC you are stuck with that is possible with your NIC. I guess no HTTP/3 over UDP or fancy congestion control optimization in TCP until the vendor somehow implements it in the hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of the reasons they&#39;ve had to build most of this stuff themselfs is because they decided for some reason to use freeBSD.The NUMA work they did, I remember being in a meeting with them as a Linux Developer at Intel at the time. They bought NVMe drives or were saying they were going to buy NVMe drives from Intel which got them access to &#34;on the ground&#34; kernel developers and CPU people from Intel. Instead of talking about NVMe they spent the entire meeting asking us about howt the Linux kernel handles NUMA and corner cases around memory and scheudling. If I recall correctly I think they asked if we could help them upstream BSD code for NVMe and NUMA. I think in that meeting there was even some L9 or super high up NUMA CPU guy from Hillsborough they some how convinced to join.The conversation and technical discussion was quite fun, but it was sort of funny to us at the time they were having to do all this work on the BSD kernel that was solved years ago for linux.Technical debt I guess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This sucks... I&#39;m sorry you had to go through this. The App Store review process is just pretty bad. It&#39;s especially frustrating when you see downright shitty apps on the store. The &#34;black-box&#34; aspect of it makes it that much more kafkaesque too.When I first submitted my app on there, they rejected it and complained that I used HealthKit but didn&#39;t mention it in the app description. The thing is, I did. My app description had a list of &#34;highlighted features&#34;, one them being &#34;Apple health integration&#34;.I was about to file an appeal, but then I saw a couple other apps with &#34;Integrates with Apple Health&#34; on its own line in the description. Figured that&#39;s probably what they were looking for (even though the guidelines don&#39;t explicitly say that) so I changed it and boom, the app was approved. I hate it, but it&#39;s not worth my time or the risk to fight it.For what it&#39;s worth, I think your app looks really good!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yep, I got this rejection when I made this tipping app (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tip-69/id1460610078).I went on to add OCR detection for receipts so you don&#39;t have to type in the amount, I added more tipping modes, I added split bill functionality, and eventually added an entire social network with the ability to share your receipt for the world to see, like or comment on.Must have spent months trying to get approved by Apple.I&#39;d rather no one ask me why."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;ve done this since the early days of the app store. Mostly-content apps without really broad appeal have long carried a high risk of rejection.&gt; Homescreen widgets: utterly useless, but can&#39;t get more iOS-y and less webapp-y than this, right?This especially, but really the whole post reads like the system working as intended.Granted (as the author notes) way too much shit gets through anyway, but that&#39;s not an excuse to do even worse. I do, as a user, wish they&#39;d tighten up the rules a lot and improve enforcement. I&#39;m quite sure it&#39;d improve my experience on the store (and probably on the web—imagine how much better the Reddit site would get, probably overnight, if their app got pulled over not being well-justified)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At a previous job, I was the engineering manager for a new neo-bank and was on call 24/7 for it. I have a beefy Lenovo P52 that I hated carrying around and leaving in my car lest it get stolen. So I got a GPD Pocket. It fit very well into my back pocket.Not only did it work great for emergency situations (I ran Ubuntu MATE as well) when I needed to SSH into machines, check stuff on Datadog, edit code to make a quick fix, push code to our K8S environments and more, but I actually found myself frequently at coffee shops and bars coding away happily on it. It brought a certain amount of freedom and cool factor with it. It was a delightful little device with a very sharp and crisp screen, a surprisingly useful keyboard that combined well with my i3 environment, that I could actually be productive on (save for running our test suite which took around 30 minutes and sucked the life out of the battery). It also got a lot of onlookers asking questions about it, leading to those ever so fun random conversations that can lead to night long friendships over wine and coffee.I genuinely miss it and will probably pick up another one now that I just got hired as a CTO for another project with equally demanding on-call schedules and uptime requirements. Although I don&#39;t drink anymore so none of those fun conversations. Ce la vie."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Micro PC is a really cool device, but owning one I couldn&#39;t really recommend it outside a very small niche.Form factor, ports, and performance are all great. The firmware is very frustrating though. Mine shipped with a newer firmware (4.18) than was available to download, and it was miserable. The machine would power on to blank screens, and have random crashes. I was wary of downgrading because I couldn&#39;t put the &#34;newer&#34; firmware back on.Finally gave in and stability was much improved on 4.13. Boot issues still happen though (less frequently). They seem possibly exasperated by Linux. It can require 3 or 4 attempts at holding the power button to force a reset. Unplug anything that could be back-feeding power so it will actually reset (not confirmed). Just all around annoying if you power it on and off a lot.Other issues to consider. The hinge support is somewhat fragile. I try to be gentle opening and closing. I think I also put some epoxy around the plastic screwhole pillar. The battery has a permanent over-discharge cutoff that a number of users have hit so I&#39;ve been careful to keep a charge on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Had one for three years. Use it nearly every day, but I work with embedded systems in robots/industrial machinery. One handed operation, tons of IO, dual boot, fits in back pocket etc. have made this indispensable.One dead battery, replacement part from alibaba via GPD rep given link. Easy to disassemble via screwdriver and spudger. Works great now. Injection molded piece that held the threads where the hinge attached also failed. Drilled a little pinhole and added a small machine screw, nut and threadlocker. No more problems. Nut goes under the plastic hinge cover. The fix is literally better than original.Other than that, the only issue I&#39;ve had is getting grub to see the screen as landscape. Grub config options seem to get ignored. Oh well. Standard rotation is sorted with boot scripts and the OEM Windows 10 side works great."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very optimistic for near-term AGI (10 years or less). Even just a few years ago most in the field would have said that it&#39;s an &#34;unknown unknown&#34;, we didn&#39;t have the theory or the models, there was no path forward and so it was impossible to predict.Now we have a fairly concrete idea of what a potential AGI might look like - an RL agent that uses a large transformer.The issue is that unlike supervised training you need to simulate the environment along with the agent, so this requires a magnitude more compute compared to LLMs. That&#39;s why I think it will still be large corporate labs that will make the most progress in this field."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The interview with Lex Fridman that he was referring to:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I845O57ZSy4&amp;t=14567sThe entire video is worth viewing, an impressive 5:15h!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting to see how he&#39;s progressed with this. When he first announced he was getting into AI it sounded almost like a semi retirement thing: something that interested him that he could do for fun and solo, without the expectation that it would go anywhere. But now he seems truly serious about it. Wonder if he&#39;s started hiring yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago I experienced an issue with a Cyberpower UPS software update that interfered with the system&#39;s Bluetooth, causing devices to not be able to connect, inexplicably since the software doesn&#39;t use BT for anything.Only after much online searching did I stumble on another user with the same issue and after uninstalling it and reverting to an earlier version the issue immediately went away.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who has recruited hundreds of candidates at this point I would urge caution with lists like this.By all means read the list, but rather than trying to grind through as many of the questions as possible, try to use it as inspiration and think of what you&#39;re actually curious about and which might tip you over one way or the other if you&#39;re on the fence. It&#39;s far better to have a good conversation about 1 thing which might affect your decision than a superficial sprint through a bunch of topics you don&#39;t actually care that much about.Secondly, consider that if you do well you are likely to have multiple rounds of interviews.  Think about which questions are likely to be most enlightening when you ask each interviewer.  Don&#39;t shy away from asking 2 people the same question if you think you&#39;ll get different perspectives. If you ask a peer engineer the diversity questions you may well get quite a different answer from asking the HR/recruiting person for instance (eg one might give you a cultural insight vs the other might just give you the policy/factual answer).I once interviewed a candidate[1] who had printed off a whole list like this and insisted on grinding through the whole thing.  It was weirdly offputting, but he was such a monster programmer that he was already a clear hire. It gave an insight into the thoroughness of his nature though and showed that he was absolutely perfect for the (critical) role we were hiring him for where mistakes were extremely costly.[1] Hi Fluffy! If you see this I hope you&#39;re doing well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m obviously cherry picking, but if an applicant asks me a series of questions akin to &#34;what source control tool do you use and why&#34; I&#39;m going to begin doubting that this person can focus on actually shipping product. There&#39;s this whole scene of people who do performative, almost theatrical, quality programming but nigh on forgot how to actually ship features, and questions like those are a hint they might be in that camp.EDIT: to add some context, i run a small startup, we need the whole team able to ship. I can imagine that in certain bureaucratic bigcorps, performatively obsessing on code/process quality can be useful, because the distance between the programmer and the customer/user is so long."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of the comments in here are reacting to the large list of questions being very off-putting. There&#39;s a deeper issue here that we still don&#39;t have a good answer for: it is incredibly hard to tell what a company is like until you start working there, and asking questions either leads to very surface-level answers or just flat out catfishing candidates. Companies being transparent and detailed about how they operate is the exception.The company gets to spend 3+ hours finding out information about a candidate, but the candidate has little option to discover company culture for themselves. They can snoop around on LinkedIn but this doesn&#39;t answer much about culture unless there is someone who is prolifically producing content inside the company. There&#39;s glassdoor which might answer part of it but generally the reviews there are extremely shallow and biased by the skills, mindset, and treatment of whoever wrote the review.So what&#39;s the answer? I think &#34;ask targeted questions&#34; is fine as long as it is not &#34;ask 100 general questions&#34;. I haven&#39;t seen a single article on the meta of how to pick what questions to ask or how to get past shallow answers. I also think the entire industry is performing pretty terrible in this space and we don&#39;t have a good answer for how to handle it that is common or even well-known. This leads to lost candidates or (intentionally or unintentionally) catfished candidates who will leave after joining."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So I&#39;m just at the tail end of a project where I&#39;m attempting to build a collaborative text editor, and it&#39;s been absolute hell. I figured it would be a tricky problem, but I had no idea how far down the rabbit hole goes. I kept thinking, gosh, there&#39;s gotta be a backend service that bakes this in, if there isn&#39;t it would be a great business opportunity.I almost want to scrap all of my code and move it to Supabase. Congrats to the team on this launch, very cool.edit: actually, after thinking it through, I&#39;m not clear on what Supabase is calling multiplayer. Presence is one thing, but when I think multiplayer, I&#39;m thinking conflict resolution. Is this an OT/CRDT implementation? Or is it just presence?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"hey hn, supabase ceo herewe&#39;re excited about this release - it adds a few neat features to our Realtime server[0]. For those who don&#39;t read the post (it&#39;s quite long), our Realtime server was initially built for subscribing to Postgres changes via websockets. We&#39;ve added Broadcast functionality (for &#34;ephemeral&#34; messages that don&#39;t need to be persisted to Postgres) and Presence (similar to Broadcasts, but it retains an eventually-consistent state between users).We were planning a larger write-up with all the technical details but it became a bit long. Some highlights:- Realtime is built with Elixir an Phoenix[1]- We&#39;ve moved to a single, global cluster
- We&#39;re using `Phoenix.Tracker` to globally distribute the Erlang PIDs of all of our Postgres connections. This guarantees there is only a single connection to each database.- We&#39;ve implemented a &#34;leaky-bucket&#34; rate-limiter using Erlang&#39;s `:counters` module[3] for &#34;per tenant&#34; rate-limiting. We&#39;ll move this to a global rate-limiter in the future- We&#39;re currently seeing ~2000 concurrent connected users - it will be interesting to see what this spikes up to now that this is on HNIt&#39;s still in heavy development, and we&#39;ll make sure to detail all the choices we take as we continue solve problems. A few of the Realtime team will be here answer questions - @chasers, @wenbo, @abc3erl.[0] Realtime: https://github.com/supabase/realtime[1] Phoenix Framework: https://www.phoenixframework.org/[2] rate limiter: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leaky_bucket[3] :counters: https://www.erlang.org/doc/man/counters.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really neat, I have been keeping an eye on Supabase, this (presence) is the feature that will finally push me to build a side project with it. I have one in mind.Anyone from Supabase here, do you have any plans to build in support for CRDT toolkits such as Yjs or AutoMerge for these features? It would make working with them so much easer if there was a plug and play backend.The one other thing I would love to see next from them is an offline sync product, so you could partially sync a users dataset to their device and save back any changes later (bonus points for then combing that with CRDTs). Maybe the WASM Postgres yesterday [0] could be a foundation for such a product.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32498435"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not OP, but the timing context of this post is important:Today, California has issued a FlexAlert, and Powerwalls in PG&amp;E and SCE will start discharging at 6pm to help reduce load on the grid. It&#39;s not a daily action, but it&#39;s emergency support when the grid needs it the most.And the time window when it happens is important: Powerwalls are contributing to  to reduce load when the grid needs it the most. It&#39;s not meant to support the entire grid, just directly attack the problem at the time where every Watt and Watt-hour counts.You don&#39;t need to own Powerwall to benefit from this, just like how you don&#39;t own the peaker plants that typically spark up at these times. You benefit because there&#39;s a big chance that there won&#39;t be rolling blackouts in California this afternoon—distributed assets like this can be dispatched.Dispatch Info: https://twitter.com/AlexGuichet/status/1559748677626777600A VPP tracker in the Tesla community: https://www.lastbulb.com/virtual-power-plantSome technical details of how Tesla VPPs work, as organized distributed systems: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ggdYts4muu0CAISO Grid Outlook: https://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/default.aspx"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m contemplating enrolling in this.Right now I&#39;m a net generator, even with our 100 deg days, but I am not 100% off grid. The Panels charge the Powerwall during the day, the Powerwall is drained overnight.The batteries currently do not survive the night. Even though the house cools down, it retains enough heat that the AC still kicks on, thus draining the battery. Note my AC is 78 all day/night. We got a thing from the power company &#34;do these things on this day and get power credits by lowering your usage&#34;, and, of course, we already do all that...no credits for us!So typically during transition at dawn, I pull in grid power.But I&#39;m still a net generator, they get more than I take.The concern was simply if I enroll in this, then the batteries kick in and drain even before the evening, and I go to grid power sooner.But, thinking about it, &#34;I don&#39;t care&#34;. It&#39;s an offset. They&#39;re draining because they need the load NOW, and I can provide it. Later, when things settle down, I&#39;ll pull it back.I think this works out, simply as a &#34;be a good citizen&#34;, use my battery to prevent someone in Fresno&#39;s AC browning out late in the heat of the afternoon.Maybe I&#39;m just being whimsical, but I&#39;m still thinking about it.Also thinking about bolting on another battery, I already have two."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quick math shows a long range Model 3 has about six times as much battery capacity as a Powerwall. I’m willing to bet more people have Model 3’s than Powerwalls. And I’m willing to bet 16% of your car’s battery capacity will impact you far less than 100% of your Powerwall.F-150 Lightning called it right: EV’s should ship with grid-tie inverting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems like a dodged bullet. There is little to no constitutional protection for free speech in Australia and defamation is routinely employed successfully in fairly speculative situations (for example, politicians, as public figures, suing journalists they don&#39;t like). Every time a question comes up like this it is genuinely an unknown what the court will do and no clear precedent suggesting they weigh potential broad impact of decisions heavily in their judgement.So this could easily have come down the other way and we could have a precedent suggesting potential liability for literally anybody who links to anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hyperlinking can still be constrained by other laws. So, this has high specificity as I see it. The specific constraints applied in the suit which led to the High Court have been found not to apply.I don&#39;t have a list of what do, I just hypothesise there could be other constraints. Private agreements, CSAM laws, IPR laws, which go to why you cannot provide a hyperlink.Not a Lawyer."</p>
