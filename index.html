								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s sort of mentioned, but not emphasized in this review that connection dropouts happen every few minutes for a few seconds. That makes starlink fine for any kind of asynchronous content like web browsing, torrenting or video streaming, but unusable for video calls, stream hosting, voip, or online gaming. It&#39;s implied that this is due to the trees obstructing a full view of the sky, but I have actually heard these connection dropouts are just about universal due to the constellation not having enough infill. Just a warning that for most of us we are still several hundred satellites short and some connection handoff updates away from this being a useful internet connection.I have a property where Starlink would be perfect and I would pay triple the price to be able to do zoom calls over the connection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had Starlink for about 6 months and it is a massive improvement on upload speed at 10-25 Mb. Download speed is a mixed bag wildly oscillating from 5 to 100 Mb and back. It&#39;s okay for downloading things but it&#39;s terrible for any sort of video conferencing. There are brief dropouts on average every 6 minutes or so and my obstruction map is better than the author&#39;s. My neighbor up the street got slightly better service by mounting his dishy on a 20-ft antenna pole above his house.Local ground service is 20 Mb download and 2 Mb upload. And that&#39;s just barely sufficient for watching streaming video and video conferencing. Gigabit service is but a mile and a half away but no one is going to pay to lay the fiber into our neighborhood. So the last mile and a half is copper from 20 years ago. I think that&#39;s going to require political will to fix and I don&#39;t think that political will exists right now nor will it in the near future. We could have paid $5,000 per house to lay it ourself but our own neighborhood couldn&#39;t come to consensus on that. Now imagine that at a national level.So if they just deliver 100/100 within a year or two, this is an epic win IMO and I will cancel ground service. And if they don&#39;t someone else will so I&#39;m not worried. But it took Teslas to spark the electric vehicle industry. Now there&#39;s a lot of choice. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if something similar happens here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m typing this message from Starlink. For me it&#39;s absolutely transformative; 10x the bandwidth I can get from any other source and very reliable.Except for outages related to obstructions. That&#39;s a real problem and the author&#39;s situation is not good. There&#39;s ways to work around it on your property; a taller mount, a tree install, cutting some trees. But ultimately Dishy needs a clear view to the north and there&#39;s no getting around it.I have some smaller obstructions for my install and it was a little annoying but fine. But in the past week or two it&#39;s gotten way better: my packet loss went from 2% to 0.6%. Details here: https://nelsonslog.wordpress.com/2021/07/20/starlink-improve..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We need a word or phrase for this phenomenon, where we attempt to substitute human pattern recognition with algorithms that just aren&#39;t up to the job. Facebook moderation, Tesla Full Self Driving, the War Games movie, arrests for mistaken facial identification. It&#39;s becoming an increasingly dystopic force in our lives and will likely get much worse before getting even worse. So it needs a label. Maybe there&#39;s a ten syllable German word that expresses it perfectly?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well. The speech police started changing &#34;blacklist&#34; and &#34;whitelist&#34; in programming context, even when those had no racist history; maybe it&#39;s time to change it in chess. (After all, white always goes first, that is not very PC.)Rename &#34;black&#34; and &#34;white&#34; to &#34;second player&#34; and &#34;first player&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a fine mess we&#39;ve created.- Popular experiences tend to be better experiences, so we all congregate to the same services- Homogenous user behavior leads to monopolistic situations, increasing outrage when anything goes wrong- Even if the government doesn&#39;t try to enforce moderation, the company attempts to self-moderate to maintain its image- The popularity of the service makes human moderation impossible, creating a need for inevitably-flawed robotsI see no solution. The only way to win is not to play."</p>

How these companies thrive? Why customers keep buying new stuff, when there are solutions already to most of the business neeeds out there (and even free ones!). 
Is this still the case of idiot-managers doing decisions like &#34;nobody was fired for buying IBM&#34; (and now SAP, salesforce, &lt;yourcompany&gt;) or am I not seeing something? Genuine qustions, really interested."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article doesn&#39;t mention it - and I can&#39;t find it anywhere - but in any neighborhood what is the highest proportion of units that are short-term rentals. Five percent? Ten percent in the super touristy areas? I have no idea and even before the other flaws in the study I am skeptical than anything short of 20% would make an impact on any major attribute of an area.I see one stat in the paper that &#34;40% of buildings had airbnb listings in some tracts&#34; but if the buildings had 10 units in them each this still may mean a relatively small number of total listings were from Airbnbs. In fact, even in Boston there are some tracts where I suppose that the average building must have 30+ units which would meant that if 60% of buildings had no listing the total percentage of listings that are Airbnbs is relatively small.&gt;higher levels of violent crime did not appear immediately after Airbnb listings became available to tourists, but rather developed over the course of several years, the researchers said.Alternative theory. Every area had some Airbnbs. In neighborhoods that were being wealthier/more popular/had more jobs decided it was easier to just do long-term rentals. In areas where landlords had trouble renting them out to anyone long-term (because locals know if a neighborhood is nice or not) they turned more units into Airbnbs because outsiders don&#39;t know/don&#39;t care."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh. This appears to be one of those cases of media exaggeration for eyeballs. The study says:&gt; the effect on violence was only consistent visible for the measure of Airbnb penetration–or the extent to which buildings in the neighborhood have one or more listings (and for the measure of density, or the listings per household in the two-year lags). It was never present for overall usage, or the estimated quantity of Airbnb guestsAnd&gt; A second and related concern could be the potential bias due to omitted variables. Though the DID models control for the initial conditions of neighborhoods, they do not necessarily control for trends in these variables that parallel the increases in both Airbnb presence and crime. For example, there is some evidence that gentrifying neighborhoods experience increases in certain types of crimeAnd&gt; we have tested this hypothesis in a single citySo there&#39;s apparently a correlation between a single metric and a single class of crime in a single city, and there&#39;s a multi-year delay in the effect. The author speculates that erosion of social fabric is the culprit, but doesn&#39;t actually back this theory up with either data or references. One would at least expect some references to some other study about the correlations on emigration and violence (my two cents here is that it feels more likely that the former is caused by the latter, if a correlation exists at all). They even acknowledge that the correlation could be due to a factor that isn&#39;t being accounted for.But then the article writer drops all nuance and blasts a title pegging blame squarely on AirBnB, even though it isn&#39;t even established that correlation is consistently true everywhere, let alone causation.I mean, yeah, I get that people don&#39;t like predatory real estate renting, and want to hear that there&#39;s a neatly convenient evil entity to blame, but come on now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m really surprised that Blizzard thinks a state suit against them for sexual discrimination, harassment, and a litany of odious behaviors by managers is best answered by calling them &#34;unaccountable State bureaucrats,&#34; as they did in their PR damage control release. It&#39;s like they think it&#39;s 1995 and MeToo never happened.In the suit, the state even attempted a mediated resolution to prevent it from going to court. But Blizzard refused to cooperate, essentially taunting the state to bring a case, which they now have.It really makes you question whether Bobby Kotick is the right guy as CEO. Not only did he fail to demonstrate ethical leadership, but his handling of this crisis is massively destructive of shareholder value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This part really helps put it into perspective:&gt; In a tragic example of the harassment that Defendants allowed to fester in their offices, a female employee committed suicide while on a company trip due to a sexual relationship that she had been having with her male supervisor. The male supervisor was found by police to have brought a butt plug and lubricant on this business trip. Another employee confirmed that the deceased female employee may have been suffering from other sexual harassment at work prior to her death. Specifically, at a holiday party before her death, male co-workers were alleged to be passing around a picture of the deceased&#39;s vagina.(I had to manually type that out because the source doc is a scanned PDF; might have typos)source: https://aboutblaw.com/YJw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blizzard&#39;s full response: &#34;The DFEH includes distorted, and in many cases false, descriptions of Blizzard’s past. We have been extremely cooperative with the DFEH throughout their investigation, including providing them with extensive data and ample documentation, but they refused to inform us what issues they perceived. They were required by law to adequately investigate and to have good faith discussions with us to better understand and to resolve any claims or concerns before going to litigation, but they failed to do so. Instead, they rushed to file an inaccurate complaint, as we will demonstrate in court. We are sickened by the reprehensible conduct of the DFEH to drag into the complaint the tragic suicide of an employee whose passing has no bearing whatsoever on this case and with no regard for her grieving family. While we find this behavior to be disgraceful and unprofessional, it is unfortunately an example of how they have conducted themselves throughout the course of their investigation. It is this type of irresponsible behavior from unaccountable State bureaucrats that are driving many of the State’s best businesses out of California.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Story time!I grew up in eastern Europe in the communist era, in a country where entire factories were run using Commodore 64 computers that were smuggled in, bypassing export controls and sanctions.The programmer at one such factory was a friend of my father, and we&#39;d go over to his place for dinner semi-regularly. He didn&#39;t have kids, and I was six, so I was bored to tears. No toys and nobody my age to play with!He did have a C64, which was the only other one in town apart from the one at the factory. He was using it to practice programming after-hours at home. There were no games on it, but he did have a book of games.As in: a literal printed book of the source code for several simple games. That you were supposed to type in to be able to play!So I did. I had nothing else to do, so I whiled away the hours while the adults chatted poking away at the keyboard, typing in the BASIC code of the shortest, simplest game first.It didn&#39;t work at first. There were some errors. With help, I fixed the typos, and hey presto, the game worked! I still remember the elation, the feeling of accomplishment after all that work. I didn&#39;t even play the game for more than a minute or so, I immediately got to work on entering the next, longer game&#39;s code. I was hooked.Eventually I tried all three or four of the games in the book, and got bored. However, I was allowed to borrow the BASIC introductory problem set book, which I took back home with me to study. I solved the problems one at a time on grid paper (to match the fixed-width screen layout). I &#34;ran&#34; the programs in my head, debugged them by working out the variable values step by step on paper, and then tested my solutions on the real C64 computer whenever my parents went over for a social dinner. Most of my programs worked, and ran at ludicrous speed compared to the glacial pen &amp; paper solutions I had worked out. I instantly understood that Computers were levers for the mind. Learning to control that raw power was intoxicating.We fled across the iron curtain as political refugees, and I took that textbook with me. I had no access to computers for nearly a year, but when we finally got settled permanently in the West my dad bought a used C64 at a garage sale for a few dollars. This was a computer that back in my homeland would be the carefully guarded control hub of a factory. Here it was a discarded plaything. Even at that age, that blew my mind.I learned more programming languages in quick succession. Pascal at the age of 11, C and Assembly at 12, C++ at 13. I had written 3D engines by the time I went to University.Statistically, if you know programming, you probably learned it in a tertiary education setting, most likely in your late teens or early twenties. Just like learning a foreign language at that age, you&#39;ll never be perfectly fluent. You&#39;ll always have an accent, no matter what you do.To me, programming is my mother tongue. I&#39;m perfectly fluent and unaccented. You probably can&#39;t even tell, you can&#39;t hear the difference.Programming for you is something you do at work.I&#39;ve had dreams in C++"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The creator of this site made a really interesting video about the gravity fields in Super Mario Galaxy: https://youtu.be/QLH_0T_xv3IAmong other things I was surprised to learn that Mario&#39;s collision shape is a sphere rather than the more standard cylinder or capsule shape used for the player character in most games, which simplifies the physics when gravity changes direction. When you look at his character model the proportions make more sense once you know that they were designed to fill out a spherical shape. How many companies would change the character design of their most iconic franchise to make their physics engine simpler?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome!  Might I recommend adding Dark Forces II: Jedi Knight?  There&#39;s already an open source renderer available (https://github.com/stephanreiter/jkview) and you can see it, here, for example: https://www.massassi.net/levels/files/323.shtml (under the screenshots, see the 3d preview).  It&#39;s got blurred textures on purpose (afraid of copyright issues), but it can render the original textures as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be great if someone wrote a book about open world video games. Or just video game worlds in general. Perhaps 100 games, three pages of pics and two pages of commentary for each one. Feels like someone should document all these virtual worlds since  most people only have time to experience a few. Maybe it would work better as a wiki, or could start as such."</p>
