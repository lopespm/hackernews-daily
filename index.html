								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s the note from Yvon https://www.patagonia.com/ownership/One of the most interesting parts of this is the choice to make Holdfast a C4.  They really wanted to make this a political organization, and were willing to forgo a staggering amount of tax savings - in fact, $17m in tax donating away a $3b asset.  Probably the least effective estate planning from a raw $ perspective in history.Major props to the family for doing this - this is now the definition of &#34;putting your money where your mouth is&#34;, and I hope this model is a success and serves as a template for others to follow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; they really embody this notion that every billionaire is a policy failure.If only more people realised this. Instead we do the opposite and worship the system which make them happen.Very inspiring overall. I&#39;ve always heard good things about the company but never knew of the founder. There&#39;s something about seeing one carry such dignified ideals throughout their life, without wavering to societal expectations, that is so admirable."</p>

Seriously, stop issuing cards without chips and send new card readers to theses businesses. End of story.Is it because US businesses use deeply embedded card readers in custom POS machines that aren&#39;t modular?Everywhere I go in South America and Europe, businesses have portable readers. The card companies just sent them new readers and they were accepting chips overnight. Same when NFC was introduced.The US payment and banking systems are truly maddening."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had the opportunity to design my own set of wheels with a friend for my Mustang GT. I put a thread together with photos of the process from start to finish, it was a lot of fun. I don&#39;t have the Mustang anymore, but the wheels are stacked in my garage awaiting a future project. https://www.mustang6g.com/forums/threads/arcane-stellar-–-a-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One day, I believe car design regulations will be amended to allow fully electric braking (ie. no hydraulics, drums, rotors, or pads).   At that point, the motor can be moved into the wheel (unsprung mass = bad, but weight savings from not needing an axle or gearbox will outweigh this).  Suspension and steering design is then far easier, because there is no axle to need to keep straight.Braking redundancy will be achieved by having motors/brakes on all four wheels, and within each motor 3 independant phase coils with independant controllers, such that there are effectively 12 brakes on a car.   Normally the controllers work together for smooth braking, traction control, software differential, etc.  But even after 3+ failures braking performance should still be satisfactory for an emergency stop.Obviously braking energy needs to go somewhere.  In the happy case, it&#39;s regen&#39;ed into a battery.  If the battery can&#39;t accept it, it gets dumped into dump resistors.  If the dump resistors fail, it gets dumped into motor coils (of which there are 12 remember).  Obviously the motor coils will heat up very fast, so this is probably a one-use-only failsafe, like airbags.So the whole system (except the pedal itself) is 12 way redundant."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; When crashes do occur an engineer needs to spend time to diagnose how it happened and what caused it. Since Pingora&#39;s inception we’ve served a few hundred trillion requests and have yet to crash due to our service code.&gt; In fact, Pingora crashes are so rare we usually find unrelated issues when we do encounter one. Recently we discovered a kernel bug soon after our service started crashing. We&#39;ve also discovered hardware issues on a few machines, in the past ruling out rare memory bugs caused by our software even after significant debugging was nearly impossible.That&#39;s quite the endorsement of Rust. A lot of people focus on the fact that Rust can&#39;t absolutely guarantee freedom from crashes and memory safety issues. Which I think misses the point that this kind of experience of running high traffic Rust services in production for months almost without a single issue is common in practice."</p>

Your identity from identity thieves.. Your location from burglars, your car keys from car thieves or your blood type from rich mobsters with kidney problems..we don&#39;t know who are any of these things.

After downloading a QR reader app, taking a picture with my phone, uploading the picture to the app, then realizing there was too much glare and trying again, they eventually just gave me a beer and put a tally mark on a notepad.Just a few weeks ago I used a QR code to join a WiFi network and it took like 2 seconds (it found the network and entered the password for me).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Atari in 1983 went from the leader in video game production to completely imploding. In 1979, four of their best programmers left after demanding equity in the sales and were refused. Their CEO Ray Kassar famously said, &#34;You’re no more important to those projects than the person on the assembly line who put them together. You’re a dime a dozen. You’re not unique. Anybody can do ­a ­cartridge.&#34;. They left and formed Activision which led to a sequence of failures by Atari until they finally died unable to compete with the likes of Intellivision, Colecovision, and Commodore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for a company big enough to be in the HN headlines (sorry, have to stay somewhat anonymous) where development virtually stalled for a couple years after a mass exodus event. The CEO went on a rampage and fired some people on the spot for something they weren’t even responsible for, which destroyed the already fragile morale and created a steady exodus of good talent over a couple of years.It didn’t kill the company for several reasons, but primarily because:1) The company had enough momentum, revenue, and cash in the bank that they could go on hiring sprees to replace everyone. The new hires had a lot of churn when they realized what was going on, so they just kept hiring until enough replacements stuck around.2) Many of the employees who didn’t quit saw this as their opportunity to rise through the ranks and fill the voids. They weren’t wrong and it paid off for many of them in the form of rapid promotions and advancement. The CEO became more hands-off as he realized his micromanagement wasn’t helping, so they basically inherited a slightly better situation.After this experience, I don’t really see a developer exodus killing any big company with good momentum and decent cash reserves. As long as a company has cash flow they can spend their way into hiring replacements as long as it takes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being a senior engineer is weird when looking retrospectively. I remember being a junior and experiencing what the author is talking about with respect to puzzlingly staring at my seniors when they could answer obscure questions.Now I do it and do the same things they did with me: facilitate my thought and troubleshooting process rather than give me answers. I think the people that are successful in Senior+ engineering are that way because of certain technical and character traits they&#39;ve developed.One is a willingness to be right in the long run. When I was a young engineer I would make my cases hard with data. As a senior engineer I sit back and let the machine mull for a while because I know that&#39;s what the engineering machine will do regardless of how technically right I may be. Another is knowing that right isn&#39;t always right. Sometimes the right answer is technically wrong, or the learnings of wrong need to be made before we collectively can be right. Another is a lot of patience; patience for myself, patience for others. I recently admitted I was behind on work because my power was out for three straight days. Young me would&#39;ve found a coffee shop and worked those days with a single monitor down to the bone. Senior me took my dog to the park.Not everyone makes it to senior, had I not forked my path in certain places I don&#39;t think I would have. My advice, relish your time as non-senior and ask lots of non-technical questions. The technical stuff comes over time and by necessity."</p>

He ended up feeling stupid, but I was trying to be encouraging because his code was pretty good aside from some missing punctuation, which will come with practice. He ended up switching majors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Where I am often hung up in comparison is due to age. I dropped out of college and spent my early 20s learning agriculture and construction. Now I work in software engineering and my current manager is younger than me. Not only is he younger than me, but he&#39;s been able to climb up to an engineering manager in a shorter amount of time than I&#39;ve been working as a SWE. So I feel really lame - wasted so much time early in my life and still seem to be wasting time."</p>
