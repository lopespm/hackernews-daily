								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Along with this, vertical scaling is severely underrated. You can do a lot and possibly everything ever for your company with vertical scaling. It would apply to 99% of the companies or even more.Edit:
Since people are confused, here is how StackOverflow handles of all of its web operations. If SO can run with this, so can your 0.33 req/minute app which is mostly doomed for failure. I am only half joking.StackOverflow architecture, current load (it will surprise you): https://stackexchange.com/performanceEverytime you go to SO, it hits one of these 9 web servers and all data on SO sits on those 2 massive SQL servers. That&#39;s pretty amazing.I want to be clear though, Horizontal scaling has a place in companies that has a team of corporate lawyers. Big. And in many many other scenarios for ETL and backend microservices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is not lying. I&#39;ve been learning docker and it is certainly nice to pull and docker-compose up for local dev, but there is a lot to learn when you factor in orchestrators. And when I mean learn, I mean actually learning the nuts and bolts of a Dockerfile and not copy/pasting shit from the internet. While it&#39;s all helpful, its certainly not needed for the project we have at work, nor the &#34;microservices&#34; that our lead thinks we need even though they aren&#39;t even microservices. All we&#39;ve done is split our application into seperate mini applications that don&#39;t talk to eachother at all, essentially 4 web services. Great! Sigh.So why am I learning all this instead of just programming? Programming is what I really want to do all day, just writing code and thinking through software architecture. Because the industry tells me if I don&#39;t learn this stuff I will be decommissioned. Fun stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s super simple and it works for you - yeay! great!
If it will continue to work for you - double yeay!However, as soon as I read, I saw a lot of red flags:- Do you really want to copy from a development computer to your production?  No staging at all? (&#34;go test&#34; doesn&#39;t mean that you have 0 bugs)- Are you really sure that everything works exactly the same on different versions of GoLang? (Hey, a new guy in your company just installed unreleased Go 1.17, build on his notebook and pushed to production)?- That VM with systemd died at 1am. No customers for you until 7am (when you wake up)BTW. I am not saying that you should do Docker or CICD. The thing which I am saying that when you cut out from your process too much, you are increasing risks. (As an example, you didn&#39;t remove unit tests part. Based on &#34;Anything that doesn’t directly serve that goal is a complication&#34; you probably should have. However, you decided that it would be way too much risk)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t speak to the 4700u or the pangolin specifically, but I can offer this perspective on PopOS/AMD:I&#39;ve been using System76&#39;s PopOS with my Asus Zephyrus G14 (4800hs) as a daily driver and I really like it. (freelance/web)The battery life is comparable to Windows (on integrated graphics mode, it has graphics switching available)at 7-10 hours with 70% brightness and balanced power settings using VScode and firefox.The g14 has a 75wh battery vs the pangolin&#39;s 49wh, so I would expect less battery life from the pangolin despite the 4700u having a lower default tdp, since the 4800hs likes to sit at around 6-10 watts when doing non-intensive tasks anyway.In 2021 I&#39;m not missing any major programs. It&#39;s pretty incredible how much is cross-platform now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll give System76 (and their hardware partner) this: They&#39;re getting closer to something I&#39;d buy.This looks like a good option for a 15.6&#34; laptop.My issue with it is that they&#39;re still shipping with those barrel plugs AC adapters, and don&#39;t appear to support USB-PD for charging on the USB-C ports.The lack of Australian support also makes it a difficult purchase - a former colleague bought a System76 laptop a few years back and it died a few months after purchase. Having to ship it back to the US, and the associated delays means having to buy a second laptop to continue working while it&#39;s being repaired."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fluoroquinolone antibiotics like cipro, levaquin, (and generally anything ending in -ofloxacin), can cause permanent nerve damage and one of the presentations is demyelination of the nerves. [1][2][3]Permanent nerve damage (neuropathy, pins and needles, tingling, muscle weakness, spasms, muscle twitches, heart palpitations) is a known side effect. There&#39;s been no attempt made to study if there&#39;s any long term delayed brain effects from fluoroquinolones. &#34;Brain fog&#34; is a commonly reported symptom of those who experience fluoroquinolone side effects. I hope there will be more studies on long term brain health from these drugs, as they&#39;re given out liberally.[1] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6006604/[2] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7667412/[3] https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10832955/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As much as I like Apple products, it looks like the privacy buck stops at China.The western world needs to desperately work on making their supply chains independent of the CCP, lest they&#39;d like their supply chains to be poisoned at some point in the future.I&#39;m a big fan of Purism and everything that they are doing. I hope their software and hardware matures with the same level of polish we&#39;ve come to know and expect from Apple products, and will be an early investor if they ever decide to IPO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Technically, what&#39;s going on here?&#34;CAID&#34; isn&#39;t a public iOS technology, and the article doesn&#39;t say what it means.Some googling returns: https://mmachina.cn/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/MMA%E4%B8%AD%...Apparently it means &#34;CAA Advertising Id&#34;, where &#34;CAA&#34; appears to be the &#34;Creative Artists Agency&#34;, some sort of Chinese advertising group. (edit: wrong organization, it&#39;s actually &#34;Chinese Anonymization ID&#34;, not a group.  the group behind it is https://trackingio.com/)Searching &#34;CAA Advertising Id&#34; yields more Chinese PDFs.From what I can tell here, &#34;CAID&#34; is a partnership between Chinese industry and Chinese government to track users across apps for better tracking.The issue here does not seem to be that they&#39;ve bypassed a technical restriction, but that the developers of major apps are using a shared identifier that Apple doesn&#39;t like.In the US, the analogy would be if apps had tracking SDKs in them, that fingerprinted users across apps, in order to better target them for advertisements, and then the US government can pick up that data and do whatever they&#39;d like with it.The strange part to me, is that this actually is the situation today in the US.I don&#39;t want to shill for China, but why is this a story?  This has been a US industry since at least Doubleclick was invented.edit:It&#39;s a story because they&#39;re using the iOS keychain API to persist and share the tracking identifier.  As far as I know, this is a new technique in the wild, but has been theoretically possible since iOS launched.  It&#39;s only now being seen as necessary because of the iOS14 privacy changes.It&#39;s curious that American ad companies seem to understand Apple&#39;s intent and are opting not to risk their business by expanding their SDKs to use keychain sharing techniques, even though they&#39;re surely aware you can do this.  Chinese ad companies seem ok with risking their clients apps being banned on the app store.Apple can mitigate this by giving users control of the data and sharing related to keychain services."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s additionally concerning that the US has little exposure to China-sourced data. This imbalance where the CCP knows far more about the average American than the US knows about the average Chinese person is deeply concerning. The more that is known, the larger the training data set, the more people can be influenced in ways that suit an openly hostile[0] government.[0] https://www.state.gov/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/20-02832-El..."</p>

This was a quantum leap beyond Mapquest&#39;s page reload and reset with cumbersome arrow buttons.  This was a paradigm shift that let me explore a geography better than any book atlas.  I gave away all my atlases+ MS Window Media Player&#39;s ability to cleanly accelerate playback to 2x,3x,4x of audiobooks and tutorial videos for slow speakers.  MS Windows 7 had this long before Youtube&#39;s player had a 2x playback option.+ SQLite library : more than 10x improvement since I came from old school of writing custom formats for persisting data.  No more dumping memory structs to disk or writing b-trees in C Language from scratch.+ C++ STL in late 1990s.  Instantly reduced need to write custom data structures like linked-lists or in-house string libraries for common tasks+ VMware in 2000s : more than 10x productivity enhancement because I can play with malware in a virtual software sandbox instead of tediously re-imaging harddrives of air-gapped real physical machines+ Google Chrome in 2008 : 10x quality-of-life since misbehaving websites crashing don&#39;t bring down all the other tabs in my browsing session like Firefox/Opera.I probably have more than a hundred examples.  Some software tech 10x improvements are more diffused.  Reddit+HN websites are a much better use of my time than USENET newsgroups.  Youtube with recordings of tech conference presentations I can watch at 2x+ is a better used of my time than physically traveling to the site."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Firebug.Every developer from around 2006-2008 knows what I&#39;m talking about. Debugging JS in IE6 was like trying to build a house blindfolded with both arms tied behind your back. Firebug is when JS went from just a web augmentation toy that could silently fail and your web page would still mostly function to becoming a critical function for a web page (many will see this as all a big mistake)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here are a few that I did not see listed by others:1. Automatic device discovery and driver installation (e.g., with USB devices (also USB device categories, etc.)). Instead of trying to find a driver, things just worked.2. Automatic updates.  Keeping everything updated, largely, fell into the background.3. Graphical integrated development environments (IDEs) for software development.  I realize editors can be contentious, but tab completion of variable names, automatic identification of methods within scope, syntax highlighting, easily dropping breakpoints, etc. are, in my experience, wonderful improvements on productivity.4. What you see is what you get (WYSIWYG) text / image editors.  Thankfully, I did not spend much time in the prior era, but it was, at times, maddening to get something to format correctly.5. Ad blockers / reader modes. Again, I know these can be contentious, but, for me, these reformatting services are sometimes the only way to make some websites practically readable.I strongly second:-The rise of memory-managed languages (e.g., JAVA, C#, etc) with pretty robust default library sets, especially for string manipulation, graphics, and network operations.-Moving map software, especially for mobile GPS mapping.-Spreadsheet software.-Being able to easily search for answers to fairly technical programming problems, compiler errors, etc. along with better access to online documentation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A company that purchases data from another search engine (that most likely also uses aggregated personal data to deliver results) with just two products (search + browser) compares its app data usage to a behemoth that strives for the most personalized experience possible in exchange for personal data in order to display personalized ads.Google&#39;s apps offer opt-in voice search (solving Audio), optional end to end encryption for bookmarks &amp; search history (solving Browsing History), while location and diagnostics are opt in as well and it&#39;s also up to you if you want to store your address book of store you credit card with Google (solving Contacts &amp; Financial Info).Yes, most people will probably use Google Contacts, Maps, unencrypted bookmarks &amp; browsing history and and store their credit card data in the browser, but you&#39;re not forced to do that.I really wish DDG would innovate on search, improve their own crawlers &amp; indexing and then attack Google head on by comparing better results with the ad-ridden, SEO-flooded shit show that Google results have become. Instead, their marketing keeps on comparing apples to oranges and just keeps on playing the privacy angle, which is intellectually dishonest because DDG and Google have completely different goals.Boy do I hope for some real competition in the search engine market.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess the majority of people on HN already know this more or less. The problem is still this: We still don&#39;t have good alternatives to Google&#39;s products and services.1) Android: Google still owns all our phones. Even on rooted phones it hard to remove google services that god know send so many requests containing whatnot to the eeee addresses. Just install no-root firewall and you will be amazed the amount of pending requests that accumulate in 1 hour.2) Google search: I guess I can manage with DDG but when it&#39;s not that straight forward search, subconciosuly I&#39;m still thinking that let&#39;s just do a quick google search to see if i&#39;m not missing anything. And often I find better results. While adblocks makes sure I filter most of the crap.3) Gmail: Yes there are alternatives but switching emails is hard. It&#39;s a big commitment for most people to switch a 10 year old gmail address. And it still works great at filtering spam and whatnot.And same for maps, youtube and all their services.They really have a big leverage on everyone.Quiting facebook and instagram was child&#39;s play in comparison. I haven&#39;t logged in for almost an year now. Quitting google is really hard otoh."</p>

- Financial data: you must enter it manually and click &#34;save for future use&#34;.Could it be better? Sure! But I think DDG is exaggerating here. We&#39;re not _that_ bad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this is great news, and I hope other states will follow. But it&#39;s a bit troublesome that it took a wealthy executive to get this anywhere politically, even after years of safe-use research and its prevalence as medical treatments:&gt; David Bronner, the top executive at Dr. Bronner’s soap company, helped bankroll the campaign, which had to overcome pandemic restrictions to gather signatures and get on the ballot last fall."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I support the move but the headline is kind of misleading. The ballot initiative was limited to directing the police chief to make these crimes the &#34;lowest priority&#34; but they are still just as illegal as before and carry the same penalties. I&#39;m not even sure this directive is binding. As the mayor (who did not particularly support the measure) pointed out, it&#39;s not like this was a high priority to begin with.A proper decriminalization or perhaps even legalization would have passed, but DC citizens lack the same rights over their own local laws that any other American living in a state would enjoy. DC deserves statehood."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We do forget that medicine is a 20th century science. Even for most of the 1900s, doctors were performing wholly unscientific and unethical things.They still barely know anything. Medical science with proper epistemology is young, perhaps younger than the advent of modern computer science.So there&#39;s lots of stuff that&#39;s just grandfathered. And because very little modern medicine has the ambition to try real novelty, we never retest the grandfathered taboos."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that always seems to be missing from these videos (in general, because there are many of them) is step 0: how do you go about acquiring the land and the permission to build a log cabin on this land? I can&#39;t imagine that there&#39;s many countries in the world where there is no build code or other legislation regarding how or where buildings can be built. The last thing I&#39;d want to do is spend an entire year building something that I would then be legally obliged to tear down.If you&#39;re felling a large amount of trees in a forest, at the bare minimum you need the blessing of the land owner (if that isn&#39;t you). Most likely, you&#39;ll also need in addition to this a permit to fell trees to begin with, because land owners in most countries aren&#39;t free to simply fell any amount of trees they wish just because they own the land.It&#39;s obviously an impressive feat to build a log cabin from scratch, but since this step is so often completely omitted, I have to ask myself whether this is because it&#39;s considered too boring, or because there are people out there who think that as long as you go far enough into the woods, you can do whatever you want because no one will notice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A great excuse to drop a link to this legend:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_ProennekeRichard Louis Proenneke (/ˈprɛnəkiː/; May 4, 1916 – April 20, 2003) was an American self-educated naturalist, conservationist, writer, and wildlife photographer who, from the age of about 53, lived alone for nearly thirty years (1969–1999) in the mountains of Alaska in a log cabin that he constructed by hand near the shore of Twin Lakes. Proenneke hunted, fished, raised and gathered his own food, and also had supplies flown in occasionally. He documented his activities in journals and on film, and also recorded valuable meteorological and natural data.[1][2] The journals and film were later used by others to write books and produce documentaries about his time in the wilderness."</p>
