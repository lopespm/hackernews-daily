Chrome made the same change a while back:https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2020/07/referrer-p...So if this breaks something people probably already noticed. And Mozilla is merely aligning with the browser with the largest market share on this.

Sad to watch it dying, however beneficial and understandable it is.I feel it didn&#39;t have to be this way: maybe if GET wasn&#39;t so widely misused recently and generally everybody knew what to not put in URL and acted accordingly, we could have preserved such nice things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great article explaining why a lab leak should always be a suspect. The alternative theory is that a virus traveled on its own (via bats or other animals) from bat caves 900km away to Wuhan where there are 2 labs researching bats. One of the labs is lesser known but is right next to the seafood market and the hospital where the outbreak was first known. [1]This article points out that a lab outbreak could have happened in the United States and many places in the world. We need to avoid demonizing China over this if we want to ever find out the truth and learn how to prevent another pandemic outbreak.[1] https://web.archive.org/web/20200214144447/https://www.resea..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My understanding of the author&#39;s central thesis is this: the US, despite its world-class virology and disease study labs, regularly has lapses in procedure that regularly lead to situations in which the public might be exposed. Given that this is happening in our own backyard, we might reasonably expect countries of similar status (like China) to experience similar lapses.That reads as reasonable to me, but raises a subsequent question: if these lapses are so common and so many countries possess the capacity for serious mistakes, why don&#39;t we see more regular outbreaks (if not full-blown pandemics) caused by labs? In other words, what makes COVID special? I didn&#39;t find a satisfactory answer to the latter question in the article.It&#39;s my (uninformed, uneducated) opinion that the severity of the author&#39;s claims don&#39;t correspond to the reality of the last few national and international disease crises (AIDS, Ebola, Zika, COVID). Which isn&#39;t to say that we should absolutely dismiss the possibility that COVID originated in a lab, only that claims that it did amount to currently unsubstantiated claims about COVID&#39;s special status among other recent pandemics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Peter Daszak, member of the WHO Covid origins team, was also the project lead for the US funded gain of function research of novel coronaviruses that was going on at the Wuhan BSL4 lab.There is historical precedent of authorities blaming local meat markets to cover up a lab leak.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sverdlovsk_anthrax_leak"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it is strange that, on the one hand, the tech world has been advocating for the rights of neurodivergent people – society should accept that people on the autism spectrum are different and that’s OK. But at the same time RMS has been attacked for some statements very probably stemming from his autism that, while they may seem a bit shocking and at odds with the mainstream, were not illegal or intentionally offensive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those who do not know RMS personally: &#34;I worked for RMS longer than any other programmer. ... This was an own-goal for RMS. He has had plenty of opportunities to learn how to stfu when that’s necessary. ... I can confirm the unfortunate reality that RMS’s behavior was a concern [in the 1990s], and that [Marvin Minsky&#39;s] protection was itself part of the problem. He was never held to account; he was himself coddled in his own lower-grade misbehavior and mistreatment of women. He made the place uncomfortable for a lot of people, and especially women. ...  RMS’s mere presence on the scene in this way has served to make it harder to deal with other cases of bad leaders’ bad behavior. It is time for the free software community to leave adolescence and move to adulthood, and this requires leaving childish tantrums, abusive language, and toxic environments behind.&#34; — Thomas Bushnell https://medium.com/@thomas.bushnell/a-reflection-on-the-depa..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Richard says he&#39;s not autistic. People who try to conflate his bad behaviour and autism are excusing his behaviour and unfairly generalising about autistic people.Richard is argumentative about his bad behaviour. He&#39;s not oblivious. Plenty of people have spoken to him about it. You&#39;d think he might take a hint after being removed from his own organisation and all the surrounding commentary. He doesn&#39;t care.(Separately, &#34;techrights&#34; is run by an obsessive troll who harasses people in the FLOSS community.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of the trip I took to Iceland in 2010. Just on the day we were about to fly back home we were instructed to turn on the Hotel TV, which was showing very eerie video footage of Eyjafjallajökull erupting. The stark emergency chyron combined with the vague video footage gave us a very unsettled feeling.Then we walked into the lobby where some 80s pop was playing, the staff was cheery and asked what we&#39;d like to have for breakfast because we&#39;d probably fly home a few hours delayed. I guess you become unflappable when you literally live on top of volcanoes :)On the Iceland Air flight home we watched a very interesting documentary about the Eldfell eruptions in 1973. It&#39;s really fascinating, although I can&#39;t seem to find a link to the docu. See also: https://www.theatlantic.com/photo/2017/01/the-eldfell-erupti..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ruby was one of the languages I &#34;cut my teeth&#34; with to some extent, and I&#39;ve always loved it&#39;s syntax and guiding philosophies, but was pulled away to PHP for my job, and ended up using other things for side projects.So a project that compiles to native code but uses Ruby-like syntax is very much &#34;what I would build if I committed to building a language&#34;. But I&#39;ve kept pushing off learning it on the notion that I could always justify learning other things that were &#34;version 1&#34; and &#34;production ready (whatever that means)&#34;.I&#39;m thinking now is the time to jump in and try this out finally.Any real world users care to explain some domains that either are or are not well suited for this at the moment? Any &#34;gotchas&#34; with writing C-bindings, should I need to? Or is the library ecosystem fairly strong?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I actually don&#39;t see any issue that isn&#39;t simply a matter of money.Everything they list that&#39;s an issue seems to revolve around the fact that the employees with domain knowledge for the system have left the company.Reach out to them and hire them on as contractors.  If they left under bad terms because the business was a bunch of dicks, expect to pay 10x market rate.  If this is truly &#34;fix this or the business is out of business&#34; - then it shouldn&#39;t be a tough decision to make."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How people handle this level of disaster is always very revealing. In every case I&#39;ve ever experienced someone kept their head and a solution was found. Usually there was reputational damage but surprisingly most times the actual business bounced back. But it was always the actions of someone in particular in those first hours that made the difference.Thinking you&#39;re fucked is unhelpful, because you start talking about resumes and expecting some deus ex machina to appear and resolve the situation (for good or ill)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These kind of posts are awesome tabletop scenarios. (and fuel for https://twitter.com/badthingsdaily ) Coming up with potential fixes is a good exercise.Things I would do that I haven&#39;t seen mentioned yet:- Grab images from the relevant servers to have current backups before messing with anything.- Try tcpdump-ing and decoding the custom KV protocol - other databases are complicated, but things like memcached/redis/... have trivial wire protocol. Maybe it&#39;s possible to recover some data by listing all entries.- Run `strings` on the KV binary or `file` on the data to make sure it&#39;s not just some open source project with a proprietary interface. With any luck it&#39;s just something like bdb that can be accessed externally.- Hook up a debugger to the KV and try to recover the keys (or maybe just strace to see if they keys are in any files)- Start tcpdump on the old DNS IPs. They mentioned they have no idea which domains they own anymore - as long as NS on customer domains wasn&#39;t trashed as well, they could collect queries coming in and recover a list from there.- See if the customer domains can be collected from billing data / some email store of notifications.(as much as I try to design for no disasters in production, the rush of &#34;this is so FUBAR, what insane thing I can do to fix it&#34; for me is an amazing feeling :) )"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many of these WiFi-LED lamps contain esp8266 devices, which have a lot of open source alternative firmware available, like esphome[0] or tasmota[1]. You can reflash them by opening them &amp; connecting a cheap (1$) usb-to-tty adapter.If that isn&#39;t an option (for reasons like not wanting to permanently damage them or being afraid of electrical shocks) a lot of them come with tuya firmware, which you can (still) often exploit and convert with TUYA-CONVERT [2].I found the Tasmota Device Templates Repository[3] to be a really valuable resource, although I&#39;ve been using zigbee devices for lightbulbs.[0]https://esphome.io/[1]https://github.com/arendst/Tasmota[2]https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert[3]https://templates.blakadder.com/index.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I&#39;m missing a few major points. I wonder if someone here might be able to clarify.1. The real meat of this &#34;pwning&#34; was (it seems) a google search to identify the WEB API endpoint. Then it turns out that sending POST requests to this endpoint can turn the light on/off, change its temperature, and change its brightness.2. In order to turn a light on/off using the &#34;found&#34; api, it is first necessary to connect to the lamp&#39;s network. So if I were doing this on my own linux machine, which cannot as far as I can tell connect to multiple wireless networks at the same time, my script to change the settings on the light would include disconnecting from my true wifi network, connecting to the lamp&#39;s network, sending the signal to the lamp, disconnecting from the lamp, and then reconnecting to my own network. Is that right? Is this what the bash scripts and apps mentioned in the post are doing?3. If I lived in the apartment above the OP&#39;s (say), and I were malicious, I could even now also access the lamps&#39; networks and, say, set their values to be whatever I wanted.  And there is simply no way of stopping this (S in IoT, after all)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I haven&#39;t seen mention much with these &#34;smart&#34; devices is how inconvenient lack of physical buttons is. Instead of just reaching over and adjust the volume/brightness whatever, I now have to unlock the phone, find the app and do some gestures to achieve same results, all of which now requires some mental bandwidth for these banal tasks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had to quit reading any FIRE (financial independence, early retirement) blogs because they were full of people headed down this same path: Extreme frugality, bare minimum savings, assuming their lifestyle would never change and nothing would ever go wrong.Retiring at 30 sounds great, but no one&#39;s life goes exactly to plan for next the 30-40 years until traditional retirement age. People change, expectations evolve, possessions wear out and need to be replaced. Living frugally may be fun when you&#39;re in your 20s, but it&#39;s not so fun when as you get older and your friends want to do things that require money (vacations, hobbies, dining out). Even worse when your romantic partner has different goals in life, as happened here.Many of the leanFIRE stories have their roots in people who hate their jobs so much that the only thing that motivates them is early retirement. They grind through the job the hate, counting days on their leanFIRE countdown until they can quit working and never look back.Most of these people would be much happier if they simply invested time and energy into finding a job they enjoy, or at least one that doesn&#39;t make them miserable. Even if it requires a pay cut and a later retirement date, it&#39;s much better to spend your time doing something you don&#39;t hate than it is to grind out a bad job in misery just to reach dreams of early retirement sooner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my early twenties, I had a business mostly on autopilot that let me work maybe an hour a day. I mostly spent my time writing poetry, hiking, making friends, etc. It was great. It was not sustainable, but it was perfect for a twenty something exploring the joys and freedoms of youth.Now, I work much harder, have kids, and responsibilities. That being said, I know the work I do is meaningful, and serves many people. We have significant savings. Though living in a big city means we can&#39;t retire early. That&#39;s beside the point though: I motivate myself to work because it is meaningful. The same with kids: I don&#39;t do things because I enjoy them, I do them in the service of my kids and my family.  Reading the story in the OP, I get the sense that the OP hasn&#39;t made that transition to thinking about work in terms of serving others. A happy life is not a life of retirement, its a life of meaning. What was meaningful once (aiming for retirement), loses its meaning once it has been attained. You have to keep moving forward. This is not about &#34;Keeping Up,&#34; but about stepping outside of oneself, and learning to put others ahead, even if it requires personal suffering. (Something parents of young children know very well.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a really refreshing and honest take on early retirement, especially among the FI blogosphere.&gt; I looked at other FI bloggers who quit work and retired.  They all appeared to be blissful. Stoic.  Confident and without reservations.  Since I ran into problems myself, I started to feel like I was defective.  Like something was wrong with me and that’s why it didn’t work so well.  Maybe it has to do with my personality (a nerdy introvert).  Or it could be because I’m not trying to sell product and make money off of my choices, like almost everyone else who blogs about FI seems to.There always seemed like a potentially strange conflict of interest with many of the FI bloggers who are ostensibly &#34;retired early&#34;, but still earn a significant amount of money from their FI blogs. Which isn&#39;t to say they shouldn&#39;t be earning that money, but it does bring up questions about some of the conclusions that they make. (There&#39;s also a bit of a groupthink or even cult-like mentality among some of them, particularly in the MMM sphere.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A different take: Microsoft, Oracle, et. al. waged a war against OSS in the 90s. They went as far as using mental illness as a weapon against the community (equating participation in the commons as an equivalent to mental illness).It’s not a coincidence the class of human that weathered the storm looks like Stallman, Linus, ESR, et. al. That’s what it took. The toxicity in these communities is a result of what was leftover. These humans grew up amongst OSS activists that also weathered the storm.They carried the flag when no one else would. Vilifying them now, at a time where Microsoft just purchased the two largest infrastructure/tooling providers for the commons (npm, GitHub) is concerning to me. Without them, the commons wouldn’t be what it is today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Sarah Mei then went through the board members involved one by one, digging into each of their histories, and tweeting what she viewed as fire-worthy infractions. The crimes included: “being super involved with Wikipedia,” retweeting a “hideous” New York Times editorial, and being friendly with famed democracy activist and law professor Lawrence Lessig. Publicly calling out each board member in turn with a clear implication: associate with a thought criminal and you too could be in jeopardy.Did she really do that? wow"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Luckily, another co-author on the book has spent a lot of time pondering inclusion, women’s rights, children’s rights, and free speech. Her name is Nadine Strossen and her credentials run deep. She served as the first female President of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), America’s largest and oldest civil liberties nonprofit, from 1991 to 2008. When she stepped down as President, three Supreme Court Justices participated in her farewell luncheon (Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Antonin Scalia, and David Souter). Strossen is a Professor Emeritus at New York Law School and currently an advisor to the EPIC (Electronic Privacy Information Center), FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights in Education), the ACLU, and Heterodox Academy. She is the author of the widely acclaimed books HATE: Why we should fight it with speech not censorship (2018) and Defending Pornography: Free Speech, Sex, and the Fight for Women’s Rights (1995). She has far too many awards, publications, and prominent appearances to name.A credential sheet of PC accolades long enough to whip a horse shouldn&#39;t be required to publicly disagree with the ideology of Google and ACLU without being fired."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google&#39;s zero-click answers are really good, especially if I search for a fact.While it&#39;s true that this is possibly killing sites by preventing traffic flow, it&#39;s one way to battle content padding for the sake of grabbing traffic.It might be an interesting move if Google were to pay a small fee to sites whose information was useful for a particular search, like those I chose to expand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google results have gotten dramatically worse over this last decade. Google now seems to fixate on the most common terms in my query and returns the most generic results for my geographic area. And, it seems like quotes and the old google-fu techniques are just ignored or are no longer functional.There are a whole host of factors behind this, but I&#39;m certain that the switch to Natural Language Processing / Semantic Search drove this decline."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many moons ago, I put a ton of work into a (now defunct) content site that provided specific information in a small vertical. Each post took hours, but I enjoyed writing the articles, and the revenue from the ads was enough to enjoy a little extra cash every month (we&#39;re talking just about enough to cover a car payment, for context).Google decided they liked a lot of the content and started providing it in their knowledge graph. It was initially great to be validated and the link to my content at the top of the search result was pretty cool to see. But it did tank traffic, as Google scraping my content and giving it away at the top of their search result page meant people didn&#39;t need to navigate to my site.Felt pretty terrible, if I&#39;m being honest, but I also have always subscribed to understanding the risks for relying on other networks for my own benefit.BUT!!!As a regular user of search engines, I love getting the answer super fast without necessarily having to guess what sort of ad-trap I&#39;ll have to navigate to get the answer I&#39;m looking for on some random content site.As a user, when I&#39;m asking some non-critical question, it&#39;s nice to just get a snappy answer. I appreciate it.The problem of course arises when content creators stop making the content for Google to scrape and index, what then?"</p>
