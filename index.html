								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; They thought they needed to build a machine learning model when they really needed to build an entirely new organization, one that possessed the technical and cultural mindset necessary to succeed in this space.I totally agree.  It&#39;s not impossible to imagine their model working: why couldn&#39;t you serve as a market-maker for homes at a large scale, especially with the unique insights Zillow could have based on their datasets.However I think where the hubris lay is in how they thought they could leapfrog all the way to an automated solution before building a competency as a house-flipping company.From what I understand, where they failed was partly in building a rich enough model to properly account for the less easily quantifiable elements which ultimately account for a property&#39;s value.  I.e. the price per square foot might make a property look like a steal, while something like a sewer main nearby, or problematic neighbor could radically change the value proposition to anyone standing at the site.  That&#39;s a non-trivial problem to solve for even the best ML and it&#39;s not clear how you would automate this.If you ask me, instead of focusing on building an automated price discovery system, they should have started by trying to build a quality home-flipping organization, and figuring out how to super-charge manual work using their datasets.  Over time you might find ways to optimize the process and increase the level of automation to scale output relative to head-count."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good riddance. If large-scale house flipping took off, we might actually end up in a scenario where housing was treated as a speculative asset, with empty houses getting flipped between investors looking to make a quick buck, further lowering the supply of actual places to live (because housing units remain empty while being flipped), driving up the cost for families who just want a place to live. Oh wait..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;data is fungible?&#34; i think the author does not understand what fungibility means. if something is fungible, that means that any unit of it is exactly the same as any other unit of it. fungible data would be random data, which wouldn&#39;t help you predict or model anything.i think zillow also did not understand what fungibility means. real estate is not fungible. in fact, it&#39;s anti-fungible- that&#39;s why there are huge diligence processes that exist around most real estate transactions. maybe floors in an office building may be fungible, but residences are definitely not- with all their quirks, customizations and problems.this whole argument that they failed because the ceo of zillow didn&#39;t have big balls is pretty putrid. pair this with the word salad of misused words and twisting of quotes and i&#39;d say this is probably one of the worst pieces i&#39;ve ever seen posted here. i feel worse for having given it any time at all.the simple fact is that the ceo of zillow didn&#39;t know what they were doing, had a team that (supposedly) applied facebook&#39;s infrastructure scaling prediction library to house prices and then attempted to apply a market making mindset to the real estate market at scale. not only is this probably something nobody should try to do, considering we contribute so much in tax dollars to first time homebuying incentives as it&#39;s recognized that the housing market is where j q public can start to build wealth, it&#39;s also probably something that nobody could do (well, at scale, with machines) given that housing is not fungible.sure, financial instruments are fungible, maybe even late model cars, but definitely not houses. doesn&#39;t take a scientist to spot that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One example of quality design which I gleaned from reading Don Norman&#39;s &#34;The Design Of Everyday Things&#34; is the metal plate I&#39;ve frequently seen on doors which are meant to be pushed.The only affordance of such a plate is its push-ability, and the fact that someone actively installed a metal plate (instead of just relying on the door&#39;s natural flatness), as well as its location at the point of maximum leverage (all the way to the right of the door, in the door&#39;s vertical center), is a clear signifier for such push-ability.Not only that, but it does its job without offering any other confusing affordances (such as a vertical handle which is also technically pushable, but which many would interpret as being meant to be pulled).Whenever I need a relatable, succinct example of affordances and signifiers for my engineering comrades, I turn to this one.  Anyone interested in design is doing themselves a dis-service by not reading Don Norman&#39;s classic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"BitTorrent is amazing. It just works. Anyone anywhere can create a torrent of their files, dump the magnet link somewhere, and everyone else can reliably retrieve it. It is self-reinforcing; the more people using a torrent, the better the robustness, redundancy and download speeds. You can often get better speeds from downloading something via torrent than from a web server. It&#39;s an open protocol that is relatively easy to implement, it has a diversity of lightweight clients for all OSes and is fairly resistant to censorship. To me it&#39;s pretty much perfect tech that solves a real problem. I hope Bram Cohen got rich off of it somehow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s amazing how much stuff breaks when GitHub goes down. I&#39;m doing some Rust coding right now, the rust-s3 crate tells me that to look up what feature I need to enable (tokio + rustls), I need to look into the Cargo.toml. Well, the repo won&#39;t load, and nor can I clone it. Well okay, fuck that I can use the default dependencies. But no wait I can&#39;t, I can&#39;t even do a cargo build because cargo uses a github repository as the source of truth for all crates. No more Rust for me today :("</p>

It sounds like level3 deprecated it, and everyone else removed it. To me (and most definitions I can find) deprecated basically means &#34;don&#39;t start using it, if you are using it stop using it, we will remove it soon but have not done so yet for compatibility reasons&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is factually incorrect when it talks about &#34;SEPA payments&#34;, claiming they are a &#34;pull&#34; mechanism. What it probably meant to talk about, is SEPA Direct Debits -- where the counterpart charges your account, as opposed to you paying the counterpart. Given that these direct debit agreements are revokable at any point in time, I doubt the claims of very high fraud rate.A normal SEPA payment, is a &#34;push&#34; affair. These have (for all intents and purposes, though not technically) been a thing ever since the euro was introduced, whereas SEPA Direct Debit is more recent, replacing many of the existing domestic direct debit schemes.Then there&#39;s the Instant Payments bit: these are a thing but they&#39;re not used all that often (yet?). Most banks charge a hefty fee for an instant payment (mine charges €1.25). Some banks don&#39;t offer them at all. Adoption will grow and costs will decrease over time.In most countries, payments within the same bank have been instant (and free) for a very long time. This is one of the reasons why many companies have accounts with multiple banks.I&#39;m sure some &#34;weaker&#34; european countries may have laxer fraud controls, but that&#39;s a temporary problem. ECB reporting is quite strict, and most banks do take fraud detection very seriously. Reputation is important for a bank, and if you&#39;re a truly disreputable bank you&#39;ll soon find yourself without friendly correspondent banks. Then you&#39;ll have a choice: fix your fraud problems, or become a useless island."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Odd not to touch on Open Banking and PSD2 in Europe; as that is basically the future he is talking about.In essence; financial institutions are legislated to add customer friendly UX and fraud prevention on top of standard bank to bank transfers. It&#39;s effectively a set of APIs that orchestrate it all, with things like dynamic linking to the payment and secure authentication rules for anti fraud.The idea is for commercial offerings to build on top of the standard APIs (for example, to offer bank transfers in checkouts). In practice it&#39;s taking a bit to get off the ground - but providers like Tink (sold to Visa for a lot of money) and Truelayer and starting to get traction.Australia and MENA region are heading down the same route.https://www.openbanking.org.uk/Edit; for clarity, SEPA was the early moves to normalise what the European banks were doing from around 2008 onwards - and ended up with PSD1 rationalising it. As others have said this blog mostly only actually focuses on the direct debit element of SEPA not the credit payment side."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When discussing Europe, you can&#39;t leave out the rise of mobile payments that work similar to India&#39;s UPI.For instance, in Sweden, &#34;Swish&#34;[0] has quickly taken over the market for casual payments, with free, instant, irreversible bank transfers between individuals using only the recipients phone number (or a QR code).They are a bunch of these systems, but currently they are all fractured into national systems, although work has started on adding interoperability[1][0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swish_(payment)[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Mobile_Payment_System..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m 42 and have stopped paying attention to titles and all the traditional organizational paradigms that are losing relevance.I feel like the ability to work from home in my sweats on simple problems as a senior engineer and receive a 75th percentile income relative to my neighbors in one of the best neighborhoods in my new home state is the most societal progress I will ever experience in my lifetime. I&#39;m a lifelong bachelor by choice. Why bother striving for anything career wise when I am on track to retire comfortably to focus on my mostly free hobbies no later than the age of 50? For a house with a 3rd bedroom I don&#39;t need?No, best to appreciate what I have and leave the striving for the next generation of engineers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The big tech companies (ie. FANG) all have huge demand for principal+ engineers and know how to scope and support them properly.  The size means they have lots of them which reduces the snowflake nature of the role and makes career development, salary support, etc… more standardized.  Since they are large, there can be some variance, but overall they are a good option if you are interested.  I don’t know where in EU you are, but most of FANG has roles in EU and some even do remote as well.Smaller companies tend to want principal engineers in theory, but as you are finding they can often struggle with how to utilize them properly.  Often you see them playing a Chief Architect role or something similar which is more hybrid with PM than pure tech.  So getting PM skills could help set you up for this direction as well.Finally, you have said you did management for a bit before, so you should know if this is an interesting path or not.  This is a very different role, so I would recommend you do this only if you have the passion and desire to do this full time.  Most principal engineers I know have done management for a bit and gained a lot of skills related to it, but ultimately wasn’t what they wanted to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I turned 40 recently and have gone the route of very flexible employment (~16 hrs per week remote) at Sr software engineer salary. This gives me the freedom to do basically anything I want for more than half the day with very low stress. For the past decade nobody at my several places of employment has had reason to know how few hours I work because I’m always the top performer.I’m intending now to build software outside of the day job until I’m bootstrapped into doing that full time. I feel this is a setup which absorbs risk while giving both future opportunity and a high quality of life in the meanwhile.I’m tempted at times to go for some super high paid position which I’m very qualified for, but it always comes back to a preference for near total freedom to live my life."</p>

I&#39;m guessing Zip is hoping most people are closer to the latter than the former.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"All these discussion about APR and napkin math and installment is missing the point a bit, in my opinion.My problem is not even that Edge collects unnecessary and allows what could be called a most intrusive third party add into its browser per se, I am mostly amazed by how incredibly tacky this looks and feels from Microsoft&#39;s side.Like, imagine buying a Lexus and discovering they are advertisements for a cheap off-brand energy drink plastered on the interior.I find it straight up incredible that Microsoft somewhat achieved to overcome the meme status of its browser after what, fifteen years, and now this? Passing on the the crown of being the lowest common denominator tech joke to someone else, gaining a little bit of market share and even one or two positive reviews in respected outlets...only to risk it all in this weird move of behaving like a shady car salesman for what must a be a double digit million deal at most, right?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometime in 1990 I injured my back. I still remember the details. The injury was caused by a strong sneeze while I was bent over picking up a briefcase. In a single second, I couldn&#39;t stand, I couldn&#39;t get up off of my knees. It was really quite bad. I went to a few doctors and got advice, but it was more along the lines of it looks like degenerative disk disease. In a few weeks the pain went away and my back felt completely normal.I am posting this in the hope that some HN reader will find it useful.Since that original &#34;injury&#34; other seemly small stresses on my back, especially when leaning over or twisted to one side can trigger this sharp sudden onset persistent back pain. Even sleeping in the wrong bed while traveling can cause me problems. The strange thing is, it goes away on its own after a few weeks and then I feel fine. If I was a yoga practitioner I would believe that yoga was curing it, if I went to a chiropractor then I would believe that  chiropractic was curing my back, and if I was a meditator then I would believe that meditation was curing my back. Back issues like mine get better on their own after a few weeks, this explains why there is such a wide range of &#34;cures&#34; for back problems in general despite the wide variety of causes, some of which won&#39;t &#34;get better&#34; on their own.Of course I&#39;ve been to doctors, and the radiological diagnosis is degenerative disk disease, but I think this is common for any person with back pain and no obvious physical cause. Everyone thinks they know what is wrong. And I think that some of them are right and some of them are wrong.I don&#39;t believe that it has anything to do with my psychological state. I&#39;ve been through many stressful events in my life and had to work and live under high levels of mental pressure, I&#39;ve been happy, sad, frustrated on and off over the years--most people have. These states are not correlated in the least with the onset of my back pain. On the other hand, recovery could be affected by one&#39;s psychological state, being able to relax the back muscles so that back can heal requires some ability to deal with the mind-body issues and the anxiety causes by pain.I had a trainer that was always stressing functional fitness. This definitely didn&#39;t seem to be useful and was sometime injurious. Throwing medicine balls again a wall and doing every exercise one handed while balancing on one leg weren&#39;t helpful. The issue for me was the twisting that was encouraged by this training philosophy. Simply keeping fit and keeping my weight down were much more helpful.The best advice I got was from a consultation with a neurosurgeon. This physician was trained to do back surgery but uniquely also treated patients with alternative therapies when surgery wasn&#39;t clearly indicated. She encouraged me to take vitamin D, omega-3 supplements, and curcumin to reduce inflammation. This has been helpful to me, reducing the frequency, severity, and duration of my back problems. Consulting with her also reduced my anxiety over pain and this might be mitigating the severity of the episodes.Golf -- the was very bad for me, an hour at the driving range could produce debilitating pain that made walking even with a cane almost impossible. I was just learning--maybe I was doing it wrong.Running and jogging -- these didn&#39;t seem to bother my back at the time I was doing it. I was able to train for and run marathons and even a wild cross country obstacle course race. I&#39;m not a great runner, but I was able to place well in my age group. What I found was that marathon training is time consuming and leads to some muscle imbalances. My lower back (and upper body too) got weaker because my exercise was just running. The tightness in my lower back from hours of running also gave me concern and occasional, brief, but significant discomfort in my lower back. Overall though, I didn&#39;t feel that my back bothered me any more than the typical running overuse injuries, like planter fasciitis, knee pain, or IT band pain afflicting my fellow runners. I was able to finish all of the marathons I started training for (training takes around 7 months if you already do a bit of jogging). I hope this encourages people to remain active if their back pain is like mine (I understand that there are many types). I do wonder if so much running could be hard on the disks, does anyone know?Brazilian Jujitsu -- I had to give it up. I never got hurt, but I felt it was the sort of thing that a senior citizen with back problems should not be doing.Sitting and sleeping -- surprising to me was that thick memory foam mattresses that was supposed to be good for backs (Tempur-Pedic back in the 90s) bothered my back while a very firm mattress on top of a solid platform didn&#39;t. For the sake of my spouse, I found that one of the Casper mattresses works for both of us.Some chairs are great, and some end up causing me back issues. The Zero Gravity Recliner is great, but now they seem very pricey. I got my unmotorized one years ago. When I have a bad episode of pain, sitting in it is one of the only ways I can get relief.I use an adjustable height standing/sitting desk with a Motion Stool by UPLIFT. The adjustable desk helps me be things just right, and I&#39;ve discovered that chairs like the Motion Stool, while requiring some getting use to, allow me to work for hours at my desk without discomfort.It&#39;s really terrible to be in bad back pain, but for me, I&#39;ve found some adjustments to my lifestyle have allowed me to be very happy and to hold off on employing more drastic measures for thirty year so far."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People are incredibly reluctant to believe that ailments might actually be partly or mainly psychological. Chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, chronic lyme disease, back pain, are all things that sincere people truly are suffering from...that may be mainly psychological/psychosomatic but lots of people refuse to consider it. Probably due to the general dismissal of mental illnesses and being told for years &#34;it&#39;s all in your head&#34;. I think partly, people with these conditions are sometimes accused (or think they&#39;re being accused) of malingering; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s the case very often, I think they legitimately feel the symptoms they report, but the root cause may be in the mind/brain rather than the rest of the body.Yes, some back pain is due to repetitive stress injuries or physical structures out of place or whatever. But as this study shows, looks like it has a strong psychological component as well. I suspect we&#39;ll (some day) get better treatments for all the things I mention, if mental illness stigma ends and they can be honestly considered from all possible causes.Edit: to be clear, I&#39;m not saying that all cases of back pain or CFS or whatever are psychosomatic - just that it shouldn&#39;t be dismissed, especially when the treatments are relatively low-risk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This treatment is based on the work of Dr John Sarno - who I first heard of here on HN almost 10 years ago. And of all the wonderful things I’ve discovered on HN, Dr Sarno’s work is probably the one that’s had the biggest positive impact on my life.When I first heard about his approach to chronic pain, I was pretty skeptical. But I’d tried everything else to solve my debilitating RSI, and nothing else had worked despite only being in my early 20s, so I was willing to give it a try. 6 months later, I was back working pain-free after being out of action for 2 years.As patmcc mentions, people can be incredibly reluctant to believe that physical pain can have psychological causes. And in many cases, there are underlying physical issues, so this should certainly not be your first approach to treatment. But if you’ve tried everything and nothing works, I encourage you to take a look at Sarno’s work. It made a world of difference for me and for many others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am confused, this seems more like a general math cheatsheet. The only thing that truly has anything to do with theoretical CS are the definitions for the O-notation on the first page (and most CS students don&#39;t need a cheat-sheet for that) and the master theorem. Nothing on P, NP, NP-hardness or completeness, formal languages (Chomsky hierarchy?), finite automata, Turing machines, halting problem, decision problem, reduction proofs, Pumping lemma, Gödels incompleteness theorem, etc. This sheet would have been of very little help in any theoretical computer science exam I ever took. The only cheat sheet I ever needed in theoretical CS was Schönings book &#34;Theoretische Informatik - kurz gefasst&#34; (&#34;A short overview of theoretical CS&#34;, well, it has ~180 pages...), which is pretty standard in German universities. It was completely worn out after my first semester + exam of theoretical CS... here is a TOC: http://www.gbv.de/dms/hebis-mainz/toc/094349797.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it&#39;s just me, but when a cheatsheet reaches 10 pages and includes multiple areas like this one I&#39;d just split it up into multiple ones. It almost feels like this needs a table of contents.And I think a bit more theoretical CS stuff, maybe a few diagrams, would be more helpful than e.g. the Pythagorean theorem or the powers of 2 which shouldn&#39;t be a problem to just memorize at that level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is only a showcase of TeX, the actual value of this cheat-sheet seems pretty low.I used to know most of this when I was in uni, including how to derive it when I needed it. Back then this kind of cheat-sheet would not have helped me apply my knowledge. The actual knowledge was very clear in my head from solving problems, or I remembered some key idea used during derivation and from there could work out the rest.If you need this kind of cheat-sheet you don&#39;t understand the concepts deep enough.Unfortunately most of this knowledge is now 15 years later either very fuzzy or completely lost from my mind. I guess that happens when it is not being refreshed/applied during the career I chose.This cheat-sheet serves a reminder of how much knowledge I have lost ;)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey!We wondered what to do to make building layouts even faster while adding more fun elements to our daily work. After a while, the inspiration came! Why not randomize the components while having fun, like at a slot machine in a casino?The idea generator combines available UI components into finished layouts. You choose the technology, the library, click &#34;Shuffle!&#34; and boom, ready-made layout. Click again, and you have a new layout.Based on our No AI®, and No Blockchain®, and Pure Random® technology. ;)What do you think?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wonderful idea, great implementation!Would love to see you guys partnering with TailwindUI somehow. That&#39;s my default go-to ui widgets library (it&#39;s not open source, so it might be challenging to find a proper partnership model with them).Just bought a lifetime subscription. And as I already do have subscription - my last recommendation is to switch to monthly subscription model as soon as you can. Monthly subscriptions is just so much more profitable pricing model:)Congrats again on shipping great product!Edit: typos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is neat! I’ll add it to my box of no/low-code tools.I do feel like not letting the homepage itself shuffle its layout is a missed opportunity for showcasing the product."</p>
