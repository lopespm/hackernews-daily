								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really hope sci-hub survives this. Sci-hub and libgen are like an entirely different internet, one allowing you to dive as deep as you wish into any technical subject. There’s really no comparison I have found anywhere for the depth of material available. People always point to Wikipedia, but all of that is surface level. If you to build something, research something, or just really delve into it, there’s no substitute for having access to all of the latest textbooks, manuals, and papers. I’ve never found any source paid or otherwise that comes even close."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Torrent seeding effort: https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/nc27fv/rescue_...All papers on sci-hub are available as torrents from library genesis. The full collection contains 85 million articles (before this announcement), and is about 80TB. If anything ever happens to sci-hub or library genesis, there&#39;s enough people out there with backups that a replacement can be set up fairly quickly, albeit without the proxy functionality to obtain new papers.However, the more the merrier, so if you&#39;ve got some spare hardware and bandwidth to share, I&#39;d encourage you to contribute to the seeding effort if you&#39;re able. At current market prices of ~$30/TB, it costs ~$2400 to have a copy of the full collection sitting on your desk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just noticed something funny: The library of Alexandria was accidentally burned in 48 BC by Julius Ceasar. Here we are in 2021, we now have Alexandra&#39;s library, which rivals the first in size and scope, and there are at least as many forces trying to burn it. But fortunately this one is digital and you too can have a copy in your hallway closet for the price of some harddrives and bandwidth.Go make a backup, if you can afford it, and let&#39;s make sure that this one sticks around."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Disclaimer: Paying Protonmail customerTheir homepage says &#34;By default, we do not keep any IP logs&#34;In 2021, any soft language like this should be a red flag for anyone who is against surveillance. Maybe in 2018 it was good enough. But in 2021 it&#39;s not. Come on, Protonmail, you&#39;re supposed to be leading the way  -- don&#39;t make me figure it out myself.Replace immediately with &#34;By default we don&#39;t log IP, but may be required to by local law enforcement. We recommend everyone connect through Protonmail through Tor. This month, 60% of our users connected through Tor&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m aware that this is a very silly sounding question, but I’m very confused about what’s going on here.If the subject of this investigation had been using ProtonVPN to connect to ProtonMail, would this have (in a marginal way) protected their anonymity? If ProtonMail can be compelled to begin logging, surely the same must be said of ProtonVPN right?It’s interesting how many “privacy focused” companies tout being based in Switzerland as some big badge of honor, which a layman consumer such as myself is supposed to be really impressed by due to the overall reputation of “Swiss privacy laws.”In practice, I’ve never been to Switzerland. I don’t know any person that has had any legal issues there, let alone someone that’s litigated a digital privacy case there. I do not speak German or French, and don’t know where to start when it comes to looking up specific cases or court proceedings, so I’d be extremely slow on the uptake of the actual ins and outs of how the Swiss privacy model works from a practical standpoint.The “based in Switzerland” thing strikes me as a bit of a black box bit of marketing speak. How much time, energy and money did ProtonMail expend fighting this surreptitious logging mandate? Does “Swiss privacy” actualy mean anything if ProtonMail is happy to hand over your IP address when spooked?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclaimer: I have a ProtonMail account that I pay for.I have seen a ton of disturbing pieces about ProtonMail. Every time I&#39;ve looked into them, they seem to be maliciously motivated and usually not true, or otherwise twisting of the truth. This has been a confusing thing for me because why is there a small subset of people so vehemently against them?In this case, I&#39;m not surprised. They say quite clearly they can be compelled to collect IP addresses - including in the linked tweet. This seems like a pretty clear cut case of them being compelled to provide an IP address. What the authorities can&#39;t do, is read that person&#39;s email. And that&#39;s what I and others pay for.I&#39;m not sure what there is to be upset about here? Other than perhaps France prosecuting this individual to begin with? If we had faith that ProtonMail wouldn&#39;t hand over anything to the government, why would anyone even care about having encrypted emails?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amen to this. Two case studies from the UK I&#39;ve been thinking about recently:1) Visiting London and spending time in South Kensington - walking back to hotel at night, only about 30% of houses had any lights on. Suggestion is the others are effectively uninhabited, and a search on RightMove shows properties sell for £20-£30m for a 4/5 bed. This isn&#39;t normal Londoners, it&#39;s outside investment.2) Cornwall, where I live - an insane house price rise over lockdown as city dwellers aim for the beautiful bits of the country. Literally no way now you could afford your first home round here on minimum wage, and some towns have a high (&gt;50) % holiday or second homes.It&#39;s an untenable situation. I think my generation (I&#39;m nearly 50) are probably the last to be able to afford their own home on anything other than a massive wage.Round here in Cornwall the jobs are things like surf instructor, supermarket worker, barperson, etc. That&#39;s not gonna stretch to the local house prices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is desperately needed. And not just in the major cities; this is happening in every Dutch town. Amsterdam may have prices beyond absurd, but the whole nation is burdened by this problem.In the street I live in the capital of the northern province of Fryslân (Frisia) most homes are owned by their inhabitants, but in the past few years we&#39;ve seen several houses being bought by small-time investors (who already own their own home of course, are financially well on their way, and are looking for ways to save their saving from low interest rates and inflation), who charge renters four times what my fellow homeowners and I pay for mortgage.You never get to know the renters, because they are really only here for as long as nothing better comes along (like buying a house or social housing), and who can blame them?Meanwhile maintenance of these houses is minimal, because the market won&#39;t really reward proper upkeep at this point; they can always sell the house for an insane price tomorrow.It&#39;s really upsetting to see my younger colleagues stuck renting a flat, while I own my house having even paid of the vast majority of the mortgage simply because I had the luck of buying it in 2013 (a major dip in the market where paying less than the listed price was common).For the good of society we need to put a stop to this type of speculation on the housing market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the long term, the ethically right answer seems pretty clearly to me to be a land value tax [0]. But due to encouragement of home ownership [1], that&#39;s not going to democratically tenable in a lot of countries for 20+ years. Unfortunate situation.[0] In 1879, a man asked &#34;How come all this new economic development and industrialized technology hasn&#39;t eliminated poverty and oppression?&#34; That man was Henry George, his answer came in the form of a book called Progress &amp; Poverty, and this is a review of that book - https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-progr...[1] https://www.economist.com/leaders/2020/01/16/home-ownership-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A finer point often missed on HN is how different publishing is across fields. In physics i have always been able post preprints to the web/arXiv and leave them up indefinitely. Their scientific content is identical to the journal formatted version and they show up in search often before the paid version. This is true even for the historically worst offenders (i.e. Elsevier)Last I heard the situation in chemistry was still completely different. The ACS is also known for bullying cash strapped college libraries into exorbitant and unnecessary journal subscriptions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see why it would be a controversial bill in Congress to simply exempt scientific publications (broadly construed) from all copyright law. Springer and Elsevier (the latter not even an American company) would be losers, but I doubt they spend more than a couple $mil on lobbying per year between the two of them. The benefit to humanity seems pretty clear.This seems entirely within the scope of Congress&#39;s power under the Copyright Clause, and need not be tied up with other more controversial aspects of intellectual property law. There was a time when one could have made a case that permitting copyrights on scientific publications would &#34;promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts&#34; (e.g. because only journal publishers were in a position to efficiently provide copy editing, nice formatting, and distribution). None of that has been relevant for decades, so it seems to me that one could even make a case that the status quo violates the Copyright Clause, since enforcing journal copyrights pretty clearly diminishes rather than promotes the progress of science."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes, everyone uses scihub (and author websites, etc) from time to time.A related question is &#34;who pays the per-paper fee&#34;.  Well, not me, and none of my colleagues.  However, I&#39;ve learned that the fees do get paid, but not by individuals. Rather, it&#39;s libraries that are paying, to fulfil interlibrary loan requests for papers in journals with high subscription costs and low readerships.  If the number of requests times the price per request is lower than the yearly subscription cost, this can be the only way to stay within budget.Where I work, research grants let me cover journal &#34;page charges&#34;, but they do not let me subscribe to journals, nor contribute to the library budget.  This has always struck me as crazy, for the yearly cost of many journals is under the cost of publishing a single paper.  Heck, we have researchers publishing in the journal of whatever, paying several tens of thousands of dollars per year ... and our library cannot afford to subscribe, so we can see our work.Yes, you read that right: in many cases, authors have to pay to publish, and then pay again to read.Some progress is being made, though. Many granting agencies now encourage researchers to publish in open-access mode. That would seem great, except that they did not increase grants to compensate for the extra cost.  Money spent on those fees is money that cannot go to support graduate students.As others have noted (here, and in dozens or hundreds of similar discussion threads), things are different from field to field.  I work in a field where it&#39;s just as important to read old papers as new ones. That means that the solution of authors posting to their websites is not always viable.  Probably a third of the papers I read (in support of teaching) are from people who died long before the web got started."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the article: &#34;Suzuki says that although he used computer software for the design, the simulation of its motion was entirely in his head only, and that seeing it take shape was a major motivation.&#34;&#34;Then I observed to my delight that I could visualize with the greatest facility. I needed no models, drawings or experiments. I could picture them all as real in my mind.
...
My method is different. I do not rush into actual work. When I get an idea I start at once building it up in my imagination. I change the construction, make improvements and operate the device in my mind. It is absolutely immaterial to me whether I run my turbine in thought or test it in my shop. I even note if it is out of balance. There is no difference whatever, the results are the same. In this way I am able to rapidly develop and perfect a conception without touching anything. &#34; - From Nikola Tesla&#39;s Autobiography &#34;My Inventions&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m always amazed by how so much Minecraft innovation is driven entirely by hobbyists. For years Minecraft was unplayable on many machines without the Optifine plugin.

This project is truly exciting."</p>

Instead of saying to friends “register to digital ocean, pay $5 and get a Minecraft box”, I can host thousands of worlds for them.I made a custom minecraft proxy (similar to bungeecord but A LOT less resource intensive) that starts the real server when someone attempts to connect to it.200 lines of go for the proxy and about as much for the http front end in django :)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So basically the only reason they were considering YouTube was to either deny it to their competition, or force their competition to pay more for it.It sounds like they expected it to die on a backroom shelf somewhere if they made the purchase. This seems anti-competitive behavior even during what might otherwise be viewed as their &#34;don&#39;t be evil&#34; phase. They didn&#39;t see it as valuable for their own needs, they just didn&#39;t want it to grow into competition itself or via another competitor and so considered buying it to let it die."</p>

In just 4 of my lifespans (and I don&#39;t even feel that old), we went from rudimentary electric motors to all the amazing technology we have at our fingertips today. Truly astounding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, sort of. Faraday invented the first thing that would sort of rotate given electrical power. It took another 33 years before someone built something that had useful torque at the output shaft. Along the way, coils and commutators had to be developed. It also took a while to realize that generators and motors are basically the same.Rotating electrical machinery was considered a solved problem and kind of boring until about 20 years ago. Then people started using semiconductor switches to drive electric motors. Classic theory assumed you were driving motors with a sine wave. Motor controllers tried to make motors happy by providing a sine wave, or something close to one. Gradually it was realized that motors could be purpose designed for chopped waveforms. This broke all that beautiful closed-form math and charts on polar graph paper that goes back to Tesla. You have to simulate to design a modern electric car motor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; At heart, Faraday was an experimentalistThis is often repeated, but I think it&#39;s a misleading label. Faraday doesn&#39;t get nearly enough credit for his theoretical prowess -- probably because he didn&#39;t develop his theories mathematically. But I would say his mental model of nature was far more accurate than most of his peers, mathematical or not, and that understanding is what guided him to groundbreaking discovery after groundbreaking discovery. He developed his experiments to confirm his own theoretical predictions, often predictions that no theoretical physicsts were making at the time; for example, the Faraday effect (that magnetism can rotate the polarization of light in a material), Faraday&#39;s law (the electromagnetic one), and Faraday&#39;s law (the chemical one)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"About 10 years ago my wife and I got two recues. A female greyhound and a male lurcher (who basically looked like a greyhound). My wife used to try to get our dogs to howl, because she thought it was funny. It turned into something they would do on command. Anyway, about 8 years ago my wife discovered the song &#34;Werewolves of London&#34; by Warren Zevon. At the appropriate parts of the song, she would command our dogs to &#34;sing&#34;, and they&#39;d both howl. Yes, hilarious. Anyway, about 7 years ago the greyhound got osteosarcoma, a painful bone cancer, and we had to put her to sleep. The lurcher was extremely lonely, so we rescued another greyhound. My wife didn&#39;t put the Werewolves song on again, because it made her feel sad. Fast forward about a year, and we&#39;re both in the house doing whatever, and I put on a playlist, not realising the song was in it. As soon as the first bar of the song played, the lurcher jumped up onto the armchair at our front window, frantically looking into the park out front, howled, and ran around the house &#34;searching&#34;, presumably for Pasha. Tears, obviously. But also the realisation that a dog can recognise a song, years after last hearing it, in a sea of thousands of other songs. And within the first few seconds of it playing. Honestly, I was astonished."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many pet owners have seen this behaviour, and what I find note worthy too is that that trauma can be easily detected when the animal doesn&#39;t react according to intention.Anecdotically, I adopted a mistreated dog this year. He&#39;s a really good boy, and shows the exact same behaviour the paper states regarding accidental interactions in general. But if you are for example brooming and slightly touch him, he immediately hides and may even piss himself. It seems to me that he was beaten up with some kind of stick when he was just a puppy. Poor boy :("</p>
