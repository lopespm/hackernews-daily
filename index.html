								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Think Apple has already seen the writing on the wall - both S. Korea &amp; the US are now probably going to push back against the IAP restrictions, and they can / should do a couple of things, which might actually increase revenue.1. Cut down the IAP commission to 15% for everyone. 
2. Cut down the commission to 5% for those who pay for a Business Account, say at $5,000 a year.The thing is no customer wants to use any company&#39;s half-assed bug-riddled purchase or subscription system. Every iOS and macOS user will prefer to use the Apple system. All Apple has to do is to make the rates competitive enough, that after considering building their own purchases system, factoring in sales tax and VAT, most developers will happily just opt for Apple&#39;s system if the rates make sense. Many people are putting up with 30% already â€” bringing the rates down to something reasonable with an upgrade path to put them on par with payment processors like Stripe (with VAT and Billing and Radar) or Paddle will just increase revenues for them.The moment they drop rates and ease restrictions apps that are not being built because of these rules will get built, and these apps will gladly pay the market rate of 5% to 10% for a full service payments system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really happy to see this moving forward, but I loathe the potential future landscape. Every fortune 500 is going to immediately pivot to their own IAP options which will make my life harder compared to Apple Pay.I&#39;m hoping with this movement, tools like Stripe/Paddle will develop some better IAP flows to make it as easy as possible. Adding my card information to 50 different in-app wallets does not sound appealing to me, despite the win for consumers and developers.I guess what I&#39;m trying to say, is that it&#39;s unfortunate we have to make a tradeoff at all.Hopefully, this move will put downward pressure on Apple&#39;s payment infrastructure that incentivizes devs to keep using Apple payments because it&#39;s the same fee structure as whatever 3rd party they might move towards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been saying this for years now: this is why Apple should&#39;ve ushered in lower commissions on larger publishers themselves because otherwise a court, a regulatory authority or a legislature was ultimately going to do it for them.And you&#39;re almost always better off making that change yourself.Big publishers have their own payment processing pipelines. Apple&#39;s is just extra overhead. Smaller publishers still (IMHO) can see a lot of benefit from Apple&#39;s 30% cut. It&#39;s those large publishers who are most likely to challenge your rules in court or lobby against you.If the very largest publishers were paying 10% as a Preferred Partner instead of 30%, they would be a lot less willing to challenge the status quo when they might lose that privilege.We&#39;ve already have ridiculous workarounds for Apple&#39;s policies here like how you can bypass it to buy directly from Amazon through the app for physical goods. The carve out for digital goods is and was always a tortured post facto justification.Where once the 30% cut funded the App Store (when it was small). It&#39;s clearly transitioned to being a massive profit center and Apple executives couldn&#39;t see past the short term revenue to see the writing on the wall. Woops."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Windy is great. The map is appealing, but be sure to check out the forecast view for a particular location. Also make sure you try different locations. I&#39;m in the Salish Sea on Orcas Island in the San Juans and because we have a lot of topography here mixed with ocean, we have a lot of local effects, contour winds and so on and there are big differences between locations.Also note that Windy can get it wrong. I grew up in Cape Town and forecasting there is easy compared to here because it&#39;s the tip of Africa surrounded by Atlantic and Indian Ocean. Here it&#39;s very mixed with land, sea, big 11,000ft mountain ranges like the Olympics and so on and this region is hard to forecast. For where we are, the forecasts - and Windy&#39;s map specifically - is wrong fairly often.A trick that a lot of folks don&#39;t know about is using ATIS, AWOS or ASOS at a local airport or airfield. If you want to know what the weather is at a given location, find a nearby airport, get their ATIS (or AWOS or ASOS) phone number and you can call and get a real-time report that is extremely accurate. I do this for KORS, our local airfield all the time. You can get this data off Foreflight although I&#39;m sure there are plenty of free alternatives. Obviously it&#39;s current weather, not forecast, but it&#39;s often helpful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"over the past few years my use of weather apps + forecasting has really been improved by reading alongside them the local NWS office&#39;s &#34;area forecast discussion&#34;which is published multiple times a day by the station&#39;s meteorologists: https://www.wrh.noaa.gov/total_forecast/getprod.php?new&amp;wfo=...It&#39;s really great to be able to contextualize the state of a Windy map, for example especially in Seattle where the weather patterns are tightly influenced by the Olympic mountains and other local conditions which these global maps usually fail to capture or express well.Windy is impressive stuff but looking is half the battle with these maps, wind directions and &#34;that weather blob is orange right now&#34; only really go so far when your weather area&#39;s geography isn&#39;t simple; in fact, i think that the older static Weather Channel style maps which expressed the pressure gradients and fronts better and helped you build a model of what the weather is doing rather than which way the wind is blowing. (see https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/journeynorth.org/images/g... for an example)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personal Googler story: In Ads and in Search, at least as of 2010 or so, Google employed independent companies who hired &#34;raters&#34; to provide &#34;ground truth&#34; for the ML systems. For example, they would rate proposed ads for a given query, so that the ML system could learn from their &#34;truth&#34;. For Search, they&#39;d rate proposed search results for a given query. There was a whole pipeline to bring in the raters&#39; results and use them.Those &#34;raters&#34; were contractors to the independent companies, and had no Google privileges at all. They couldn&#39;t come to campus and eat at the cafes, for example. They had no direct contact with any Google employees. I helped a relative get hired as one of those. This was about 11 years ago.These outside companies had minimal oversight from Google, by design. My cousin joined the Search rater company and was given a test problem, which was timed and they had max times allowed. When she finished, they said &#34;sorry, you took too long, we&#39;re not paying you.&#34;I raised a stink and HR sent a representative to meet with the Search people. I sat in. The Search people were obnoxious little corporate toadies who claimed they couldn&#39;t interfere with any particular contractor&#39;s case, because of the legal separation requirements.I so enjoyed watching the HR rep calmly and politely tell them, &#34;That&#39;s great! Good job, you guys! But you know... when you hire someone and they don&#39;t do a good job, your remedy is to fire them. Not to refuse to pay.&#34;She got paid.I can&#39;t make any general statements about what happens to everyone, but in this particular case, I can&#39;t complain at all about HR&#39;s handling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Google executives have been aware since at least May 2019 that the company was failing to comply with local laws in the UK, Europe and Asia that mandate temporary workers be paid equal rates to full-time employees performing similar work, internal Google documents and emails reviewed by the Guardian show.&gt; But rather than immediately correct the errors, the company dragged its feet for more than two years, the documents show, citing concern about the increased cost to departments that rely heavily on temporary workers, potential exposure to legal claims, and fear of negative press attention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My question is, if it&#39;s so advantageous to employ people via onsite staffing firms (basically half of FAANG&#39;s workforce is employed this way), why doesn&#39;t Google stop directly employing people altogether?Without fail, if it&#39;s a giant publicly-traded company, a huge percentage of the workforce will always be onsite vendors. It seems so bizarrely arbitrary where they decide to hire direct vs. contract.And I&#39;m not talking about janitors, I&#39;m talking highly paid software engineers, product managers, etc working on the same teams with Google employees.Based on the rates I&#39;ve seen, I can&#39;t imagine it&#39;s cheaper than having direct employees. So I&#39;m guessing its more about making it easier to fire people, harder to get sued by them, and offloading the hassle of benefits onto a third party. It&#39;s clearly legal in the US, so why not take that strategy with all employees.Does anybody have insight as to when this trend started in corporate America and why it&#39;s only popular with big publicly traded companies?When a company goes public, do they suddenly get a mandate from the Board that they have to start mass-hiring people through Adecco?Based on stories of mailroom workers rising up to executive ranks in the past, this clearly wasn&#39;t true as recently as the 1970s."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been a long time coming. There is an infamous MathOverflow thread about the proof (also linked in the article), with the following comment summarizing the state of affairs ~10 years ago:&gt; There is no other evidence. In fact there is absolutely no evidence what so ever. I have never met a mathematician who could convince me that he or she understood Freedman`s proof. I attempted to read that monstrosity of a paper a number of times by myself and quite a few times with a group of other mathematicians. We never were able to finish checking all of the details. Such seminars always ended before we could make it through even half of his paper. No other expositions on the subject seem to be any better. It is truely an odd state of affairs that after all of these years no one has managed to write a clear exposition of this so called proof, and that no one seems to question the claim that there ever was a proof. I remember thinking as a young mathematician either this &#34;proof&#34; is sheer nonsense or someone will eventually write out a clear and detailed explanation. As of April of 2011 I have understood that the so called proof is full of errors and they can not be fixed. I mentioned this to several mathematicians during the summer of 2011 and I believe these conversations are directly linked to the dialogue seen here on math overflow.Also on that thread, Brendan Guilfoyle raised the issue of writing a complete book-length treatment of the proof. I found the following response an interesting commentary on incentives in academia.&gt; Promotion committee: &#34;What have you done in the last 5 years?&#34;&gt; B.G.: &#34;I&#39;ve been writing a book about a paper published in 1982.&#34;&gt; Promotion committee: &#34;How is that groundbreaking overachieving hyped research?&#34;&gt; B.G.: &#34;It is not, but I am preserving the knowledge of the elders.&#34;&gt; Promotion committee: &#34;Who told you that was a good idea?&#34;&gt; B.G.: &#34;A guy on the internet, and 24 people liked his suggestion.&#34;&gt; Promotion committee: &#34;We will call you, don&#39;t call us. Good bye.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I understand this article, itâ€™s about a 500-page book that is devoted to one proof of one theorem in topology. I find that amazing.And cheers to Quantum Magazine for regularly publishing popularizations of research mathematics. I know many, at times, take issue with their simplifications and framing, but theyâ€™re trying, where almost no one else with their reach covers these areas at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So many comments here about MS and Oracle.  MÄ“h! I have an intellectual affinity for the suffering.  But it has been 20 years since I wrestled with the Beast from Seattle.Most of those twenty years were spent doing my own things in Linux, Perl, and R.  In glorious ivory tower isolation from the real world consequences of serving a master who&#39;s goal was to extract revenue...Here I am for the last year serving Apple (the Beast from Cupertino?).The problems are the same with documentation.  Yesterday I found an example in some Apple documentation.  It saved me half a day, and I almost dies from shock.  I have never before seen an actual example...Their main documentation is videos.  Fucking videos.  Videos of what looks like actors pretending to be developers, that go on for ages, have no transcripts....And then the tools:  At least the MS and Oracle tools work! (Do they?)  In Apple you cannot believe what the debugger tells you about the state of your programme with out double checking in at least two other ways, because their tool chain is very buggy, and they will not fix it.There is no money in fixing tools.  We developers pay them SFA money, brighter colours on the App store, deeper dark arts in getting you to fork over $XX for shiny apps that is where their development resources are going.SO...  They are all the same: APple, MS, Oracle, Google....  We developers are their bitches, we will crawl over broken glass to get things done, so there is no need to spend any resources on us....Come back RMS!! All is forgiven!!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems to be the general rule of thumb that, when you want to  google for an oracle error message, then exclusion of both oracle documentation site, and developer forums is your first criteria on the search bar.  Same applies to Microsoft (large parts of MSDN), and now Amazon Web Services documentation (at least some parts of it).That&#39;s the reason StackOverflow works - it really solves programmer&#39;s problems, instead of the strange dialects of English and style that flourish on MS and Oracle and Java docs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked with databases for a while now and I&#39;ve never advocated for moving to Oracle (I have advocated for postgres though).  The long term organizational costs is a big factor - but an almost equally large factor is the fact that1. I have never actually used their dialect and have heard absolutely terrible things about it2. There is no non-enterprise DBMS available that uses something close to their dialect so I figure actually hiring Oracle DBAs would be a nightmare.These two factors combine to make me absolutely baffled at how completely Oracle has seemed to dominate every market but the private one (i.e. government, especially defense and educational).  Have I been missing something about ways to actually get real world experience with Oracle?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In school, 25 years ago, I was taught the &#34;circling balls&#34; atomic model and for me physics seemed kind of boring and very stable field of science, like we already knew almost everything.Nowadays, thanks to superb youtube channels[1], I&#39;ve learnt that we are rather in the beginning of the journey of solving the mystery of universum, and the reality is much more exciting than those boring &#34;circling balls&#34;; actually there are no balls at all but just &#34;fields&#34; (which of course is also just a mental model).[1] E.g. https://www.youtube.com/user/TheScienceAsylum"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congrats, this is one of the best landing pages I&#39;ve seen this year. It looks really nice, and I love the idea of a headless ecommerce platform, especially one that comes with a nice backend GUI for managing inventory, etc.I took a quick look through the documentation as well, and was  pleasantly surprised by the maturity of the features that it has. This provides pretty much all of the basics I think one would need to manage a medium sized store. One area I do think could be improved perhaps is in the internationalization; it seems to me that every product has a single string to be the description, a single string to be the title, etc. with no easy way to localize the text across different regions.I also am curious about the pricing; the landing page mentions that you can get started for free, and &#34;start building for free&#34;, but is there some component that costs money down the road? I don&#39;t see any pricing page on the website so for now I&#39;m assuming it&#39;s 100% open source."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for building it as open source! Few q&#39;s:1. It doesn&#39;t seem to be multi-tenant (that is, hosting multiple shops/companies with one db). Are there plans to add multi-tenancy?2. What are the major differences vs  https://github.com/vendure-ecommerce/vendure ? (another nodejs solution, with included Admin panel and storefront)3. How do you plan to monetize?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great landing page. Love the focus on integrations, tho I immediately wanted to know more. None of those logos are clickable, and I was impatiently waiting for the logos to scroll to see if there was an accounting integration.  I also donâ€™t recognise all the logos. Iâ€™d suggest this deserves its own page, and from experience, this will draw in users / customers via search / seo.I found a repo for your admin panel which talks about a â€˜Medusa Cloudâ€™ account, but I canâ€™t find any other details about this.There a couple of models with integrations, you can build them as open source, but then you have to maintain them. Or you can have 3rd parties build and maintain them as Saas offerings. Either works, they both have significant positives and negatives. Either way itâ€™s a significant opportunity for revenue generation.If youâ€™re interested in Xero / accounting integration reach out. I could work with you to build your own, or could connect you with folks that would build out such services around your product.Minor:
Copy under â€˜SEO Friendlyâ€™ header is duplicated from another header.â€˜Get Startedâ€™ doesnâ€™t go anywhere."</p>
