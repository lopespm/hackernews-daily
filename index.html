								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like most people, I&#39;ve ordered a lot of packages (hundreds?) on Amazon and almost never had a problem. In the rare case of a problem, Amazon would instantly refund me. But almost all those orders are under $1000. Everything changes when you have a problem with an expensive order. Amazon has a price threshold where the support system is different and the normal CS people are powerless.During lockdown, I ordered a Sony camera and lens that was in the $5k+ range. The package went &#34;missing&#34; with the shipper with obvious fake tracking data, like multiple &#34;customer not home&#34; delivery attempts timestamped at 12am in the morning. The packages never showed up. Amazon kept saying it was the shipper&#39;s fault and the shipper said it was Amazon&#39;s responsibility. Lots of tweets, etc, got me nowhere.In the end Amazon finally refunded me, but it was a nightmare. They wouldn&#39;t even talk to me until I waited a number of days after the package was late and even then all they would say is that it had to be escalated to management who would review the issue eventually. Even when they finally agreed the package was lost, I had to wait for another management review to actually get the refund issued. They had my money tied up for weeks with no recourse for a package they never even delivered. I can only imagine how bad it would be if the shipper claimed it was delivered.My recommendation is to skip Amazon for anything expensive or at high risk of shipper theft/fraud. Your customer experience will not be the same as when they lose a $10 package. They will treat you like a criminal no matter what your past history with Amazon is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do not trust Amazon to ship anything safely and securely anymore. Almost everything I receive is damaged, late, or mis-delivered. Books are especially abused somewhere in Amazon’s fulfillment. (They’re always bent, creased, or dirty.) Items that are supposed to be 1-day shipping typically take &gt;=3, and Amazon’s tracking mostly says “oops! it’ll come trust us”. (Not verbatim, obviously.)Amazon’s return process is becoming incrementally more obtuse as time goes on. While they’re still decently good, it’s getting harder to do easy, no-nonsense returns. Typically—if they don’t just tell me to dispose of the item myself—they demand I drive to Amazon lockers or Whole Foods or Kohl’s to drop stuff off at no charge, and pressure me into just getting Amazon credit.I would never buy a $7,000 item on Amazon under any circumstance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happened to me as well. I got a Asus ROG Strix G15 laptop on 13 May(this month) and upon clearance from Sri Lankan customs (where I live) the UPS agents discovered that the contents was missing. UPS notified me this and report this to Amazon. They(UPS) held the package with them and didn’t deliver it to me as it was empty.Even in the commercial invoice the gross weight of the laptop package was just 1.81KG! The laptop itself weighs about 2.3KG!When I connected Amazon support they basically said that the package was delivered and they did an investigation the the weights are correct as well.The UPS has filed a claim with Amazon and Amazon is not responding to UPS even and insists I obtain a police report. I didn’t even receive the package. Shouldn’t UPS and Amazon sort this out?We are under lock down due to COVID and I can’t go to a police station to make the complaint.Now I don’t have the laptop or a refund…This costed me about 1700 usd with shipping. It’s not a cost I can afford to just write off."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems like commenters are misreading the lawsuit here. My first instinct after reading the top paragraphs of Stoller&#39;s post was also &#34;so what, this seems fine,&#34; but if you read to the end and see what the suit is really alleging, it&#39;s not just a policy that punished sellers for offering discounts on their products when sold off Amazon. It&#39;s the fact that Amazon is charging anywhere between 30-45% in fees to the sellers, which is much higher than other online marketplaces and obviously less than the 0% they&#39;d charge themselves to sell through their own site (though they&#39;d still need to pay money to operate the site), and then punishing them if they sell somewhere else that has lower fees for a lower price.That seems like legitimately monopolistic behavior and something that is illegal and should be stopped. The post is still misleading in that it doesn&#39;t mean Amazon is raising prices across the board by 30-45%. But they are raising prices across the board by whatever the delta is between their fees and WalMart&#39;s fees, or some other marketplace that charges even less, minus the difference in shipping.Normally, market forces would solve this problem without any need for legal intervention, because some other marketplace like WalMart can just offer lower seller fees and attract all the sellers. But that doesn&#39;t happen precisely because Amazon&#39;s massive subscribed user base represents so much of the market that no can afford not to sell there, which is seemingly the definition of a monopoly and why legal intervention is called for. Lower-cost marketplaces can only compete if Amazon is not allowed to blackball sellers from access to the only customer base that matters."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know how some can see it as shady or misleading, but I still prefer it.  That is, I prefer having the price baked in, right in front of me...no surprises.  Versus some indy site I&#39;ll think &#39;oh only six bucks?  sure I&#39;ll try it&#39; only to be shown it&#39;s actually closer to 20 after shipping and tax.  That just wastes both our time.Further, even if it&#39;s a hair more expensive, I&#39;ll still pay it for the no hassle returns.  I recently purchased a knife I saw on Amazon, but decided to go through the seller&#39;s official site to save a couple dollars.  It was not worth it, and not something I&#39;ll do again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Now, if this were all that was happening, sellers and brands could just sell outside of Amazon, avoid the 35-45% commission, and charge a lower price to entice customers. “Buy Cheaper at Walmart.com!” should be in ads all over the web. But it’s not. And that’s where the main claim from Racine comes in. Amazon uses its Buy Box algorithm to make sure that sellers can’t sell through a different store or even through their own site with a lower price and access Amazon customers, even if they would be able to sell it more cheaply. If they do, they get cut off from the Buy Box, and thus, cut off de facto from being able to sell on Amazon.&#34;This was the missing piece for me. Would like to see more specifics about how Amazon does this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; If people are trying to assign blame to a bug or outage, it&#39;s time to move on.This is one of my favorite excerpts. I once worked in a lab where we would have frequent catastrophic failures because there was never any disaster planning or contingency management plan. I personally triaged 3 such incidents alone or with people who happened to be there when the problem arose and attempted to disseminate some suggestions for how to prevent similar problems in the future. No one was interested. People were primarily interested in tearing my head off because I hadn&#39;t handled the problem the way they would have done it (of course, they were out drinking beers or sleeping while I was dealing with the issue at 12 AM or on a weekend).After the third time I said fuck it, the next time there is an issue I am going to insure my own projects are safe and then I&#39;m going home and turning my phone off. Let someone else deal with it. That is the not the culture you want to be promoting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This, and the current “sober” posts on r/ExperiencedDevs, makes me think of Herodotus describing the way the Persians made important decisions - once sober, once drunk, and if the drunk and sober decisions were the same they knew it was a good one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The most underrated skill to learn as an engineer is how to document. Fuck, someone please teach me how to write good documentation. Seriously, if there&#39;s any recommendations, I&#39;d seriously pay for a course (like probably a lot of money, maybe 1k for a course if it guaranteed that I could write good docs.)I agree but think it is more than just _documentation_: effectively communicating ideas through text was one of the most underrated skills in software engineering. I say &#34;was&#34; as I think there is much more focus on it now with remote work and video call fatigue becoming the norm for many."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“But it’s like the early Internet!” shouted the Emperor’s coinholders. “The Internet wasn’t yet useful a mere, um, thirteen years after its invention either.”I can see how people in their twenties would fall for this argument because they can’t remember. The reality is that the internet was immediately extremely interesting (either useful or fun) for practically everyone who got access. Email and ftp alone were killer apps. A bit later came Usenet and IRC and MUD gaming. There were things to download, people to meet, flame wars to participate in. People would stay up until 4am to get a chance to go online in university shared facilities.With cryptocurrency there’s nothing to do. You could pay $100 to buy a “cryptokitten” or whatever, but then you’d be stuck shilling it on somebody else somehow. The community is a mix of Scientology-like groupthink and multi-level marketing sales pitches. The early Internet was infinite times more fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These two resonated with me:&gt; A lot of intelligent observers look at cryptocurrency, see that it makes no sense, and reasonably infer that they must be missing something profound on the technical level. Tech culture has a nice tradition of not deriding new ideas, but we need to break it here and speak out&gt; [non-tech people] don&#39;t see the huge silent majority of tech people who know it&#39;s a scam. That&#39;s on usIt is on us. I never realized this before today. I&#39;m pretty sure it&#39;s nothing but a pyramid scheme, but I always gave the enthusiasts the benefit of the doubt. After all, Elon is so cute when he&#39;s enthusiastic! But yeah he probably knows it&#39;s a scam too, what was I thinking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I could waste a huge amount of time refuting the author&#39;s points, but will make it more of a meta comment.Crypto is vast, complex, and inherently not suitable for binary thinking. I&#39;ve studied the space for months and have come to the conclusion that crypto is two-sided in almost every aspect.Many/most coins are speculative, which you can associate with words like &#34;greed&#34; and &#34;casino&#34;. Yet also provide wealth savings/growth to people locked out of it in our traditional system.NFTs are a cruel joke right now, yet ridiculous as they are, may be a precursor to various groundbreaking uses having real utility, in an exponential way.Smart contracts are largely dysfunctional, yet there&#39;s early success in replacing financial products like staking, lending, leverage. When it works, it&#39;s permission-less, which has interesting social benefits (access not defined by your identity/social class).And so on.I&#39;m not here to debate any of these points, my only point is to not dismiss crypto as a whole (binary thinking) and to not underestimate it. The topic is too complex for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will postulate an opposing view to TFA:Quality consumer goods are better in two key areas. First, they are replaceable. I don’t want a military grade mixer in my kitchen if getting a broken whisk or motor on it is going to require me hunting all over eBay for the specific part hoping it’s available. I was very excited at one point about the idea of getting a commercial dishwasher that can run a load of dishes in like 90 seconds. Problem with those is that you can’t go to Lowe’s and get a replacement part when it acts up. You have to call a restaurant equipment servicing company and pay them what a restaurant with a broken dishwasher would pay. Or more because you aren’t a frequent customer. Sure, maybe it’ll break less but here’s the thing: my modern LG dishwasher will be more convenient to use and if I get 10 years out of it rather than 20 I still spent only $1000 on the top of the line one rather than the $4k on a 10 year old used commercial unit that I will struggle with the entire time.Second, consumer goods are replaceable. I am used to my Kershaw knife. I broke it yesterday. I can get it serviced by the manufacturer or get a brand new one, or both. If I buy some special forces surplus knife and chip the blade I am either done with that knife or I’m taking it to a specialist or I’m buying a new one. Knowing that I can replace an item I’m used to when a one-for-one replacement is a comfort. Obviously that doesn’t work for everything but it works for items that are made by high quality manufacturers.Bonus: a military grade mixer is going to suck to make high end pastries because it’s geared towards making mashed potatoes for the troops. I feel like the author is romanticizing ma class of products that in reality aren’t all that amazing except in a couple of key areas that to most consumers aren’t as big of a deal. So while it’s possible that, as the author states, the average consumer is an idiot, I don’t see much evidence that the author is much ahead of the pack here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love to use professional-grade items where i can, but sometimes &#34;overkill&#34; means a worse product.  like the professional-grade fan - it&#39;s not just designed for a high duty cycle, it&#39;s also probably designed to be operated in an environment where people regularly use hearing protection, so quiet operation is not a consideration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The average consumer is an idiot, so the bean counters keep milking them... They want pizzaz over functionality and durability. They want shiny stuff in a bigger box... The industrial, military and commercial market doesn&#39;t mess around. They want to purchase equipment that works reliably and performs to a specification. It&#39;s professional and their livelihood depends on it. It sort of self filters the entire market. Shitty things drop off the radar due to poor sales.This sounds like a cool hobby and conversation starter. But it&#39;s hard to take the author seriously when he proselytizes on the practical virtues of buying ejector seats over retail chairs. Industrial goods are often built for very specific use-cases. If those use-cases don&#39;t align with your own needs, you&#39;re just paying a lot of money for something you don&#39;t need. And often, something that fails to deliver on your actual needs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The idea that a field can be reformed by making it worse until it suddenly faces a reckoning and emerges much better is ... I don&#39;t know where people keep getting the idea that this might work. It has never worked in any field ever in history.The thing that can happen: fields gradually split into rigorous and non-rigorous camps. Like with evidence-based medicine, or chemistry/alchemy. Depending on the field, either might prevail in the market. Medical research and bridge-building are mostly rigorous, programming is mostly non-rigorous.AI/ML has a range of rigor levels, from fairly good to total crap. I think people in the field have a reasonable idea which is which. It&#39;s frustrating to people outside the field that think they can just take the technique with highest reported performance numbers and expect good results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth noting: In most of these cases, even when caught, the guilty parties and the bad papers remain unnamed. There are known-to-the-editors fraudulent papers in major journals still being cited.The consequences of committing academic fraud are minor, and the consequences of not doing so generally mean no academic jobs or tenure.There isn&#39;t a 99.99% innocent claim here (as at the end of the article). This stuff is widespread. This is much more accurate:&#34;because everybody is complicit in this subtle fraud, nobody is willing to acknowledge its existence&#34;Littman is at Brown, where the majority of the CS department engages in this !@#$%. I&#39;m not trying to single out Brown. Parts of MIT, Stanford, etc. are even worse."</p>

They know your age and all the insecurities you have about your body, not to mention your health problems and every embarrassing fact about you. They know where you&#39;ve been, where you&#39;re planning on going, and your political preferences. They know if you&#39;ve donated to political parties, attended political rallies, if you voted, where, and when. And they know all your friends.And we just let them do this. As tech people, we built this. And all the along the way we told ourselves it was fine, because it was very lucrative for the entire ad tech/fintech/startup ecosystem, and us personally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got a question for anybody who works in ad/marketing tech - is what Robert is describing something that you&#39;ve worked on/with and seen successful results? If so did you build it that way intentionally? Like, I totally understand that it&#39;s possible, but has anybody intentionally built something that tracks or correlates peoples location so they can group them with similar interests and sell them similar products?To me, the stupidest simplest solution is probably the most likely - some naive marketing analyst probably just grouped all traffic coming from the same IP address into the same bucket and blasted ads to them based on recent Amazon purchases at the same IP address."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a lot of actual data sharing going on, but I also wonder how often these are just the Baader-Meinhof effect (noticing recently mentioned things everywhere).Today I made an insta post about sand that resembled dunes at the beach, mentioning a camel in the description. Less than 5 minutes later I saw the camel logo at the beach bathroom, on someone&#39;s discarded cigarettes.Here it&#39;s obvious that there is no connection. But if I had instead randomly seen a camel cigarette ad online at that point in time, I might have seriously wondered if it&#39;s because I mentioned it in the post."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Kind advice to everyone willing to share their write ups: avoid Medium.I can’t read the article because of the signup wall. It is cheap and easy to set up a blog on your own custom domain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Before you can make things better, you have to stop making them worse”Incredibly great advice. Especially when trying to resolve an already broken situation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Security and reliability are more likely to go wrong in the seams between components. That means literal integrations, but it also means organization seams.Elon said the best part is no part. Parts between systems, interfaces/valves/pumps/APIs/whatever, are often modelled not after what makes the most sense for the final system or product but often follows the organisational structure of the people making the system. So it makes sense that these interface parts are often what creates problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I actually experienced an interesting incident that made me switch from Charter with no intention of ever giving them my business again. They had upgraded their default speed in my area from 200 Mbps to 300 Mbps but you wouldn&#39;t get it unless you called in for them to increased it. Then a short time later they announced it as a increase to service at no additional cost and it would automatically take affect. Then a couple of months later they reduced again and said it was never an option. I was just so annoyed I switched to 1 Gbps service for an extra $30. I really hope that one day cellular or satellite gut them. Charter/Spectrum is one crooked company that should be sued out of existence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funny coincidence: The same week that the city started running conduit in our neighborhood for municipal fiber, a Xfinity &#34;account manager&#34; came to our door and left a handwritten note saying great customer service was their goal and to call him if there was ever a service problem!Funny how legit competition makes them sit up and take notice...At some point after that, Xfinity dropped their gigabit service level from $190 to $70/mo (IIRC).In theory we have competition, but the alternatives are: Century Link 40Mbps DSL, or Rise Broadband terrestrial wireless (which hasn&#39;t proven a very good alternative for my coworkers)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So that invites an obvious question: Why isn&#39;t the competitor available on that next street too?Some streets are more expensive to dig on than others.  Perhaps prices are higher and competition is lower there for that reason.Don&#39;t get me wrong; I don&#39;t trust the broadband providers to do anything but try to extract maximum revenue from their customers.  But I also don&#39;t immediately trust too-simple explanations that confirm my biases.  The story here is more complicated than just moustache-twirling greedy corporations."</p>
