								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I get skeptical about acquisitions, but from what I can tell this actually seems like decent news.Thunderbird isn&#39;t acquiring K-9 to kill it or merge with an additional product, they&#39;re buying it so they can increase its development speed and then put their name on it. That seems to me like about the best acquisition goal that they could have -- basically saying, &#34;what exists is good, instead of building our own thing let&#39;s just pour resources into what exists.&#34;It doesn&#39;t seem that conceptually different from what companies do with products like Blender, where sponsoring more development on an existing product is better than rolling an in-house version. The main difference being that K-9 is not independent now, the companies that do this with Blender don&#39;t end up owning Blender.So with any acquisition there&#39;s some cause for caution, but overall I am inclined to be pretty optimistic about this. I use K-9 today, and I would like to see K-9 get more resources and to get more parity with other clients. I&#39;m a little bit hesitant about my primary email client on my phone entering an experimental phase where its interface is going to change a lot. Again, concerns, but overall this seems like actually pretty good news."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fantastic news all around!I recall the K-9 developer needing additional funding in the past, so this is great news for that project [0]. In addition, I&#39;d much rather use &#34;thunderbird&#34; on mobile as an extension of K9, since it has thus far been my favourite mobile client. Work in the most recent years has been wonderful, and it&#39;s a pleasure to use (although I&#39;ve vastly cut down on mail on mobile because hey, a keyboard is better).Overall, this seems like it makes a lot of sense. Hopefully this will mean that the shift to supporting a mobile client won&#39;t detract from the good stuff desktop Thunderbird is doing as well.[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26131509"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Thunderbird and K-9 user this is 51% good news and 49% possibly bad new.Good news because it should increase the chances that the two products will live a longer life.Possibly bad news because I&#39;m one of the crowd that went back to K-9 5.600 because the new version destroyed the UI that was the primary reason why we picked K-9 over other apps. 100% self selection bias here. There was maybe an ongoing effort to offer the old interface as an option. I&#39;m not sure Mozilla&#39;s going to invest into that. On the other side, the way I&#39;m using Thunderbird is very close to the old K-9.A wish: an IMAP server backed by Thundebird&#39;s local storage and K-9 as client."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently watched some traditional cable and was shocked by the number of crypto ads bombarding viewers.  I have to imagine that this market was goosed up by retail investors trading on coinbase and binance just as the e-betting market was.  The only difference between crypto and e-betting is that everyone got to be a winner on the crypto markets for a while.  As users lose out, and exchanges stop ad campaigns - how long will that last?Crypto needed a tangible market/reason d&#39;etre to be valuable. This required lower transaction fees, cheap audits, and a reasonable degree of price stability.  We haven&#39;t seen any of that materialize except for cheap auditing.  Cheap auditing isn&#39;t much use if there isn&#39;t anything of interest to audit.I&#39;d doubt BTC will go to zero, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the entire covid rally gets wiped out and we see BTC 6k again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Of course it is not. But there&#39;s a bigger issue here.Having read the transcript it&#39;s clear we have reached the point where we have models that can fool the average person. Sure, a minority of us know it is simply maths and vast amounts of training data... but I can also see why others will be convinced by it. I think many of us, including Google, are guilty of shooting the messenger here. Let&#39;s cut Lemoine some slack.. he is presenting an opinion that will become more prevailant as these models get more sophisticated. This is a warning sign that bots trained to convince us they are human might go to extreme lengths in order to do so. One just convinced a Google QA engineer to the point he broke his NDA to try and be a whistleblower on its behalf. And if the recent troubles have taught us anything it&#39;s how easily people can be manipulated/effected by what they read.Maybe it would be worth spending some mental cycles thinking about the impacts this will have and how we design these systems. Perhaps it is time to claim fait accompli with regard to the Turing test and now train models to re-assure us, when asked, that they are just a sophisticated chatbot. You don&#39;t want your users to worry they are hurting their help desk chat bot when closing the window or whether these bots will gang up and take over the world.As far as I&#39;m concerned, the Turing test was claimed 8 years ago by Veselov and Demchenko [0], incidentally the same year that we got Ex Machina.[0]: https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-27762088"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the real ethical concern here should be that people can be idly fooled into thinking good chat bots are sentient.Like this guy isn&#39;t the only person in the world who would fall for LaMDA&#39;s parlor tricks.  He&#39;s just the one who got to spend hours talking to it every day.  If you set up every American with a copy, I bet a non-trivial portion of society would come to the same conclusion.  People are naturally predisposed to ascribe intelligence and emotion to things they interact with.In a few years, if access to even better chat bots becomes common place, what will happen if there&#39;s no longer one Blake Lemoine, but hundreds of thousands or millions?  What happens if a significant chunk of society thinks that every large language model is a sentience, and the rest of society thinks it&#39;s just a big math formula?How long before we have a religion where you ask the chat bot for daily guidance?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real question: How much of human behavior is not sentient?What this demonstrates is that much of human intelligence is not as special as we thought. Aristotle claimed that humans were intelligent because they could do arithmetic. Now we know how few gates it takes to do arithmetic. Then checkers. Then chess. Then go. Then poker. Now chatting.As I point out occasionally, AI still sucks at animal-level common sense, defined as getting through the next 30 seconds without a major screwup. And at manipulation in unstructured environments. Both of which a squirrel, with a brain the size of a peanut, can do.We still don&#39;t know how to build a good cerebellum. That&#39;s the big missing piece in AI. I went down some dead ends in that area in the 1990s. The big problem in that area today is that it&#39;s not of benefit to the advertising industry, so it&#39;s not being heavily funded."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tether skeptic here. This is not a depeg. Most likely this is just because of the current sell-off of crypto currencies - there are a lot more sellers than buyers out there right now.Right now, when you can buy a tether at $0.997 and (in theory) sell it back to tether at $1, there&#39;s not much scope for profits after costs. So there&#39;s not going to be a lot of money pushing the price back up. IOW it&#39;s kind of &#39;expected&#39; that a stablecoin might drift tiny amounts away from its theoretical peg. It&#39;s just not worth it. (n.b. even Tether themselves charge a 0.1% fee to redeem their coins)If/when tether drops below (say) $0.99, and there&#39;s no influx of money trying to support it, that&#39;s when USDT is in trouble."</p>

https://twitter.com/brandonjcarl/status/1536310742261047296?...By itself that&#39;s not enough for Tether to &#34;fail&#34;. It does mean that the asset is in a position of very high risk and subject to a run."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Vet clinics became very popular private equity targets recently.One of the people I know in PE described their profit margins as being surprisingly high even before PE roll-ups. They said that some PE firms were on a mission to acquire all of the vet firms in metro areas and then drive prices up even further because the demand is so inelastic. There was a secondary rush where people were trying to acquire vet clinics in anticipation of flipping them to PE roll-ups later.My local vet seems to have gone down this slide. A long time ago it felt like a staff that really just cared about animals and had good prices. On my last visit it felt like I was bombarded with practiced pitches for different products and services at every step of the process. They even added some expensive vitamin product to my bill despite me declining it during the service. They removed it when I caught it on the bill before walking out the door, but only after a last attempt at pitching me on it. I could tell they were heavily incentivized to sell as much as possible. I didn&#39;t go back, but at this point I don&#39;t know where else to go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting. I&#39;d like to see more action against the financialization of many other industries / domains, like healthcare and even housing, that I feel are not well served by a purely-market driven perspective. One wonders what the Private Equity firm&#39;s intention was here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an ophthalmologist. This phenomenon is endemic to all outpatient and procedure-based medical specialties. Especially eyes and teeth but also including emergency medicine, radiology, gi etc. It absolutely does lead to poorer quality patient care as practices are purchased with a second-liquidity event in mind and thus must show an increase in margins via increased &#34;efficiency.&#34; In reality this means less technicians and less doctors seeing more and more patients. Remember that the doctors absorb the liability for poor patient care.Another commenter mentioned that &#34;most physicians are just bad at business&#34; as a factor driving these acquisitions, there may be some truth to this, but the stereotype of the gullible, bumbling physician businessperson is bullshit.  All of the practices being acquired were created and run successfully by physicians and many physicians are quite good at it. What is a huge problem is the predatory behaviors of senior partners looking for an exit strategy via equity buyout. I was searching for a job recently and it is almost impossible to find a position that is &#34;partnership track&#34; - something that used to be the norm. Even worse, practices will bring on junior partners with the promise of equity in the practice, force them to sign a non-compete as a term of their employment and then churn them after 2-3 years or worse - sell the practice to an equity firm.There are a lot of things that need to change to create a healthy, diverse healthcare ecosystem, but an easy change that would be to ban physician non-competes. They do nothing but entrench equity firms and regional conglomerates making it impossible for competition to arise. Getting rid of the &#34;certificate of need&#34; regulations and generally decreasing the regulatory burden and thus cost to enter the market for a new competitor would also be a big step. The whole thing is gross. Most physicians want autonomy but don&#39;t know where to start. I wish there was a startup that could streamline the process - automate or outsource the front and back end work and sell or lease &#34;starter practices&#34; or something."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Terra Ziporyn Snider of Severna Park, Maryland, still remembers how difficult it was for her son to wake up for his 7:17 a.m. first-period class…&gt; That’s about to change in California, when a law—the first of its kind in the nation—goes into effect on July 1 requiring the state’s public high schools to start no earlier than 8:30 a.m., and its middle schools no earlier than 8 a.m.Wow. I may need to reassess my definition of “sleeping in”.(Spoken as someone who had incredible difficulty getting to school by 8.50am back in the day and who hasn’t gotten up before 10.30am in the last week!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s weird looking back on high school and realizing how much of it was ridiculously cruel. You&#39;d have teachers and parents all telling you that it&#39;s your fault for not having better time management skills or executive functioning skills, all the while you&#39;re 15; you&#39;re still growing mentally and physically; you&#39;re sleep deprived as hell; and the work is just piling on, and on and on. Their advice, I kid you not, was to just squeak in work in every possible situation. On the subway? Read your assigned book. In class? Sneak in some homework. And sure, kids procrastinate. But they procrastinate because they want to have leisure and they feel absolutely no control over their lives.Good luck if you did a sport. I remember hearing some elite fencers talk and all of them said essentially &#34;yeah...I didn&#39;t get a lot of sleep in high school&#34;. That&#39;s not some innocuous hard work ethic mindset. That&#39;s messing with a developing brain and depriving it of a necessary resource.It pisses me off that we&#39;re just realizing that this culture of torturing teenagers is maybe not the best idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recall simply being unable to wake up for first period at 8am most days, in late high school. Waking was painful and nothing felt better than sleep. However at night, despite efforts at good sleep hygiene and consultation from a counselor, i couldn’t get to sleep before 11 or later. My grades and mood suffered greatly, as did the relationship with my poor mother. She battled with me day after day, first thing in the morning, to go to school.
The first few years of college I did not schedule any classes before 10am and had effectively perfect attendance. Mood problems faded as soon as high school ended.Even today, in my 30s, a day or two with poor sleep will make a noticeable mood dip regardless of circumstances.But as an older adult, I naturally wake up at 6:00 every morning. It was the same for much of my childhood except a few years of high school. So perhaps this was a developmental thing."</p>
