								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a NVidia shareholder I&#39;m relieved at this.  ARM is clearly less valuable as part of NVidia with all the conflicts of interest that entails than as an independent company.  NVidia talked about synergies but they could pursue all of those with an architectural license for far less money.  It&#39;s actually something of a pattern that most mergers fail to provide synergy and destroy value, it&#39;s just that they enlarge the empire of the CEO and so seem attractive from that standpoint."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Only two weeks ago SoftBank / Arm / Nvidia made a submission to the UK competition authorities with a singularly pessimistic view of Arm’s prospects as a stand-alone company [1]. I wonder if this was wise given the where the deal seems to be now.Whilst this is a bit overdone, it does highlight the challenges that Arm faces. If the Nvidia deal is dead - which seems likely - then floating clearly seems unlikely to offer the prospect of the return that SoftBank was expecting when it paid a premium for Arm.The key question from an Arm user / customer’s perspective seems to be ‘Can Arm as a stand-alone company finance the investment it meets to stay competitive?’[1] https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/61d81a458fa8f..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems crazy to me that Blizzard/Activision is worth more than Arm.
I get BA has tons of world-famous games, but almost every phone on earth is Arm. Arm is taking over laptops and servers too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wrote a thread[0] on Pixel 3 (trying to convince Google to extend the support) a few months before it went EoL[3] (Oct &#39;21). Here&#39;s the important bits:- 10M+ Pixel 3 devices that were sold worldwide- 72% of Pixel 3&#39;s estimated lifecycle emissions are from its manufacturing[1]. Using your phone is _not the source of most of the emissions during a phone&#39;s lifecycle_.- It has gotten worse over time, but Google hasn&#39;t offered better guaranttes. Pixel 5&#39;s emissions-over-lifetime are 30% higher than that of Pixel 3.The alleged reason Google can&#39;t offer support beyond 3 years is because of Google&#39;s dependence on Qualcomm for the support[2]. Apparently Qualcomm asks for a ridiculous amount of money to support any chip beyond a measly 2-3 years. Apple gets away with it by building their own chips, and Pixel 6 is guaranteed to be supported for 5 years as a result.However, the fact that Google - one of the world&#39;s richest corporation can&#39;t convince or pay Qualcomm to support a perfectly functional device in 2022 is astonishing.[0]: https://twitter.com/captn3m0/status/1427908406086553601[1]: https://storage.googleapis.com/mannequin/sustainability/repo...[2]: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/the-fairphone-2-hits...[3]: https://endoflife.date/pixel"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me. I had a Nexus 6P and after that experience I promised myself that I will never buy a Google hardware device ever again. The company has the wrong mentality regarding its handsets and how to take care of the customers who buy them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, Google needs really needs to do better.  Samsung has raised the bar by supporting its devices with 4 years of patches: https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/22/22295639/samsung-galaxy-d....  And frankly, how hard/expensive would it be to support these devices for far longer? Google is a massive company, and I see little reason why that can&#39;t employ a team of devs backporting patches to older phones. Current versions of Windows and Linux run happily on decades-old hardware, so a phone should at least be able to get patches for known security issues for a decade.  Dev resources would be far better spent on this than yet another hamfisted attempt to build a messenger app that they&#39;ll kill in a couple years anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a little embarrassed to say this and I don&#39;t know exactly what I pictured in my head, but I had no idea these telescopes were so big[1].I guess I never saw one pictured next to a human. I&#39;ve only seen pictures of satellites being worked on so I expected something more human sized? It seems so stupid now, especially since earth telescopes are huge.[1] https://svs.gsfc.nasa.gov/vis/a010000/a013500/a013522/JWST_v..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Destin of the Smarter Every Day YT channel had an interview a couple years ago with Dr. John Mather, the senior project scientist of the JWST, where he asked something like &#34;will you be nervous during the launch and deployments&#34;, and Dr. Mather replied &#34; I don&#39;t get anxious about stuff I can&#39;t deal with&#34;, and that they&#39;ve tested everything they thought of to test.I was super impressed with Dr. Mather, not only that he seemed so wise, but also that this super busy man took the time to do an hour long interview with a random You-Tuber. I think the JWST project is in good hands.Edit:
I guess Destin is not a &#39;random&#39; You-tuber, but someone that was well-placed to connect with Dr. Mather. Still, he&#39;s not CNN or BBC - he&#39;s a guy with a handheld camera that doesn&#39;t ask fluff question, but questions intended to help inform himself and his audience. Still think Dr. Mather thinking it was important to spend so much of his schedule with Destin was impressive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If any of the James Webb team are here, Congratulations! A phenomenal achievement.So excited to see first images and read about all the discoveries you are going to make. Exciting times!My daughters (7yo) class have been talking about it, she keeps coming home from school excited to tell me about the latest update on its journey. I love the fact we have these exciting things happening in space science to experience together."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seeing Night Watch at the Rijksmuseum a decade or so ago totally changed my view of seeing things in a museum vs. seeing them online. I&#39;m a child of the internet and had this view that seeing it on my screen was good enough, but wow is Night Watch incredible up close and in person. Overwhelming, almost. A totally different experience.That said, this image is amazing, and lets you see a lot more detail than you can easily manage at the museum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Me and the wife visited the RM in Nov 2019.  The painting is rather large, so 717 Giga pixels doesn&#39;t go as far as you would think but you get quite close to the textures that you would see close up.Whilst you are there, please note there is rather a lot more to see than the one picture.  The architecture is worth noting too.  My overriding impression of the piccies on display is: &#34;sumptuous&#34;.  That&#39;s probably not in the fine arts&#39;s lexicon of superlatives but my personal experience.The model boaty exhibition is not as jarring as it might sound, alongside some very serious artwork exhibitions and is great fun.  It doesn&#39;t seem to really belong there at first blush but I do understand that naval prowess is rather important to the Netherlander psyche, so perhaps that legitimises it.  It does give you a bit of relief after having rather a lot of important art thrown at you.All in all, I cannot recommend the Rijks&#39; highly enough.  If you go anywhere near the Low Countries, then slap it on your itinerary.  The coffee is quite reasonable in the entrance cafe, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apparently at some point in the past three pieces were removed from the sides of the painting.&gt; That’s why we’ve had so-called artificial neural networks working overtime on reconstructing the original appearance of the painting. Hour upon hour, the computers have been whirring away, recreating these missing pieces on the basis of a 17th-century copy.Interactive comparison of the missing pieces:https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/stories/operation-night-watch/...Zoomable image with the missing pieces added back in:https://i.micr.io/jfYIf/en/nw-met-missende-stukken-clean"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The malware is a cherry on top, but the story before that is pretty awful already, and unfortunately seems to be representative of specialized software like that: proprietary (with constant risk of malware, indeed), awkward, poorly (if at all) documented, likely the protocols to speak to the hardware without it are kept in secret, and occasional shipment of Windows machines where just software would do (but probably it&#39;s written to just barely work on a given system, and won&#39;t run on others easily).I think the main and annoying problem is those general practices, not just a single instance of malware.Edit: Apparently some focus on the &#34;Chinese&#34; part, but I suspect that hardware being specialized and software being shipped by the hardware manufacturer are larger factors here: at least all the awkwardness before the malware part I&#39;ve observed to be approximately similar with hardware+software produced by Chinese, European, and US companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given that Windows 7 _Ultimate_ was installed on what is essentially an OEM machine, it&#39;s very likely that it&#39;s a pirated copy with a &#34;home brewed&#34; license key.I think the most reasonable explanation is that either the OS was sourced already infected, or the crack tool they used was infected."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The story here is not the fact of the malware - it is the purpose of the malware: industrial espionage. China is well-known in industry for its sheer volume and brazenness of industrial espionage. A pick-and-place machine is especially well placed for this since it will, by necessity, have access to PCB designs and BOMs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;the biggest mistake I see engineers make is doing too much work on their own before looping in others&#34;&gt; &#34;For more senior engineers, it can happen because they like to work on their own and may be overconfident in finding solutions.  It can also happen if the team culture is toxic and engineers fear getting criticism early in the design process.&#34;Not saying the above statement is incorrect but here is an alternative explanation that is also viable: Senior Engineers are often hired into large large projects so that the company has the capability to address emergencies or modify the existing system accurately as it is often more difficult to work on a large complex code base than to build a new one from scratch. Those engineers sometimes never get to work on greenfield projects and &#34;doing too much work on their own before looping in others&#34; is a way to scratch this itch without the opportunity being taken away prematurely. It also offers chance to produce memorable work as nobody remembers the set of 3 point tasks you completed ten sprints ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m good at working on a team and looping in others. I also find it to be one of the most exhausting parts of software development. It&#39;s so difficult to constantly need to get feedback and buy-in from other people, and takes away a lot of the creativity and joy in programming (for me).Which isn&#39;t to say you shouldn&#39;t do it, just that it&#39;s one of the things that makes me dislike working on a team. I actually think this may be one of the factors in burnout for a lot of developers. Writing code as a team is almost like writing a novel with a few dozen other people, all of which have differing ideas on how the book should be written, or even what it should be about. It&#39;s hard to feel the joy in creating something when you&#39;re only a small cog in the development machine, and every decision needs a dozen voices of input.It&#39;s disempowering to feel like you&#39;re never able to make a decision yourself, despite supposedly being hired for your expertise in the field.&gt; Always encourage engineers to show their work as quickly as possible – an engineer on a project should never go more than a week without showing something, and usually it should be more like a day.&#34;usually it should be more like a day&#34; is bad advice in my opinion, and a likely source of micro management. Let professionals do their work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At least two things happened here:- The pandemic gave most people an unusually-long period of time at home to help them realize all the things they could have been doing (e.g. spending more time with family, not being stuck in a commute), if only their work had not been sucking up all their time and energy.- Income vs. expenses changed to the point where people couldn’t hope to pay off their debts even if they worked.  Work has not been paying anywhere near enough.  At that point, what is there to lose: if you will be swamped and in debt with work, and you will also be swamped and in debt without work, at least the 2nd option means finally not having to put up with the crap from many workplaces.Also, it has just become clearer and clearer where all the lies were told.  Society did not treat “essential” workers that way at all.  There was all kinds of prioritization of bottom line over employee health, especially early on.  We all assumed that governments could/would do a lot more to help.  Heap on all the unfilled promises for promotions, raises, etc. and many workers just have no reason at all to give a crap anymore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is the central bank inflation target typically 2%?Well if you target 0% and any actual result below 0% happens, that&#39;s deflation which is a disaster for economies.If inflation is say 10%. Maximum employment is near certainly impossible. Debt will be expensive and the economy crawls to a halt. Who wants to pay 10% interest on their student debt?So where in between do you have a good price stability? It tends to be around 2%. It allows for error in measurement, it provides safe cushion.The USA is at 7% inflation. This means the central bank is not doing their job. They by mandate should have drastically increased interest rates. Inflation almost certainly is out of control now. Looking at central bank balance sheets that are very far from balance, and looking at money supply M2. There&#39;s a solid 40% inflation coming. Lets say it sticks to 7%, this inflation will last probably 4 years.When inflation is so high and interest rates are not. The people winning are those in debt. Which is the government and youngins. However, it also means you cant save money. You must spend money as soon as possible. Tourism is dead for many years.Flipside, what does this also do? It pressures salaries. You are making 7% less this year but you&#39;re making 115% less the next year. So anyone in demand will be in demand and be able to buck the inflation curve.The people most hurt by high inflation are those who just retired. They no longer can demand more $ for their productivity. Their &#39;safe&#39; investments are way below inflation. They don&#39;t realize yet they cant afford to be retired."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Great Renegotiation is also a byproduct of inflation. Workers are seeking better pay to keep up with the rising cost of living.Keeping in mind small business is collectively the largest employer and contributor to US output... let&#39;s remember the coming rate hikes will greatly reduce available cash to small businesses that operate with credit lines, credit card debt or via home equity lines. That is a LOT of US businesses. Now add to this increased input costs due to inflation. Now add increased tax rates. You can also expect lending requirements will tighten.So, it&#39;s worth considering the odds of worker prosperity (vs) the odds of a wave of business failures and associated unemployment/underemployment in many (but by no means all) sectors.Personally, I think the Fed &amp; Treasury will continue fiscal stimulus and capitulate hard in the face of a deep recession. More of the same can kicking, and we&#39;ll see what seems like prosperity. In reality, it&#39;s a delay of an inevitable downturn unless some magical productivity innovation or goods/services advance emerges to rescue the US economy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; In a statement emailed to Polygon, a Nintendo representative confirmed the theory that Switch cartridges are coated in a material that’s meant to dissuade people from putting the units in their mouths.So under a kind of Streisand-esque effect, tons of people are now doing this who would never have done such a thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes. In the EU product &#34;denatured alcohol&#34; for most purposes is likewise treated with the same agent. This replaces the widespread use of methanol and similar products which are poisonous (yes even if you call the product &#34;meths&#34; it probably isn&#39;t methanol in the EU today). The rationale is that poisoning people is not an appropriate reaction to attempted tax avoidance. Alcohol is only &#34;denatured&#34; because booze is taxed, there&#39;s no technical reason to use poison, and so the EU took the poison out, for the same reason it doesn&#39;t execute or torture criminals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know this isn’t new but I still love that Nintendo did this. It’s such a Nintendo thing. They’re a toy company and think like one.Did Sony do this with the Vita cartridges? I don’t remember hearing so (and never thought to taste them?).Heh."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This isn&#39;t exactly a secret or new information... it was pretty well known when I lived on the peninsula 10+ years ago (thus the username, Poulsbohemian...). There&#39;s a state park right near the Hood Canal bridge where it isn&#39;t uncommon to watch the submarines come and go in and out of the canal. Always a bit surreal to push your kids on the swings while watching a first strike weapon capable of destroying the world pass by ;-D. I don&#39;t recall the name of the street, but there are houses with views across the water to what locals believed to be the dolphin pens..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All these links and no &#39;Johnny Mnemonic&#39; reference.  Takes place in 2021.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johnny_Mnemonic_(film)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This, together the news that North Korea also has weaponized marine mammals, makes me more saddened than from the usual dismal news we hear. Even the primal innocent are being roped into our primate rivalries. It gets even worse, as each side in such an umderwater war will blast away every cetacean it detects, just in case."</p>
