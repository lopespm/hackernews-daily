Instead of waiting for everything to be _done_ done, they’re bringing us all along for the setup, giving us “alpha” and “beta” images (if you will), and in so doing keeping interest in the telescope.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN, I made Back Of Your Hand, a map-based game where you&#39;re given random street names and you have to locate them on the map. You can play solo or compete with friends on other devices.I made it for my dad as a Christmas present. It also gave me an opportunity to learn about geocoding, etc.Tech: serverless, Leaflet, Turf, Svelte, TypeScript, Cloudflare pages. I tried to use as many open / free tools as I could. I originally used map tiles from OpenStreetMap but they were discontinued so it uses Mapbox and Maptiler now.Questions / feedback welcome. I also wrote a blog post with more information: https://adamlynch.com/back-of-your-hand. The code: https://github.com/adam-lynch/back-of-your-handWarning: it’s pretty difficult, unless your streets are numbered :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This would be actually helpful practice for first responders. FDs/EMS in my area are expected to memorize all of the streets in their region, and I imagine it’s the same for PDs too. Another layer on top of it would be to quiz you on how to get from a fixed point (the station) to a random intersection. For the US, you could also provide a random block on a street rather than an intersection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting. Did something similar with a self hosted version of geoguesser with my friends. We set it up right near our school. We have multiple routes walking home and the amount of precision we could get was insane. One of my friends was able to get only a few meters off from the original position almost instantly.I hosted it here if anyone wants to try 
https://geoguess.alexmehta.xyz/createmap (advanced map and draw your boundaries).I found it more fun than Back of Your hand just because I frankly don&#39;t remember too many streets but can recognize the overall area from walks I go on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you&#39;re leaning towards stripping all your writing down to list form, you may want to read Tufte&#39;s analysis on the role PowerPoint (aka writing everything in the form of bulleted lists) played in the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster [0]. I used to write exclusively in bulleted list/outline format until spending time with Tufte&#39;s analysis. Now I get that the connective tissue of the document is vitally important to the reader even if it&#39;s not important to the writer. If you don&#39;t put in the connective tissue, your reader has to do it for you and they&#39;ll probably do it incorrectly (leading to, for example, the failure to prevent the Challenger disaster).[0]https://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/teaching/courses/pi/2016_2017/phil/..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe I’m dating myself, but I was taught to start writing by coming up with an outline, which helps you organize your ideas into a coherent sequence. A list article basically makes its outline visible. The outline is also easily turned into an introduction that can address the non-list structure problem at the end of this article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The top comments aren’t doing the article justice. The article is really about the kinds of subjects that can be covered in depth as small sections that do not have dependencies between them. It explains the value of topics that can be presented this way, then explains these articles need to publicize this fact by claiming to be lists. Seriously well argued position and I recommend reading the whole thing.Notability the article is not about hierarchical bulleted lists."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"He had really interesting computational ideas about harmony. From The Nature of Order (2002) “As architects, builders, and artists, we are called upon constantly—every moment of the working day—to make judgments about relative harmony. We are constantly trying to make decisions about what is better and what is worse…”Following this, he published a paper on “harmony-seeking computation” as an approach to optimize “wholeness.” He identified 15 elements of wholeness in designs that might be measured, like the presence of coherent centers, strong boundaries, local symmetries or roughness/imperfection. He proposes that “the harmony that is sought in these computations is indeed what we otherwise call ‘beauty’. But the result of harmony-seeking computations are not merely pretty or artistic. In most cases, they are also better functionally and technically.”Alexander,   Christopher &#34;Harmony-Seeking Computations.&#34; International Journal of Unconventional Computing 4 (2008)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So the anomaly that the carrier group tracked, then scrambled fighter jets for.  The object that four different pilots saw visually, and was confirmed on multiple different sensors.  That was camera glare?The video is only one piece of the evidence.  The pilots are trained, and other sensor systems confirmed what the camera was showing.  This analysis is pretty flimsy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I honestly don’t know what to make of these observations other than I’m utterly convinced they’re not alien, super high tech or break the laws of physics (eg inertia). There was no alien crash in Roswell. I also file believe any government is competent enough for the claimed cover up and associated psyops.What I do find interesting is the overlap between people who buy into various conspiracy theories and people who are religious, were religious or would otherwise be likely to be religious.There’s some fascinating psychology here and I think it boils down to a combination of wishful thinking and the comfort derived from there being a Grand Plan rather than just a collection of random stuff that just happens.“Can’t be explained” is typically “hasn’t been explained yet”. Lack of an explanation is nothing more than that. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.I approach this from the other direction. Given the huge benefits of a Dyson Swarm and the fact that it seems to require no exotic materials and no more physics it looks increasingly likely that we are very alone in the Milky Way and even if we aren’t it requires an awful lot of hubris to suggest a species would spend the considerable effort and tens of thousands of years to come here and hide.Like this is Main Character Syndrome at its finest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"- David Fravor and his colleagues, are highly credible witnesses of something they observed visually.- This is certainly a very interesting interview: 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DIUBjvY4PnQ- There are visual observations, and what are, ( by military standards), flimsy short images/video.- This analysis partially explains one part of it, without excluding the presence of an object.- There is also Radar data, but it has not been published or time correlated to the reported visual observations.Observations:- These Aliens only seem to want to goof around with folksy US pilots.- Pilots known to simulate UFO sightings, fans of UFO invasion stories and stories of Russians shooting UFO&#39;s and getting shot back. ( watch the interview...).- These Aliens show up exclusively during their training time and with sightings restricted to areas with US carrier groups exercises.Also...- The Aliens don&#39;t show up with their &#34;Tic Tac&#39;s&#34; or seem to be interested on the Ukraine conflict.- They don&#39;t care about EU or Latin America citizens...- Don&#39;t  want to play around with the Russian or Chinese Air Force.- They don&#39;t show up in the data of any of the existing Military satellites capable of reading a bus ticket on the ground from 400 km.- These Aliens don&#39;t show up in the observations of the 
  thousands of professional and amateur astronomers,
  that scan the sky a total of thousands of hours every 
  night, using some of the most exquisite optical instruments available.I would say: They either don&#39;t exist, or if they do, they are pretty dumb and we have nothing to fear."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I canceled in January. It takes several clicks through buttons and sometimes small links. It alternates the styles with negative or positive wording sentences, alternate offers. They try to convince you to get an email reminder 3 days before the renewal date instead of canceling. After you canceled, the only call to action on the confirmation page is to cancel the cancelation. You immediately get an email to easily cancel the cancelation as confirmation that you canceled.I was prepared for a dark pattern fight, I was not disappointed!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Germany a new law will take effect on July 1st 2022, that obligates online shops to provide an &#34;easily accessible, clearly visible&#34; cancellation button on their websites, that allows to cancel any contract that has been established online or via App.The entire procedure is described very explicitly in the law and breaks down to a 2-step process:1. mandatory cancellation button, which, if pressed, leads to a2. confirmation page, where a defined set of parameters is requested and a confirmation button then cancels the contract.In my eyes the defined set of parameters on the confirmation page can easily been abused to make the process more difficult for the user.The parameters required are:1. Type of cancellation2. Unique identification of the user3. Unique identification of the contract4. The desired end date of the contract5. Means of electronic communication for cancellation confirmation (email)Topic 2 can be made very difficult and is in my eyes superficial - if the user logged into his account, he is identified IMO.Topic 3 is ambivalent, how do you identify an contract? By title and date, by ID? In my eyes there should be a popup with existing contracts to choose from (which can easily be done if the user is logged in).Topic 4 is prone to errors, because many contracts have notice periods. So the user has to do research on his contract and if he gets the lifetime/notice periods wrong his cancellation will fail.Information (unfortunately only in german):https://www.voelker-gruppe.com/stuttgart/kuendigungsschaltfl..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually just cancelled two days ago and was shocked at how painless and easy it was. But now I have my answer why- they got caught and the pendulum swung far to the other side.Presumably. The article doesn&#39;t mention anything about Amazon changing their policies as a result of being called out. But my experience was certainly not what was described in the article- basically a single button click.Big fat edit: OK, I was wrong. This article and the other comments here made me go double check and sure enough, the cancellation didn&#39;t go through. Perhaps I fell prey to a dark pattern, but I seem to remember seeing different pages. Maybe an A/B test. Either way, good timing on posting this article!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Couldn&#39;t find any introduction to the project on the blog but the official repo has more info on the background for the project:&gt;Rust is more secure than C.  Despite our efforts, it&#39;s all too simple to
mess up when using a language that does not enforce memory safety.  We
estimate that at least half of our tracked security vulnerabilities would
have been impossible in Rust, and many of the others would have been very
unlikely.&gt;Arti is cleaner than our C tor implementation.  Although we&#39;ve tried to
develop C tor well, we&#39;ve learned a lot since we started it back in 2002.
There are lots of places in the current C codebase where complicated
&#34;spaghetti&#34; relationships between different pieces of code make our software
needlessly hard to understand and improve.https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/arti"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well done and thank you to all involved. You are making a real
difference on the side of democracy, human rights and the values of
the free world at an uncertain time when so much is under threat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So at this point it is ready for passing traffic through a SOCKS proxy. Meaning we can `cargo run --release -- proxy` and redirect applications to use port `9150` for their network connections.Couple of related questions:- Does anyone know, in a Linux distro, how to pass all system traffic through a SOCKS proxy port? I&#39;m not looking for intermediary proxy handlers but an official method to force all user and system apps to use an arbitrary port.- If it is not possible to do so, does `NetworkManager` have a setting for this?- Is it possible to at least change Chrome/Firefox ports via CLI to an arbitrary port?"</p>
