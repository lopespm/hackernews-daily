These dimensions are:1. the number of Wikipedia editions of each individual; [i.e. number of languages in which this person has a Wikipedia article]2. the length, i.e total number of words found in all available biographies. […]3. the average number of biography views (hits) for each individual between 2015 and 2018 in all available language editions […]4. the number of non-missing items retrieved from Wikipedia or Wikidata for birth date, gender and domain of influence. The intuition here is that the more notable the individual, the more documented his/her biographies will be; [!]5. the total number of external links (sources, references, etc.) from Wikidata.We then determine the quantile values from each dimension and add them all to define our notability measureThey also have a table of what this metric throws up as the most &#34;notable&#34; from each time period: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01369-4/tables/3 and how the &#34;domain&#34; varies over time: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-022-01369-4/figures/2 (note Nobility and Religious in 500–1000, to Sports and Culture post 1950)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made an interactive art installation on this question once: A black box with a knob where you could adjust how much time you have, then it would offer you (Google streetview) panoramas of the locations it found within your distance, and in the end even print a paper slip with your travel itinerary to take with you.The installation used realtime data (Google directions API): I somehow figured out, that if I would run this from a local machine and reset the browser frequently, Google would let me do this even without an API key… they certainly sensed something was awry and I did get API warnings and captchas because of &#39;suspicious traffic on my network&#39;, but they were nice enough not to block me completely. I strongly doubt this would still work though, this was in 2017.Pictures and videos of the installation: https://maschinenzeitmaschine.de/derweil/"</p>

Maybe I wouldn&#39;t be so confused about it if I understood what use people have for their phones to hold so much compute.

It turns out that the world has moved on. Web pages are getting harder to read on small screens. I had to squint a lot. The phone&#39;s short height means that it often doesn&#39;t charge &#34;vertically&#34; in Qi chargers. It doesn&#39;t fit in my car&#39;s integrated phone holder, it just rattles around.And I really missed the zoom lens.So I&#39;m OK with the Pro, and I will get used to slightly larger phones.(The &#34;Max&#34; is still stupid.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We&#39;ve built an open-source low-code framework (https://github.com/ToolJet/ToolJet) with Tabler as the base for our UI components. choosing Tabler was one of our best decisions, it helped us ship new UI components faster."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Tabler and have used it for a few projects with great success.The title of the OP is not really accurate though. It&#39;s not so much a framework but a bunch of customization on top of Bootstrap and some pre-built templates for stuff _like_ dashboards, galleries, forms, etc. The site is more like a kitchen sink demo and documentation site for stuff you can pick apart and use in your own application."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Tabler. I&#39;ve used it for a few Rails projects and since Rails 7 it&#39;s even easier to integrate thanks to Import Maps. I can get a project off the ground even faster with this UI kit. I&#39;m already used to the Bootstrap classes and tags so this is just the final component for maximum productivity.I get some people don&#39;t dig the design but I think it look serious, and in general that&#39;s what dashboard are for, serious business. They need to be readable and simple to understand and use. Tabler gives that vibe.Edit: As an afterthought, I would really appreciate if anyone knows any similar projects. It&#39;d nice to compare and have more options. So far I havent found anything so compelling in this space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You would really hope there would be some far reaching repercussions for senior leadership at Google on this one. There are lots of projects that Google has tried and failed on, and sure, that happens. But this one is probably the clearest, obvious failure of execution. There is an absolutely crystal clear playbook of a Tech company forcing its way into the Gaming business. So how Google has managed to enter, completely fuck up, screw around partners, screw around customers and then leave all within the span of 3 years is just fantastic.And it&#39;s not just that, because Google&#39;s reputation for giving up on anything remotely difficult, no one bought into it in the first place. I would wager there are entire market segments that Google can just never enter now since they have done such a good job at branding themselves unreliable. It reminds me of a Petrostate where a country has huge wealth because of what they&#39;re sitting on, but that same wealth destroys their ability to develop anything meaningfully different."</p>

Stadia removes all fraction and means I don&#39;t need to install/update or have gaming hardware.The service is great. Despite it not being popular. It would be an absolute disaster for me if the service were to close."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32275078">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really appreciate when people use technical facts to criticize something, like with this. It is a well written take-down of the implementation of the Windows Registry as of both today and 2010.I suspect if the concept of the registry was created today it would look more like a database (e.g. Sqlite), although organizing it like a virtual FileSystem does have a certain appeal, and unfortunately I don&#39;t know of a database engine that supports such a layout. The Registry&#39;s Key-Value pairs are 1:1 with a database table&#39;s column-values pairs, it is just the multiple tiers of organizing &#34;folders&#34; above that that are a difficult implementation detail.The UNIX way is undeniably more flexible since it isn&#39;t a virtual filesystem, it is just a filesystem. The problem is that everyone invented their own configuration format to store configuration data in /etc and there&#39;s no format agnostic API to access that information (you can open it, but can you understand it?).Both UNIX and Windows suffer from the same orphan issue wherein information can be written, the application removed, and it is unsafe to ever remove it since you may not know the author and or all consumers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t feel like this article is good enough to be worth resharing 12 years later.It missed some of the key reasons why the Registry is bad and other criticisms (&#34;We have to write exactly the bytes Windows expects.&#34; yeah of course you do. It&#39;s only meant to be changed using APIs.) are not very well thought out.The criticism that the Registry is a janky filesystem in a single file is dismissed because you can do the same thing with ext3. That&#39;s not a good reason to dismiss it. Just because you can do a similar thing doesn&#39;t mean it is a good thing to do for the Registry. The Registry being a single file is a cause of a ton of problems, and is IMHO the root of all the other problems. If this were a better technical article it would go into that instead of hand waving it away. (E.g. it being a single file leads to the all or nothing nature of it. It necessitates the bad filesystem implementation instead of using the actual underlying filesystem, etc.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A point being overlooked by article and commenters: the records in the registry probably use in the order of 10-100 bytes each, while every actual file takes up at least around 1024 (EDIT: maybe more like 4096?) bytes. Putting tiny &#39;files&#39; into a special format is a no-brainer on the older computers that existed when the Registry was first created. I am assuming this was one of the motivations to create the Registry in the first place, to save space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just took a look at the quickstart guide. The way the code snippets are implemented is gorgeous. They are syntax highlighted, are formatted/indented exactly as they would be in the terminal, line breaks are indented correctly but css is used to make them easily copy/pastable without including any line numbers/indentation characters. Such a delight. Such focus on details. Makes me really confident in the rest of the project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congratulation on the 2.0 release. EdgeDB looks awesome. However, I will not advocate using it for any of my clients unless there&#39;s a clear path to derisking its adoption. Like all new software products/services there&#39;s a significant risk of it becoming abandonware. I&#39;d obviously want EdgeDB to succeed but how can one de-risk adopting it?
Would it be possible to somehow &#34;transpile&#34;  both queries and modeling scripts to readable SQL? That way, worste case scenario one may fall back on Postgresql without loosing most of previous work.
Let me be clear. I really like EdgeDB  and obviously want the best for and you guys but I do not think I&#39;m alone in thinking that we need a clear, easy and verifiable way to fallback to Posgresql if/when needed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to build local first software backed by EdgeDB. Similar to these tools:- https://replicache.dev- https://github.com/tantaman/conflict-free-sqlite- https://aphrodite.shI wonder if EdgeDB provides any utilities to make this already perhaps? Or community has to build some kind of CRDT software that builds on top of EdgeDB that will do local syncing? Maybe that&#39;s planned to be tackled for 3.0?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It looks like you are up to 175 posts of various workspaces. I didn&#39;t look at each one, but all the ones I saw were nicely staged, organized workspaces. Did you get any submissions for &#39;real workspaces&#39; with stacks of books, papers all over the place, and sticky-notes all around the monitors? If you did, did you reject them?I too, have a newsletter that I started last year about data management. I only have about a hundred subscribers so far, but I am trying to grow it with interesting articles about how computers organize, process, and analyze all kinds of data. https://didgets.substack.com/If I get a few thousand subscribers like you, I might look for sponsors too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kudos!Although it&#39;s an entirely different type of content/business, this reminds me of Humans of New York. [1] There seems to be a broad desire for simple, consistent content about the lives of everyday people. I think it may be a reaction to the increasing unreality of most larger media outlets, which have become very contrived and overly-optimized.If I were looking to start a newsletter, I would pick a similar everyday topic.1. https://www.humansofnewyork.com"</p>
