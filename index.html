								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is only tangentially related, but if you think you should buy a Kitchenaid mixer, you really should look at Bosch&#39;s offerings for a mixer instead. More than twice the wattage in the motor. My wife has been making bread with ours multiple times a week for almost 20 years. And you never have to stop the mixing to &#34;scrape down the sides&#34; like you do with Kitchenaid mixers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s why investors buy up houses: they know your neighbors will do the dirty work of artificially constraining the housing supply, which makes it a good investment.Here&#39;s one who comes right out and explains this:&gt; Meanwhile, local opposition to building is so commonplace and the approval process so cumbersome, time consuming, and expensive, even when a proposed project complies entirely with requirements, approvals are not forthcoming, at least in an expeditious manner and needed supply is simply not provided.  Recently I heard of a new acronym to add to my vocabulary: CAVE, Citizens Against Virtually Everything, to be added to NIMBYISM and BANANA (Build Absolutely Nothing Anywhere Near Anyone).https://www.clearcapllc.com/2021/04/27/q1-2021-clear-capital...Support groups like https://yimbyaction.org/ if you want to &#39;stick it to the investors&#39;.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If only so many people didn&#39;t treat land and houses like investments, there wouldn&#39;t be such a disastrous hoarding problem. Henry George&#39;s Land Value Tax [1][2] seems like an obvious economic fix that would require a large fraction of the population to change how they think about land and natural resources, but most of them are invested in such a way (i.e. owning multiple houses on multiple parcels of land, often without renting anything out) that it is in their economic self-interest to block any such proposals. Although, I suppose this situation isn&#39;t unique. The world has long been doomed by coordination problems.[1] https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/your-book-review-progr...[2] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_value_tax"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Bitcoin is positioned to disrupt the remittances industry in El Salvador, estimated at about $5 billion annually. Most families in towns like El Zonte do not have bank accounts, and rely on services such as Western Union WU +0.5%, which take 5-10% in fees. The closest Western Union is approximately one hour by bus, requiring the recipient of the cash transfer to take the bus back with cash on hand, creating a safety issue.&#34; [0][0] https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianakoffman/2020/07/14/this-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazingly shortsighted. The primary beneficiaries of this will be organised crime, who will now be able to wash the Bitcoin via El Salvador to convert it to dollars, which they can use to buy trade items and export the profits.The number one export of El Salvador is actually people. If they were concerned about remittance fees they could just set up a bank in the US with low fees, instead of getting kickbacks from OCGs and Western Union / Money Gram etc.El Salvador is set to be a big climate change loser, and every joule spent on bitcoin is bringing them closer to disaster.&#34;El Salvador has seen a steady increase in extreme events (storms, floods and droughts) during the last 30 years. The Pacific coastline is already experiencing rising sea levels and it is expected that 10–28 percent of the country’s coastal zone territory will be lost by the end of the century. Coastal areas, home to over 30 percent of the population, are highly vulnerable to the combination of sea level rise and El Niño events.&#34;https://www.climatelinks.org/resources/climate-risk-profile-...Coastal flooding risk is significant due to loss of mangroves.https://thinkhazard.org/en/report/75-el-salvador/CF"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To give some technical background: yes, using Lightning (as they seem to do) for affordable BTC payments is challenging for most. As far as I am aware that is why they rely on custodial solutions [1]. People hold their money with someone from their village they trust, which is not ideal but neither is being unbanked. Down the road I could easily see this trust being spread over multiple people using multisig wallets.The amazing thing about all this is that everyone can become a BTC &#34;bank&#34;. You need a bit of capital but orders of magnitude less than a normal bank would require, maybe 2k$ to get started of which you might spend 400$ on hardware and fees to open some channels. The trustless nature of lightning lets you and your users then join the global payment network without asking for permission from anyone and you can engage in commerce internationally.I think, while we are still early, that this is an awesome experiment. It will highlight the UX problems so we can fix them. Hopefully at some point all this will make sense to the average westerner too, so we can finally have a money not controlled by anyone (states, incumbent banks) again. But that might take a long time.[1] https://github.com/GaloyMoney/galoy#status-of-the-project"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Your problem is not with SMS as a second factor though. (Unless you think the attacker had your password as well). It is with the use of SMS as a single recovery factor.The very things that make SMS a uniquely good second factor make it an awful only factor. Use of SMS for account recovery should in general (or at least for important accounts) have a delay (order of days) that allows the real user to intervene."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lost my Microsoft account years ago. I still get emails from Microsoft stating that there&#39;s suspicious activity on the account. I got two just yesterday.Despite that, despite still having access to the email the account is on, I cannot recover the Microsoft account. Despite Microsoft notifying me that the account is still, years later to this day, being abused, cannot use any form of recovery. I cannot access the account with help from support or even after visiting a brick-and-mortar store.It&#39;s one big reason that I&#39;ve long since refused to purchase anything more from Microsoft and have ditched Windows.Good luck recovering your stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As others have said, it is not that SMS 2FA is insecure; it is that thieves have figured out how to defeat it using SIM jacking and a bit of facebooking and googling.  It is now trivial to figure out your home town, your favorite pet, etc.  Also as others have said, the current alternatives have their problems.  What if you lose all your Yubi keys?  What if your phone was accidentally wiped and you never got around to backing it up?  You cannot prove you are you and so customer support cannot help you.  Google, Microsoft, and Apple are not known for helping consumers get themselves out of this catch-22.It is a mistake to ask consumers to protect, backup, and secure their digital lives themselves.  Consumers don&#39;t have the time or skills to keep up with the hackers.  If Apple, Google, ATT, Verizon etc. cannot provide digital security, this is an opportunity for someone else to step in.  My personal suggestion is this is a ripe opportunity for someone like the US Post Office or Department of Motor Vehicles.  Consumers would go to the US Post Office or DMV and purchase a Yubi key from them.  The additional value they add, is they can verify the identity of the consumers who is purchasing the Yubi key and replace the key if it is lost/stolen.  Similar to how they process driver licenses or passports.  This service is optional and would actually cost money.  I would gladly pay a monthly fee for this peace of mind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am really curious to see where we&#39;ll be in a year, two, three down the line wrt remote/office/hybrid work at major companies.This forced experiment has had some surprising outcomes about the effectiveness of remote workplaces, but working from home for only a year, in pandemic conditions, is clearly not the same as indefinitely in normal times. But there&#39;s reason to think that may go even better, not worse; I am really curious to see how it plays out and glad more companies are continuing to let people work remotely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been back in my company&#39;s office in person (medium-sized tech company) for the last week with a small subset of employees before we all go back, and I&#39;ve become pretty convinced that these hybrid models will not go well. Even while wearing masks and social distancing, I feel far more connected to the others that work in the office, and whether it&#39;s fair or not, personal connection and trust play a huge role in collaborating effectively and deciding who gets what work, who gets promoted, etc. If everyone can choose whatever combination of remote and in-person they want, it seems impossible to me that there won&#39;t be extremely strong in-group/out-group effects that will cause big organizational problems for companies. But I&#39;m saying this as a young person excited to work in person, so maybe others (parents, those with long commutes) feel it&#39;s still worth it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I currently have 10 fully remote engineering jobs. The bar is so low, oversight is non-existent, and everyone is so forgiving for under performance I can coast about 4-8 weeks before a given job fires me. Currently on a $1.5M run-rate for comp
this year. And the interviewing process is so much faster today, companies are desperate, it takes me 2-3hrs of total effort to land a new job with thousands to chose from."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Vivaldi Mail? That took a while :-DVivaldi is developed by a team created by the former Opera founder and CEO. Vivaldi kind of tries to re-create the spirit of Opera, but I think it&#39;s going to be too hard to do it.For those who didn&#39;t use it, Opera was first a paid browser (which limited its reach), then an ad-supported browser (which again limited its reach). It then finally became a free browser but by then it was too late.It had its own, super fast, rendering engine (I forget its name, Presto?). It had a built in email client, feed reader, calendar (unfortunately with no Exchange or Gmail integration), a notes app, a powerful download manager and even a Bitorrent client. And a TON of features and UI flexibility.It was super compact, a marvel of engineering and UX design that managed to pack all those things in a package of about 5MB at the time, and you wouldn&#39;t even see or load the extra functionality like the email client if you didn&#39;t use it.Unfortunately with HTML5 and the Chrome-ification of the web, it couldn&#39;t keep up :-(Vivaldi tries to do the same on top of web techs and web techs just can&#39;t handle it. Web techs are almost as flexible but they&#39;re really slow and bulky.Still, I wish them luck."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to offer Vivaldi some praise, I switched to it as my main browser a few years ago, and it&#39;s been great. I had to look for a new browser when Firefox (that I had used since the Firebird days) kept breaking my settings and plugins with their updates. After yet another Firefox update I wasn&#39;t able to restore the browser to how I want it to be, so I tried Vivaldi.I&#39;m not even a big fan of the original Opera, but love Vivaldi&#39;s features such as easy screen splitting between two tabs and one-click actions to disable images or apply certain filters to a page. Picture-in-picture and pop-outs for media are also great, periodic tab reload is occasionally very useful.Ideally I&#39;d like to use a fully FOSS browser, but my patience with Firefox ran out, and Vivaldi is Chromium + custom open-source parts + closed-source UI layer. Good enough for me, though not ideal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I switched to Vivaldi from Chrome earlier this year as I was uncomfortable with the level of Google integration in that browser.Vivaldi is based on Chromium and has lots of improvements over Chrome, like gestures out of the box, side panels, lots of clear options. And Chrome extensions work perfectly.
I&#39;ve had no issues so far.The complexity of managing a browser engine that does what everyone expects requires humongous resources so I can understand the move to Chromium. As long as the google bits are removed and the extensions work, it&#39;s great to have an alternative to Edge and Chrome.I mostly use Firefox as my daily browser and nothing would make me abandon it but it&#39;s nice to be able to segregate your various professional/private persona using different browsers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I&#39;ve pointed out before, I think this problem didn&#39;t exist in 01974, or in CP/M at all, ever; I think CP/M was perfectly capable of creating files named AUX.H, or PRN.H, RDR.H, CON.H, LPR.H, etc.  IIRC, even CP/M PIP (which is what actually implemented the special device names) required the colon to indicate that you meant a device.  So if you wanted to print FOO.DOC on the printer in CP/M PIP you could say PRN: = FOO.DOC but not PRN = FOO.DOC.  You could also, I think, say B: = FOO.DOC to copy FOO.DOC onto drive B:.The problem was introduced, IIRC, in MS-DOS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I knew what this was going to be as soon as I saw &#34;aux.h&#34; in the screenshot.Some years ago I was working on an embedded system that involved DisplayPort. For those unaware, DP&#39;s control channel is called AUX. One day, my new co-worker who used Windows asked me, who used Linux, why my AUX-related code wasn&#39;t checked in - which it most certainly was.And that, folks, is how I learned about this absurd property of Windows that exists to this day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thread inaccurately describes the limitation of these special names being on the &#34;OS level&#34; -- it&#39;s actually one layer down, in the DOS and Win32 subsystems. Windows NT doesn&#39;t throw fits about these file names if the subsystem you run under (see: POSIX, LXSS, OS/2) doesn&#39;t care about them. Cygwin can even override the Win32 behavior by just passing all its file handlers through the native NT API instead of the Win32 API."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The mob is a huge problem with Twitter (and adjacent social media), and the issue with a mob is purely that of its size. It&#39;s the size that makes the mob, and everyone who has ever considered chiming in to add their voice why so-and-so was bad should stop to think about whether the world really needs that additional voice. Each individual voice may be perfectly right. So-and-so may really have done wrong. But did they really do such wrong that the 10,000th voice is needed?I am ashamed to say I&#39;ve done it myself, back when I was on Twitter. My feed would start lighting up with some really Bad thing that so-and-so said -- and generally it was &#34;Bad&#34; -- and I&#39;d add my voice somewhere to that cacophony. Not necessarily writing to the Bad Person, but chiming in on someone&#39;s long thread.Now I look back and see I was another participant in the mob.Look, the author described in the post absolutely did herself no favors. Her book may have been great, but the way she interacted with people on social media was absolutely not. But being the 10,000th person to tell her that is never necessary. That&#39;s just wanting to join a mob, because mobs are fun, because you&#39;re all justified in this act together.Mobs are scary, because everyone thinks they are justified. A good friend of mine grew up in Kenya and recounted that when he was about nine, he saw a mob catch a thief. Joining in with everyone else, he took a wire and whipped the man. Next thing he knew, the crowd had put tires over the alleged thief and set him on fire. He has never forgotten the guilt he felt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not that the people who form a twitter mob don&#39;t think or &#34;let twitter think for them&#34;.It&#39;s that they actively enjoy hurting someone as a mob. They get a kick out of it, and it&#39;s not discouraged (as would be actually forming a mob out in the streets be). If anything, it&#39;s encouraging, and gives them not just the joy of kicking someone who is down, but also &#34;good person&#34; credits (because the one getting kicked is a bad person, of course).In other words, people are not mislead &#34;against their better nature&#34;: they are just encouraged to embrace their badness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are so many comments here blaming Twitter while blissfully unaware that HN fuels the exact same online outrage. Almost every day there&#39;s a &#34;&lt;company&gt; did bad thing to me&#34; article on the front page and people immediately pick up their pitchforks and join the mob. You cannot fix the problem without acknowledging that we are all part of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"By the way, Sci-Hub has stopped adding new articles to the database for a few months now (background: https://www.reddit.com/r/scihub/comments/mk46x4/scihub_v_els...).It would be great to develop a truly decentralised solution. Having a database of individual torrent links for each paper might be a start."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way SciHub is being treated by governments is pretty infuriating. There&#39;s a tiny minority of people who have an interest in keeping SciHub off the internet, and they&#39;re generally neither the researchers who write the papers, nor those who want to read them. Despite this, the power of the state has been used repeatedly to keep SciHub inaccessible and limit their ability to get funding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years back, frustrated with increasaed DNS blocking of Sci-Hub, I wrote a quick DNSMasq hack (haq?) to return Sci-Hub IPs for any &#34;sci-hub.&lt;domain&gt;&#34; possible.  The shins-n-grits factor of surfing &#34;scihub.elsevier.com&#34; were palpable.https://old.reddit.com/r/Scholar/comments/7m3uin/meta_if_you...As others have mentioned, Sci-Hub also maintains a Tor presence, and you can access the Onion link using the Tor browser (provided you can install that on your desktop or device).https://scihub22266oqcxt.onion"</p>
