								<p class="story__comment_others">"Might be similar to the last time this came up (i&#39;m looking for it now, edit: found it[0]) where the developer worked with a sizable development-for-hire firm that were themselves associated with many other dev accounts, some of which ended up being suspended for ToS violations (possibly by this firm, possibly by the customer without the firm&#39;s knowledge). The anti-ban-evasion technology Google runs then effectively poisoned this firm&#39;s Play developer profile so that anyone working with them would be suspended for the potential ban evasion, eventually.Note that, for this specific case, it might not be a firm but one of the developers themselves that has a poisoned account thanks to past dealings that violated ToS. I imagine the system only banning by associate if the $25 developer account itself ever uploads an app so that it doesn&#39;t ban associated Google accounts for non-play-developer purposes.0: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19124324 (comment explaining https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19124463 )"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Parallelism with the computing units in GPU permeates the entire computing model.  For the longest time I don&#39;t get how partial derivative instructions like dFdx/dFdy/ddx/ddy work.  None of the doc helps.  These instructions take in a number and return its partial derivative, just a generic number, nothing to do with graphic, geometry or function.  The number could have been the dollar amount of a mortgage and its partial derivative is returned.It turns out these functions tied to how the GPU architecture runs the computing units in parallel.  The computing units are arranged to run in parallel in a geometric grid according to the input data model.  The computing units run the same program in LOCK STEP in parallel (well at least in lock step upon arriving at the dFdx/dFdy instructions).  They also know their neighbors in the grid.  When a computing unit encounters a dFdx instruction, it reaches across and grabs its neighbors&#39; input value to their dFdx instructions.  All the neighbors arrive at dFdx at the same time with their input value ready.  With the neighbors&#39; numbers and its own number as the mid point, it can compute the partial derivative using gradient slope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Mesa 3D - driver library that provides open source driver (mostly copy of AMD-VLK)Wrong, wrong, very wrong. No copy here. Mesa&#39;s RADV was developed completely independently from AMD, in fact it predates the public release of AMDVLK. It&#39;s also possibly the best Vulkan implementation out there. Valve invested heavily in the ACO compiler backend, so it compiles shaders both very well and very quickly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many people are seeing all these different vendor specific CPUs as a win. I&#39;m a bit more skeptical, but perhaps that it unwarranted.But Apple, Google, and Amazon are now creating their own ARM CPUs for their own products. So most of FAANG, all if you count the ones with consumer products.The first version of these CPUs will be very ARM compatible, as they are trying to drive adoption to of their silicon. Once there get a leg up they will start adding patented operation to their stuff. And then we&#39;ll end up with a fragmented CPU field driven by corporate greed.And because they are not OEMing this hardware, they really have no incentive to be cooperative with the others. Similar to older gaming console that had custom and experimental architectures.However it is obvious why this is all happening. And that is Intel and Qualcomm inhibited growth and squeezed too much profit from the market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting, I remember when Nokia exited the chip business in 2007. Up until then they had a lot of in house expertise for that. A few of my colleagues in Nokia Research were pretty upset about that at the time. In retrospect, this became a contributing factor to their demise. Their reasoning was that chips were a commodity, which at the time was correct. However they then backed the wrong partners (e.g. Intel, MS) and got cornered in a market they used to own and dominate. Windows phone and MS get a lot of blame for this. Also betting on Intels failed mobile strategy and going for Wimax instead of LTE definitely did not help.But the key thing was outsourcing their core technology bit by bit. And that started in 2007. By 2012, a lot of Nokia factories no longer existed and production had moved to China and they had changed software strategy so often that it all got very confusing.In the space of about five years they went from being the largest smart phone manufacturer to selling out to MS who then unceremoniously pulled the plug on the whole thing because there was very little left in terms of tech and skills worth salvaging. Windows Phone was a dud. Nokia as an Android phone manufacturer did not make a whole lot of sense (they actually launched one Android phone just before MS took ownership). Around the same time they also launched what could have been a Meego flagship device but was effectively a dead end when they killed off the entire team before putting that in the market.Already in 2010, Apple felt they needed to do the exact opposite and have more control over their hardware. Fast forward 11 years and now world + dog is doing their own chips. And Apple of course dominates the phone market with a strategy of basically doing everything in house. Just like Nokia used to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If such efforts are not curbstomped early, we&#39;ll end up with fully closed computing devices architecture, belonging to different vendors who provide whole vertical from bare metal to OS. There will be Google&#39;s processors/OS/software, Apple&#39;s, Samsung&#39;s, plus some shit CCP will come up with, like, TikToks, and all of them will be mutually incompatible, with own programming languages and data formats. The future looks bleak."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m a “true believer” in CRDTs, which I have some experience in. You can implement a useful CRDT for simple applications in under 100 lines if all you care about are standard database objects - like maps, sets and values. List CRDTs are where they get complicated, but most applications aren’t collaborative text editors.The promise of CRDTs is that unlike most conflict resolution systems, you can layer over a crdt library and basically ignore all the implantation details. Applications should (can) mostly ignore how a CRDT works when building up the stack.The biggest roadblock to their use is that they’re poorly understood. Well, that and implementation maturity. Automerge-rs merged a PR the other day which brought a 5 minute benchmark run down to 2 seconds. But by bit we’re getting there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its a good article but it should be noted that this very much is a web-centric view of Offline First and its challenges. When I say web-centric, I mean as opposed to offline-first on a mobile app.Native apps dont deal with the same issues around storage, and are actually _much_ more performant overall. If you haven&#39;t done an offline-first app, I highly recommend it. The experience is magical. You can fly around your app at the speed of the users touch. Content is magically loaded as soon as its clicked on. Its amazing as a user.As for similarities, conflict resolution is a universal problem and is either the most difficult or second most difficult problem [1] to solve. What makes this more difficult is that there is no one-size-fits-all for this. You need to have a deep, nuanced understanding of your system and what makes sense for your use case in terms of resolution strategies. Then you need to implement them, which is not easy especially if your backend is bog-standard REST on a classic SQL datastore.I&#39;ve enjoyed reading the past 2 rxdb articles on this (the one mentioned here as well as the one from a couple days ago [2]). Its great to have more content on this publicly available, when I was getting into offline-first I only had a couple options.[1] - At the end of the day, offline-first is a whole bunch of caching, and so you end up needing to deep dive into cache invalidation strategies which we all know is a hairy problem.[2] - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28690427"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been working on offline-first apps (CouchDB/PouchDB + Cordova/Capacitor and published via App/Play Store) in the last years and can definitely relate. But some points to add:- The 7 days IDB limitation does not apply for apps that are published through the stores- Conflicts can happen, but depending on your design they might not matter in practise. „Implement a proper conflict resulution strategy“ has been on my „todo: maybe“ list for over 3 years now but was never important enough.- Data migration is not needed as long as schema changes are additive (new doc fields, new doc types). Design carefully early on, keep track of „abandoned“ properties and you&#39;ll rarely need a difficult migration.- Depending on the performance of your customers&#39; phones and the amount of data your app is processing, it (JS -&gt; ... -&gt; IDB and back) might not be fast enough. I had to add caching layers for some use cases. But at some point, you probably want a proper state management library anyways which should include caching nearly for free.- You can (and should!) still consider most of your data relational. There is even a relational-pouch plugin. But I&#39;m strongly missing foreign key constraints and better DB-level data validation than CouchDB&#39;s design docs provide."</p>

SBCL is amazing and aside from calling C directly, it is still very fast. Python is slow without its specialized libraries from the C-world, but SBCL produces short, readable code that is pretty efficient. There ECL[2] for an embedded Lisp, or uLisp[32] for really small processors like the ESP chips.[1]  http://lush.sourceforge.net/

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I write Clojure for food, and Common Lisp for fun. One reason for the latter is CL&#39;s speed -- awhile back I compared a bit of (non-optimized) Clojure code I wrote for a blog post with a rough equivalent in CL, and was stunned that the Common Lisp code ran about 10x faster.  This made me curious as to how fast it could be made if I really tried, and was able to get nearly 30x more[1] by optimizing it.Clojure is definitely fast enough for everything I&#39;ve done professionally for six years.  But Common Lisp, while having plenty of rough edges, intrigues on the basis of performance alone.  (This is on SBCL -- I have yet to play with a commercial implementation.)[1] http://johnj.com/from-elegance-to-speed.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I miss my common lisp days, and I think rust being able to export C ABIs makes it a really great companion language for CL. I also think common lisp (or really, any fast lisp) is a really great tool for game development. The fact that you can redefine a program as it&#39;s running really helps iterate without having to set up your state over and over. Pair that with a fast, low-level language that can handle a lot of the lower level stuff (been trying to find time to look at Bevy on rust), and you have a killer combo.The main reason I stopped using lisp was because of the community. There were some amazing people that helped out with a lot of the stuff I was building, but not a critical mass of them and things just kind of stagnated. Then it seemed like for every project I poured my soul into, someone would write a one-off copy of it &#34;just because&#34; instead of contributing. It&#39;s definitely a culture of lone-wolf programmers.CL is a decent language with some really good implementations, and everywhere I go I miss the macros. I definitely want to pick it up again sometime, but probably will just let the async stuff I used to work on rest in peace."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dear Microsoft,You fools, you own a gate to the internet. When i search 8*9 in the start menu, show me the result of the multiplication instead of a link to &#34;search web for  8*9&#34;. Make the menu auto-complete with the titles of the first 5 web results instead of random ads. Make it work well as an actually useful extension of search. Forget about edge and bing.com, you will care about the brand name later. (You can thank me later with a sizeable compensation package)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Part of the problem Microsoft have is that they just set the default to bing, people open it and don’t know what it is so search google.These same people don’t know how to change their default search so keep searching for google.If they wanted these people to stay they should get rid of their background image and just give a search box like google does - basically trick people into staying."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Alt-F2 on KDE brings up krunner - a small text input floating dialog in which you could type, say, 8 * 9 , and be gifted the value 72.  No spam accompanies this result.Alternatively if I type &#39;hacker&#39;, I shall be shown the three windows I currently have open, along with the 7 bookmarks, that match that string.Otherwise it&#39;s a handy shortcut to launch any application I know is installed on the local host.I believe it&#39;s consistently been providing this service for more than twenty years.Compare ctrl-escape on Microsoft Windows, which should offer much the same experience.Often while using Microsoft Windows I am trying to find a way back to a fleeting pop-up that graced a corner of my screen before I could fully read or act upon it.  This invariably fails to provide a sensible result.  For example, type &#39;update&#39; if you wish to search for, but certainly not find, the source of the various noisy &#39;Windows Update&#39; notifications.  Prepare thyself for disappointment.*"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Supervisory managers brandishing Agile + endless meetingsPersonally for me - this led to burnout and I have quit last two jobs that used Agile faster than I have the 2 before that didn&#39;t use Agile. Agile is very clearly being misused to turn developers into factory line workers whose productivity can be measured by number of commits, reviews and docs they put out every two weeks. And the meetings it takes to do Sprint planning, stand-ups, reviews, demos, retros are really killing any possibility of developers having a flow of uninterrupted time to do what they need to.And the burnout article linked in the OP makes a great point about inputs to development teams not being measured. At some places developers are left to spec out stories and others have Architects / Tech Leads do it - in either case that in itself is a large chunk of work that takes up huge amount of time that no one is rewarded for in any way!Mostly though keeping the churn going is what gets really tiring - do most orgs have work that a) needs to be done every two weeks and b) can be done in two weeks perpetually? The pressure leads to manufacturing bite sized requirements that can be demoed in two weeks - the real impact of that work is almost always never evaluated. Combine this pressure with time crunch that prevents people from spending quality time together to ponder bigger, high impact problems and collaborate on solving those within the meeting heavy Agile process and you are never going to get anything meaningful done.This is not to say Agile itself is bad - it takes effort and skill to use it effectively but managers seem to be taking the easy way out to create a factory line kind of setup where random requirements keep getting thrown and every two weeks you are supposed to roll out _a_ solution. The trouble is software / IT is not at all like rolling cars out on a factory line so it all falls apart.Edit: By Agile I meant Scrum really."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reads to me as yet another screed by someone who has never worked outside the tech industry. Software Engineering is IMO the best, most privileged job available in the US, and I suspect in much of the world. Life-long tech workers have no idea how much worse conditions are even for “knowledge workers” in other fields.Case in point, when we get a tired of the office grind we can publish a manifesto that slams tons of people we’ve worked with in the past (with no fear of consequences from those burned bridges), move to a resort wherever we want, and still expect to either make great pay with benefits while fully remote, or realistically start our own business with a great chance of success (and can easily raise funding to defray the risk if we want to).I’m grateful to work in software. It’s a wonderful thing that we have so much privilege. And so of course, at a time when the world has been quite stirred up and most of our lives affected, it’s great to see many engineers have the freedom to change jobs to fit their lives better, and that they’re exercising that freedom.But could we observe and write about all that without the anger and entitlement? For anyone who has worked in other fields, or even less in-demand jobs in tech, it just comes across as whiny and out of touch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree this is a phenomenon right now, but I feel that article is vastly overcomplicating it, and not necessarily accurately.I&#39;d suggest simply:- software engineers are hugely in demand- software engineers have worked out they can work well remotely, and often prefer it for a combination of productivity and work/life balance reasons- software engineers are voting with their feet and finding work that suits their needs - and many firms are losing talent accordingly due to not meeting the needs of those staff"</p>
