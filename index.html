								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An aside:&gt; L3 cache is shared by all cores of a CPU.I recently learned this is no longer true! AMD EPYC processors (and maybe other recent AMDs?) divide cores into groups called &#34;core complexes&#34; (CCX), each of which has a separate L3 cache. My particular processor is 32-core where each set of 4 cores is a CCX. I discovered this when trying to figure out why a benchmark was performing wildly differently from one run to the next with a bimodal distribution -- it turned out to depend on whether Linux has scheduled the two processes in my benchmark to run on the same CCX vs. different CCXs.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epyc shows the &#34;core config&#34; of each model, which is (number of CCX) x (cores per CCX)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The culprit was a shared atomic reference counter (Arc). The cache invalidation across cores eliminated any kind of scaling via multiple threads.The solution is to stop sharing. The author had to make changes specific to this codebase for each thread to have its own copy of the offending dataset."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The notion of &#34;lock-free&#34; is fundamentally misleading.It trips up everybody who hopes &#34;lock-free&#34; will be a magic bullet freeing them from resource contention bottlenecks.When you have explicit locks, aka mutexes (condition variables, semaphores, what-have-you), the interaction between your threads is visible on the surface. Replacing that with &#34;lock-free&#34; interaction, you have essentially the same set of operations as when taking a mutex. On the up side, overhead cost may be lower. On the down side, mistakes show up as subtly wrong results instead of deadlocks. And, you get less control, so when you have a problem, it is at best harder to see why, and harder to fix.Because the lock-free operations involve similar hardware bus interactions under the covers, they cannot fix contention problems. You have no choice but to fix contention problems at a higher, architectural design level, by reducing actual contention. Having solved the problems there, the extra cost of explicit mutex operations often does not matter, and the extra control you get may be worth any extra cost.What is lock-free good for, then? Lock-free components reduce overhead when there is no contention. Given any actual contention, performance is abandoned in favor of correctness. So, if you have mutexes and performance is good, moving to lock-free operations might make performance a little better. If performance is bad, mutexes and lock-free operations will be about equally as bad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an egregiously editorialized headline, but this was the easiest way to submit two separate links to LKML in one HN submission --- link to Fillipo&#39;s tweet about those links.The @zx2c4 Filippo is referring to is Jason Donenfeld, of WireGuard fame. It was news to me that he&#39;d taken over the Linux kernel random driver! But it&#39;s welcome news indeed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The popularity of the Blake family annoys me, as I feel that it&#39;s overhyped. Sure, they&#39;re fast (on current hardware), but they&#39;re supposed to be cryptographic hash functions. I know that BLAKE received some scrutiny in this regard, as part of the SHA3 competition. But then BLAKE was obsoleted by BLAKE2, which in turn was obsoleted by BLAKE3, making the claims to security less and less sensible.And all this is before the actual winner of SHA3 comes into the picture. With parameters as specified by SHA3 it&#39;s a lot slower than BLAKE3, but it is my understanding (IANAC) that(1) The SHA3 security margin can safely be decreased, as NIST set the security requirements too high. This is one of the reasons for the speed difference.(2) The sponge-based crypto popularized by Keccak (the SHA3 winner) is much more amenable to cryptanalysis than the more traditional crypto such as the functions in the Blake family. This means that Blake&#39;s security would be less sure even had it received the same level of scrutiny. But AFAIK Blake received much less scrutiny than Keccak, or even other sponge-based functions, such as the ones in the NIST Lightweight Crypto competition.https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/lightweight-cryptographyhttps://keccak.team/2017/not_arx.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note for those who only read the headline: the 3x speedup was achieved by removing a call to RDRAND in the extraction path, not the change in hash function."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Three independent, but somewhat related thoughts on this topic:1). On HOWTO articles about infra (1/2): I&#39;d like to see more articles that lead with requirements, rather than setups that then justify the setup with requirements. Like, congrats, you managed to host a bunch of web applications via containers on a dedicated server. It&#39;s really nice for a super personal project and I&#39;m sure it helped OP gain a lot of operational experience across several domains, but I just find this type of article to be &#34;DYI porn&#34; for a highly specific subset of DYI.2). On HOWTO articles about infra (2/2): Is there any sort of comprehensive infra setup guide out there? Even something that just covers &#34;core&#34; AWS services (CloudFront, EC2, ELB, ECS, Lambda, CloudWatch, CloudTrail, and a few others...) feels like it would be incredibly useful for so many people.3). &#34;AWS on Rails&#34; - I feel like we&#39;re getting close to a time when &#34;AWS on Rails&#34; emerges and we see the birth of a new opinionated tool that says &#34;Most people just want to ship their product, not fiddle with cloud infra. Do it our way and you can focus on product instead of infra&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I (my company) use a similar approach: a single dedicated server with docker containers, by using dokku [0], for an heroku-like self-hosted PaaS.Most of our applications are either:- app developped in-house (django/flask): Procfile + deploy with git push- standard app with a docker image available: deploy directlyDokku comes with useful &#34;service&#34; plugins for databases, auto https (letsencrypt), virtual hosts... Overall, a good experience.[0] https://dokku.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Someone deleted an interesting comment about adversarial interoperability [0]I’d love to see and give money to a project to create and maintain easy to use and stable “adversarial interoperability” APIs for as many services and products as possible.Perhaps companies and projects would not often use these directly because of the risks (hopefully some would, though!) but individuals could drop the library or the URL to a server hosting it into their apps to gain extra features.If standardised, whole open source apps could be built around them that allow querying and analysis of data from services and aggregating and automating using the services including optimising prices, taking advantage of offers, and using undocumented APIs to the users advantage.Maybe something architected and incentivised like https://thegraph.com/ for adversarial intercom and undocumented APIs. Building as a network of nodes and funding with crypto would make it harder to attack and take down.[0] https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2019/10/adversarial-interopera..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t understand the way this was implemented.They are bound to get in trouble with Google for this, but they can’t easily pull the feature.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People look at me like I’m insane when I tell them I’m packing up and taking a year off.I’ve f’in had enough. And that’s me, the wife and our two kids- not quite school age. No I haven’t FIREd. No I’m probably passing up a raise and a promo (or maybe not). Super linear growth requires super linear decision making. You either follow the sheeple or decide enough is enough and make some drastic change. Im not getting these years back and for the life of me can’t understand those who say, I’m gonna work till I’m 55 and then I’m done.Anyways HN fam- I’m already done.Here’s to 2022See y’all in Penang."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like there is wisdom in &#34;Make hay while the sun shines.&#34; When you&#39;re young and unencumbered by responsibility and family, when your cognitive abilities are at their peak, when your energy is endless, when your body is strong and healthy, when your knees work, and your fingers can type without arthritis: that&#39;s the optimal time to work and earn. Min-max that salary and stay healthy. Due to compounding interest, a dollar made in your 20&#39;s is far, far more valuable than a dollar made in your 60&#39;s. Every morsel you make and save early means your retirement comes earlier. There will never be a more efficient time to earn those days of leisure that will come later if you stay healthy.Take that vacation to Bali when you&#39;re young, and you are wasting your prime, strongest days that could be making you financially secure and/or independent. Go windsurfing for a year in Ibiza after college, and you&#39;re adding 5 years to your working life--retiring at 62 instead of 57. It didn&#39;t sound like much time when I was young, but today, as I turn elderly, I&#39;m counting down the years until I can finally retire, and kicking myself for goofing around when I was younger. If I could do it all again, I&#39;d have tried harder to get into big tech early, I&#39;d have taken comp and 401(k)s and advancement more seriously. I&#39;d have played fewer video games, traveled less, and relaxed on the beach less.Life isn&#39;t short--it&#39;s LONG, and you have a brief moment in that life to maximize your preparation for the rest of it. Use it wisely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pithy, but true.It&#39;s only half the story, though. Moderation and balance are the real key. Overwork is not good in the long term. But underwork can also be a problem, even when employers let it slide.Starting in my 30s, my friends who operated in the extremes of overwork or underwork started to diverge from everyone else. Overworked people were burnt out and had few friends and social connections left. Underworking people were often first to be laid off and slowly fell behind in their skills relative to everyone they were competing against for jobs.Most of them found balance and got back on track, but I know a few holdouts who went all-in on the vagabond life of traveling the world and having fun, as well as a few who have just disappeared into their work and have basically lost social skills at this point.Balance and moderation aren&#39;t really that difficult when you make them a priority. Especially in this job market where employers aren&#39;t squeezing employees as hard because everyone has so many alternate opportunities."</p>

I&#39;m sure, at this point, someone already explained them.That reporter is a victim of harassment, and that if it wasn&#39;t for &#34;view source&#34;, it could be for some unrelated stuff. It&#39;s the same as protesters being arrested for all kinds of bogus reasons, or random people being arrested with planted evidence. The goal is to deter someone you don&#39;t like from exercising their legal right (journalism, protesting, standing in the street in the wrong neighbourhood), by weaponizing unrelated laws.The only reason &#34;view source&#34; is being talked about is because that looked like the best case when the book was thrown at that journalist.I hope that case remains at threats and doesn&#39;t get to actual charges."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really tried to like macOS for an entire year. I used Yabai[1] as tilling window manager which is much better than Amethyst mentioned in the article. I also wrote my own compose key tool macos-compose[2] and rofi-like clone choosem[3] (eventually bought into Alfred).Yet with all of this effort I still went back to linux after a year (Arch with Qtile and Gnome). What really killed macos for me was the fact that animations could not be disabled entirely and everything felt like it&#39;s behind several ms of a delay. I work on the move so I don&#39;t have the luxury of multi-screen setup so switching between programs, workspaces and windows is the most important part of my workflow - it just drove me nuts.Now I run simple Lenovo yoga laptop with arch+qtile+gnome and honestly, my performance at work at least doubled. That&#39;s my anecdote anyway.1 - https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai2 - https://github.com/Granitosaurus/macos-compose3 - https://github.com/Granitosaurus/choosem"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did the exact opposite. I was on MacOS since 10.2.But lately I felt things have become way too locked down (both hardware and software), too dumbed down (too many apps resemble mobile apps with limited functionality) and too opinionated. Sometimes I just want things differently. Another reason was that many new features are specific to iCloud integration and as I use many OSes (both computer and mobile) I could not take advantage of those anyway. I need cross platform. So a lot of selling points became irrelevant.I moved to FreeBSD with KDE on top and it felt like a breath of fresh air finally being able to set up my system the way I want it. This is so empowering.It became my daily driver about a year ago and I haven&#39;t looked back though I still use Mac and Windows for work, Windows personally for gaming and Linux for some servers.Of course I lost some stuff too like Apple&#39;s excellent multi DPI and great hardware integration. And many apps that were great like pixelmator. But I gained a lot of configurability and the ability to upgrade my hardware again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me Linux is about freedom. Other systems might be better in UI/UX or performance (e.g. give more FPS in games for NVidia cards), but I remember the times when Microsoft dominated the IT world and it looked scary.All corporations strive to fragment the market using non-compatible technologies and then to monopolize the market by consuming other fragments.This strategy failed in the 90s with the arrival of Linux. Although many times I felt like the whole world will become Microsoft/Wintel, I think we barely missed.Now, corporations are trying to do it e.g. via forcing everybody into the cloud and killing open protocols. E.g. I have several email accounts and I can&#39;t gather mail from all of my mailboxes in one application. Situation is even worse with Calendars. I have two jobs and also my own personal calendar server and I can&#39;t collect all my calendars in one app also. I have to routinely check Google Calendar, because even though I can add it to my Thunderbird Calendar, moved or canceled events changes are not propagating to Thunderbird. And I can&#39;t integrate Microsoft Outlook calendar into my Thunderbird at all.I really don&#39;t want to rely on whims of one corporation. Also, regarding MacBooks: I remember when the touchbar had no alternatives and it is really awful. This is what monopoly means: you have to live with bad decisions. You have to pay absurd money for a piece of cloth or a roller for the desktop case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite part of the Nintendo story is that back when it was a playing card company, the heir to the family business took a trip to America that included a meeting at the largest card company in the world.He had expected it to have a luxurious, palatial campus… but its entire headquarters turned out to be like the fourth floor of a single building in a generic office park. He was like, “This is the absolute pinnacle I can ever hope for if I succeed beyond my wildest dreams running the playing-card company. I need a new idea.”You can read all about it in an outstanding book called I Am Error that, beyond extensive interviews with the historic key players, also takes an incredibly deep dive into the technical details."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Netflix had considered offering movies online, but there were speeds and bandwidth problem in mid-2000.One of the more interesting things I learned from the (outstanding) documentary &#34;Enron - The Smartest Guys in The Room&#34; [0] was that Enron planned an online movie streaming service together with Blockbuster in the late 90ies (to start in 2000), but failed for the same reasons.&gt; Enron would store the entertainment and encode and stream the entertainment
over its global broadband network. Pilot projects in Portland, Seattle and Salt Lake
City were created to stream movies to a few dozen apartments from servers set up
in the basement. Based on these pilot projects, Enron went ahead and recognized
estimated profits of more than $110 million from the Blockbuster deal, even
though there were serious questions about technical viability and market demand [1]But of course Enron &#34;pivoted&#34; to outright fraud some years before that.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDyMz1V-GSg[1] https://pubs.aeaweb.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1257/0895330037658884..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Twitch started out as Justin.TV, where Justin Kan wore a camera on his head 24/7 and livestreamed the results.Then they expanded to a small handful of streamers, then anybody could stream, but it never really took off and they were running out of runway.Then they noticed that the one area growing faster than any other was videogame streaming, and rebuilt the whole company around that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some previous discussion on SciterJS here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24797423The issue is that this isn&#39;t actually an Electron alternative; the author is upfront about this not actually being a browser-compatible rendering engine. It&#39;s just a rendering engine that happens to use some subset / superset of HTML, JS and CSS, but it is not compatible with web libraries and components.As a basic example, SciterJS crashes loading the &#34;hello world&#34; ReactJS project (at least it did last time I tried it - the author recommended I used a custom version of React he publishes). It&#39;s perfectly fine to come up with a lightweight cross-platform UI rendering engine (we know we need more of those), but having it web-adjancent while not really web-compatible is a recipe for frustration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see, in this thread, talks about what Sciter does and does not offer.It&#39;s not the only alternative to Electron, but it might be one that offers predictable and repeatable results.I released a small open source project on HN last week (https://github.com/Fusion/pngsource) and I wrote its backend logic in Go. I built the frontend using Tailwind (https://tailwindcss.com) and DaisyUI (https://daisyui.com) and, using Go compiler flags, I can release the app using both WebView (github.com/webview/webview) (which, yes, does require the host OS&#39; collaboration) and Wails (wails.app) (which also does.)On Linux/AMD64, the binary&#39;s size is 3.7M when building for WebView, and 6.8M when targeting Wails.The way the app works is I drag/drop files to the UI, magic happens, and I use github.com/ncruces/zenity to prompt the user for a save location.I cross-compile the apps using xgo (https://github.com/karalabe/xgo)It&#39;s been working pretty well on Linux, Windows, MacOS. I think WebView&#39;s approach of limiting the feature set is working well as it feels more &#34;native&#34; than Wails (better refreshes and resize operations for instance)However, I already have a few tickets reporting that, for instance, the app is displayed as a blank window in some environments. And it&#39;s hard to debug remotely, obviously. So, this is where Sciter may be a better option."</p>
