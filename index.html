								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting way to approach it, my approach might be less technical, when someone comes to mind randomly, I just txt them with:  Hey, you just popped into my mind, I hope all is well with you and yours!

It&#39;s simple, lightweight, and you&#39;d be shocked how often the other person pings back.My completely un-scientific view is that most people think of others once in a while. Perhaps we&#39;re too busy to reach out, or the guilt of getting out of touch makes it hard to push through that resistance. I just push through it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some comments here claim that he is treating people not as friends. IMO these comments are not charitable a interpretation. While it is a plausible interpretation, I have strongly learned from HN to be charitable and optimistic when reading someone else&#39;s point of view. I know with topics like this that perspectives vary more wildly among people, so let me show you why I can be more optimistic in my interpretation.I think it&#39;s perfectly fine to separate emotions and reason like this. The reason: I am on the other side when it comes to managing my friends: I am not separating reason and emotion. Because of that, I am failing hard at staying in touch with people that I would like to stay in touch with (I am noticing it with certain friends of my as well). I am succeeding to stay in touch with a few people, but if I&#39;d have a system like this I might be able to stay in touch with many more people that I&#39;d like to stay in touch with anyway but for some unknown reason have some sort of blockade or friction.Other than that I think the interpretation is not charitable enough, I also have personal experience that it might be wrong. For example, I view the dating markets strictly from a market perspective that is heavily inspired by micro-economics and &#34;common sense&#34;. Initially, such a perspective is detached from emotion, but there are certain points where it is attached (e.g. with supply/demand questions like: &#34;what do I want/need from a partner&#34; or &#34;What can I offer? What do I want to offer? What do I need to offer?&#34;). Moreover, upon meeting people there is empathy, sympathy  and human intuition involved. Sometimes the emotions will be so strong that I have a compulsion towards meeting a person again (e.g. falling in love). Those emotions are not helping! Sometimes I feel the right amount that is also in line with my other needs and in other cases I don&#39;t feel enough about a certain person when I don&#39;t see them (but when I do see them, I am delighted to catch up).Management of personal life != how people are on a moment by moment basis in personal lifeI think by having a system like this, you can put Dunbar&#39;s number to shame."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think so-called ASCII-art is more in the spirit of Markdown.The nice thing about the original Markdown (modulo bugs) is that things are written the way one would write plaintext documents which are supposed to be easily read in a text editor.  So you don’t write bullet lists like this:- Bullet 1 - Bullet 2 - Bullet 3And hope that some post-processing will add linebreaks for you.  You write it like this:- Bullet 1- Bullet 2- Bullet 3Similarily there have been many tools that let you add so-called ASCII-art diagrams to Markdown documents.The spirit behind the kind of thing in the OP, on the other hand, is that one should get nicely formatted HTML from Markdown for the purpose of online consumption.  Which is a very different goal.So if I were to judge the syntax itself (since that is what matters most to the original spirit of Markdown.pl) I would say that it seems pretty decent.  Not as “declarative” (!) as ASCII-art, but most probably much easier to edit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks very single-use and way too verbose. There should be a replacement of SVG that is not XML based and easy to use"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m super excited for this!One thought though, on the syntax. Wouldn’t it be a bit odd if suddenly this line in a README.md:   ```js
   const foo = 1 + 1
   ```

Rendered as:   `2`

? Isn’t that kind of what we’re doing here with the mermaid source tag? That tag is for showing source code, no? Feels like there should be another tag for rendering it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had an XPS, top of the line with full warranty/premium support. Horrible experience. They swapped many models to a shitty wifi card that caused bsod. I had to spend over 15+ hrs with support to finally convince them the fix was to swap the card to the original Intel and not doing another system restore or reformat.Then the battery. Oh the battery. The computer would randomly wake up from hibernate and drain the battery till it was dead. This also caused premature drain. Guess what? Dells batteries are rated for less cycles (half compared to apple) and this seemed to coincide with the end of my warranty period (time to buy a new one) but it doesn&#39;t even matter because their premium support only covers battery replacements for the first year!And get this! They only sell refurbished batteries. Just everything about this company is trash.The XPS is a nice line. It is very premium, but only skin deep"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The conflict between the market wanting systems that are (a) as small and light as possible and (b) as fast as possible means that modern systems are designed to have close integration between the platform and the OS to perform appropriate thermal management. If the OS doesn&#39;t indicate that it supports doing this, the hardware will run in a much more constrained mode. Apple can do this without too much trouble since they implement the whole stack, but it&#39;s more complicated in the PC space. Intel have a spec called Dynamic Power and Thermal Framework (DPTF), but the useful part of it is the adaptive thermal policy, and Intel refuse to publicly document it.I reverse engineered a chunk of this (https://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/54923.html) and it got merged into Intel&#39;s Thermal Daemon (https://github.com/intel/thermal_daemon) which /should/ improve things, but it&#39;s complicated by this mechanism allowing for vendor-specific controls that are usually implemented by having a background service running under Windows that triggers them.There&#39;s multiple things that can be criticised here:
1) Intel pushing OEMs to adopt a technology that they (a) don&#39;t document and (b) don&#39;t write proper Linux support for
2) Canonical not making it clear that OEM certification only requires that the system work, not that it work as well as it does under Windows
3) Dell not figuring out a decent solution for this, even for systems that they nominally support Linux onDell could build hardware that doesn&#39;t rely on adaptive thermal management, but that hardware would either be bigger or slower than competitors&#39; hardware. Fixing this unilaterally is hard - we need an open spec that&#39;s implemented by both hardware vendors and integrated into mainstream Linux distributions. Given where we are, the easiest way to get there would be for Intel to publicly document DPTF."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a reminder: don&#39;t buy Dell, they have a history of ignoring issues and refusing to fix.The US needs to adopt EU-style consumer laws."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This last summer/fall really put things in perspective for me.  We did a major outdoor renovation at our house, which involved landscapers, plumbers, electricians, and carpenters.Every day these guys would show up at 8am and long sleeves and jeans and hard hats, work super hard, pee in a port-a-potty, and be exhausted by the end of the day.  They worked out in the 100 degree heat as well as the rain as the job got near the end.  Luckily the bosses were pretty cool and provided them with decent food for lunch and plenty of drinks (but I still offered them food and drinks too).I on the other hand was working at my desk in my air conditioned house in comfortable clothes.  A few times a day I&#39;d put on my flip-flops and wander around outside to check on their work, ask a few questions, and then head back in when it got too hot.And a couple of times the plumbing sprung a leak just as they were getting ready to leave, despite their best efforts to get all the risky work done early, and they they had to stay super late.  Once the plumber was here till midnight after arriving at 8am.I used to have thoughts about how it would be nice to have a job with totally spelled out requirements that end at 5pm and then you have the rest of the day off.  But no more.  I&#39;d much rather work at my comfy desk inside and deal with the occasional call at 9pm on a Saturday than deal with what they all went through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A professor of mathematics noticed that his kitchen sink at his home leaked. He called a plumber. The plumber came the next day and sealed a few screws, and everything was working as before.The professor was delighted. However, when the plumber gave him the bill a minute later, he was shocked.&#34;This is one-third of my monthly salary!&#34; he yelled.Well, all the same he paid it and then the plumber said to him, &#34;I understand your position as a professor. Why don&#39;t you come to our company and apply for a plumber position? You will earn three times as much as a professor. But remember, when you apply, tell them that you completed only seven elementary classes. They don&#39;t like educated people.&#34;So it happened. The professor got a job as a plumber and his life significantly improved. He just had to seal a screw or two occasionally, and his salary went up significantly.One day, the board of the plumbing company decided that every plumber had to go to evening classes to complete the eighth grade. So, our professor had to go there too. It just happened that the first class was math. The evening teacher, to check students&#39; knowledge, asked for a formula for the area of a circle. The person asked was the professor. He jumped to the board, and then he realized that he had forgotten the formula. He started to reason it, and he filled the white board with integrals, differentials, and other advanced formulas to conclude the result he forgot. As a result, he got &#34;minus pi times r square.&#34;He didn&#39;t like the minus, so he started all over again. He got the minus again. No matter how many times he tried, he always got a minus. He was frustrated. He gave the class a frightened look and saw all the plumbers whisper: &#34;Switch the limits of the integral!!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This comment and its top reply are dead on:https://old.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/sm54ri/a...No job is going to get you away from unreasonable people with unreasonable expectations, and most trades introduce a bunch of other unpleasant things that you&#39;d have to deal with.It&#39;s all tradeoffs. Someone may legitimately prefer the stresses of a trade to the stresses of working in software, and that&#39;s great for them. But it&#39;s not an objectively easier path: if it were, plumbers would be much less expensive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a multi-week long social engineering scam targeted at Thomas. Thomas has a Discord for a drone transportation startup, and the scammers proceeded to embed themselves in the community and provide valuable labor such as web design and graphics design in order to earn his trust.Thomas&#39;s wallet is public and advertised on Twitter via his ENS domain. He had $100M+ in aETH, a derivative token provided by Aave when you lend out your assets for interest. The aETH is redeemable for the underlying asset.The scammers created a fake NFT project associated with space and drones, and proceeded to give Thomas a free one, but asked that he stake it (or deposit it into a smart contract), to earn yield in the form of Armstrong ETH, a token they made up that had the same acronym as Aave&#39;s (aETH).The catch was that when he went to stake his NFT, they asked for an approval for spending aETH from his wallet. Approvals such as this are normal when interacting with smart contracts, since the contract has to be &#34;delegated&#34; responsibility over the tokens in order to move them. However, what wasn&#39;t normal is that the approval was actually for Aave ETH.If he had only looked at the front end of the scam site, it wasn&#39;t obvious what was going on. However, a quick glance at Etherscan revealed that he had signed off on an unlimited spend approval for Aave ETH.Luckily, he had done so on a fresh wallet and not his main wallet that has $100M in aETH. When the scammers tried to get him to stake a second NFT from his main account, he got suspicious and discovered the truth.This scam was specifically targeted at Thomas, and orchestrated over multiple weeks, for the specific assets in his primary wallet.Couple takeaways:- divide your assets across multiple wallets. New wallets are free. Don&#39;t put all your eggs in one basket.- use a hardware wallet or an audited battle tested smart contract such as Gnosis Safe for storing significant sums of money.- always verify your transactions- avoid associating your public identity with your main wallet / vault address- be careful, scammers are getting more creative and advanced in technique including standing up professional front end websites to give the appearance of legitimacy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can get behind cryptocurrency and stuff, but the idea that anyone can write a contract that says &#34;I get to do what I want with your money&#34; and then build their own custom, one of a kind UI with no way to limit what the user thinks the button does for you to sign such a transaction, it&#39;s got to be the biggest, most massive security hole I&#39;ve ever seen brushed off. You want me to put the title to my house on it? You want code to be law?This shit isn&#39;t ready for the mainstream, and some of these architectural decisions are indicative of engineers who are in over their heads (but that&#39;s almost all code nowadays, even mine).They build a mechanism that enables me, at the click of a button, to give away control of my fortune, and they designed the system so that anyone can design whatever interface they like to get you to sign any transaction they like. It&#39;s laughable. I&#39;m in disbelief. And this is web3? No thanks, I think I&#39;ll stick with bitcoin or whatever, keep it simple. At least I can tell what a bitcoin transaction does without having to learn a programming language."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was an absolutely fascinating and chilling story.The thing that struck me about it is the scam didn&#39;t work for a few reasons:1. He typically had a practice of not using his main wallet for things like this.2. He got wary and actually read the smart contracts.This is a level of technical competence required that&#39;s going to mean most people have to offload this to a trusted intermediary. And then what&#39;s the point of all the decentralization ideology? Because we just re-invented banks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems like a lot of people are missing the point of this one.PG/YC invest at the earliest stages. The information they need is pretty much:1. What are you doing?2. Do people like it?3. How big is the market?4. What are you/team like?Could you cover all of those in a formal business plan? Sure, but you can also do so in a short-form application that&#39;s 1/20 the length or in a 10-minute back-and-forth conversation.You don&#39;t have to ever view formal documents or financials to do that.That is PG&#39;s broader point, and isn&#39;t really that controversial IMO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting to contrast this with PG&#39;s most recent essay &#34;Putting Ideas into Words&#34; where he argues that people who don&#39;t write don&#39;t have fully formed ideas. What else is a business plan besides a thoughtful writeup? I think it would give me a good idea into how a person thinks.[1] http://paulgraham.com/words.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He invests in seed rounds where those often go down the drain.The things that matter at this stage are:Founders and general market size. So sure, ignoring the noise of those two makes sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blind person here, happy to answer any questions. I&#39;m speaking from the perspective of someone born blind, so whatever ends up working well for me might not work as well for someone just losing their sight, though I tried to take that fact into account.The most immediate suggestions that come to mind are:1. Learn to use a screen reader. You don&#39;t need an expensive one. NVDA on Windows, Voice Over on the Mac and Orca on Linux are the way to go. NVDA is probably the least quirky and easiest to find resources for. I&#39;d recommend against Orca, while it can be used, we all know how tricky Linux on the desktop can get, and throwing a screen reader into the mix doesn&#39;t help.2. Forget about the mouse. Screen reader users use the keyboard exclusively. Try disabling the screen too, many sighted users who practice with a screen reader end up relying on what they can see, which makes things more difficult.3. Accept that inaccessibility is a fact of life, and it has to be worked around. Not all tools are accessible, and some are more accessible than others. If you&#39;re looking for an accessible IDE, Vs Code is great and constantly improving. Emacspeak exists, but I don&#39;t actually know anyone who uses it, and I know quite a few blind people in tech. Some things that you&#39;re now doing through a GUI are best done via the command line, Git is a good example. Programming tools usually aren&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s everything else that causes issues. Slack and Zoom work great, for example, but many smaller collaboration tools don&#39;t.4. Not all areas of programming are equally accessible. I can&#39;t imagine a blind dev working exclusively on the front end, where there&#39;s a lot of CSS involved, and where you have to look at Figma designs and debug issues solely based on screenshots. Backend stuff is much more accessible, same with lower-level systems programming. Dev Ops is very much a mixed bag.I&#39;m happy to answer any further questions either here or via email, my HN username at gmail dot com."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was born blind, so this is just my experience interacting with others who lost their vision later in life. It&#39;s likely your friend will want to focus more on counseling and therapy to adjust to the fact that they will be totally blind in a short time. Instead of figuring out if Voiceover on Mac OSX or NVDA with Windows and WSL is better they should get the help they need to figure out how to do all the daily things they used to. How are they going to be able to cross streets, go out to a restaurant or bar on their own and navigate around, etc. How will they match clothes, cook without being able to see the stove or microwave, etc. All these things are possible although with the lack of info on your friend&#39;s location I have no idea what government or private support there will be for this kind of rehabilitation service.
NVDA with WSL2 and VSCode is what I use for development, Mac OSX and XCode was a garbage fire last time I tried it four years ago. Some of that may have been the fact that I was not nearly as comfortable with Voiceover but Apple made no effort I could see to interact with the accessibility community at that time. My understanding is that iOS development is more accessible with Swift UI but I&#34;m not spending $1000+ for a secondary computer to try it out."</p>
