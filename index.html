								<p class="story__comment_others">"Forgive my ignorance but it seems that one major problem with crypto-exchanges is that they don&#39;t necessarily have any assets other than the crypto that has been deposited there, which means all overheads (which I am assuming for some of these guys is $Ms/year) can only come from trading crypto unless they are charging reasonable money for the privilege of using their exchanges.In the FIAT world, banks make tonnes of money from things like loans and mortgages so they can handle some risk by holding onto cash.If this is true, how does it get fixed? Is there any reason someone would take out a loan in crypto and pay interest on the repayments?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pardon for living under a rock, but why are crypto exchanges affected by the mood in the crypto market?I thought that a crypto exchange functions like a currency market: I put an offer to sell 10,000 EUR for 1 BTC and someone else puts an offer to buy 10,000 EUR for 1 BTC. When orders cross, a transaction happens and the exchange gets a fee, whether in currency or crypto units.What are crypto exchanges fundamentally doing differently that they are suddenly losing money?Surely a drop in transactions would make them lose fees and require them to fire some staff, but I expected a &#34;Facebook-like&#34; downsizing, not a full-blown bankruptcy.What am I missing?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"3blue1brown linear algebra + the linear algebra chapter from “all the math you missed but need to know for graduate school” - linear algebra and abstract vector spaces in general finally feel familiar.Also, timbuktu manuscripts - showed a history that I had never really heard of. These are written manuscripts of african scholars which are hundreds of years old, and still exist today. Some record the history of great west african civilizations along with other things they studied (e.g. science, religion, math, literature, ect). I was never taught this history even existed but yet was made to learn the various details about asian, european, middle eastern, central/south american history. This, and the attempts to destroy/steal these manuscripts at various points in history, made it click how serious power of controlling information, and ultimately influencing beliefs can be, with respect to giving legitimacy to the various rulers/authorities. Beliefs/perceptions matter quite a lot. This 1hr lecture is quite good: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lQiqyyRfL2Y&amp;t=16sBehavioral biology class from Dr. Sapolsky (Sanford) - explains a lot of why we behave the way we do, from different biological perspectives https://m.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLqeYp3nxIYpF7dW7qK8OvLs..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No book. Just one course.I was a rather humble support guy for COBOL applications, so I had to learn COBOL, which I did.I was sent by my manager for a one-off, three-day &#34;advanced COBOL&#34; course.It wasn&#39;t about advanced COBOL; it was an advanced course on the seven-pass Burroughs COBOL compiler. Memory was short in those days, hence the seven passes; intermediate results were files on disk. We learned that by nulling the executable for a chosen pass, we could hack the intermediate files, to do things COBOL programs weren&#39;t supposed to do, like calling OS functions.I learned how parsers work, and how parse trees are represented. I learned about intermediate code, optimisers, interpreters, and code generators. I got interested in compilers, and wrote a source-level debugger. It was just a three-day course, but it was incredibly valuable to me. Perhaps life-changing.Perhaps it&#39;s not so much that that course made something click that wasn&#39;t clicking for me; rather, it inspired an interest in me that simply wasn&#39;t there before.As I said this was a one-off course. There was about seven of us, and I don&#39;t believe anyone else ever received that training."</p>

Russ Cox, one of the technical leads on the Go language, made the same mistake in the regexp package of the standard library.https://go-review.googlesource.com/c/go/+/355789"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A while ago at my company we switched from GCC to Clang, and noticed a couple of massive regressions (on the order of 50%?) in performance having to do with floating point.After profiling for a bit, I discovered that suddenly a lot of time was spent in isinf on Clang and no time in GCC… Clang was emitting a function call where GCC wasn’t. I happened to randomly change isinf to std::isinf (it’s a random habit of mine to put std:: in front of these C functions). Suddenly the regression disappeared! I guess on Clang only std::isinf was a compiler intrinsic while GCC recognized both? Anyway, that’s my small-change optimization story."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing that this piece really got me thinking about is how many other crypto companies are the same ponzi scheme because they are counting made-up things as assets on their balance sheet.In other words, suppose I create token SCAMMER, and I say its supply will be capped at 1 million tokens (or 10 million, or 100 million - that&#39;s the &#34;nice&#34; thing about crypto, I can kinda choose whatever number I want), and then I&#39;m able to sell 10 of those tokens for $100 each. According to FTX math, I now have $99,999,000 of assets on my balance sheet, but of course if I actually tried to sell a lot of my &#34;kept&#34; tokens I would tank the SCAMMER price.Even better, and I think what is probably more common in the crypto industry: suppose I get my buddy to create a SUX2BEU token. I tell my buddy I&#39;ll by 10 SUX2BEU tokens for $100 each if he buys 10 of my SCAMMER tokens for $100 each. Now suddenly we can both say we have huge assets on our balance sheets! Until, of course, someone decides to pull aside the curtain covering the wizard.So many ponzi schemes on top of ponzi schemes..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I often joke that crypto has been run by gold bugs who were forced to &#34;smoke the whole pack&#34; on fiat currencies. So a lot of crypto is a nihilistic homage to federal reserve systems.In that way, &#34;DeFi&#34; feels the same about the finance industry.It was no secret that SBF hated traditional finance. And so I assume he refused to learn anything from it. But what he ended up creating was almost a hilarious parody of the financial system.That&#39;s at least how I can square the circle about how someone who could criticize Lehman Brothers for letting themselves get overleveraged on shady asset classes could literally have negative 8 billion dollars in &#34;Hidden, poorly internally labeled ‘fiat@’ account&#34; and then publicly go to Twitter to say they have a &#34;liquidity problem&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m horrified by so many of the comments here that seem to lack even the most basic of human decency. Allow me to fill people in for those who have never uprooted your life and moved across the world for a job. It is a massive commitment on the part of the employee, where you sell the majority of your earthly possessions, property, cars, etc. Then you go through an immigration process which even if its handled by FAANG involves a ton of work. You get to the new country, find a place to live and start to adjust.So to do that to someone and then days later be like &#34;we actually don&#39;t want you&#34; is beyond shitty. This persons visa is dependent on their employment so now they get to go into a city they don&#39;t know and try desperately to find employment with an employer who is interested in sponsoring someone from abroad (which is a small fraction of the total employers).For all you budding Elons, here&#39;s a shorthand for it. If you ask someone to move across the world and don&#39;t need them anymore, give them three months on the books to find somewhere else that don&#39;t count against their visa. It will give them a chance to get settled and go on interviews. Or don&#39;t recruit internationally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So many commenters here (presumably US/CA citizens) don&#39;t realize that the gut-wrenching feeling of being laid off whilst your visa depends on uninterrupted employment is _nothing_ like the SHTF-but-all&#39;s-ok feeling of being laid off &#39;regularly&#39;.In the USA, for most work visas, you are given a 60 day death clock pleasantly sugarcoated as a &#39;grace period&#39; to find a new employer or leave the country. Cue trying weave in that baggage in between screening calls &amp; technical interviews to explain to prospective employers how you have 47 days and 15 hours left to be hired or leave. The complication of dealing with USCIS and attaining a work visa (usually bound to your employer) is a marathon even with unlimited time, but in a puny 8 week window?...In my own experience this also happened in mid 2021 when Australia&#39;s borders were closed (to AU citizens as well...) so leaving back home wasn&#39;t even an option."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imho the real question here is, why is it that Meta keeps hiring right right until they do large layoff rounds?The kind of issue that requires large layoff rounds is not something that just materializes overnight, out of the blue.So why does their management - which should be able to read the writing on the wall, since that&#39;s part of their job - not issue a strict hiring freeze (in addition to other measures taken to try and avoid/reduce the impeding layoffs).Why do they go from hiring to firing in the blink of an eye?"</p>

He was in the hospital for two weeks. While under observation after his release, we have not seen indications of lasting damage. No way to know what the future holds.  So far, so good.We are still not anti-vax at all. In fact, I might go for my next booster today.The one thing that angers me is that this incident cost us $10K.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems like this should have been a requirement before any emergency use authorization, and certainly before any mandates.The fact that this research is just now being done ought to be enough to immediately revoke the FDA emergency use authorizations and pull the product from the shelves.The covid vaccines have been a complete and utter disaster at every level. The erosion of trust in the institutions that are supposed to protect consumers has alone done exponentially more damage than the virus it self.We now have victims of vaccine injury so scared of societal backlash they don&#39;t speak out, and doctors so scared of losing their license/job they ignore the evidence in front of them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The most persuasive argument for Apple as trustworthy on  privacy was weak: that because they didn’t monetize data as rapaciously as Google or Meta, there was less incentive for them to spy on users.But once they introduced new privacy controls, they seemed to suddenly start investing more seriously in their own advertising network. That, and the encryption slight-of-hand with iCloud, makes the cynic’s case for them.App telemetry, metrics, etc might get handwaved away with a sinister phrase, like “essential for improving user experience.” But placing trust in a company on privacy due to the relative lack of financial incentive seems hopelessly naive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple will probably get away with that as it is all in the fine print. But,1. Let&#39;s not forget vast majority ( if not all ) of people on the Internet, inclusive but not limited to Main-steam Media, HN, Reddit and Twitter who commented between 2017 and 2021 thought privacy meant anonymous. And before anyone disagree, very very few on HN even bother to downvote or stand up against the notion of privacy meant anonymous.2. Apple play this card, both in PR and marketing, along with media ( Submarine Article or not ) as a tool against Facebook. Or Social Media but let&#39;s be honest we all know they mean Facebook. And of course, for people from US, after 2016 Facebook is the most evil company on planet earth. Any Facebook bashing equals great.3. A lot of people were brought into the idea of privacy meant anonymous. So in other settings, Apple use the word &#34;personalised&#34; instead of Data Collection, cough, I mean tracking.4. The good thing about all of these, anything illogical will have to unfold some day. ( Just like Crypto ) Apple of course collect Data from you. Apple of course has all the Data about your usage pattern. So when some people came to realise privacy doesn&#39;t mean anonymous, I guess they aren&#39;t so happy?5. Apple&#39;s true definition of privacy is that All Apple&#39;s user Data belongs to Apple. Any data to third party are by definition &#34;Tracking&#34;. Since Privacy is a Fundamental Human Right, I guess the only choice is to give Apple all your Data?6. Most people, especially tech nerds will likely play the I trust Apple more than Google card. Because Apple are not in the Ad business! - That was 2017 to 2021 if not 2022. They have their ads business right infront of you for a long time. They have been preparing their Ads business for a long time. Most tech nerds, or Apple apologist just turns a blind eye to it."</p>

Notably, while the team discovered similar  iPhone  activity on a non-jailbroken phone running iOS 16, the data was encrypted and it was therefore not possible to determine exactly what it contained.And this is why &#34;security&#34; to prevent user control or even knowledge of &#34;their&#34; devices is so important."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the joke is still good, because it&#39;s still a bad manner to have your phone ringing and buzzing in many situations (a concert, at the opera etc). I mean, it&#39;s actually an impressive comic, it imagines a possible future tech and correctly identifies some real misuses, 70-80 years before it became reality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That comic got one small detail incorrect: in 2022, phones are rarely in pockets, because most people can&#39;t stop using theirs long enough to put it in a pocket."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They are now banning cellphones in schools in Nordic countries. But alas, parents are buying standalone smartwatches for their precious brats.Which reminds me of me in 1950s. I always tried to get seat by the window where the heat pipes run. My crystal set needed ground wire and the antenna could be hidden by  the curtains."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Mass layoffs makes the news because papers depend on sensational headlines, but it&#39;s important to put into perspective.&gt; The pandemic produced Amazon’s most profitable era on record ... Amazon doubled its work force in two years, and funneled its winnings into expansion and experimentation to find the next big things.So it doubled its head count in the past 3 years and is now trimming by 3% (or 1% of global).Update: Tried to figure out whether the doubling head count was corporate employees or total. I don&#39;t have time to dig into it now but a quick search did turn up Amazon&#39;s EEO reports in which they break employees down into a number of categories including &#34;Professionals&#34; -- which sounds like it would include engineers. 77K in 2019, 121K in 2021. So it&#39;s reasonable to assume those did double from 2019 to the present. See https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/workplace/our-workforce-dat..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is just the latest round of cuts at Amazon: &#34;From April through September, it reduced head count by almost 80,000 people, primarily shrinking its hourly staff through high attrition.&#34;Also: &#34;Amazon froze hiring in several smaller teams in September. In October, it stopped filling more than 10,000 open roles in its core retail business. Two weeks ago, it froze corporate hiring across the company, including its cloud computing division, for the next few months.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In 2018, Echo and Alexa lost about $5 billion, said a person with knowledge of the finances. When Amazon introduced new devices this fall in an annual event, it was notably more restrained than past years when it had featured zany products like a sticky note printer and $1,000 home robot.$5B loss from one business line is a lot. Maybe this manner of investment inspired Zuck on the metaverse."</p>
