								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years back I got audited, and it was called an &#34;electronic audit&#34; by the IRS. Which basically meant that they had their computer systems scour a bunch of the bank records and discovered that I had forgotten to claim a 1099 for some contract work I had. OK, so they sent me a computer print out and they had cross checked everything on my return electronically, my property tax deductions, my stock dividends so on and so on.Ok, so if they can do all that automatically for an &#34;electronic audit&#34; why am I filing a return, just run that thing and send it to me and I can file an exception if there is something on it I disagree with.I think the answer has already been identified in several other comments here, a heavy lobby effort on the part of Intuit, H&amp;R and whoever else to keep it tricky and complex so you have to buy their B.S&gt; software or services."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny side note: I had a flat mate once who was on a working holiday from Japan.He was in love with and endlessly curious about English slang, it’s basically all we talked about.I remember explaining to him why my uni friends and I referred to things as being “craptastic”, starting with American marketing’s love affair with the portmanteau.He got it pretty quickly and enjoyed using it in conversation.The saying that was harder for him to understand was “fuck all”.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the kind of pain that comes from trusting scammers and nincompoops about unworkable blockchain &#34;scalability&#34; fixes.Here&#39;s the sequence. Those dumb enough to ignore it are doomed to repeat the pattern. I&#39;m probably getting some details wrong in this Rube Goldberg scheme, so feel free to correct.1. Citing &#34;Ethereum network congestion,&#34; Axie Infinity announces an ethereum side chain, Ronin.[1]2. Ronin was a centralized server (therefore fast and cheap) authorized to make Ethereum Mainnet transactions. The server was a hot wallet in other words.3. The Ronin team tried to make it look like they were &#34;decentralized&#34; by splitting signing authority among 9 &#34;validator nodes.&#34; (the article)4. An attacker obtained 5 of 9 keys, which is the signing threshold.5. With the required threshold of keys, the attacker signed the transitions moving assets off the Ronin servers.None of this is new. The Bitcoin &#34;block size war&#34; was fought over this very point. Unworkable scaling schemes are going to end in disaster with no fallback, and no recourse for those who lose money. You end up with nothing, and will be sad.And it&#39;s sad that the same lessons keep getting replayed over and over. It&#39;s really simple. Can your &#34;blockchain&#34; be validated with regular hardware? Does it use a secure consensus algorithm? Is there a secure side channel through which low-value transactions can flow? If not, you&#39;re going to have a bad time when the shenanigans start happening.Now, is that side channel effectively a single server? Handling hundreds of millions of dollars of value? Have they rolled their own crypto? If yes to any of these, get out and stay out.[1] https://medium.com/axie-infinity/introducing-ronin-axie-infi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m out of the loop and trying to understand - people lent over half a billion dollars of their &#39;real&#39; fake money (ETH) to a game studio so they could transact on the studio&#39;s sidechain because gas fees are prohibitively expensive on ETH, and then the game studio got hacked and lost it all?How was this ever going to end any other way? Imagine how preposterous the idea of storing $650mm in USD in a random game studio&#39;s checking account would be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a system run by people, the transaction could be reversed, traced, and the culprits eventually brought to justice.In a system run by algorithms, designed to avoid oversight by people (governments), there is no such powers. There&#39;s no reversal. There&#39;s no checking the name on the account the transfer was to. It&#39;s just gone.I do not understand why people who have legal intentions would want to be part of the crypto economy. There&#39;s nothing but more risks with zero benefits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have to admit I find this whole situation (and also Krebs article bizarre). The problem seems to be that tech companies approve EDRs without much checking. Then the argument somehow becomes it is essentially impossible for them to check because there could be any of the thousands of police departments in the world requesting the EDR? Why should MS in the US somehow respond to a request from police department in Cuxhafen in Germany?I think the argument being made here is one of those &#34;we can&#39;t make a perfect solution so no solution works&#34;, which is nonsense. Simply don&#39;t answer requests from police departmenents you can&#39;t verify. I bet you if a police department would request some business sensitive information they would not hand it over without going over the subpoena with a fine toothed comb. The issue is just that they don&#39;t value their customers privacy high enough to do a proper check."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Trying to find more information about Emergency Data Requests leads in large part right back to this discussion and the original Brian Krebs post, with a few hits to various private organizations that explain what it takes to use an Emergency Data Request with them.I&#39;m having trouble finding any basis for this in law.  Can anyone help clarify that?  Are EDRs just 100% voluntary compliance on the part of some private organizations who are choosing to divulge customer information without an actual court order?If that&#39;s the case, why are we lamenting the existence of the hackers and not publicly shaming the companies complying with these nonsense EDRs?  Real court orders aren&#39;t that hard to get, and at least there&#39;d be a more blatant crime to prosecute if anyone forges them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;“The only way to clean it up would be to have the FBI act as the sole identity provider for all state and local law enforcement,” Weaver said. “But even that won’t necessarily work because how does the FBI vet in real time that some request is really from some podunk police department?”There are already preexisting systems for solving this sort of problem. For example the FBI could set up a PGP based certificate authority[1] for email. Then the FBI signs the identities of the podunk police departments ahead of time. All the service providers would need would be the FBI identity (PGP public key) which they would sign once to authorize it and then they would be able to verify emails coming from any of the podunk police departments with no extra work on their part. This example comes with a revocation system that actually would work in this case.All secret key material would remain under the control of the specific FBI department acting as the certificate authority. No third party involvement would be required.[1] https://sequoia-pgp.org/blog/2021/05/12/202105-hello-openpgp..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is what is so frustrating about companies harming many people by small amounts. There is no actual recourse for the individuals. If an individual missed a credit card payment by mistake, the bank would assuredly charge them a late fee, report the payment to the credit agencies, etc. But when the company makes a mistake like this, no penalty, no consequences. It really should be the other way around—we should extend grace to the person rather than the company, yet the company basically has more “rights” in a way than the person."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article seems intentionally misleading. It&#39;s implying that if the organization disabled the &#34;Web &amp; App Activity&#34; setting will not carry over to the user. That&#39;s not what the support page says though:&gt; If you disabled Web &amp; App Activity in the Admin console, it is turned off for Google Workspace users. Users can turn it on if they want.So nobody will be tracked on the web who wasn&#39;t previously. The setting that will be turned on is just the one controlling search history within Gmail, Docs, Drive etc.(But it does seem surprising that they didn&#39;t just show a option dialogue on the next load of a Workspace app and ask the user to choose.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently left Google after spending a few years there.Internally Google puts a huge premium on user safety and privacy. So much so that shipping anything requires getting changes through a regulatory process to safeguard users.Google doesn’t do a good job of marketing its process. In some domains Google does explicitly use user behavior to drive revenue, so from the outside it becomes easy to spin changes like this as encroaching on user privacy, but I don’t see that here. I see something like a PM who is trying to surface some more functionality to users directly, and some engineers who spent far too long with lawyers to get sign off on this change.It may be fashionable to sensationalize product changes like this, but the truth is often more mundane.Edit: found a comment from the PM themselves in a previous discussion https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30174304"</p>

Glad this is finally out, and really looking forward to seeing what features the React team adds in follow-up releases.The Working Group model really helped us in the community give feedback - APIs like `useSyncExternalStore` wouldn&#39;t have happened otherwise, and I really appreciate the responsiveness on that topic.FWIW, React-Redux v8 is in beta right now:- https://github.com/reduxjs/react-redux/releasesI think it&#39;s basically ready to go, but I haven&#39;t had a chance to really test out the SSR support I added a couple months ago.  I&#39;d love to have some help testing that out.v7 will _run_ with React 18, but v8 has been specifically reworked to behave correctly when used with React&#39;s new &#34;Concurrent Rendering&#34; capabilities.  We&#39;ve also converted React-Redux itself to TS (no more separate types package).Ideally, I&#39;d like to release v8 as final in the next week or two."</p>

I suspect not, but it is an unfortunate accident he was born in and runs his company from Russia, the government of which is a dirtbag, so, correct me if I am wrong, Kaspersky must be a dirtbag by association, but especially for discovering Stuxnet. Believable, but I think the real reasons Kaspersky is persona non grata is due to having discovered Stuxnet, and Kaspersky Lab suspected of uncovering secret US cyberweapons in the future.I am a patriot, but even I don&#39;t appreciate being lied to by my government. It would be good if the next best cyber security firm and software was half as good as Kaspersky&#39;s. But I suspect not."</p>
