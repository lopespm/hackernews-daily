I don&#39;t remember how I found it but I&#39;m sure it was posted on digg or slashdot or something at the time. I had a lot of posts in the first few years about some generally broad concepts, and completely inactive since.In spite of this, I am in the top 7% of accounts on the site, which is a nice reminder on the power of compound interest!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I&#39;m happy for the people who made a lot of money in this transaction, I always read these announcements with a bit of angst.From a user point of view, I expect this to go like Reddit has, for example.  Everyone building that value saw high use value, returns on their investment in the form of information they need, lean, easy to find, high signal to noise.Now there is a debt to be paid.  The new owner needs to extract the purchase price, and whatever additional additional returns they intend.  Everything costs something.So what will it be?Subscription access?Less favorable signal to noise?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The original source is much better written and explains the core of what the paper actually uncovers:&gt; [...] found a vulnerability in the algorithm that decides Twitter Trending Topics: it does not take deletions into account. This allows attackers to push the trends they want to the top of Twitter Trends despite deleting their tweets which contain the candidate trend shortly afterwards.Source: https://actu.epfl.ch/news/mass-scale-manipulation-of-twitter...Paper: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1910.07783.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this must be happening on every social media platform in some way. The fact is that people seem to love being afraid and anxious. Bad news spreads like wild fire. All that X bad actor has to do is just figure out any worrying take on a topic of choice and then just sit back and watch the mayhem.I also think the most likely originators of this content are state actors. If they can pay a group of people to drop intellectual bombs in the public spheres of their enemies all day, I&#39;m sure they see that as an overall (and very cheap) win. Honestly, it&#39;s more a question of why they wouldn&#39;t do this than why would they."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Relevance&#34; is not the signal that people think it is. It can be trusted when it is coming from people we&#39;ve already vetted, but at a mass scale, it is easily weaponized to manufacture and manipulate public opinion. An algorithm that decides relevance can be gamed, as we see here.These features won&#39;t go away, however. Twitter and the media at large rely on the veneer of relevance to ensure they retain an audience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Holding the money hostage for half a year on a 20 year old account? Not surprising. Paypal and their other entities like Ebay are pretty shit when it comes to nuance and their impact on others.Had a 15 year old Paypal business account (parent started it and I took it over ~7 years ago) and last year they shut it down because I, as the new owner, was not 18 when the account was created. Nothing from the support but &#34;computer said you bad, nothing we can do&#34;.In Ebays case I sold an item, got the regular email from Ebay (DMARK/SPF/IP verified) that they had received payment and was holding it until the item had been delivered. Then a week later I got another email from them saying they had blocked the buyer for abuse (i.e. a fraudulent transaction to them) and that I shouldn&#39;t ship the item they told me to ship a week ago. After 2 months of trying to get through to the support they just claimed that someone spoofed their DMARK, SPF, and servers IP. After explaining how impossible that would be their &#39;proof&#39; that it was &#39;spoofed&#39; was that there should be a copy of the message in the Ebay inbox where, after the reply, all messages about the auction ever existing were suddenly gone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;We don&#39;t like what you are doing, and are going to hold your money for six months. I hope you don&#39;t subsist on it, or have any business obligations to attend to. We&#39;ll call you.&#34;This should be illegal for Paypal to do, period. Absolutely illegal.And if it is on behalf of a government or banking/fraud regulations, then the person should be referred to relevant agencies.Let&#39;s be clear and drop the pretense: They are confiscating his property."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In Switzerland, we&#39;re soon going to vote on two initiatives ¹² aiming at reducing pesticide use.
The first is essentially about forbidding the use of all artificial pesticides by 2031 (also importation of food that was produced abroad using pesticides).
The second is about removing subsidies to farmers that use any kind of pesticide, or regularly use antibiotics on their livestock, etc.I feel like they are quite drastic initiatives, but it&#39;s good to at least have a desire for change.
I&#39;m interested in any opinion from knowledgeable people on the subject!¹ https://www.admin.ch/gov/en/start/documentation/votes/202106...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve watched the entire cycle in the past thirty years as a former agronomist.  We were able to genetically modify plants so they generated natural pesticides as a defense against insects.  This allowed us to stop spraying thousands of tons of less insecticides.But the very people complaining about spraying chemicals rejected these new enhanced plants saying they weren&#39;t &#39;natural&#39;.  We have been breeding plants to do things the past 170 years ever since Gregor Mendel and his pea breeding.  The only difference now is that we have better tools.  You cannot win everyone over.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregor_Mendel"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dengue is a serious health threat in Singapore. Fogging (1) is pretty common.Now, the Singapore government says fogging should be used judiciously, not routinely. But, that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case. Many condos will fog once a week, year-round. Supposedly all operations must be submitted in the an &#34;E-fogging Submission System&#34;, but as far as I can tell, there&#39;s no visibility into this.Singapore has also recently declared a &#34;climate change emergency&#34;, and I&#39;d consider biodiversity, at the very least, a part of that.My point is that: if the Singapore Government is unable or unwilling to manage this with a sense of urgency (or &#34;emergency&#34;), then I&#39;m not generally hopeful.(1) https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fogging_(insect_control)"</p>

My code can accurately follow the flow of data without polluting my stack with single-use variables, nesting many function calls, or other sorts of clutter.This is also pretty common practice in Haskell.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work for another company that is going to do a partial return to office.  I will be looking at options for companies that offer full in person office (or 90% in person office) after things settle down.  I  have worked full remote for a total of 5 years of my career, and I believe working in the office is a competitive advantage.* Overhearing hallway conversations (and joining them) helps spawn invocation.* I often do/did paired programming, and over-the-shoulder code reviews.  These are easier in person* Having a workforce socially close improves productivity because everyone wants to step up for each other.* Being seen by my fellow employees helps keep me from becoming distracted.* Working at the office helps prevent home life from being distracting during work hours.There are some personal benefits I enjoy from being in the office.* I save money by spending less on food, drinks, and electricity.* I enjoy the routine.* I had a stronger work/life separation.  I rarely turned on my work laptop at home."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Cook wrapped up the memo by saying that he&#39;s looking forward to seeing employee faces. &#34;I know I&#39;m not alone in missing the hum of activity, the energy, creativity and collaboration of our in-person meetings and the sense of community we&#39;ve all built,&#34; he wrote.&#34;CEO&#39;s all spout the same nonsense. The majority of people work because they need to earn money. They&#39;re not working to make a new &#39;family&#39; or change the world or be around &#39;creative people&#39;. It&#39;s generally the leadership teams at companies that think it&#39;s great to be in the office but that&#39;s because they&#39;ve sacrificed a lot to get where they are and they care deeply about their job and the company. The majority of people just want to earn some money and do it as easily as possible. I think companies not offering full remote work options will see a lot of employee turnover and will have to change their policy very quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some here are being honest, so I&#39;ll be brutally honest: Covid has upset the master-slave relationship, and they&#39;re realizing they&#39;re giving up too much control.  Yes, even the supposedly forward-thinking, progressive tech world.It&#39;s so much easier to ignore the BS of &#34;company culture,&#34; &#34;a new family&#34; and other such nonsense when working remote.  Plenty of people here have outright stated they work as a way to fund their lives and they couldn&#39;t care less about &#34;the mission,&#34; &#34;changing the world&#34; and other similar lies.  When WFH you only need to put on a show (and sometimes pants!) when on a video call, then you can relax and get your work done and shut out the BS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My first job out of college was scanning books for the Internet Archive down in the basement of the Library of Congress. Their scanning machines used a foot pedal to raise and lower the glass Platen, so I&#39;d use one hand to flip the page and wiggle the cradle to get things nice and flat and the other would snap the photo. You can get pretty fast after a while, but boy is it mindless. Older books that had been rebound a couple times already were the hardest to work with as you have the least amount of margin. There&#39;s a bunch of different sized dowels that we would put under the spine in the cradle so the glass could gain a couple millimeters of margin, just enough to avoid cutting off text. Worst case scenario the book had to be unbound in order to capture. I did get to flip through a lot of cool old illustrated catalogues like this: https://archive.org/details/illustratedcatal00keil/page/14/m..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At Japan in the meantime, people in book scanning community (that exists) often just cut the book spine and scan the pages using normal scanner, throw it away once all the pages are scanned.People (rightly) value room spaces than books there.
It&#39;s called &#34;Ji-sui&#34; (scanning by oneself)  and gear recommendation sites like [1] are abundant. Another reason of &#34;Ji-sui&#34; prevalence was the poor availability of ebooks, although that reason was less relevant today.[1] http://monomania.sblo.jp/article/60578693.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built one of these out of pine 2x4s and plywood. I thought it would be cheaper than buying one (I was wrong) but I&#39;m also not a skilled woodworker and had to buy most of the tools.It works quite well and I digitised dozens of textbooks I&#39;d purchased and needed to reference but couldn&#39;t carry around every day while finishing my masters. My one had 2 Nikon mirrorless cameras controlled via Pi-Scan. https://github.com/Tenrec-Builders/pi-scanI had a smaller toggle switch wired to the GPIO pins so I could click the scan next button without having to take my hands of the book. Once I got used to the workflow I could scan about 1000 pages per hour while watching Netflix.I replaced it with a Czur scanner that isn&#39;t as good, but is a lot smaller and is good enough for my less demanding needs now that I&#39;m not doing a masters degree :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recall visiting the Yangtze river by boat tour around 1997. This was before the dam was built and the place was beautiful.  Imagine the grand canyon but it was covered with lush vegetation. We visited a center where there were models of the three gorges dam would soon to be built. On the tour they said we would be the last tourists to see the Yangtze as it stands, after the dam, many landmarks/settlements would be flooded, and even back then people critiqued how many species of fish would die because they can no longer swim up river to spawn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly there is a term for the last known member of a species: Endling [1]. Scrolling through that Wikipedia article always gives me an eerie feeling. It looks like the Chinese paddlefish is not listed yet though.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endling"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its cousin, the American paddlefish, is still around, though it&#39;s vulnerable.Among other similar reasons (overfishing, pollution), dams are related to its decline: &#34;Series of dams on rivers such as those constructed on the Missouri River have impounded large populations of American paddlefish, and blocked their upstream migration to spawning shoals.[29]&#34;But it&#39;s not too late...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_paddlefish#Population..."</p>
