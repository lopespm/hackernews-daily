								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has happened to me frequently at my current company. I get pulled into a meeting about something that I have no context on because it touches my area of expertise, and the discussions have apparently been stalling out.I brace myself to be the idiot. I&#39;m going to waste everyone&#39;s time asking questions that everyone knows the answer to, and I just got looped in, so everyone&#39;s going to feel like they need to walk through all the super-obvious stuff to satisfy the one guy who didn&#39;t do his homework.So I start asking questions, and slowly begin to realize that nobody in the room has any idea what they are talking about. That there are fundamental misunderstandings and misconceptions about existing systems. And, naturally, it turns out that the questions I have are questions that other people have.This has happened to me so often now that you would think the sinking feeling I get before I brace myself to look stupid would go away, but it never does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was younger, I often met people who seemed kind of dim to me, at first, and later found the majority of them to be orders of magnitude brighter than me.
It was not hard to connect the dots, the reason they were so much brighter was (in part) exactly because of what made them initially seem dim.. They asked questions, honestly. Not the showoff kind of question you ask to show how much you know, but real, honest questions that not only showed how little they knew, but importantly, allowed them to actually learn and understand, rather than just nod and not get it.My intuition has changed from this, I find it that most times, when someone shows genuine interest and asks honest, revealing questions about some new topic, they often excel at many other things (and will likely on the new topic as well).I&#39;m adapting this myself, being honest, asking honestly, and sometimes looking really stupid (because, in that context, I am!), and I appreciate greatly both the wealth of information that allows me to access, and that almost anybody worth their salt recognizes this trait as well.Failing an interview due to looking stupid is probably a blessing in disguise, you don&#39;t want to be hired by people who can&#39;t see this, and you don&#39;t want to work next to people who&#39;s just pretending to understand, not learning because they can&#39;t afford to look stupid when they are (and thus stay stupid, and be much more inclined to try to pass blame to someone else, like you, who look stupid)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One way to prove that he truly doesn&#39;t mind looking stupid would be to list times when he risked looking stupid... and it turns out he actually was.It&#39;s happened to all of us though we dont like to admit it.I&#39;m sure it&#39;s happened to him too  and I looked but I didn&#39;t see any of those examples listed.Giving only examples of when people thought he was dumb and it turned out he wasn&#39;t... that&#39;s kind of just a roundabout way of humblebragging that you&#39;re an unrecognized genius.Sadly I think this undermines the point of the article which otherwise makes a good point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing that burns out web developer is web development. The constant shift of technologies (just for the sake of it) and the nerfed (to oblivion) environment is hell. As a web developer, after you learn the basics (~5 years)  there is no feeling of where the &#34;up&#34; direction is. Everything feels like sidesteps. There is no feeling of permanence to your knowledge, unlike a lawyer or a doctor. The knowledge feels like water pouring into a full container - as much of it goes out, as it goes in.Switched to embedded systems 7 years ago to avoid the burnout. It is better, in my opinion. Funny enough, there is a natural barrier to entry that keeps most programmers away - You have to understand how computers work, how operating systems work and you have to be able to code in C/assembly. I have a lot of fun and actually picked up electronics as a hobby, which will help me better myself professionally. I think there is enough here to keep me entertained until I retire."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 64. DRY (don’t repeat yourself) is a luxury for when you have a coherent theory in your mind of the app’s code.&gt; It’s for when you have that theory contained in a worldview in your mind that helps you quickly test out decisions and plans against that theory.&gt; Until then, you should repeat yourself. Seeing your code repeat itself – when rhyming phrases start to pop up throughout – is a vital tool for building a theory about your app.Wow, this is the best explanation of how to apply DRY that I&#39;ve ever heard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice read. I&#39;ve been doing web dev for 15 years. What has got me burnt out now:-Spend most of my time dealing with tooling issues.-Increasingly complex demands. Even the simplest problems now seems to be multi layered with dozens of edge cases to be accounted for. It&#39;s seemingly impossible to get anything right. You can spend hours testing a responsive design on every browser, every viewport - send it to the client and you&#39;ll get after 5 minutes a list of 50 issues, half of them totally asinine.-Lack of respect/authority/autonomy. After 15 years I&#39;m considered a subordinate to a PM with 6 months experience and zero technical knowledge. This one can be improved a little by working remotely I think. But it just comes down to how management view or value different roles. We are a liability to them, something to be managed, coerced and controlled.-Oversaturated market, learntocode, let&#39;s be honest and say for 95% of companies, web devs are a commodity. I don&#39;t have an issue with people who are excited and want to learn coding, but the reality is the job market is over stuffed.-Leetcode interviews. I just don&#39;t have the energy, desire and sometimes specific knowledge to deal with these interviews. Its a straight no from me now, if i get contacted by a recruiter requesting I do one of these.I can see clearly that other people in non technical fields are getting paid better or the same as me and dealing with far far less work and far less stress.It&#39;s like there are two type of work category: &#34;reviewers&#34; and &#34;implementers&#34;. Reviewers are the stakeholders, they make all the demands and do none (or very little/superficial) of the actual work. Implementers, well we are the ones who do the heavy lifting and deal with all the real problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel pg’s point is similar to musicians. As an example, Glenn Gould was a classical pianist and renowned Bach interpreter. He had awesome technical ability at the piano, and a fantastic memory. But lots of incredible pianists have these abilities. Go to any university or observe any competition and you’ll plainly see awesome talent. These qualities are analogous to “being smart”.However, what set Gould apart from his colleagues was his innovative and iconoclastic interpretations of well-known works with “standard” prescriptions. He had fundamentally different, but wholly consistent, ideas about musical interpretation, recording technology, presentation of music to audiences, and so on. He’s remembered as a pianist not because his fingers were quick and sensitive, but instead because he pushed boundaries in completely original ways.Leonard Bernstein—a noted conductor and pianist—quips about this when he conducted the Brahms Concerto in D minor, with Gould at the piano [1]. I recommend listening but I’ll copy his words (from [2]) for posterity.&gt; Don&#39;t be frightened. Mr. Gould is here. He will appear in a moment. I&#39;m not, um, as you know, in the habit of speaking on any concert except the Thursday night previews, but a curious situation has arisen, which merits, I think, a word or two. You are about to hear a rather, shall we say, unorthodox performance of the Brahms D Minor Concerto, a performance distinctly different from any I&#39;ve ever heard, or even dreamt of for that matter, in its remarkably broad tempi and its frequent departures from Brahms&#39; dynamic indications. I cannot say I am in total agreement with Mr. Gould&#39;s conception and this raises the interesting question: &#34;What am I doing conducting it?&#34; I&#39;m conducting it because Mr. Gould is so valid and serious an artist that I must take seriously anything he conceives in good faith and his conception is interesting enough so that I feel you should hear it, too.&gt; But the age old question still remains: &#34;In a concerto, who is the boss; the soloist or the conductor?&#34; The answer is, of course, sometimes one, sometimes the other, depending on the people involved. But almost always, the two manage to get together by persuasion or charm or even threats to achieve a unified performance. I have only once before in my life had to submit to a soloist&#39;s wholly new and incompatible concept and that was the last time I accompanied Mr. Gould. (The audience roared with laughter at this.) But, but this time the discrepancies between our views are so great that I feel I must make this small disclaimer. Then why, to repeat the question, am I conducting it? Why do I not make a minor scandal — get a substitute soloist, or let an assistant conduct? Because I am fascinated, glad to have the chance for a new look at this much-played work; Because, what&#39;s more, there are moments in Mr. Gould&#39;s performance that emerge with astonishing freshness and conviction. Thirdly, because we can all learn something from this extraordinary artist, who is a thinking performer, and finally because there is in music what Dimitri Mitropoulos used to call &#34;the sportive element&#34;, that factor of curiosity, adventure, experiment, and I can assure you that it has been an adventure this week collaborating with Mr. Gould on this Brahms concerto and it&#39;s in this spirit of adventure that we now present it to you.Because some took this as an attack on Gould, Bernstein followed up with the remark:&gt; Any discovery of Glenn&#39;s was welcomed by me because I worshiped the way he played: I admired his intellectual approach, his &#34;guts&#34; approach, his complete dedication to whatever he was doing.Anyway, it’s an interesting parallel in the arts world. Jacob Collier is a musician of today that has similar qualities of “being smart with good ideas”.[1] https://youtu.be/SvWPM783TOE[2] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_Philharmonic_concer..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another way to frame this topic: intelligence doesn&#39;t always lead to impact, and impact is what matters.Example: I met a ton of trivia &#34;nerds&#34; through a friend a few years ago. They had all met at an Ivy League college, they were clearly &#34;smart&#34; in that they knew a lot of information and could follow a logical argument but somehow none of them were able to use their smarts for anything practical. They had jobs you didn&#39;t need to be that smart for, and their personal lives were sort of messy. I didn&#39;t really know what to make it them at the time, now I think they had the &#34;smarts&#34; but they didn&#39;t have the &#34;drive&#34; so their brains sort of did them no good.Another example: Plenty of people are constantly frustrated that they are misunderstood. &#34;I am so smart but I can&#39;t get anything done around here because everyone&#39;s an idiot.&#34; Some people go through their whole life believing this. Luckily I had a job that disabused me of this and taught me to communicate my ideas clearly and persuasively to others. But without that, without the ability to persuade people of your ideas, you might as well not have them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hamming (of Hamming codes) has a famous Bell Labs talk &#34;You and Your Research&#34;, describing how to have a large impact. It covers a lot of the same ground, but in more detail:https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.htmlA few points from it:You&#39;ve got to work on important problems.How about having lots of `brains?&#39; It sounds good. But great work is something else than mere brains.The people who do great work with less ability but who are committed to it, get more done that those who have great skill and dabble in it.The prepared mind sooner or later finds something important and does it. So yes, it is luck. The particular thing you do is luck, but that you do something is not.One of the characteristics you see, and many people have it including great scientists, is that usually when they were young they had independent thoughts and had the courage to pursue them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Intuit is such an evil company. Now that I&#39;ve moved to Germany, I know what it feels like not to have to file every year (I still have to for the US but it&#39;s trivial now due to FIEC).There&#39;s nobody hounding you here, no stress regarding your taxes unless you&#39;re filing for a return or have extenuating circumstances, and even then there&#39;s a government-provided online portal for direct communication with the Finanzamt (finance department).Every American should be upset with Intuit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Going to paraphrase a quote from a podcast that stuck with me.&gt; What (the left) needs to do is clear out rents. Not just housing rents, but rent seekers. The economy is riddled through with people who do nothing, but get paid because structurally that’s who gets paid.Intuit is one of those companies. They produce a few real products, QuickBooks for businesses and Mint, but overwhelmingly their money comes from the fact that they charge rent on filling your taxes. They’re a parasite on our society.Fortunately the podcaster wasn’t talking about the US; their country was worse off than America in this area by far. But unfortunately it seems like we’re on the same glide slope if we don’t do something about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate wasting at least a day if not more of my life every year filing. As time goes on and i have more assets the time to file goes up as well and gathering all the required documents with every bank having different timelines is a nightmare.But what can I do about it? I would imagine if it went to a vote overwhelmingly people would say no I don’t want to file like this every year. But here we are and honestly I don’t have much energy left these days to be mad about anything as it’s wearing on my health."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I served in the Georgia legislature during a portion of a similar story. Without a doubt, the calculations throughout the story were political not technical.In the Georgia version, the technical details of the exposed information in the Secretary of State&#39;s office were facepalmingly simple (misconfigured apache directives) yet the story dragged on politically for years.Quickly, a hired security researcher for a corporate client found all registered voters info and instructional pdfs with credentials for the elections system publicly indexed by google. They responsibly disclosed. The apache configuration was updated to &#34;use encryption&#34; (moved from http to https) but still left the info indexed by google over https vs. http.    Eventually, this information became public.The state attempted to prosecute the security researcher but found no state statutes they could use. They then used this incident as a base to create a bill to criminalize the security researcher&#39;s actions.As a state rep, I worked very hard to push back on a bad bill spawned by the incident that would&#39;ve criminalized responsible disclosure.Only due to bi-partisan efforts from technically versed people were we able to get the Governor at the time to veto the bill.https://www.snopes.com/ap/2017/06/15/researcher-finds-georgi...https://www.ajc.com/news/state--regional-govt--politics/comp..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the article title kind of curious, given that it states Parson has &#34;doubled down&#34; which suggests that the video the article references is an active effort on Parson&#39;s part. It then goes on to state that the video was produced by a PAC Parson created but doesn&#39;t give direct input to. Comes off as unnecessarily inflammatory to me I suppose.Having said that, this situation in particular really tests my willingness to assume good faith on the part of the governor and his body of advisors. Is he legitimately without a single person close to him that could inform him of how misguided this line of aggression is, and how fortunate it was that the individual who identified the security problem acted in such a helpful manner? On top of that he assigned the Missouri State Highway Patrol to investigate, because given his perceived severity of the situation that&#39;s the best agency at his disposal? It all just seems bananas.I try not to assume that totally inane actions from elected officials are exclusively the result of political calculus, and I suppose I don&#39;t have any evidence to assume that&#39;s the case here either. But I&#39;m at a loss as to how this situation could blossom into something so ridiculous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is pretty good overview. One fun tricks we would regularly do was move all the background audio off the disk and into GPU ram. We&#39;d stream just enough that we wouldn&#39;t saturate the bus but could get back 20-30mb of system memory.There was also that time we ran out of open file handles ahead of key demo at one of the tradeshows. I remember rewriting the whole audio streaming subsystem to piggyback on the seekfree texture loading system so that we could use the that single big file as a source for both streaming texture and audio data. Did that in 24 hours less than 2 days ahead of the show, fun times.[Edit]Another fun thing from that era was that almost no one other than the in-house Sony Studios used the SPUs well. X360 came out just ahead and had tooling that was miles ahead(PIX!) so everyone started from the X360. None of the workloads we&#39;re vectorized so it was absolutely brutal to get them to fit into the SPUs. For a long time a good chunk of that silicon was just idle. If you did start from the PS3 though because of the vectorized workloads you had insane cache coeheranch and usually ran better on the X360/PC as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth saying that the whole site is an absolute gold mine of fantastic information about console architectures over the ages, and I particularly like the way he always highlights how the DRM has been broken. It&#39;s really fascinating to see the convergent and occasionally divergent evolution that goes on in these machines, speaking to, but slightly independent from, the technological trends of their time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Millions of lives and $Ts in health damage has been done and continues to be done by lead[0].  And it was largely avoidable because the dangers were known.99 years ago the League of Nations signed a treaty banning indoor leaded paint.  The US, of course, declined to join and it took another 50 years before it took action.  Concerns were raised about leaded gasoline, industry steamrolled the science.And it was just a couple of months ago that the final country (Algeria) stopped producing leaded consumer road fuel.For a good history seehttps://www.thenation.com/article/archive/secret-history-lea...[0] An Update on Childhood Lead Poisoning https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5645046/As many as 500,000 US children (2.5%) under 6 years have BLLs ≥5 µg/dL. Each lead-exposed child costs an estimated $5600 in medical and special educational services.7 Lead exposure-related cognitive impairments cost an estimated $50.9 billion annually in lost US economic productivity.6"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Small airplanes still use a leaded aviation fuel known as Avgas. I think of that every time I drive by the airport in the middle of Renton, WA right next to the lake.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m eagerly awaiting the Cargo feature &#34;named profiles&#34;[1]. It&#39;s already merged, but not yet announced to be planned for any specific Cargo version. It will allow users to create custom profiles with different build parameters from the standard ones, so you can e.g. create a &#34;profiling&#34; profile which is based on the &#34;release&#34; profile, so that it has all the nice optimizations, but with debug information included, so that it works well with cargo-flamegraph:  [profile.profiling]
  inherits = &#34;release&#34;
  debug = true

[1]: &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/9943&gt;And then there&#39;s the less fireworky, but still appreciated, Iterator::map_while[2], which is going to be in Rust 1.57.[2]: &lt;https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/89086&gt;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love the concept of editions.  I haven&#39;t anything like it in other languages.  Having the ability to have one project made up of crates of many different editions is brilliant. It makes breaking language changes that would otherwise be a nonstarter become minor and easy to manage.  Love it"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so excited to finally have disjoint captures in closures; many papercuts on that one when I worked heavily with Amethyst a while back as there were a few closure-based APIs.Thanks to all the contributors for getting us to the 2021 edition!"</p>
