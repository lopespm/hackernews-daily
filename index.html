								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish companies would be forced to do that same for everything, and at a reasonable cost.It&#39;s infuriating how if I buy, say, a dishwasher, and the heater pump goes, it&#39;s around £100 for a new one, but the whole machine costs maybe £400. Are you telling me that all that steel and plastic and motors and controllers and labor and profit and shipping and everything is actually 75% of the cost, and 25% of the entire value of my dishwasher is tied up in the value of that one part, the one that happened to need replacement?And don&#39;t get me started on cars!If we as species cared about sustainability (we don&#39;t), companies would have to sell their parts for little enough that you could buy all the parts for a whole new machine for no more than the cost of the new machine. That would focus their minds on using interchangeable, standard, COTS parts to avoid having to maintain SKUs and also avoid having the parts fail in the first place. Rather, now, it&#39;s highly profitable to make parts fail: you either get to ding the customer for a replacement part at 500% markup, or they give in and buy a whole new machine, and the old one goes to scrap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Comments in the linked thread are spot on. Manufacturers would do anything to avoid abiding spirit of that law to keep their bottom line.What&#39;s  more depressing is  &#34;tech enthusiast&#34; circle (eg. in reddit or hardware forums) will be more than eager to rationalize, defend and disseminate any weak technical excuse made up by manufacturers for keeping their anti consumer practices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a contrarian view on this. I really don’t think governments should be making technical decisions for the product design unless it directly impacts health issues. If fixed batteries makes product smaller or better then it’s choice of creator, maker and hacker. Consumer should be voting with their wallets and they should have a choice. This kind of constant interference from EU burocrates without understanding technical details is what led to completely pointless “accept cookie” disaster all over the Internet that has already cost billions of dollars collectively while not benefiting anyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is so great. Thanks for sharing your code and your collections of tilesets etc, as well as where you got them from. I&#39;ve been wanting to make a learning app into pokemon style quest adventure for quite some time now but I don&#39;t know anything about game development/engines out there. Your repo is a great introduction to exactly this kind of thing.I wanted to do something with javascript/HTML5 that let me switch between this kind of map and little exercises that would switch over to React/DOM stuff. Seems like Phaser 3 would be a good (the best?) tool to do this? Any thoughts or suggestions? I mean like I would love to have a little world just like this you could walk around in but then when I walk up to a certain section in the library it would jump into an exercise which would involve Q&amp;A with the questions and promps using React and the DOM. Then when the person finishes the challenge it would jump back out to this tiled world.I see people embedding Phaser games inside React apps, but is it possible to embed  interactive React DOM components inside Phaser games? Or does everything have to stay in Canvas/WebGL mode?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is delightful! I got stuck against the far right library wall after the research papers page and couldn&#39;t escape so I had to start over, but I adore the concept. That said, I&#39;m glad I don&#39;t need to navigate a site like this every time I need to find any information at all, because fun as that would be it would take way too long lol."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used .NET Core for a backend API relatively recently (3.1) with no background in .NET prior (mostly javascript/typescript, php, and ruby). I found it incredibly productive and to be an enjoyable developer experience. Entity framework is one of the best ORMs I&#39;ve ever worked with. Solutions and projects took some getting used to but I like it in retrospect. I now use IntelliJ products as a consequence of having used Rider for that project (developing on a mac) and enjoying the experience. C# as a language is now one of my favourites. I find it hard to convince colleagues and peers to give it a chance (mostly ruby and javascript devs) which is a shame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have worked with .NET for a long time and recently did some work with Java, node and python. .NET has a lot going for it but i feel MS is making things more complicated than they have to be. When I need to achieve something a little off the beaten path in the non .NET technologies this is often pretty straightforward to achieve whereas in .NET I have to find some obscure interface  and overrides to implement and then deal with weird side effects. I think .NET has become too big for its own good to be maintained by one party. The documentation also has a lot of volume but almost no structure. When .NET started out it was pretty coherent but in the last few years it felt very disjointed without a central design philosophy. Don’t even mention desktop development which is a complete mess since Windows 8.Maybe I am too negative on .NET but personally find the open source alternatives easier to work with and more fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love .NET. It is highly productive, reasonably performant and you can competently write any kind of software using it beside systems programming. It is an excellent jack of all trades, and you can move with ease from game programming, to web applications, to desktop software, to small glue programs and utilities, to mobile apps, to web frontend and what not.In the future even systems programming might be possible with push towards native apps and direct memory access. If at some point it will be possible to disable the garbage collector and manually manage memory, .NET could be used for everything.For a company investing in .NET is a good idea since you can move with ease a developer from one role to another. And even if you don&#39;t move the developer, having a mobile developer who can read and understand the code for the backend APIs can be quite beneficial.For me, personally, working with .NET was quite a win. I moved from desktop apps to web, then, when I got bored I moved to the gaming industry as a game developer and now I am again a happy web developer writing microservice based web apps. Meanwhile I also developed a few mobile apps for myself."</p>

Certificate chain updates, etc can be delayed until a secure connection is requested by me.The amount of unsolicited and virtually uncontrollable network traffic from macOS, Microsoft Office, Adobe Creative Suite, etc is bad enough, I expect more from Mozilla that never stops marketing its privacy features.I believe I have the right to control when and for what purpose the computer and software that I own communicates with third parties."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My essential Firefox fix is Librewolf.https://librewolf.net/Unlike many Firefox forks, it tracks modern Firefox. I believe they run a similar set of tweaks to Tor browser, just without the Tor. This is quite nice. It’s autoplay blocking has actual teeth: I’m delighted when YouTube’s annoying autoplay-next-video is foiled by it.Since it is smaller and from a less well-known group of developers, I can totally understand this being untenable. But the added risk is worth it for me, because while it isn’t perfect, it feels like I have gotten a little slice of control back with it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I played a bit into this game (maybe about 20 hours), and it&#39;s good. The size of the map dominates the game-play as you aim to explore all the types of destinations. It&#39;s a procedurally generated world, and some hilly towns will get a little weird. The glider is really a killer features, because the mountains are really really steep, you climb up to the top and the glide to cover a fairly large distance on the map.It was still hard to get into the social element of the game, because of so few players and such a large map. I think other players tended to be concentrated at the main spawn point, so a lot of the rest of the world was a backwater essentially.They also have a giant tree. It will cost you some hours, but it&#39;s quite different than anything else you&#39;ll find."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a little curious, is there a technical reason why voxel games are easier to build than non-voxel ones? The docs mention that all of the assets are community-contributed. Does making them voxel-based just drastically lower the skill theshold to make a contribution, vs. smoother ones in something like Blender? I guess I&#39;m a little curious about the relative amounts of effort that would have been required to make this kind of game (procedurally-generated open world, I believe) using non-voxel assets and mechanics, since the existing set seems to be pretty fully-featured."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this, and also its predecessor https://808303.studio which was this but without the SH101 and with a less celebratory tone. The audio quality is absolutely splendid.However, I really wonder why they don&#39;t have any URL auto-sharing mechanism. Given that there are no patterns, no sequences whatsoever, it&#39;s just one single 16 position loop per &#34;device&#34;, an entire song could easily fit on the URL. Eg the TypeScript playground live-updates the url as you type: https://www.typescriptlang.org/play?#code/FAYw9gdgzmA2CmA6WY...That &#34;record&#34; feature is neat, but it&#39;d be way neater if I can just share an URL with my composition with a friend and they can remix it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Super fun. I use a 303 clone in some of my stuff. The physical interface is just a big gumption trap for composing, and this web interface is actually 100x  better. I will likely use this to compose and hack around, and then plug it into my physcal 303 for its part. The extra fun is modulating with the knobs.I use analog synths to get away from screens. Fun thing I&#39;ve discovered that is specifically useful for the 303 is that loops and melodies with a prime number length against composite number beats are a source of free constant movement in otherwise repetitive loops.  A 4 on the floor beat vs a 7, 11, or 13 step melody only cycles every 4 x n bars. I&#39;ve been mulling one of the an 808 re-issues, or even investing in a collectors item, and playing this in my browser is removing my excuses for putting it off. Thank you!"</p>

Not a research institution. And Brady Seals is not a scientist. Note the lack of PhD. She has an MBA and has never worked in science. Nor did she &#39;author a study&#39;. She authored a REPORT. Which is not peer-reviewed and not published in a reputable journal.As an immunologist I assure you that scientific evidence does not indicate that &#39;increase of asthma is on par with living in a home with a smoker&#39;.And frankly- just walking outdoors in NYC you&#39;re exposed to far higher levels of lung-irritating pollutants than you are cooking stir fry on your stove. But that doesn&#39;t fit the agenda the Times is pushing with multiple induction stove articles lately all focused on bogus health effects and the (more legitimate) climate concerns.https://nyti.ms/3i1tj3B#permid=117337268"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I fitted an AEG induction hob in our kitchen about 3 years ago. It is absolutely amazing. It&#39;s so controllable - you can go from &#34;barely hot enough to melt chocolate&#34; to &#34;so hot your pans start discolouring and everything burns&#34; - and back again - in seconds (and everything in-between obviously).I always thought gas was the best for cooking. But I was wrong - induction is. Gas is great for medium-high power cooking, but it falls apart for lower temps, and it&#39;s very hard to get it consistent. The only time I really miss gas is when stir frying - you can&#39;t really use woks on induction.It&#39;s also wipe clean!"</p>

It was so good and unlike with other youtube alternative clients, you basically had almost 1:1 feature parity over the official app. Plus you had the option to disable almost all the recent UI changes easily and a sponsorblock integration.It was much much more of a threat to Google than newpipe or less &#34;normie&#34; friendly alt clients, and it was getting too popular for it&#39;s own good.

The main thing the filmmakers are trying to show is that these are girl-bosses who can do anything men can do (and more) and it&#39;s so important to show that with utter, relentless completeness, that they&#39;ve created characters that are magical, who don&#39;t need to overcome anything, characters who matter mostly as individuals, who have no duties or responsibilities to anyone else (most certainly not to any men). They&#39;re just total kick-ass take-no-prisoners empowered women.That&#39;s why these characters are good at everything from the start. It&#39;s why they never struggle. The overriding point that&#39;s trying to be conveyed in every scene is that these women kick ass. That&#39;s why the modern Mulan can&#39;t be shown as weak and later overcoming her physical weaknesses in other ways. No, she cannot be weak -- full stop. If she encounters a much larger man, then she has to kick his ass.Addendum that shouldn&#39;t be required, but of course it is: I want to make it totally clear here that of course women leads can be interesting and dynamic and multi-dimensional. If you think I&#39;m saying otherwise, then please don&#39;t even bother engaging, because you will have totally missed my point, which is that this particular approach to featuring women is ham-fisted and risible and probably counterproductive, in the end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another enormous gripe I have with modern movies, other than the (lack of) interesting moral lessons from OP, is the sound design. Loud explosions and music, with quiet, mumbled lines[1]. I&#39;m forced to watch every movie with subtitles on, or to miss a good chunk of the dialogue.And I&#39;d go beyond that, and blame the mumbled lines for our lack of interesting quotes. It&#39;s a lot harder to have unexpected turns of phrase, speech patterns, or novel vocabulary choices when the audience is struggling to understand even the most basic, predictable sentences.[1] https://www.slashfilm.com/673162/heres-why-movie-dialogue-ha...Edit: for people mentioning audio mixing and stereo, that&#39;s only part of the problem. Even with my (admittedly cheap) 5.1 setup, I sometimes miss most of the dialogue in some scenes. I think the change from theatrical to more realistic enunciation is also to blame."</p>
