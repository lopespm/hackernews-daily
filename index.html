								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"@dang, I think we need an explanation for why Tank Man-related content on Hacker News has been disappearing all day. I usually trust HN to be a bastion of free speech, and if there isn&#39;t some kind of proportionate response here, I don&#39;t believe myself or many others here will be able to see it that way going forward.EDIT: Thank you for your response, dang. Hacker News is a special place, which is why we have responded so strongly to today&#39;s events - I apologize if the tone above came off as less-than-civil. I (and it seems, many others) look forward to hearing more about the &#39;dupe&#39; article others have linked to below. It was only upon seeing the article marked as a dupe after seeing the previous flagged out of existence that it began to feel like more than just a user-initiated action, so I am sure further information on the mod-initiated actions will put these fears to rest."</p>

That is inaccurate, so in keeping with the HN guidelines (&#34;Please use the original title, unless it is misleading or linkbait; don&#39;t editorialize.&#34; https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html), I&#39;ve replaced the title with the tweet text. That&#39;s the standard thing we do with titles, when people post Twitter links.Much as I&#39;d love to, it&#39;s not my place to say why the original title was inaccurate, so I&#39;ll just remind you all that there are two or more sides to every story and not everything on Twitter is true.In keeping with the rule that we moderate HN less, not more, when YC or a YC startup is involved (https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;qu...), I&#39;m not doing anything else to the submission. Normally, of course, we&#39;d downweight this sort of petty drama."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m the person this original tweet was about.None of you know any of the internal details but what I can state is that Paul has no idea what he&#39;s talking about and later admits to the fact I wasn&#39;t lying.Here&#39;s the order of events:1. I went to a neighborhood clinic in Oakland, CA that&#39;s literally next door to my house, I can see the church from my window. Paul lives in NYC which is on the opposite end of the country.2. I asked them about eligibility and told them I don&#39;t clear CA guidelines. They told me it&#39;s first come, first served with an ID showing I am 18+.3. I showed up the next day, waited in line for 4 hours then got jabbed.4. Posted it in an internal forum for other founders.5. A few people had issues so raised them which I addressed but YC still took down the post within the day.6. I appealed but YC still held their decision as final.Outcome: YC founder came with his aunt, uncle, and mom all over 65 to get jabbed who didn&#39;t know about the vaccine site.---Paul ends up tweeting about it and making a huge deal around something he has no idea about. He gets a bunch of people on Twitter upset about something they don&#39;t know about.Outcome: Internet rage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The person who the original tweet was referring to (it&#39;s not private; they admitted it), just tweeted a GIF about &#34;witnessing karma&#34;.https://twitter.com/Prafulfillment/status/140093402468041523...EDIT: Reply on HN by the author: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27400221"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m not surprised but a little disappointed that most of the older techniques aren’t mentioned:- checkbox/radio inputs can be used to toggle state with `:checked ~ .foo` selectors- `:focus` (and now `:focus-within`, and `:active` though it’s less useful) can be used similarly, but also allow child selection [Edit to add: `tabindex=&#34;-1&#34;` makes anything focusable with a pointer input, but doesn’t capture keyboard tab or  iteration with assistive tools]- `:target` can be used similarly, paired with fragment links [Edit to add: but beware history entries, this can be a poor UX]- `&lt;label&gt;` can be used to not only set those states but also trigger scrolls (including within `scroll-snap` parents) without creating navigation history entries- the `attr()` function can be used to reference server-dynamic HTML data for display with `content` in pseudo-elements- I have to assume CSS animations are adopted widely enough that people aren’t using JS for that where it isn’t needed; but you can also use declarative, even interactive, animations in SVG- speaking of which, inline SVG (even `&lt;use&gt;` references) are part of the CSS cascade, and you can change any CSS-addressable property with `currentColor`- and you can nest HTML in SVG with `&lt;foreignObject&gt;` if you want to use SVG techniques in HTML- probably not worth mentioning but in case you don’t know... if you miss table layouts, you can use them with `display` on basically anything; if you want table semantics without tabular rendering you can override `display` as wellAlllllll of that being said, if you use these techniques check your stuff with assistive technologies!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m currently trying to do as much as possible (without crazy hacks) in HTML / CSS alone, just because it&#39;s easier. Things like &#34;position: sticky&#34; are easier than anything JS could do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a limitation to `position:sticky;` though, which is that it will not work inside of ANY parent that&#39;s `overflow:auto` or `overflow:hidden`. I hope this gets addressed in a future version of the spec one day. Gtihub issue: https://github.com/w3c/csswg-drafts/issues/865The biggest issue that happens to me is that I&#39;ll have a large data table where I want `overflow-x:auto` with a sticky header, and this is just impossible without Javascript. Of course, the UX of such a table is not ideal, but sometimes nothing will substitute for a large data table when you have a lot of data that goes into a table and people want to see it."</p>

The world needs more of this kind of awareness from CS grads. Not suggesting this be a major part of the curriculum, but just maybe we could go from 0 required courses covering this to 1 or 2.[1] https://web.stanford.edu/class/cs182/ and https://5harad.com/mse330/ Yes, STS (https://sts.stanford.edu) exists, but again that&#39;s elective and thus involves sacrificing opportunities to take those courses.EDIT- see epoch_100&#39;s link here about Stanford CS embedding ethics throughout the curriculum, which seems to address this concern: https://hai.stanford.edu/news/building-ethical-computational..."</p>

The rest was about software and programming (at least!)- second year: Mathematics IV, Statistics II, Physics II. The rest was about software and programming (nice!)- third year: software and programming only (very nice!)So, about 80% of the students didn&#39;t pass the first year because of its heavy mathematics + physics content.Extra:- mathematics I = logic, Boolen algebra- mathematics II = calculus- matehmatics III = Multivariable calculus and something else I don&#39;t remember- mathematics IV = Complex analysis/complex variable calculus- physics I and II = electromagnetism and friends"</p>

Laziness has its virtues, but invariants, validity checks, run-time type checks, etc. should all be performed as early (and often) as possible - it&#39;s much easier to debug issues when the are proximate to an object or structure being created or modified, then when that data type is being used much later."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; One of the coolest parts of our codebase is the new general purpose language at its foundation. Though the semantics of the language are substantially different than Clojure, it’s defined entirely within Clojure using macros to express the differing behavior. It compiles directly to bytecode using the ASM library. The rest of our system is built using both this language and vanilla Clojure, interoperating seamlessly.Actually this sounds quite horrible."</p>

I would venture that they can train a junior programmer in a couple of weeks, and make them productive very fast.I guess they could make it work in any language but judging by the description clojure is indeed a great fit, due to the macro capabilities, flexibility and solid runtime via JVM."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think you&#39;re reading far too much into this.You spoke with a support agent who is checking the status of your AdSense campaign. That system has flagged links on your website as &#39;malicious&#39;. The agent is simply telling you the links are &#39;not allowed&#39; because the system has flagged them. Ie. you&#39;re not allowed to run AdSense on a site with flagged links.I&#39;m 99% sure this has nothing do with you using a GA alternative."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Clearly Google was kind enough to identify the adtracking as a type of privacy-hostile malware. Now, if only they could extend the courtesy to the horror show that is Google Analytics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A story from a decade back. Setup a site, low traffic, not much change over months. Added AdSense, within days traffic increased.I was thinking, yeah Google, why not turn the knobs a tiny bit - people will hardly notice and it&#39;s win-win for both of us anyway."</p>
