Well done to OP for writing a detailed summary of a succesful productised service that they got off the ground as well as a solid list of actionable tasks you can take to improve your own product.They&#39;ve outlined how their clients have loved the service, it&#39;s been financially successful and everyone is happy, yet all people here do is complain about a) how this is the downfall of the internet b) there&#39;s some technical or editorial minutiae of the post itself they dislike c) how they could have done it better d) what they&#39;re doing is just plain wrong or unimportant.If HN had its way, every product and service on the planet would be devoid of marketing, sales or design and the only way you could buy it was via the command line.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unsurprising, but still disappointing. Actually I&#39;m glad someone is trying to hold them accountable. It seems silly tho that we need to pass a law to uphold what&#39;s already written into the constitution. It highlights that the constitution only has teeth in some legal contexts, primarily where a court case is being heard on a citizen being prosecuted. Conditionality seems to not have any bearing on preventing agencies from violating the constitution or stopping them when they&#39;re found out, nor punishing those responsible for the violation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing I still can&#39;t fathom, all these years after Bush II and then Snowden, is just how little human beings really care about mass surveillance. Yeah, the Snowden leaks made a splash, but the media cycle turned over a couple weeks later and everyone moved onto other things.It&#39;s like, if you&#39;re of a certain age, you had to read 1984 or whatever in school. You&#39;d think &#34;well, no one would stand for that sort of thing in real life!&#34; Okay, so we don&#39;t live in that society, exactly, but time after time, we&#39;re shown the breadth of government surveillance and the reaction from the broader public isn&#39;t to call for anyone&#39;s head on a pike -- it&#39;s not even to vote anyone out!Outside of little communities like this one, people don&#39;t give much of a fuck. I guess that was Orwell&#39;s real point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t like how this article buries the important parts of this story. There is good reason to think that this surveillance by public info is legal currently, there was a court ruling stating that&#39;s the case.A law is necessary to codify that this practice is a violation Fourth Amendment, and Wyden is currently one of a handful of senators trying to get it passed.The story eventually mentions this, but the beginning focus on confidentiality makes it seem like they&#39;re hiding evidence of their crime."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congress is corrupt (via lobbyists). Congress would make this illegal if congress men/women didn&#39;t sell out American Citizens.88% of the cost of the US Fed gov is paid for by taxes by workers (income taxes).  Less than 12% comes from all corp/business taxes combined with capital gains (taxing the rich 1%).  Business shifting tax burden to workers is a massive scale problem.  $3.5 Trillion = US Tax Revenues (2019) and 88% came from workers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Quick summary: the biggest electricity provider in the country (ENEL) made an app (Juicepass) to find and manage their charging stations across the country. The Android Auto functionality of the app has been rejected by Google for non disclosed &#34;security concerns while driving&#34;. The antitrust ruled out it was because Google wanted to sabotage competitor apps to the charging stations finder built-in in the Google Maps app. On top of the fine Google will need to provide the SDK to integrate their app with Android Auto."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way antitrust is working in recent years is kind of ridiculous. Google in Europe is becoming a rich case study in antitrust meh.You find that adwords engages in a blatant &#34;monopolistic abuse&#34; in some specific sense. In the Adwords EU case for example, Google was both monopsonising (google search) and monopolising search advertising. But, the actual violations are specific, like exclusivity requirements and other technical infractions buried in their take-it-or-leave-it contracts with &#34;partners.^&#34;Google get a fine. They deny culpability. They pay a fine and move on. Whether it&#39;s 100m or 2bn doesn&#39;t really matter. Google are demonstrably willing to pay far more (eg acquisition, browser kickbacks, etc.) to maintain a monopolistic position. Besides minor tweaks, there&#39;s no reason for them to change.What&#39;s the point? Antitrust can&#39;t be useful as a violation-fine paradigm. These cases/fines don&#39;t affect the monopoly or free the market in any useful sense.IMO, we need some way to declare a company &#34;Big&#34; and apply special rules to them. If those rules are onerous, that might create some organic pressure to split and/or help smaller incumbents  compete.There is no point to antitrust if its totally reactive, handing out fines for moving violations. The point of antitrust is trust-busting, to affect market structure. The point if to have a competitive market.All the 1990s stuff is playing out. Just like the MSFT case, we see that operating systems, browsers (now app stores) are monopoly prone and that it&#39;s a big deal. On the other side, the 90s &#34;portal&#34; concept is fully realized now. In the digital economy, controlling the windows of consumption is everything. None of the costs, all of the profit... literally all in a lot of cases.^Newspapers didn&#39;t have the advantage search partners had in their monopoly claim, because Google doesn&#39;t have agreements with them. No contract, no abusive clauses. The take it or leave it offer is &#34;give us your content for free, or go away.&#34; Formally, Google isn&#39;t even doing business with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"allegedly, Google did not approve Enel X charging station finder app Juicepass on the Android Auto store due to security and standards concerns. I do not understand why Google did not provide a clear exhaustive explanation on the specifics but just a generic &#34;We have strong standards for the publishing of apps on our Android Auto store&#34;. They are not even trying to justify or defend themselves because they don&#39;t need to - they will pay the fine and move on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Big fan of notion. Not a fan of the data lock-in or haphazard security. For tools like this, SaaS will almost always beat open source just by virtue of elbow grease and a product direction. So I’m willing to forego the open source alternatives. But I really wish Notion gave me more options for how to host my data. AFAICT they offer no “dedicated storage” or “on premise” plan, even if you want to pay for it.In fact I heard a rumor that the entirety of Notion runs on a single unsharded database. If true, combined with the fact that this API took so long to ship, I have to assume that there is a crippling amount of tech debt in their stack. Hopefully it’s growing pains and they’re sorting it out, but it doesn’t make me feel confident about the security of my (most sensitive) data.It’s maybe also a cautionary tale about what happens when you dismiss too many early decisions as “premature optimization.” You ship fast in the beginning but a few years later you’re buried in all the debt you generated.Granted, it’s a good problem to have. If the choice is between a profitable, popular company buried in tech debt, or the perfect stack with no customers, I’ll take the debt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I initially signed up for Notion, I did so thinking the API was already usable. It was used as a selling point for their premium service even though it wasn&#39;t implemented. This was a year and a half ago or so.I felt pretty burned by it and killed my subscription. Hopefully this turns out well for the people who&#39;ve been waiting for it, but that experience left a terrible taste in my mouth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve recently started using Notion and I&#39;m surprised at few things that I find incredibly annoying with it so far. Since it seems there are some Notion staff here I&#39;ll take this as a change to give some feedback to hopefully improve the product.* No read-only mode. I like to have documents default to a read-only mode so I don&#39;t accidentally typo random characters, or delete something when try copying. etc.* No floating table of contents. There is a ToC block but it&#39;s at a fixed position, where it&#39;s not terribly usable especially for long documents having a giant ToC at the top isn&#39;t great. I&#39;ve tried using columns but it just squishes the rest of the document way too much* Floating heads. When you have multiple collaborators the avatars zooming up and down the left side of the document is incredibly distracting. I&#39;d love a way to disable this completely. I don&#39;t care where in a document other people are reading.* Database/Table horizontal scrollbar. Almost every database in our documents end up with this giant scrollbar that spans edge to edge, looking like a horizontal rule, breaking up the visual flow of the page significantly. I keep thinking it&#39;s some kind of page break.These are just some of my initial impressions. I do think it&#39;s a very visually nice product and has a lot of neat features but I&#39;m pretty surprised by some basic QoL stuff missing and hope to see it further refined."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very perplexing behavior from Musk, I must say. Bitcoin&#39;s energy consumption has been front-and-center for a few years now and even more so when the bull market got hot. How does Musk decide to throw $1.5 billion worth of Tesla&#39;s cash into BTC without acknowledging this? I was expecting a little bit more due-diligence from him, but he&#39;s been absolutely consumed by crypto markets in general."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised that nobody&#39;s mentioned it here, but this crypto boom has sent demand for mining hardware through the roof, which has contributed in no small part to the chip shortage. Miners are buying up ASICs, GPUs and FPGAs at a premium.In the short term, crashing the crypto market can ease demand for semiconductors, but in the long term, getting cryptos to move to Proof of Steak will hopefully ease it up for good (But don&#39;t quote me on that!)It&#39;s no secret that one of their biggest supply chain constraints is chips right now (aside from batteries.) So it&#39;s not all that ridiculous to imagine them pulling this kind of publicity stunt off so that they can actually produce and sell more cars. And if they can profit off of it at the end of the day, even better!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, that&#39;s incredible.  Goes to show that people do walk away from plane crashes with some regularity.  My father was a pilot[0].He sold his plane about 15 years ago (to a group of owners, one of which was a priest, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a joke in there).  A few of winters later, he was called out to Romeo Airport; the pilot flying the plane that was formerly his had crashed the aircraft a few miles short of the runway in bad weather[1].  He was traveling with his daughter, a friend and, I think, his wife.  He died, but his daughter was able to get free and make her way to a nearby farm to call for help.  Looking at the plane, the fact that anyone survived at all let alone walked to a nearby house with minor injuries is pretty miraculous.It&#39;s hard to impress upon folks who have never been in a small plane like that just how ... yeah ... how much it feels like you&#39;re hanging onto a kite.  I have no idea the kinds of structural technologies are involved in the aircraft but I know his plane was made in the 70s and was light enough that he only had a pole which attached to the front landing gear to pull it out of the hangar.  The weight is so critical that the 7-seat plane can realistically only seat 4-5 adults.  I remember being shocked that they had to weigh the paint they applied when he had the plane re-painted.[0] I&#39;ll spare the details as I have left many comments in the past about his experiences.[1] https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/43894 - &#34;Pilot Error&#34;; I recall my Dad saying &#34;all plane crashes are pilot error&#34;[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-32_Cherokee_Six"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just in case anyone (like me) is thinking - wait did that aeroplane have a parachute?From:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cirrus_Airframe_Parachute_Sy...The Cirrus Airframe Parachute System (CAPS) is a whole-plane ballistic parachute recovery system designed specifically for Cirrus Aircraft&#39;s line of general aviation light aircraft including the SR20, SR22 and SF50. The design became the first of its kind to become certified with the FAA, achieving certification in October 1998, and as of 2014 was the only aircraft ballistic parachute used as standard equipment by an aviation company."</p>

Well I think the biggest notable difference between then and now is then bitcoin seemed to be going only up. Now it seems to be going down. When bitcoin continues to  steadily go down, it is a significant concern because Tesla will have to take losses on the cars it sells and will have reduced gross margins, which will result in their stock price tanking.Musk smartly decided he did not want to risk his half a trillion dollar company on random bitcoin fluctuations. It is probably the right decision (although certainly covered up with false reasoning) but he should have never reached this stage. Tesla should have never taken bitcoin without provisions for automatically converting it into one of the currencies it pays its costs in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If TSLA has already dumped their Bitcoin, Elon just pulled off a highly lucrative pump and dump scheme.1. Buy $1.5 billion in BTC2. Announce TSLA will accept BTC, with the knowledge that very few people will actually do that, and public support from a major company will drive up the price of BTC.3. Sell off your BTC at the higher price. A portion was sold in Q1 for a hefty profit already.4. Rinse and repeat with DOGE?The environmental impact was well known before they bought it, so it&#39;s a little odd that they&#39;d reverse course because of that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A large number of people were making comments about the environmental concerns of crypto the instant Tesla announced they were buying into Bitcoin. What changed?It&#39;s really hard to argue Tesla&#39;s surprise here. (Elon Musk actually replied to Jack Dorsey saying &#34;True&#34; in response to his argument that Bitcoin is good for renewable energy: https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1385107878055317509 )"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fact this was paid off, and paid off so rapidly means that targeting major infrastructure for massive payoffs is going to become more and more prominent. The next time though, it&#39;ll be $50M. I work with people in the oil fields and I know the numbers they are playing with and the fact that a single well being down can easily be $100,000 lost per hour. So obviously they want these systems back up fast.$5M for shutting down that major of a pipeline seems like too little, unless, of course, they weren&#39;t expecting the company to even pay. Now that these actors know that the oil (and quite likely other utilities) are more than willing to pay big bucks to get back online, they will be targeted far more.There are so many reasons this is very very bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t have much to add here, but I&#39;ve been going to Def Con and the other Las Vegas security conferences for a few years. Every year there is a section for infrastructure security (factories, refineries, etc). Its always the smallest section and the least populated. But its simultaneously the &#34;most important&#34; in terms of how much damage can be done from a single attack. Every year I went and was always terrified by all the stuff I saw because all the people hosting booths were like &#34;yeah its dead simple to get in and break things.&#34; I feel like so many people could see this coming and there are just no consequences for the companies to incentivize them to do better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Colonial is being widely lambasted for a culture of absolutely lackadaisical security.  Call me callous but numerous federal agencies exist to issue security best practices and exploit announcements.  numerous vendors also exist.  play stupid games, win stupid prizes.Not paying the ransom would have been tantamount to complete dissolution of the company.  it would have tirggered a much wider investigation into the company with shareholders abandoning it as the outage dragged on at the hands of an incompetent leadership.Unfortunately it seems to have been a Pyrrhic victory as paying the ransom puts their shareholders at risk of serious sanctions and indictment from the US Dept. of the Treasury.https://home.treasury.gov/system/files/126/ofac_ransomware_a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work on a B2B app with a lot of local govt users. We dropped support officially for IE11 last summer and I was surprised by the little to no pushback.Our stance was if you needed to use IE11 for a legacy application, that&#39;s fine -- but our application required something besides IE and you&#39;re not limited to only one browser on your computer.Any stances by IT that they haven&#39;t had a chance to authorize another browser or prove that another browser was secure compared to IE11 is an absolute joke at this point. Any IT department that is telling users to use IE11 for security reasons is questionable imho."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been keeping a log of the slow death of IE here: https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1260627626739130369?s=20in the past year, major sites in all categories from linkedin to twitter to skillshare to microsoft to adobe have all dropped IE, with Wordpress, Drupal and Vuejs making plans.The big catalyst I think will be the US government dropping IE support - it only supports browsers above 2% usage (https://github.com/uswds/uswds/issues/3877), and we are currently hovering at 2% dropping 0.1% a month https://analytics.usa.gov/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not even joking when I say this, for some companies, it would literally be cheaper to buy your IE users a new computer. Obviously, for enterprise customers, who are likely to be the majority of IE 11 users, you can&#39;t necessarily do that (though think about if you can)."</p>
