								<p class="story__comment_others">"This doesn&#39;t surprise me at all.If you&#39;re reading and you&#39;re really determined to overcome corruption, you need to document everything. Getting the other auditor on board would be good too. Make sure you assert that the privilege of holding office is yours, provide the certificate, and show them the laws. If they still deny you the authority and position, then look up a PA law called official oppression. Report this crime to the police. If they decline to cite/arrest, look up the process for filing a private criminal complaint. The DA could still decline to prosecute, but you could appeal that decision to a judge. Good luck (my experience is nobody in the system actually cares and they&#39;ll side with the establishment)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometimes company legal teams can be the most accessible way to draw attention to something like this, and I don&#39;t mean in a combative way. They&#39;re very risk conscious, they see a &#39;10+ years of building a heavy metal community, gone like a puff of smoke&#39; in terms of risks, both of bad publicity but also if you were to somehow litigate because of the damage to your business or project. Often they have an email address that is manned because they have to respond to legal requests of various types.You can potentially request all your data (and data about the hack) and let them know why, maybe reach out asking how you can get law enforcement involved and who you should contact after you&#39;ve made a police report. It&#39;s not a threat, but it get it on somebodies radar. If you express how devastated you are there is potential for them to help. They also have a lot more latitude than any kind of helpdesk (especially at the scale of Facebook, and the users/customers facebook has).They&#39;re also well connected with-in an organization because they have to sign-off on all kinds of projects and risks.I think `patio11` has amazing advice is a similar vein[1].[1]: https://twitter.com/patio11/status/1162561822248992768?lang=... (I think he has a longer version/reference, but I can&#39;t find it)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Probably not the advice you&#39;re looking for, but looks like you have a blog also and am assuming that some/many of your subscribers also look at your blog. So, you may want to use your blog to spread the word about losing your page so that your subscribers know what&#39;s happening and you don&#39;t lose many of them.In addition, while you should keep looking at ways to recover your FB page, but you may want to take this opportunity to create a more traditional forum of your own.You may want to look at AVSForum.com, Home-Barista.com and others for ideas on how to structure very successful traditional review/forum sites and while it may be more effort initially as you&#39;ll have to build it yourself, in the long run it may be more fruitful for you.Either ways, Good Luck!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Universally necessary services like communication, healthcare, and social media (the digital plaza) can never be justly managed by private companies.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is pretty incredible. These aren&#39;t just good practices, they&#39;re the fairly bleeding edge best practices.1. No more SMS and TOTP. FIDO2 tokens only.2. No more unencrypted network traffic - including DNS, which is such a recent development and they&#39;re mandating it. Incredible.3. Context aware authorization. So not just &#34;can this user access this?&#34; but attestation about device state! That&#39;s extremely cutting edge - almost no one does that today.My hope is that this makes things more accessible. We do all of this today at my company, except where we can&#39;t - for example, a lot of our vendors don&#39;t offer FIDO2 2FA or webauthn, so we&#39;re stuck with TOTP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real crux of the issue is the long-tail of applications which were never conceived with anything but network-based trust. I&#39;m certain the DoD is absolutely packed with these, probably for nearly every workflow.The reason this was so &#34;easy&#34; for Google (and some other companies, like GitLab[1]) to realize most of these goals is that they are a web-based technology company - fundamentally the tooling and scalable systems needed to get started were web so the transition were &#34;free&#34;. Meaning, most of the internal apps were HTTP apps, built on internal systems, and the initial investment was just to make an existing proxied internal service, external and behind a context aware proxy [1].The hard part for most other companies (and the DoD) is figuring out what to do with protocols and workflows that aren&#39;t http or otherwise proxyable.[1] https://cloud.google.com/iap/docs/cloud-iap-context-aware-ac...[2] https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2019/10/02/zero-trust-at-gitla..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our corporate IT folks have a Zero Trust Manifesto in which there are enrolled devices (laptops that remote SREs can carry around), there are enterprise applications, and there&#39;s connectivity between these (e.g., tunnel pairs). SREs often need to write scripts that operate on sensitive production data from the enterprise applications, but must do this work directly on an enrolled device.Pre-Zero-Trust days seemed safer. Copying production data to a laptop wasn&#39;t allowed. Instead, each SRE had their own Linux VM in the data center, accessible from home and able to run the scripts (with connectivity to the enterprise application). This prevented a whole class of realistic attacks in which a laptop (while unlocked/decrypted) is taken by an adversary. Admittedly, in return, we&#39;re protected from a possible, but less likely, attack in which a Linux VM is compromised and used for lateral movement within one segment of the enterprise network. (An enrolled device has to be in the user&#39;s possession; it can&#39;t be any machine, Linux or Windows, in the data center or office.)The only people who love this are our enterprise application vendors. Our bosses are paying them a TON more money to implement new requirements where, in theory, all possible types of data analysis can be done directly within the enterprise application. No more scripts, no more copying of data. No more use of Open Source. And, of course, people from these same enterprise application vendors advise the government that Zero Trust must be a top priority mandate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Naomi Wu seems to upset a lot of people. She makes things, and was accused by the publisher of &#34;Make&#34; magazine of being a fake, with some guy doing the actual work. She replied by posting long, detailed videos of her making stuff. An hour of cutting aluminum extrusions with a chop saw and putting together a frame. Soldering PC boards. Eventually, the guy apologized.One of the useful things she&#39;s done is to put up lots of videos of her running around Shenzhen. There aren&#39;t enough ground-level videos of the working parts of Chinese cities. There&#39;s extensive coverage of Tokyo, by comparison. It&#39;s interesting to see the high-density housing blocks and street-level activity. (The &#34;let&#39;s increase housing density&#34; crowd from Strong Towns should watch those videos.) People who&#39;ve met her report that she knows Shenzhen very well, down to the back alley level, where some unmarked door leads to an important factory. She&#39;s toured the electronics markets of Huaqiangbei. (I miss the days when Silicon Valley had electronics parts stores.)She&#39;s done some nice technical work. Her main thing is 3D printing, and she came up with the first angled 3D printer that worked reliably. The print head moves in a plane 45 degrees from vertical, and the base surface is a belt, which advances the workpiece one layer at a time. So it can produce objects continuously, or very long objects if you add support rollers. Others had made prototypes of such machines, but the properties of the belt and print head are touchy to make that work right. She got it all working, and it&#39;s now a product, with her picture on the box.At various times she&#39;s pushed on GPL compliance, mask quality, and other issues of interest to the tech community.She wears skimpy outfits sometimes. So what? That&#39;s most of Instagram. Unlike most Instagrammers, Wu has something original to say. Sometimes with a biting wit. I gather that it&#39;s more biting in Cantonese."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For any Westerners here who seem to have a hard time understanding why this is wrong:Look at an even more women-oppressing culture such as that of Afghanistan under the Taliban. Women are required to cover their faces in public. Why? For &#34;modesty.&#34; What it boils down to is that if women show their faces it could have a negative effect on men (sexual attraction).A lot of people where are shaming her for being essentially immodest in her quest for female empowerment. A face is not immodest. A boob is not immodest. It is not sexualized because it is just a body part. It takes a man to do the sexualization, so the sexualization isn&#39;t the boob, but a man&#39;s who is doing the sexualization. A baby does not sexualize the boob (it&#39;s food). They get conditioned to it by society and culture as they grow older (a culture that sexualizes it).Sub out face in Afghanistan with boob in America and you&#39;ll see it&#39;s the same picture. While we should pat ourselves on the back for being so progressive as to allow women to show their faces in public, we haven&#39;t quite gotten to the point where it&#39;s ok to show boobs in public. And yes, some women prefer to wear burkas, just as some women prefer to hide their boobs in public.The point is that those restrictions on women shouldn&#39;t be dictated by the actions or effects they have on men. Instead, men should either change their viewpoints or control their own sexualization so that women don&#39;t have to accommodate. These immodest views come from those who sexualize women, and because that&#39;s out of the control of women so they should not be forced to accommodate something out of their control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh... while talented, she is constantly pushing the boundaries of taste and the YouTube TOS to gain subscribers.She pretends to be some women&#39;s rights activist when she&#39;s really just a purveyor of some weird type of titillation. Yes the algorithm is capricious, yes its arbitrary, and yes YouTube is evil. But she&#39;s clearly making a bust of herself naked. I&#39;m sure if I put my balls on YouTube they&#39;d be more than demonetized.I have no problem with her personally, I also don&#39;t find her interesting at all... but it is what it is. YouTube probably needs to classify videos more finely grained so that we can distinguish between types of videos and match tolerances for blue content to advertisers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first job out of school was at a dot-com in Vegas in the year 2000 initially as the network administrator. Susan was the Director of Marketing. My first interaction with her was typical assisting someone with some issue or another, but I noticed her book shelf was full of very technical books, and it turned out she was a Microsoft Certified Solutions Expert and I was just a simple MCP (I was new to Windows NT, my background was in Netware). I was about 22 and she was about 40, and it was very intimidating at the time, especially after I learned she was Susan Thunder.While the company was downsizing (dot-com bust) the CTO told me to batten down the hatches while Susan was being laid off. I told him that I&#39;m fairly confident she knows more about NT than I do and that I didn&#39;t think I could do enough to secure things, so we more or less shut things down for the night.I sort of remember the whole company being scared of her in general. I don&#39;t know why though, she was always very nice to me and seemed pleasant in general. It was an overreaction to shut down the network that night, Susan never attempted revenge. In hindsight, she was probably an adult that understood that companies fail and it wasn&#39;t personal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since the JWST design started, there&#39;s been a revolution in the &#34;easiness&#34; of launches.I wonder if a future evolution of space telescopes will be some kind of interferometric (obviously extremely hard for IR or visible light, but easier for radio and microwaves) swarm of cheap semi-disposible telescopes than one enormous one.Then you can add to the swarm, upgrade elements, and retire failed elements without having to eat a multi-billion helping of humble pie.And rather than have a fearsomely complex integrated sunshield, you could have a similar swarm of simpler satellites that provide a large cool area at L2, and then the observers just need to handle their own heat.I suppose this could be described as microservices...in spaaaaace.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The funny thing is that everyone commenting here thinks that we&#39;re headed towards an authoritarian nightmare, but for different reasons.It&#39;s not until you sit with someone and nut out what they mean by &#34;authoritarian&#34; and &#34;censorship&#34; and so on that you realise you&#39;re completely morally and politically opposed to them.This shallow political take is what allows so many strange bedfellows to unite on the &#34;political right&#34; (which is no longer really a relevant tag).I&#39;m reminded of this amazing review by George Orwell:&#34;Yet each writer is convinced that the other’s policy leads directly to slavery, and the alarming thing is that they may both be right.&#34;https://maudestavern.com/2008/10/09/george-orwell-review/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No doubt, these censors and would-be censors have the best of intentions. But you&#39;ve really got your head up your own ass if you convince yourself that you are protecting people by deciding the information that is appropriate for them to be exposed to. I just don&#39;t understand the shortsightedness, the naivete, or the willingness to discard the principle of free speech."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I say Bah to the entire censorship debate!My critique of Substack is that our lesson from the last ten years is simple: speech should happen primarily on platforms that are prohibited from profit-seeking and run in the public interest. Censorship on these platforms should be prohibited, of course, but so should any form of profit seeking.Our problem isn&#39;t censorship. Our problem is that our political/economic/religious/public health discourse is entirely mediated by corporations that are helmed by clever and well-educated folks and funded by the tippy-top of the elite financier class, who expect exceptional ROI."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;&#34;&#34;
One could imagine a very imperative “cluster operating system,” like the above, which exposed primitives like “allocate 5 CPUs worth of compute” or “create a new virtual network,” which in turn backed onto configuration changes either in the system’s internal abstractions or into calls into the EC2 API (or other underlying cloud provider).
&#34;&#34;&#34;There is a name for this: Single System Image. There is no need to write the operating system layer - Linux works well.I built a SSI. Each grid can host several apps, &#39;gridapps&#39;. As priorities change during the day, an operator can rebalance resources using a bash-like shell. Each gridapp has (1) core nodes, which need to keep running, and (2) scale nodes which can be started and stopped. Nodes can be configured so they are taskset-bound to an individual processor, or sharing a processor between several nodes. There are equivalent primitives for memory and persistent storage. Commercial, 1000 cores.The author contrasts this with K8s by saying that K8s is declarative. This is not the important distinction. My system had declarative configuration, and did a fitting at startup.The key difference is motive. The design above is the natural choice when you build a grid computer from first-principles.K8s is designed to solve a different problem: scaling up the traditional model of programming. Here, a developer writes an algorithm on their workstation. The deployment circumstances and interactions with other systems are an afterthought. Often this developer does not deploy the code themselves, this is done by another team who don&#39;t understand the internals of the code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Disclaimer: I have never used k8s, so cannot assess the factual accuracy of this piece.)If Kubernetes hasn’t yet incorporated this article into their documentation somewhere prominent, they should. This is an excellent, and crucial, piece of documentation: providing a mental model and explaining key design decisions. All complex systems should have a document like this one. As a newcomer, this is what I want to read first.Bravo, author. I hope you get rewarded."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The posters here who are commenting on what should be (often largely what Kubernetes already is) would do well to read the paper about the Omega scheduler.https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.c...It is almost the rule that none of us has the breadth of experience to understand all of the problems that need to be solved. In fact, an explicit goal of Kubernetes is that almost all users should not need to understand much of how the system actually works.Frankly, most users have neither the time, inclination or intellectual capacity to understand more than a tiny part of the systems they work on. That includes most people who say they do understand those systems completely ... a few short questions can generally expose how little they know about important aspects.That ignorance is a measure of success, btw, not failure."</p>
