								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personally I&#39;ve used SVGs and linear gradients to achieve a smooth gradient. I made a CodePen about it several year ago: https://codepen.io/toastal/pen/NAVybq"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just before Christmas I got an urge to add a dither filter to my JS canvas library. The past few weeks have certainly been a very intense adventure through a very deep rabbit hole involving color spaces, color distances and discovering how to generate a best-fit reduced palette of colors and then dither it (hello, blue noise!)I finally managed to complete the work last week and I&#39;m quite happy with the results. Using the library people can set the colors of graphical objects or gradients using any CSS color space string (RGB, HSL, HWB, LAB, LCH) and the color should render as expected. The reduce-noise filter uses LAB internally to calculate color distances, but in the end I compromised and used euler distances for the algorithm rather than one of the more modern algorithms.Work is still on a branch in the library[1] but I&#39;m hoping to merge it into the main code in the next week or so (after testing across devices/screens/etc).Aside: Safari has gone ahead and introduced support for HWB, LAB and LCH color strings in CSS. Sadly, they&#39;re not recognised by Safari&#39;s canvas engine (yet). Also, their HSL and HWB gradients seem to be the same as the RGB gradients; their LAB/LCH gradients seem to dodge the dreaded Gray Zone.[1] - https://github.com/KaliedaRik/Scrawl-canvas/tree/dec-21-dith..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article seems to give RGB a bad rap but I think it makes the most sense for gradients. I wouldn&#39;t want a yellow to blue gradient to cycle through a (partial) rainbow of colors. But I also wouldn&#39;t really ever choose to make a pure yellow to pure blue gradient. Most pleasing gradients you see in the wild use colors that are more similar to begin with, so it&#39;s a bit of a strawman. It&#39;s really just about carefully choosing your start and end (and optionally intermediate) colors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this is fabulous!  They spent almost $5000 to buy and test every mask available on Amazon.If you click on a mask it will take you to a page with the test details.  More incredibly, most of the masks also have 5-7 minute video review!If you click on the &#34;Breathability&#34; column, then on &#34;Grade&#34; twice, you will end up with a list of masks that Pass with the most breathable masks first.Way to go, Lloyd.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I find annoying is that they still return results that are those sites that seem to register a load of terms that all point to the same page. You see this with telephone numbers, song lyrics etc. where the result looks like &#34;Lyrics for Stairway to Heaven&#34; but you click through and there is no content, just a page that says &#34;Upload some lyrics to this song&#34;.. etc.These sites should be heavily penalised for click-baiting and they have been doing it for years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ironically, my work on my own search engine has led me to be a bit more patient with Google&#39;s problems. At least I think I understand them better. Search engines fail in weird ways.I think in part that Google just has gotten a spectacularly confusing failure mode. If it can&#39;t find good matching contents, it starts second-guessing your query and producing other results, which makes you think it&#39;s not even considering what you entered. It may even be &#34;better&#34; in the sense that it&#39;s more likely to return at least something relevant, but in practice it&#39;s bad UX because it&#39;s so unintuitive what&#39;s happening. It&#39;s probably one of those unfortunate optimizations that are invisible when they work and frustrating when they don&#39;t.There is so much stuff on the Internet it&#39;s easy to start thinking there is guaranteed to be good results for any search, and that just doesn&#39;t seem to be the case. Especially with highly specified searches with 6-8 terms, you quickly enter the domain where you&#39;re reasonably unlikely to find an exact match."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I search for &#34;databricks series b valuation&#34; in Google (from Argentina, using Google.com in English) result #6 is:&#34;Python get value from database - Büro Jorge Schmidt&#34;, which judging by title and preview seems to be a Python + MySQL tutorial. It returns a 403 error and might be a hacked site, since the home page is for a graphic design studio in Munich.Result #8 is something similar:&#34;Intellij flatten packages - Músicos de Viaje&#34;. This is definitely a hacked site (from Spain, apparently) that redirects me somewhere else.Result #10:&#34;How to calculate tax percentage in sql query&#34;. Another hacked site, this time for an evangelical church from Brazil.Now... how can Google think that any of these sites are relevant? Even if it doesn&#39;t realize the pages are hacked... even its crawler has been fed content that included the keywords... :A - The sites themselves don&#39;t match the query at all.B - No legit site about the subject would link to these sites.C - The results themselves (title, url, preview), as Google shows them, have nothing to do with the search!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author is fighting a strawman. Rather than engage with the specific problems these solutions were built to solve they dismissively regard them as just flavor of the week trends purely for the sake of chasing newness. This is true of the entire post, but I&#39;ll tackle just one since it&#39;s emblematic of my issues with all the rest:The argument for Electron and React Native isn&#39;t &#34;it&#39;s modern&#34;, it&#39;s &#34;it&#39;s much cheaper&#34;. Hiring experienced desktop application devs to build a quality native app for each platform is going to be expensive, hiring a few JS bootcampers to build one react UI that works on every platform is extremely cheap - shittier performance is the tradeoff to instantly have access to every platform. It&#39;s not a coincidence that Electron apps like e.g. Slack, Spotify, Discord are massively dominant players in their markets, I doubt you&#39;d look the engineering leads of these companies in the face and tell them that you believe they put no thought into the tradeoffs of Electron and that they&#39;re just following trends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel comfortable with asserting that the author has never worked on a complex web application. This web-dev hate borders on pathological: this is a guy that seems to specialize in Unix/Linux tooling, doesn&#39;t have a single tutorial on web app development [1], and yet has an intense hatred towards a space that he barely understands.These types of arguments are incredibly embarrassing to read, not only because they betray a stunning lack of familiarity with the topic, but it&#39;s basically a conspiracy theory: everybody is stupid except me, all these successful companies making billions of dollars and attracting top talent are just throwing money into a fire for fun.[1] https://unixsheikh.com/tutorials.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a greybeard. I&#39;ve been doing this since before HTML existed, and I&#39;ve kept up with the changes as they occurred along the way.I&#39;m not going to refute the author&#39;s points one by one. Everything being complained about exists for a reason. I agree that it&#39;s incredibly complex. It&#39;s overwhelming. That&#39;s why people specialize.An individual can still own an entire application and infrastructure, limit their technology choices to those from the 90s, and produce a perfectly functional, modern web application indistinguishable from anything using the latest tools and frameworks. It&#39;s a whole lot of work, though.If you take the time to learn some of the modern tools, they&#39;ll save you a lot of time. Why re-invent the wheel? But all these time-saving frameworks are complex, and learning all of them would take years, if you haven&#39;t been keeping up as they evolved. You can learn one or two of them quickly, though. You can specialize.That&#39;s why we have DevOps teams, UI teams, API teams, database teams. That&#39;s a lot of people. But that&#39;s what it takes if you want a high-performance web application that can scale to support hundreds of millions of users, is responsive around the world, supports a variety of languages, can handle disruptions, complies with regulations, and on and on. Don&#39;t need those things? Then stick with PHP and HTML on a server you run yourself. This isn&#39;t the 90s anymore. There are a lot of people out there, and if you&#39;re building something worth using, it&#39;s a different ballgame."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Meanwhile our idiot city (Oxford, UK) is spending £1.2m on &#34;Quickways&#34;, which are painted lines on existing roads... guaranteed to keep cyclists 0% safe. This in the face of national Government guidance in favour of physical segregation from cars. (Plans at https://letstalk.oxfordshire.gov.uk/quickway-cycle-route-oxf...: the promise of &#34;segregation where possible&#34; in reality means about 5% of the network.)It is really frustrating how highway engineers, as a profession, are unwilling to consistently learn lessons from the Netherlands in designing cycle infrastructure. Many cities seem to delight in half-assing their own solutions. So congratulations to Milan, who look like they may have got it right."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you live in a region where bike infrastructure is underfunded, and car infrastructure is overfunded, it’s probable that’s because cycling is viewed as a recreational activity in your area and thus undeserving of tax dollars compared to ‘essential’ car travel.If you disagree with that, (and live in a democracy) let someone know! Find out who controls the infrastructure spending in your area and call/email them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If any of you have been to Milan, the inner circle of the image [1] is more or less the city boundary. That path could be anything between 70 to 100 km according to how they&#39;ll design it. I had no problems cycling 100+ km around the city during the second quasi-lockdown of one winter ago.The grey area is what&#39;s called &#34;città metropolitana&#34; now, basically the old province of Milan including more than 100 of other cities. Milan accounts for almost half of the population.[1] Deep link to the bike paths network https://cdn.road.cc/sites/default/files/styles/main_width/pu..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Turns out, you can’t. From what I could gather, the version of Chrome was tied to ChromeOS which couldn’t be updated because of the hardware. No new ChromeOS meant no new Chrome which meant stuck at version 76.This is the most surprising part of the article. If ChromeOS does not allow the browser to be updated after the hardware has reached end-of-support, I would recommend it to nobody, ever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A friend lent me a 2017 iPad that she&#39;s no longer using. I wanted to download Spotify, but couldn&#39;t, because I needed a newer version of iOS.The device does not get a new version of iOS, so I tried Safari to see if the web client works. Spotify&#39;s web client does not work on that version of Safari.So I tried downloading Firefox and Chrome, but I can&#39;t because they no longer support my version of iOS.So I looked for a way to download older versions of apps (Spotify, or an older version of Firefox or Chrome on which Spotify would still work). As it turns out, there&#39;s a way: you first need to &#34;purchase&#34; the app you&#39;re interested in on a newer device that supports the latest version. Then, you can log into your older device and download an older version of the same app.That means there&#39;s a way for me to run an older version of an app that works on my iPad, but nah, I need to first get a newer device and &#34;purchase&#34; it there.My conclusion: the onus is on the device manufacturers to not arbitrarily restrict their users. Jim Nielsen&#39;s mom&#39;s iPad is perfectly capable of opening that website, but its manufacturers are limiting it artificially."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first line of the article is misleading. It&#39;s not just about a &#34;crappy laptop&#34;, it&#39;s about locked-down devices (ChromeOS, iPad) that have had their support terms expire. I suppose that is crappy, but it&#39;s not quite the image I&#39;d conjure myself.For various reasons but mainly because I so rarely use laptops, I have a crappy laptop from ca. 2010. It&#39;s slow, with a spinning-rust hard disk and an Intel Celeron from its day; it&#39;s a miracle it even allowed up to a 4GB RAM upgrade. With a GPU that can barely manage to process a 1366x768 framebuffer needed for the built-in screen, it&#39;s an unpleasant experience all around. By all means it&#39;s the definition of crappy laptop and that held even when the thing was new.All the same, it has no problem running Debian 11, and both the newest Chromium and Firefox can at least launch on it. It does take half a minute for the browser windows to actually appear, but it works, more or less. The per-site experience after this depends heavily on how much &#34;cool tech&#34; web site developers have opted to use. YouTube is practically unusable even in the tiny video window it displays and 360p videos. Hacker News is perfectly fine.Perhaps bias on my own part, but I would argue that this case is the crappy laptop that&#39;s reasonable to optimize for. It may not be pleasant, but for large classes of web sites, it should be bearable to some extent. I&#39;m pretty sure both the Chromebook and iPad mentioned in the article have better hardware specs than my thing, but they&#39;re both made by companies that are far too willing to drop support after a short period, leaving users in an insecure status and many of them just don&#39;t know why web sites stop working."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My dad who passed away some years ago on my 50th birthday, worked on the design for the AGR for many, many years. Fond memories of him picking me up from school and excitedly telling me the interesting problems he had to solve that day on the walk home. A lovely way to start my day - thank you for sharing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bet the Fukushima backup power system would have fit this explanation perfectly:&gt; in addition to the grid connection, there are four twelve megawatt diesel generator stations spaced around each corner of the plant -- each with two generators, any one of which is able to provide operating power to keep the reactor&#39;s safety systems working.Unfortunately for Fukushima, all generators were flooded by a single Tsunami. What are the odds of an unknown event that will affect all generators? Think of EMP, contaminated fuel, a large cloud of C)2 suffocating the engines... All seem highly unlikely, but how do you plan for the unknown unknowns?The most likely (and I think underestimated) risk for Nuclear plants is a systemic change due to a large (climate?) crisis and/or war. Think of the collapse of the Soviet Union, that definitely increased risk and reduced maintenance budget for a few Nuclear plants. Any significant sea level rise, drought or flood could very well trigger such events (even if the reactor is not affected directly, the society around it will be). That is why I think nuclear is a risky option to reach net-zero; every plant you build is a bet on the future stability of society for at least 75 years (time until the plant will be safely decommissioned by future generations). I would feel much safer in a world covered in solar panels, wind turbines and transmission lines (and highly variable spot pricing) than in one with nuclear plants that require constant care by experts and that even in the best case incur a huge cost on society to safely decommission.&gt; In 2016 the European Commission assessed that European Union&#39;s nuclear decommissioning liabilities were seriously underfunded by about 118 billion euros, with only 150 billion euros of earmarked assets to cover 268 billion euros of expected decommissioning costs covering both dismantling of nuclear plants and storage of radioactive parts and waste. France had the largest shortfall with only 23 billion euros of earmarked assets to cover 74 billion euros of expected costs  [1][1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_decommissioning"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"French power grid agency RTE made a report[0] forecasting 2050 France energy mix, and because of loss of knowledge and increased security measures, even with strong political will, France won&#39;t be able to maintain its 70% nuclear power electricity share.
Most nuclear-intensive scenario in this report is max 50% nuclear energy.[0]https://assets.rte-france.com/prod/public/2021-12/Futurs-Ene... in french"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">" Not very surprised.An Indian expat living in NL, with parents living back home in India. My (retired, old) parents are afraid to get tested for COVID because they hear way too many incidents from their neighbourhood about “hospitals faking COVID test results just so that they can admit them for 4 days, administer expensive drugs, charge them some hefty bill, and send home”. As stupid as it sounds, I could not force my parents to go and wait in the line to get COVID test, after he says “I believe I don’t have COVID now. But if I go to the testing center that is so badly managed and understaffed where only people with obvious high level of COVID are brought to get official result, I will get COVID there!”.Say what you will, but if the basic trust in doctors and healthcare is lost, how would people get tested, and how can you trust any statistics from there?!I’m ashamed, stupefied and angry at the same time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excess deaths will need to become the standard statistic used to compare nations.  Otherwise, we&#39;ll be debating &#34;deaths FROM vs. deaths WITH COVID&#34; and the differing statistical definitions from nation to nation.  Moreover, is a death from lack of access to medical care due to the collapse of a medical system a COVID death?  Is a death of despair from isolation and unemployment a COVID death?My sense is, when the pandemic is analyzed historically, &#34;excess deaths&#34; will be the only salient statistic in the literature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"India desperately needs a public institution like the NHS of the UK!Few years ago my father died of ILD(Interstitial Lung Disease), as per the doctors. I had my doubts about the diagnosis, but I had no where to go to for second opinion. There is a private hospital syndicate in every city of India; no hospital goes against other hospitals in the same city; they will cover each others back because most of the hospitals have the same &#34;consulting doctors&#34;. They just loot the patient&#39;s relatives by prescribing same drug but from different manufacturer. And if they realise that the patient is going to die, then the family members are pressured to take the patient home or elsewhere, this is to avoid &#34;death count&#34; on their register. I was literally asked to take my father home the day he died suggesting that &#34;take him home, we will provide the ambulance and he will die on the way home so it won&#39;t be on anyone of us!&#34;The medicine profession in India is not just joke, it is inhumane and lacks any value for humanity.India should have looked at some of the European countries when setting up it&#39;s healthcare, education and news media policy. Unfortunately the country has copied verbatim everything in this regard from the US!"</p>
