								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been thinking about the difference between human users and computational agents. There is a widespread pattern of enforcing that only human users may interact with a service, not computational agents. Running a user-installed extension is one example; additional examples are CAPTCHAs, account verification by phone number, or services which refuse to provide API access such as banks.Sometimes the reason is to protect users (e.g. banks), sometimes to protect the service from abuse. But often the reason is to ensure value can be extracted from users (e.g. serving ad impressions) or the power that can be exerted over users. Regardless, I believe this comes down to power: computer scientists understand that acting through a computational agent is fundamentally more powerful than acting directly as a human user. Computational agents can operate at scale, they provide virtualization (e.g. throwaway identities), and thereby conserve the ultimate scarce resource: our attention. Many systems seem to have computational power asymmetry as their fundamental principle: as little human contact on the system&#39;s side as possible; as much human contact on the user&#39;s side as possible.If there&#39;s any path ahead that avoids a totalitarian nightmare resulting from asymptotic concentration of power, it depends on cultivating a more widespread understanding of computational power and developing new social norms and policies. As a CS educator, this is one of my top priorities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I manually unfollowed almost every friend and every page I followed a couple years ago. My feed is now a very limited selection of gaming and media posts that I  enjoy immensely. No politics at all and almost nothing in my feed from actual individuals that I know. I ended up enjoying Facebook again, even if in a very different way.It was a tedious process and a tool like this could help a lot of people find their own value in the platform by getting a fresh start. Sadly, FB has no interest in that and would rather corral us in ways as to maximize their own benefit, not ours."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “if they ask about time off in the first interview then they are never going to be there!”The fact that this attitude is common scares me when I&#39;m doing interviews.Time off is incredibly important to me.  What&#39;s the use of making a great income if you can&#39;t get the time off to enjoy it?The culture about the use of PTO varies wildly between companies.  A friend of mine worked somewhere that supposedly gave 20 days PTO per year, but trying to actually use more than a single day at a time was always met with denials, and even if you did take a Friday off, you were expected to work 10 hours/day the other 4 days of that week to make up for it.So yeah, when I&#39;m interviewing, I want to know how much time people are taking off, but I don&#39;t want the interviewer to think I&#39;m lazy and will be trying to avoid work as much as possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The 10x programmer is a silly myth. The idea that someone can produce in 1 day what another competent, hard working, similarly experienced programmer can produce in 2 weeks is silly.You know, 10x is an optimistic number here. Some programmers will do in 1 day what you wont achieve in a life time. And not understanding that makes you a bad programmer by my book simply because this is the foundation of the job.So let me give one advice: you are not producing code, you are engineering code. Some will find solutions that the others will not find. Thats where the 10x programmer thing come from. The guy who wrote bittorrent said something like the following: &#34;I&#39;ve written bittorrent in a way you would never have thought about&#34;.You think John Carmack was the only one trying to make 3d games when Doom came out? Thousands of programmers where trying to. Does that make him a 10x programmer in your opinion? Or more like a 1000x?"</p>

Something I have never associated with a moth before.Secondly, I found it pretty cool to see how their flight wasn&#39;t as controlled as I had thought of. It looked like a bit of a mess on take off. Again, just disarmed me from the moths I&#39;ve grown to despise flying around the house.Very cool to see them from a different perspective."</p>

Bugs are a real weakness for me.I don&#39;t get put off by blood at all. I can handle (and in fact enjoy) gore in movies, horror movies, etc. But man, I don&#39;t know what it is with insects. Their tiny spindly legs, weird beady eyes, the wings, their hair, their antennae. Can&#39;t stand looking at it.Fascinating creatures, but boy do they mess with my mind like nothing else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"LOL !&#34;The chief financial officer is Giancarlo Devasini, a former plastic surgeon from Italy who was once described on Tether’s website as the founder of a successful electronics business.The only reference to him that turned up in a search of Italian newspapers showed he was once fined for selling counterfeit Microsoft software.Elsewhere on the website, there’s a letter from an accounting firm stating that Tether has the reserves to back its coins, along with a pie chart showing that about $30 billion of its dollar holdings are invested in commercial paper—short-term loans to corporations. That would make Tether the seventh-largest holder of such debt, right up there with Charles Schwab and Vanguard Group.To fact-check this claim, a few colleagues and I canvassed Wall Street traders to see if any had seen Tether buying anything. No one had. “It’s a small market with a lot of people who know each other,” said Deborah Cunningham, chief investment officer of global money markets at Federated Hermes, an asset management company in Pittsburgh. “If there
 were a new entrant, it would be usually very obvious.”&#34;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2021-10-07/crypto-my..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand how Tether has survived this long. Bitfinex and Tether sure look transparently like a fraud, all the way back to the &#34;no really we have $1 in the bank for every Tether but you can&#39;t audit us&#34; days. And yet it continues to occupy its role as the underpinning of most cryptocurrency markets. Why hasn&#39;t it blown up yet? My best guess is that it&#39;s useful to everyone taking in money from new retail investors. Also there&#39;s no clear financial incentive for blowing it up; there&#39;s no way to easily short Tether, for instance.This article talks about the way Tether is loaning out what reserves they have. The Economist looked at this phenomenon and found Tether has a 383-to-1 leverage. That&#39;s going to be a complete disaster the moment there&#39;s a major blip in the economy. Say, a major Chinese real estate company going broke. Or interest rates in the West finally going up and causing a market correction. Maybe that&#39;s what will blow it up.The good news is the Economist also thinks the inevitable cryptocurrency disaster will be bad but won&#39;t destroy world economies. &#34; its holders would lose hundreds of billions of dollars but that the fallout would be manageable.&#34; I sure hope that happens before this tower of unregulated investments gets so big that when it falls over it crushes the real economy.But don&#39;t worry folks, this is all good for Bitcoin.https://www.economist.com/leaders/2021/08/07/why-regulators-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I have no idea about .NET development, I don&#39;t really understand the relation between these projects and .NET Foundation.Is .NET foundation paying them money? Or what is the relationship between the projects and Microsoft/.NET Foundation?Reading the &#34;apology&#34; on github, it seems that .NET Foundation/Microsoft thinks those projects are essentially theirs, and they are free to put them under their enterprise account to &#34;simplify billing&#34;https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/Home/discussions/39But reading this article, and the one below, the maintainers think otherwise?https://www.glennwatson.net/posts/dnf-problems-solutionsThere are also some notes about copyright that I don&#39;t understand. Who owns the copyright? Microsoft or the maintainers?edit: From the github &#34;apology&#34;:&gt; Projects might not fully understand what joining the .NET Foundation means. We share a checklist with project maintainers on project changes they accept as part of becoming part of the .NET Foundation. That’s obviously not sufficient. We will post a new document that describes what you can expect when your project joins the .NET Foundation. This will include changes (observable or legal) and new benefits. It will also include changes that could occur later.....ok? That seems scary, coming from Microsoft"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone here old enough to remember when SourceForge was The Place(tm) to stick OSS code and then how it fell from grace?I’m curious in what ways the MicroSoft take over of GitHub is and is not starting to feel like that.For me, one is just the difference in scale. GitHub is vast in both content as well as tooling compared to SourceForge at it’s highest points. And a commercial entity orders of magnitude smaller than MicroSoft took over SF. The rate of descent into Not Good(tm) territory also seems slower and more ponderous.But while the magnitudes differ, the vectors look similar. Not exactly the same, because history rhymes with itself before it repeats itself.Curious what other similarities and dissimilarities other old timers see."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">" Whenever I read news like this I can never figure out what moving a company&#39;s headquarters actually means. Musk has already been living in Texas for a while. Tesla already has sizable operations there (both offices and factories). The company is registered in Delaware, so legally this change means nothing. They aren&#39;t going to fire employees in California or force them to move (in fact Musk said that they will continue to expand their Bay Area staff). They will continue to pay (or not pay) taxes exactly the same as before.

Some experts would say “no,” others would say “yes,” and they’re both right it depends.https://copyrightalliance.org/education/qa-headlines/copyrig...In the US, such protections are still only at the &#34;being considered&#34; stage as best I can tell:The major amendment, of course, would be the extension of design protection to fashion designs, by amending § 1301(a) to provide that “A fashion design is subject to protection under this chapter” and by amending § 1302(b) to include “an article of apparel” in the definition of “useful articles” subject to protection.https://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat072706.htmlAs the Copyright office&#39;s discussion notes, there are non-expressive protections in the specific case of ship hull designs (also in chip masks).  But fashion itself has remained largely a copyright-free zone.The proposed language did not enter into US law as evideced at Cornell&#39;s USC server:https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/1301Cloudflare has secured this round without challenging the copyrightability of the alleged infinged works themselves, but probably also has that arrow in their quivver should they need to invoke it.   The court&#39;s decision here is actually a broader protection for Cloudflare (it would apply against any infringement claim), though it doesn&#39;t invalidate the plaintiff&#39;s IMO questionable fashion-based copyright claims."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The judgment talks about Cloudflare&#39;s services in terms of caching, speed, security and so on, but seems to ignore the vital service that Cloudflare provide to shady sites - anonymity.This victory adds to the impression that Cloudflare is a safe front to present content that would be taken down if hosted directly.We understand that a &#34;Front organization&#34; for criminal activity isn&#39;t something to tolerate in bricks &amp; mortar businesses - why is it allowed on the internet?So while I don&#39;t particularly care for the wrongs of copyright takedowns, Cloudflare (or other US-based edge networks) surely shouldn&#39;t become a bulletproof legal shield for any person or company who can hide their origin?(and Cloudflare still extend their services to the booter sites from whose illegal activities they&#39;ve sold protection from!  But that&#39;s not important right now...)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personally I find Backblaze B2 more compelling.... Ok, after writing that, I realized that I should probably look up R2&#39;s offering first. And then my jaw hit the floor at &#34;free egress bandwidth&#34;.Free egress bandwidth? Yes please.I will instantly convert.Then I was worried about price per GB. $0.015/GB is incredibly competitive.Good lord, where do I get early access to this thing? I&#39;d transition all our infra today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO, the best feature Cloudflare added to R2 was the automatic migration. This makes sense for a CDN to offer, but if R2 works, this makes it pretty simple to migrate.&#34;After specifying an existing storage bucket, R2 will serve requests for objects from the existing bucket,&#34;I&#39;ve Beene evaluating R2, but this migration path makes it dead simple to use. I just point my code to read/write from/to R2 instead of S3, and I&#39;ll get egress fees from AWS during the migration, but then that&#39;s it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article touches on the one major unanswered question I have about R2:  CloudFlare&#39;s CDN ToS make it clear CF is meant to host websites and APIs, not content downloads [1].  Does R2 have similar ToS?  It&#39;s reasonable that CF doesn&#39;t want R2 customers that use 500MB of paid storage and 500TB of free bandwidth, so what is acceptable use?[1] The Services are offered primarily as a platform to cache and serve web pages and websites. Unless explicitly included as part of a Paid Service purchased by you, you agree to use the Services solely for the purpose of (i) serving web pages as viewed through a web browser or other functionally equivalent applications, including rendering Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) or other functional equivalents, and (ii) serving web APIs subject to the restrictions set forth in this Section 2.8. Use of the Services for serving video or a disproportionate percentage of pictures, audio files, or other non-HTML content is prohibited, unless purchased separately as part of a Paid Service or expressly allowed under our Supplemental Terms for a specific Service."</p>
