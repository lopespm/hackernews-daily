To arrive at this architecture takes 100s if not 100s of hours, and to share it with the community is dang inspiring.I was feeling a bit down on my projects, but this has me amped up seeing how the ultimate goal of working on features rather than deployment is possible, and very real!Best of luck with Panelbear!"</p>

It is cheaper for them to not give a fuck, than to give one. Unless they are fined upwards of $20-50bn it’ll never stop because it’s always going to benefit their bottom line. Full stop.If you don’t take 10-15% from a company they won’t ever be incentivized to stop. This 5% or less bullshit has to stop if folks want change.Edit: small grammar fix."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For years companies have been steadily asking, mandating or even trickling users to give them their phone numbers under the excuse of security (while the real reasons were different), now what?How can they be trusted anymore?This also strikes a great point about the data sharing between Facebook and WhatsApp. Linking data between services augments the dangers and the consequences are not obvious to the end user.I think Facebook should offer their users the option to remove their phone numbers with a real deletion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I went in thinking &#34;meh, let&#39;s check&#34; and was surprised and quite amused about the &#34;wholesomeness&#34; of what could have been a very strange encounter.He seemed respectful and she seemed unbothered by the whole ordeal. Interesting, not my cup of tea, but definitely interesting.Something else that caught my attention was how early he believes his interest for feet developed, as early as six and nine years of age. I wonder how this slightly amusing predilection grows and develops over time, as to even gain sexual connotation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; So why not just look at feet on Instagram, or screenshot them for yourself? What do you get out of posting them to another website?This question has always been weird to me, but apparently there are people who don’t experience “this thing is good, i wish to contribute” or “this has brought me joy, i wish to give something back”. I mean, thankfully there are still enough others that we can have Wikipedia, where you also don’t get anything in return. Not even “clout”. Sometimes someone will send you a thank you and that’ll make your day. Open Source is another obvious one, but it extends to the real world, too. Some people will plant flowers in public places or do yarnbombing or pick up trash in the neighborhood or whatever. Why do it? What do you get out of it? I mean, I don’t want to be harsh saying “what a dumb question”, but it just kind of makes me uncomfortable how it challenges something that should be celebrated.The next question about it being invasive is good and valid, but this one on its own just sounds like “why not content yourself with passively consuming”. I’m glad he called himself “generous” because it’s true."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; CPUs have somewhat plateaued in their single core performance in the past decadeIn fact for many cases single core performance has dropped at a given relative price-point. Look at renting inexpensive (not bleeding edge) bare-metal servers: the brand new boxes often have a little less single-core performance than units a few years old, but have two, three, or four times the number of cores at a similar inflation/other adjusted cost.For most server workloads, at least where there is more than near-zero concurrency, adding more cores is far more effective than trying to make a single core go faster (up to a point - there are diminishing returns when shoving more and more cores into one machine, even for embarrassingly parallel workloads, due to other bottlenecks, unless using specialist kit for your task).It can be more power efficient too despite all the extra silicon - one of the reasons for the slight drop (rather than a plateau) in single core oomph is that a small drop in core speed (or a reduction in the complexity via pipeline depth and other features) can create a significant reduction in power consumption. Once you take into account modern CPUs being able to properly idle unused cores (so they aren&#39;t consuming more than a trickle of energy unless actively doing something) it becomes a bit of a no-brainer in many data-centre environments. There are exceptions to every rule of course - the power dynamic flips if you are running every core at full capacity most or all of the time (i.e. crypto mining)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&#34;Closing File Handles on WindowsMany years ago I was profiling Mercurial to help improve the working directory checkout speed on Windows, as users were observing that checkout times on Windows were much slower than on Linux, even on the same machine.I thought I could chalk this up to NTFS versus Linux filesystems or general kernel/OS level efficiency differences. What I actually learned was much more surprising.When I started profiling Mercurial on Windows, I observed that most I/O APIs were completing in a few dozen microseconds, maybe a single millisecond or two ever now and then. Windows/NTFS performance seemed great!Except for CloseHandle(). These calls were often taking 1-10+ milliseconds to complete. It seemed odd to me that file writes - even sustained file writes that were sufficient to blow past any write buffering capacity - were fast but closes slow. It was even more perplexing that CloseHandle() was slow even if you were using completion ports (i.e. async I/O). This behavior for completion ports was counter to what the MSDN documentation said should happen (the function should return immediately and its status can be retrieved later).While I didn&#39;t realize it at the time, the cause for this was/is Windows Defender. Windows Defender (and other anti-virus / scanning software) typically work on Windows by installing what&#39;s called a filesystem filter driver. This is a kernel driver that essentially hooks itself into the kernel and receives callbacks on I/O and filesystem events. It turns out the close file callback triggers scanning of written data. And this scanning appears to occur synchronously, blocking CloseHandle() from returning. This adds milliseconds of overhead.&#34;PDS: Observation: In an OS, if I/O (or more generally, API calls) are initially written to run and return quickly -- this doesn&#39;t mean that they won&#39;t degrade (for whatever reason), as the OS expands and/or underlying hardware changes, over time...For any OS writer, present or future, a key aspect of OS development is writing I/O (and API) performance tests, running them regularly, and immediately halting development to understand/fix the root cause -- if and when performance anomalies are detected... in large software systems, in large codebases, it&#39;s usually much harder to gain back performance several versions after performance has been lost (i.e., Browsers), than to be disciplined, constantly test performance, and halt development (and understand/fix the root cause) the instant any performance anomaly is detected..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Historically, the Windows Command Prompt and the built-in Terminal.app on macOS were very slow at handling tons of output.A very old trick I remember on Windows, is to minimize command prompts if a lot of output was expected and would otherwise slow down the process. I don&#39;t know if it turned write operations into a no-op, or bypassed some slow GDI functions, but it had an extremely noticeable difference in performance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was a teenager, my music teacher always had a copy of the Real Book around. I went to a local music store and was looking through their music books when one of the employees asked, &#39;is there something I can help you find?&#39; When I said the Real Book, he said, &#39;oh, we don&#39;t keep that out here&#39;... he disappeared for a minute and came back with a copy from the back room. At the time, I felt like I had been admitted into a secret club."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a bassist. I got my Real Book in 1982. I was already playing in the high school jazz band, but as a suburban kid, I had zero exposure to things like jam sessions and live jazz performances. Nobody had taught me how to learn harmonies from recordings, so I was kind of lost. The Real Book gave me a way to follow recorded tunes and grasp what the players were doing. Later on, being able to play from &#34;lead sheets&#34; enabled me to play with musicians who were a lot better than me, and was really how I learned to play.But eventually, I was hauling a ton of fake books to every gig. About 20 years ago, I was running late, and decided to leave my fake books behind. And I survived. I had memorized most of the tunes that were played regularly in my locale, and forced myself to learn the rest by ear, on the bandstand.So I tell people that the two best things I&#39;ve done for my jazz playing were: Getting a Real Book, and getting rid of my Real Book. Today, those tunes are hopelessly overplayed, and I prefer finding bands to play with, who are willing to venture off the beaten path, with less familiar tunes or especially original material."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was learning to play the saxophone my instructor had an old copy of the Real Book. The transcriptions of songs by some of the jazz legends  would blow my mind. I thought the people being able to transcribe those were geniuses (still do). They had no sophisticated software to help them. It was all done manually by listening to countless hours of recordings over and over again. All those chord changes, harmonies, the extra fast tempo...That also reminds me of Phil Schapp. He used to run (probably still does) a radio program at Columbia University. Most astonishing encyclopedic knowledge of jazz!! Have a listen sometime. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_SchaapEdit: Added Wikipedia link."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I understand the arguments that &#34;QI has reasonable goals in theory&#34;, but it is time to throw the baby out with the bathwater. If cops didn&#39;t want to lose QI, they should have held themselves to account for the last few decades. Maybe the unions should have spoken up when cops steal tens of thousands of dollars in cash from a suspect, and get away with it due to QI.San Antonio, TX will be voting in May on whether to disband the police union. &#34;Back the Blue&#34; types are saying it&#39;s Defund in disguise, that we won&#39;t be able to find good cops, and so on.Except several large cities in Texas don&#39;t have unionized police, and they do alright. Furthermore, the cops in San Antonio can commit really awful crimes, and still have months- or years-long appeals.Being a cop isn&#39;t a right, it is a privilege and a critical duty. It should be easy to fire bad cops. SAPD, if you didn&#39;t want your union to be busted, maybe you should have  held yourselves to a higher standard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The purpose of qualified immunity is to permit officials to carry out their discretionary duties without fear of personal liability or harassing litigation.It applies to all parts of government. Didn&#39;t get the building permit for your kids horse barn? Sue the planning commission members individually. Animal control writes you a citation for Puddles not being on a leash? Unleash the lawyers. Health department gave your wine bar a bad rating? Sue the inspector personally.The way to fix policing isn&#39;t by making the rest of government worse. Reform unions for employees of the people. Create independent civilian oversight boards with the teeth to suspend and terminate. Invest more in mental health and drug rehabilitation services. Invest in educational resources to teach communities how to deal with law enforcement.Edit to add: People are confusing civil liability with criminal liability. If you are found guilty of a crime, then you can be sued."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since it&#39;s a USA-specific term and not very self-explanatory (I thought this was a COVID-related thing because it contains &#39;immunity&#39;, but it&#39;s not):&gt; In the United States, qualified immunity is a legal principle that grants government officials performing discretionary functions immunity from civil suits unless the plaintiff shows that the official violated &#34;clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known&#34;.-- Wikipedia"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had to type in this box more times than I&#39;m willing to admit to produce something that didn&#39;t violate the guidelines.Let&#39;s examine why this is problematic:- This will absolutely be leveraged on anyone in a precarious position. It&#39;s their ultimate out. Minority groups, majority groups, it doesn&#39;t matter - you&#39;re in trouble and need a platform to tell your story? Not happening on Twitch. Expect more to sign on to this idea; it is the ultimate tool for cancel culture proponents.- Foreword: I am not making a constitutional argument. Private companies now own most of the highways we use for speech, much less widespread speech. Sure, Newspapers and mail can be argued, but there&#39;s plenty of examples where they had to tolerate nasty messages for some self-imposed access to speech principles. Secondarily, nobody used a newspaper to talk to their auntie, while Twitch isn&#39;t Facebook or Twitter self-expression is not limited to certain platforms. That is lost on tech companies.This new stage of American moralism is pretty tiring no matter what group or direction it comes from.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s strange to see a company that once prided itself on active engagement with its users to find product-market fit antagonize its content creators so much. And as a user, it gives me the perception that the platform is just plainly unfair. (Plus the platform is unusable without Adblock).Top streamers have been banned or lost partnerships for playing their own music[0], stating controversial political opinions[1][2], getting trolled by users who &#34;snipe&#34; streamers and shout vulgarities, or just accidentally showing movie clips with nudity [3]. From what I gather, the ban appeal process is byzantine and is heavily biased towards inaction. Oftentimes appeals are never even considered, or partnership staff plainly doesn&#39;t respond.The upsetting part is Twitch is such a great platform technology wise, and its competitors can&#39;t seem to recreate the same magic. I guess we&#39;re stuck with lousy moderation until the streaming fad dies down.[0] https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/twitch-reportedly-suspen...[1] https://dotesports.com/streaming/news/hasanabi-banned-from-t...[2] https://win.gg/news/5496/destiny-loses-twitch-partnership-fo...[3] https://www.ginx.tv/en/twitch/vinesauce-banned-on-twitch-ove..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After reddit started banning people for upvoting the wrong things, this is a logical next step. Contrary to the popular belief, slippery slope isn&#39;t a logical fallacy.Anonymity is the only way to combat this. Make sure your online identity isn&#39;t connected to your real name. Ideally, you should have separate identities for each website. Using Tor or a VPN is also a good idea."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny comments, but jokes aside, I think we&#39;re missing a very obvious reason why he has signal. Mark most likely has contacts that are super high up in governments and coorporations who use signal since they can&#39;t trust any other app. People who say that he just tested out competition, I think you guys underestimate his technological knowledge and his resources waaay too much. If he wanted to do that he could have easily ordered someone to get him a clean phone with a sim card not linked to his name and let that device sit on his desk for testing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it really surprising that he would have all of the most popular messaging apps? Facebook’s playbook of copying popular features from apps gaining traction is by no means a secret.I’m not totally convinced by the narrative that Mark doesn’t trust his own tools so he prefers Signal."</p>
