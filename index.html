								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The concern trolling and gatekeeping about social justice issues coming from the so-called &#34;ethicists&#34; in the AI peanut gallery has been utterly ridiculous. Google claims they don&#39;t want to release Imagen because it lacks what can only be called &#34;latent space affirmative action&#34;.Stability or someone like it will valiantly release this technology, again and there will be absolutely no harm to anyone.Stop being so totally silly Google, OpenAI, et. al. - it&#39;s especially disingenuous because the real reason you don&#39;t want to release these things is that you can&#39;t be bothered to share and would rather keep/monetize the IP. Which is ok -- but at least be honest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s next?
Dreamfusion Video = Imagen Video (this) + Dreamfusion (https://dreamfusion3d.github.io/)Fundamentally, I think we have all the pieces based on this work and Dreamfusion to make it work. From the looks of it, there&#39;s a lot of SSR (spatial SR) and TSR (temporal SR) going on at multiple levels to upsample (spatially) and smoothen (temporally) images that won&#39;t be needed for NERFs.What&#39;s impressive is the ability to leverage billion-scale image-text pairs for training a base model that can be used to super-resolve over space and time. And that they&#39;re not wastefully training video models from scratch, and instead separately training TSR, SSR models for turning the diffused images to video."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting that these models can generate seemingly anything, but the prompt is taken only as a vague suggestion.From the first 15 examples shown to me, only one contained all elements of the prompt, and it was one of the simplest (&#34;an astronaut riding a horse&#34;, versus e.g. &#34;a glass ball falling in water&#34; where it&#39;s clear it was a water droplet falling and not a glass ball).We&#39;re seeing leaps in random capabilities (motion! 3D! inpainting! voice editing!), so I wonder if complete prompt accuracy is 3 months or 3 years away. But I wouldn&#39;t bet on any longer than that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was some grim stuff happening in the Chancery case: multiple bits of evidence suggesting that Peiter Zatko had in fact been in touch with Musk&#39;s team, in advance of the &#34;whistleblowing&#34; release. The Chancery court had just come in with an order giving Twitter extended discovery rights to look for those communications.If it did turn out that Zatko had been talking to Musk&#39;s team, that would be a very big deal, not only undercutting a big part of Musk&#39;s current case (which he was set to lose anyways) but also falsifying several statements made both to the Delaware court and also to Congress(?!).I wonder also if the appearance, performative as it is, that Musk is choosing to buy Twitter rather than being forced to buy Twitter is helpful for financing. He&#39;s more or less obligated to purchase Twitter, but there&#39;s no rule preventing him from offsetting the expense with a syndicate of co-investors; that syndicate might be easier to put together if he can shift the narrative."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He got slammed in discovery, lost a lot of his pre-trial motions, and started losing a ton of his net worth by appearing like a buffoon.  He was about to go into an emergency conference at the Delaware Chancery court, and I assume that he was being told &#34;you are going to lose&#34; by his lawyers if not the Chancellor herself.There was some indication that Mudge may have been in contact with him.  He lost a lot of discovery motions about bots.  His own experts told him that he had no case about Twitter bots.  This case has been a loser from the beginning, and I think he thought he could get a better price by doing this.  He likely didn&#39;t want anything else to come out.The Twitter board did a great job not bowing to the pressure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man, I’m usually not one for drama, but I really want this deal to go through.
I don’t use twitter and as such don’t really care if it implodes, but from what I’ve heard twitter has been a cesspool of negativity for a while now and on a slow but steady downtrend in general.I’m sure Musk will try anything to recoup his investment, so it’ll either go out with a bang, or he somehow manages to pull a rabbit out of his hat and actually turn twitter around. Though I don’t think that’s very likely.Either way it’ll be a fun pastime to follow the unfolding of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This report provides a detailed background of Hans&#39; potential cheating, and detailed breakdowns of certain aspects of chess.com&#39;s cheat-detection methodology, including previously unknown (or little known) methods such as window focus change event monitoring and post-focus-change move analysis.[1]The report also reveals Niemann&#39;s engine move correlations alongside over two dozen chess Grandmasters who have admitted to cheating on chess.com.  The fact that online cheating is so widespread even among top chess players is certainly news to many, including me.  Perhaps it is a good thing that this scandal is highlighting the issue, and given how widespread cheating may be, perhaps chess tournaments both online and physical need to take cheating much more seriously than they apparently have been.There is also an interesting analysis of Hans&#39; rating improvement history, his over the board tournament performance and key game analysis, and a rundown of key moments in his game against Carlsen in the Sinquefield cup. Each raises concerns.Chess.com&#39;s report also makes it clear that Niemann lied outright about his history of cheating in post-Sinquefield interviews, as he admits in communications with chess.com Fairplay staff to much broader cheating.All in all, the report raises many concerns and it seems reasonable for the chess community to demand much higher standards of cheat prevention and detection across competitive venues.  How long might cheating issues have gone on merely rumored vs fully investigated or acted upon, had this intrigue not developed due to Carlsen&#39;s withdrawal from Sinquefield &#39;22?[1]Tangentially, this induces an obvious concern about cheat and cheat-detection arms races.  A clever cheater might scrutinize this report and refine their cheating plan.  For example, they might recognize the need to use a second device (such as a phone) to cheat.  They might use the data corpus presented in this report to establish limits on how often they use chess engine moves per game, and they might manage their ratings progress over time carefully, so as to stay in acceptable ranges of engine move correlation, rate of improvement, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The conventional wisdom is that if you are not a GM by age 14, it is unlikely that you can reach the top levels of chess.&gt; While that statement may seem discouraging, it has been borne out in modern chess.&gt; Greats like Fischer, Kasparov, Carlsen, and almost all of the modern GMs who have been established as top five players, were notable GMs by age 15 at the latestWow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So page 9 from the last paragraph is interesting.  Chess.com basically indicate that apart from Hans, a number of highly rated players (including higher than Hans) have been caught and admitted to cheating.I haven&#39;t gone over the report thoroughly, but it&#39;s clearly focused on Hans&#39;s conduct and not so much on the state of play regarding online cheating, which is, even by Magnus&#39;s statement, the chief focus of all of this.As an outsider to the chess world, this revelation of rampant online cheating is the main story.First, not surprising, right?  Using a computer engine is part of learning and preparing in chess (AFAICT).  What other sport has a similar issue where an extremely useful and essential and highly available tool in the sport is considered cheating based entirely on using it within the narrow window of a game?  Of course it was going to leak into play in online games where you only have the data feed of moves and nothing else connecting the players.Second, that it&#39;s common amongst the elite of the sport is huge.  Either online chess is somewhat dead on arrival as a sport and was never taken seriously by many players (which makes sense to me given how integrated computer engines are in the sport) ... or the chess world needs to go through some sort of cultural revolution here.Third, chess.com have a conflict of interest in this meta-discussion, I presume, as they have commercial interests in the survival of online chess.Fourth, the OTB cheating question still seems open and it seems plausible to me that a good chess player would cheat online for followers and income and entrance to tournaments and then use OTB as the real testing ground.  My bias here is that I suspect cheating in OTB is just crazy by comparison as you&#39;d have to carry some sort of device that would stand as hard evidence of cheating while in online play the proof is always circumstantial and so easier for a cheater to convince themselves they won&#39;t get caught.  Which gets back to my second and third points about how online chess maybe doesn&#39;t make much sense and chess.com aren&#39;t quite seeing the forest for the trees on this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The big claim turns out to be a little overstated. The claim:&gt; AlphaTensor’s algorithm improves on Strassen’s two-level algorithm for the first time, to our knowledge, since its discovery 50 years ago.reduces to:&gt; AlphaTensor discovers algorithms that outperform the Strassen-square algorithm, which is a fast algorithm for large square matrices31,32. Although the discovered algorithm has the same theoretical complexity as Strassen-square, it outperforms it in practice, as it is optimized for the considered hardware. Interestingly, AlphaTensor finds algorithms with a larger number of additions compared with Strassen-square (or equivalently, denser decompositions), but the discovered algorithms generate individual operations that can be efficiently fused by the specific XLA33 grouping procedure and thus are more tailored towards the compiler stack we use. The algorithms found by AlphaTensor also provide gains on matrix sizes larger than what they were optimized for. Finally, Fig. 5c shows the importance of tailoring to particular hardware, as algorithms optimized for one hardware do not perform as well on other hardware.So they improved on Strassen’s 50-year-old algorithm by optimizing it for hardware that has only existed for a few years and de-optimizing it for human use? There is so much cool stuff here without claiming to do something you really didn’t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The paper is a great read -- an interesting approach, fun theoretical comparisons, plus benchmarks for optimized algorithms for specific hardware (CPU and GPU, allowing for differing instruction sets).But it doesn&#39;t stop there; from the &#34;Discussion&#34; section:&gt; One important strength of AlphaTensor is its flexibility to support complex stochastic and non-differentiable rewards (from the tensor rank to practical efficiency on specific hardware), in addition to finding algorithms for custom operations in a wide variety of spaces (such as finite fields). We believe this will spur applications of AlphaTensor towards designing algorithms that optimize metrics that we did not consider here, such as numerical stability or energy usage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a gut feeling that there is a faster way to compute logarithms going from least to most significant bit. How would I go about using ML to find it?[Edit] I think Feynman&#39;s algorithm might do it:&#34;Consider the problem of finding the logarithm of a
fractional number between 1 and 2. (The algorithm can be
generalized without too much difficulty.) Feynman observed
that any such number can be uniquely represented
as a product of numbers of the form 1 + 2^(-k), where k is an
integer. Testing for the presence of each of these factors in
a binary representation is simply a matter of a shift and a
subtraction. Once the factors are determined, the logarithm
can be computed by adding together the precomputed
logarithms of the factors. The algorithm fit the
Connection Machine especially well because the small
table of the logarithms of 1 + 2^(-k) could be shared by all
the processors. The entire computation took less time
than doing a division.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank god, at least some sort of enforcement.At least 90% of phone calls I get are robocalls or spam. But, as the head of a large household, I can&#39;t disable unknown callers; who knows if that urgent care I took my kid to 6 months ago needs to call because I put my email address in wrong and they couldn&#39;t bill me, and I don&#39;t want the account to go to collections. Or maybe some random clerk from the city needs to contact me about property taxes?I just do not have a definitive contact list of every number that might call me with critical information, and I&#39;m not confident they would leave a voicemail. Or even if they leave a voicemail, it&#39;s often impossible to return a call because the caller is originating from some complex web of VOIP systems and when I call back I get a machine asking for an extension, which the caller forgot to leave in the voicemail!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just throwing this out there, that when I get spam calls, I answer it and tell them im answering it to waste their time.I am not getting a lot of spam calls compared to past years.Texts however."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those as confused as I was by the title. FCC will remove providers from the &#34;Robocall Mitigation Database.&#34; This is a database of providers who are certified as complying with robocall mitigation requirements. Failing to demonstrate compliance results in removal from the DB, which in turn, results in your calls no longer being routed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“Bingo!!” said the teacher. “It’s the same thing with calculus. You’re not here because you’re going to use calculus in your everyday life. You’re here because calculus is weightlifting for your brain.”Total BS...There are better ways to exercise your brain that will be many more times better than Calculus. This is HW so one that comes to mind is programming. But there are so many more. Here are a few, understanding and fixing a car, understanding music and playing music, art appreciation, literature and understanding the human condition and on and on. Recent research has shown that doing daily exercise is a great way to keep a healthy body and brain, rather than sitting on your butt learning a useless subject.Yes, there are professions where Calculus is needed and there are people that truly enjoy math. Cool, take all the math you need and want to learn. You should take it.Anyone that tells you that Calculus is a good way to exercise your brain is just trying to justify their job. Don&#39;t for a minute believe that it&#39;s the best way to use a limited resource like your time.Source: Me, it took me 3 semesters of Calculus to figure out that it was useless to me and 90+% of the people that take any of it.P.S. note: Many people disagree. Good, you should not take it as absolute truth. I guess my real point is that you should question whether you really need to take Calculus. Don&#39;t just take it blindly because you are told you should. You have other options."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have had to answer this question to my kids (one of whom abhors math). The explanation I gave is this:For many subjects, most kids will end up never using them. But, we have no way to predict which subjects will be useful for which kids. Without the ability to do that, our priority is maximize each child&#39;s opportunity. We never want a kid to be in the situation where they would have been interested in a subject and a career path but never ended up discovering that and using it because we didn&#39;t expose it to them.So we teach some of every subject to every kid. That way no matter which path they end up following, they are as prepared for it as we can make them.(Also, yes, I agree that math is good general training for cognitive rigor. Also, numeric literacy is vital for all adults since we live in an ecomonic world and participate in a democracy where statistics are necessary to understand policies.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a number of angles to this.Want a fancy job? This is one of the hoops to jump through. Same as leetcode further down the line, you won&#39;t do it at work but you will do it to get work. But that&#39;s also a pretty tragic take on it.Practice for other things, sure, that is also a way to see it. You won&#39;t bench press the other team but you will make yourself stronger. But for what? A sport you&#39;ll never play? What are you preparing for?Here&#39;s another one. Math, especially pure math, is a thing that is totally separate from observation. It just sort of exists without being anywhere, and yet there&#39;s all this depth to it. You can get a puzzle that cannot be solved by any anything other than thoughts, and you can keep building on these puzzles that don&#39;t exist. Go nowhere and explore.Lastly I note that it&#39;s mostly math class that gets asked this &#34;what&#39;s the point&#34; question. But you may as well as this about everything else you do in school, and you will mostly find that you&#39;ll have spent years to learn French for 4 weeks of actual use in France, dissected frogs for no reason, and learned how to play the recorder. All things that I&#39;m sure you can find positives for despite the superficial benefits being quite small."</p>

Then, I had some health issue and could no longer keep doing that to my body, so I went back to school and got a CS degree.I sometimes get depressed and miss physical work, but then I remember how shit it was and how an injury would prevent me from working. As a dev I think I&#39;m going to be able to earn money as long as I&#39;m alive and have a functioning brain.I guess once you have enough money then maybe someone might find that work fun? Obviously it helped the writer with depression. However, if he ever gets permanently hurt and it affects his daily life I have a feeling depression will come back in full swing. Office work is much much safer.There are ways to help people through tech and have much bigger affect then moving boxes for a shitty company.Edit: What helps my depression is connecting with people outside of work, helping people in my community, doing projects around my house and spending time with my son. Additionally, I try to make good choices when spending my money and limit my spending on stuff I don&#39;t need, as I dislike excessive spending.Edit2: Some great comments below. This is very much poverty/shit job tourism, which the writer can escape at any moment. This is some BlackMirror type of content. Guy makes it big in tech, retires, now works shit job people are trying to escape to cure his depression. He then writes about it on a blog. Now, other non-aware devs might be reading it contemplating leaving their jobs to do a REAL job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read the article, and... I get it.  But something about this just seems weird to me.  I grew up mostly on a family farm, worked every day of my life in some capacity since I was 9 or 10 years old, and did shit jobs to pay for college (which I eventually dropped out of right before graduation).  I don&#39;t think my route into tech is that different from many of the other folks I&#39;ve worked with... this guy lived a /very/ charmed and privileged existence compared to the average American tech worker, and going to work at an Amazon warehouse to get a reality check seems... patronizing somehow.  I am glad he got a reality check, but I feel like there&#39;s another way to do this, or at least how to write about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I had what I would stereotype as a traditional Chinese upbringing in America, which meant my parents very much expected straight A&#39;s. Anytime a B happened, something had gone wrong. The explanation was never like you lack the talent or whatever, but that you didn’t work hard enough.It sounds like the author never got a chance to figure out the intersection between what he liked to do and what he was actually good at. Instead, he was trained to respond to the approval of authority figures. So the true north of his internal compass pointed to whatever the person in charge at the time thought of him.Fast forward to 2021:&gt; I think most people who dream of retirement think that it&#39;s going to be awesome. And it was—for about a month.  I skied on weekdays, shopped at Target at 11am with nobody there, and played video games. But after several months of pursuing various hobbies as my whims and interests—all the things which people who aspire to retire young might look upon with envy—I felt unfulfilled. I became unmoored, set adrift in a sea of theoretical possibility only to drown in unbounded optionality. Novelty and excitement turned into a spiraling vortex of depression as I began to wake up sometimes at noon, sometimes 2pm, and on the rare occasion even getting out of bed at 6pm.With no authority figure to send the positive vibes he craved, the author felt adrift. This is where the gig at Amazon comes in. Authority figures galore and a clear sense of what a job well done meant.Some are chalking this up to poverty tourism. Maybe it&#39;s something else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I learnt C, more than 20 years ago, from the book The C Programming Language written by Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, also known as K&amp;R. I read the book almost cover to cover all the way from the preface at the beginning to its three appendices at the end while solving all the exercises that each chapter presented. As someone who knew very little about programming languages back then, this book was formative in my journey of becoming a programmer.Appendix A (Reference Manual) of the book broadened my outlook on programming languages by providing me a glimpse of what goes into formally specifying a programming language. Section A.12 (Preprocessing) of this appendix specifies trigraph sequences. Quoting from the section:&gt; Preprocessing itself takes place in several logically successive phases that may, in a particular implementation, be condensed.&gt; 1. First, trigraph sequences as described in Par.A.12.1 are replaced by their equivalents. Should the operating system environment require it, newline characters are introduced between the lines of the source file.Then section A.12.1 (Trigraph Sequences) further elaborates trigraph sequences in more detail. Quoting this section below:&gt; The character set of C source programs is contained within seven-bit ASCII, but is a superset of the ISO 646-1983 Invariant Code Set. In order to enable programs to be represented in the reduced set, all occurrences of the following trigraph sequences are replaced by the corresponding single character. This replacement occurs before any other processing.  ??=  #
  ??/  \
  ??&#39;  ^
  ??(  [
  ??)  ]
  ??!  |
  ??&lt;  {
  ??&gt;  }
  ??-  ~

&gt; No other such replacements occur.&gt; Trigraph sequences are new with the ANSI standard."</p>
