								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ah, we actually have one of these at Caddy: https://caddyserver.com/docs/architecture(The filename on disk is literally &#34;architecture.md&#34; -- it is a Markdown file rendered by Caddy&#39;s template handler: https://github.com/caddyserver/website/blob/master/src/docs/...)It could use some improvement, but it&#39;s been really great for helping people learn how Caddy 2 works at a high level. Beyond our docs, I always encourage new contributors to thoroughly explore the godoc and code: it&#39;s very well-commented and organized, especially once you know how it all comes together. A single document will never be sufficient. But it can help you map between concepts and code.Code search is also invaluable for this; I recommend Sourcegraph: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/caddyserver/caddyEdit: One other valuable piece is explaining why the architecture is the way it is. Our architecture.md doc links to a video that explains how I arrived at Caddy 2&#39;s architecture (and why it&#39;s not arbitrary): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhJO8giOqQs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a similar advice, but I will go one step further: add README.md to other folders as well. It is dope to have a map of your whole system in an Architecture.md (or a README if it&#39;s not too long), but it&#39;s even more dope to be able to click through it and have submaps of how other components are structured.Displaying the folder/file structure and explaining what is what is a must. An example from Diem[1]:  consensus
  ├── src
  │   ├── block_storage          # In-memory storage of blocks and related data structures
  │   ├── consensusdb            # Database interaction to persist consensus data for safety and liveness
  │   ├── liveness               # RoundState, proposer, and other liveness related code
  │   └── test_utils             # Mock implementations that are used for testing only
  └── consensus-types            # Consensus data types (i.e. quorum certificates)
  └── safety-rules               # Safety (voting) rules


I recently digged into dependabot&#39;s code, and I found it extremely well structured. For example you have an Architecture section in the first README[2] with a diagram (how awesome is that!) and with links to the README of all the sub components, which themselves live in the subfolders[3].What I dread the most is going through a new codebase and not seeing any documentation in internal packages. Like how the fuck am I supposed to understand anything in there? By reading all the code?[1]: https://github.com/diem/diem/tree/master/consensus#how-is-th...[2]: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core#architecture[3]: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/blob/main/comm..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love architecture docs, but find they&#39;re often written using a funny process:  1. Spend a long time writing the doc.
  2. Wait for a person to chance upon it.
  3. Hope you anticipated their questions.

It seems like the most important thing a person can do is reverse this:  1. Say who the doc is for.
  2. Find that person. Ask them to try a lil contribution.
  3. Frantically write / revise the doc.

IMO it&#39;s a lot like creating a presentation. The earlier the feedback the better!"</p>

Some works for comparison would be; Land of Lisp, Realm of Racket, Clojure for the Brave and True, Learn you a Haskell for Great Good!, Learn you some Erlang for Great Good!, and Why&#39;s (Poignant) Guide to Ruby. There may be more I am not aware of. On the topic of cats programming there is also JavaScript for Cats, which is great too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like spyder a lot for the variable explorer, which makes it feel more like Matlab.  However the constant bothering about installing Kite got annoying. Unfortunately there isn&#39;t a way to use Kite and have it not constantly annoy you about upgrading to the enterprise edition. If Kite had a no ads plan for like ~ $10  a year it would make a lot more sense to integrate it in spyder."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It often causes a double-take for me when I see projects on HN with the same name as projects I once worked on.Way back in time, maybe around 1998, a friend an I worked on a steganography tool that we called Spyder. I don&#39;t remember where it was published or under what license (probably freeware), but the algorithm was incorporated into Hide4PGP (http://www.heinz-repp.onlinehome.de/Hide4PGP.htm), and we stopped work on it.This post just caused a bit of nostalgia. I can still remember my co-developer taking a break jamming on a bass guitar while we tried to figure out the striping problem (the solution was to compress the data to increase entropy first)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can I get the following behavior from Spyder (last time I tried I couldn&#39;t find a way) - for some keyboard shortcut like Cmd/Ctrl + Enter:- the shortcut sends the selected code to the terminal (this is possible)- if I hit the shortcut when nothing is selected, the line where the cursor currently is gets sent to the terminal and the cursor moves to the next line of code- if the cursor is at the beginning of a block of code like an if-statement or a loop, the whole statement is sent to the terminal and the cursor moves to after the statementRStudio has this behaviour by default, I find it very convenient and I haven&#39;t been able to replicate it in other environments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve seen many possible explanations mentioned. Most common seems to be that raising daughters is more stressful than raising sons (for various reasons) leading to more arguments etc. Most intriguing might be that sons conceived into tenuous marriages don&#39;t even make it out of the womb. I&#39;ll add one more: mother/daughter friction. I can&#39;t even count the number of families I&#39;ve seen in which a mother feels betrayed when her daughter doesn&#39;t follow her example in everything, and lets those feelings show. I&#39;ve seen the same with father/son, though less so perhaps because mothers tend to be more active parents. It would also be foolish to ignore the issue of daughters growing into their adult bodies and becoming sexually active right when many mothers are feeling insecure about their own attractiveness. We can argue about causes, but the effect is real.When mothers and daughters fight, it always puts fathers in a difficult position. A dad who consistently sides the mother might get credit for being a good co-parent (usually not) but be alienated from their own child. A dad who consistently sides with the daughter is likely to lose all contact with either due to divorce. All this, regardless of who&#39;s right or wrong between the two. Again, a bit of this happens when fathers and sons are in conflict, but it doesn&#39;t seem quite as severe and has different potential outcomes because of how &#34;family&#34; court works.That&#39;s just one possible factor, affecting some cases, but it seems worth mentioning along with all the others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; parents of teenage daughters argue more about parenting than do the parents of sonsFrom my own experience. When my daughter hit 12 it was a fucking nightmare. The hormones hit girls hard and they can become incredibly difficult. That said, now she’s 13 things are much easier and look to be getting easier by the week. Although my wife and I both have to be very understanding and on the same team to deal with difficult behaviour — we have a lot of strategy meetings.Lacking empathy, and wanting independence without responsibility are part of being a teenager. But 12-year old girls can sometimes be super charged griefers.On the flip side, teenagers are actually awesome to hang out with and total joys full of creativity and fun — if you work through the refusal to clean their room, general lack of hygiene and the drama."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anecdotal, but I have three sons and four daughters. In my experience boys are harder when they are younger (wild, causing mayhem and physical destruction in their wake, solving problems using fighting, etc.) but in their teenage years prefer to hang out quietly in their rooms. Girls on the other hand tend to be calmer in their younger years, but then in their teenage years become argumentative, moody, causing lots of emotional and psychological strife. It takes until they are in their early 20s for things to calm down. Though by then the damage has already been done. In an ideal world I&#39;d like to raise girls when they are young and boys when they are older."</p>
