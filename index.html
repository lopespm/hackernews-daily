								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is almost exactly my life, shifted by a decade.The problem is that by 35 you can&#39;t get by on novelty anymore because you&#39;ve seen some version of everything there is to see.The worst thing you can do is pine for the good old days. They aren&#39;t coming back. And they weren&#39;t that good anyway. Your best times are ahead if you can successfully adjust.What worked for me was putting down roots. I resisted it mightily at first because I wanted to stay mentally 25 forever. Now I see that getting married and having a couple of kids was the right thing to do. It forced me to become more flexible, more deliberate, more focused and have more stamina to do hard thingsI&#39;m a loner by nature, so I can&#39;t imagine where I&#39;d be if I hadn&#39;t settled down. I just know it wouldn&#39;t be as good.Once you&#39;ve got those roots down, life will lead you to what you should do next. Maybe being a full time parent, maybe learning to sail, maybe more successful entrepreneurship. Who knows...EDIT: I don&#39;t mean to imply that everyone needs a family. What&#39;s important is to start living for others to some degree. Hedonism has famously bad diminishing returns.Some people choose to do lots of volunteering or switch careers to social work. There&#39;s lots of options."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m 58. Everything IS an different iteration of the same thing. Generally, if intelligent adults are involved, there are likely to be some useful new things in the new iteration, small improvements.  On rare occasion, there are massive changes that only become apparent later. (Like when transistors first appeared, they wore out, like tubes, but slower... germanium was replaced by silicon, and lifetimes tended towards infinity, and then integrated circuit appeared)You&#39;re not too old to have a social life... that happens once you&#39;re in a nursing home, and have worn out the good will of the staff. Up until that point, there are always new friendships and relationships to be had.Going out to parties and drinking until morning is a lot harder on you than it was, that&#39;s a normal part of growing up. There are plenty of other things to do that are far more rewarding if you give yourself time to grow into them (and Covid rules don&#39;t prohibit them)If you need a hobby, I suggest machining.  Challenge yourself to make 1000 of some everyday hardware store item, like a 1/4&#34; 10-24 x 2&#34; screw, Flat head.  You&#39;ll learn a lot of interesting history, and grow to appreciate the supply chain, along the way.Note: Outside of the US, maybe some M8 Torx screws instead? You&#39;ll learn about Rotary Broaching, or cold heading, along the way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mourning the loss of one’s youth is pretty typical. You lose a step. You didn’t do what you hoped you would do. You wasted your time. So forth and so on.Don’t worry. It gets better. This is all part of the process of life.My recommendation is that you read Man’s Search for Meaning by Viktor Frankl.“He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.”I’m 52 here. I was a prolific programmer in my 20s. A go-go marketer in my 30s. For the last 10 years, I’ve run a business that I love with two partners who have taken advantage of me at every turn. The last two years neither has worked and yet they get paid.Do I feel lost or depressed? Absolutely not.I love life. I have an amazing family to whom I am utterly devoted. I volunteer for stuff. I do cool things every day. If I feel bored, I make things with my hands or engage in other creative pursuits. I focus on the moment and others more than anything else and all the rest just goes away.How is this possible? I’ve filled my life with reasons to live.In fact, I have so many now that there is no room for worry about what I have and haven’t done. And in doing so, I realize that none of that matters anyway.My mom died at 52 after taking a header down a flight of stairs. My grandfather died at 56 after getting stabbed in the belly by my grandmother (she was psychotic).Our naked existence is laughable. Everything can be lost in an instant.Dive into the why and you can deal with any how."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The output is very polished and fast, I like it a lot.
Unfortunately it&#39;s not technically a single file as it depends on code downloaded from their server, therefore it can&#39;t be deployed locally without Internet connection.From the forum:&#34;In terms of license, you don&#39;t need an internet connection. However, Files app loads it&#39;s own Javascript, CSS and several plugins from CDN (jsdelivr.com), and this requires internet. We already have a request to allow serving all assets locally (as an option), although in your case that might not be practical as this means Files app is essentially no longer a&#34;single file&#34;, but multiple files that you need to be included with each installation (although you could assign a global path perhaps). In any case, for now it&#39;s not possible to load Files app without internet.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So either 1) the lawyers ripped off J&amp;J by spending time on this or 2) J&amp;J management was so angry and irrational that they demanded the lawyers waste their time on this.Every lawyer worth their salt in America knows that you can’t get an injunction to prevent someone from publishing something.

By doing so, J&amp;J could limit its financial exposure to the lawsuits.”[1] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accounting"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fought the battle to keep my SMTP server IP off blacklists, and lost.You can do everything possible, have a perfectly clean IP, have a good amount of outbound email traffic, only send transactional email, etc. Still, there will be edge cases where email does not go through. AT&amp;T email servers would constantly blacklist me and not respond to requests to remove me, gmail/yahoo/outlook would silently put emails in the spam folder, and companies using email firewall products would blacklist me, with an IT Dept too inept to fix it.The solution was to pay a small fee and proxy all outbound email through a transactional SMTP sender, like Postmark or Mailgun. It&#39;s easy to do, with one line of code in Postfix. You can be selective, and only proxy emails sent to certain troublesome domains. If you try an email provider and it&#39;s not working out, it&#39;s one line of code to change to another provider.This allows me to still manage nearly all aspects of hosting my email server and control my email data, while not dealing with deliverability issues. I use Postmark and I have not dealt with a deliverability issue in two years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m dealing with this right now.Both my personal domain and rsync.net are on a distinct subnet, but that subnet is smaller than a /24 and someone on a different subnet has, apparently, behaved badly.Enter &#34;abusix&#34; ...One of my engineers had an enlightening webchat with one of their engineers where we were shown the &#34;offending&#34; IP and it was explained that they have no ability to distinguish subnets (and no interest in doing so).  So if you&#39;re not wasting an entire /24 (we only need ~10 IPs at this location) you&#39;re in danger of this misclassification.We were also informed that our normal, business communications with paying customers should have unsubscribe notices appended to them.  Which is to say, you&#39;re a paying customer of a service and we send you some kind of alert or critical announcement ... and it should have an unsubscribe link.Unbelievable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Spam blocklists are run by an unaccountable cowboy cult that somehow has managed to consolidate a ton of power simply for the fact that most people who run email inbox services didn&#39;t want to deal with the problem of spam, so they were more than willing to just hand over anti-spam &#34;enforcement&#34; to anyone who was allegedly doing &#34;what was best for the internet.&#34; There&#39;s no check on these people who run these blacklists, and the system they&#39;ve built is entirely a black box, antithetical to the principles of the open internet. And if you&#39;re not a huge corporation that can afford professional management of your email deliverability, good luck – the individuals and small organizations are just out of luck. It&#39;s a miserable racket and for what?If you want to know why there&#39;s a new thread each week on HN about why it&#39;s impossible to host your own email service, this is why."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was a lot of work on microbiome and cancer immunotherapy... the latest study in the field published in the most prestigious journal there is [1] seemed to show that fibre intake was more important than any specific microbe. In fact they found that eating more fibre and taking probiotics resulted in worse outcomes than just eating more fibre alone. This was recapitulated in a mouse model:&gt; Together, these data have important implications. We show that dietary fiber and probiotic use, factors known to affect the gut microbiome, are associated with differential outcomes to ICB. Although causality cannot be addressed from the observational human cohort, where unmeasured confounders may exist, our preclinical models support the hypothesis that dietary fiber and probiotics modulate the microbiome and that antitumor immunity is impaired in mice receiving a low-fiber diet and in those receiving probiotics—with suppression of intratumoral IFN-γ T cell responses in both cases.It would be a bit disappointing if the final conclusion from all this microbiome work was &#39;Eat more vegetables&#39;...[1] https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aaz7015"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just another data point, but my journey through digestive issues and recovery was kicked off by the worst depression and burnout I ever experienced, which started in 2019 and lasted 3 years.My best guess for what happened is that work stress, excessive celebration and coping with the cognitive dissonance of the pre-COVID era and subsequent pandemic, combined with overtraining and the misuse of protein shakes in place of food, left me in a chronically dehydrated state. The body tries to collect moisture from the gut, which opens an opportunity for bacteria to get into the body cavity and blood, which is colloquially called leaky gut. This sets off food sensitivities and eventually an autoimmune condition/response to lectins, gluten, etc, which have proteins similar to linings in the body, joints and thyroid. Then a cascade happens where everything goes out of whack quickly. In my case, I went from being in the best shape of my life, the strongest I had ever been in the gym, to barely able to get out of bed in the morning. In other people, it might present as chronic fatigue, arthritis, etc.I didn&#39;t really believe any of this in 2018, and my meal plan then consisted entirely of everything that I can&#39;t eat today. So I consider what people say politely, but for the most part, they have absolutely no idea what they&#39;re talking about. This experience has made stuff like GMO foods sound absolutely insane to me. Like, why would we ever taint our food supply to make food 5 cents cheaper or &#34;feed the world&#34; when we&#39;ve been operating under artificial scarcity since the end of the second world war? It&#39;s all a crock.Every time you eat inflammatory food, the risk is similar to smoking a cigarette. Probably nothing will happen, but if it sets off your immune system, you may wake up one morning chronically depressed and/or unable to eat something that you rely upon. It got me after I turned 40, YMMV."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone been telling me, my depression comes from bacteria, I KNOW! Pain is... if I eat something plant based, depression and suicidal thoughts come back. Takes about 4 days after I ate the offending food, stays for 3 days, then I&#39;m back to normal and energetic.Latest experiment was one teaspoon of fermented green squash daily, seemed to work out okay for 5 days or so, then depression came back, BUT I could smell it in my armpits 1-2 days before the thoughts were back.https://gutsense.org has a lot about fiber - the only fiber I can use seems to be animal based, like eggwhites"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very cool. My daughter has a brain shunt due to complications of spina bifida and so we’re thinking of cerebrospinal fluid on a regular basis. As a layman I guess there’s a particular cerebrospinal fluid pressure you want, and that being too high or too low causes issues? Apparently the shunt just drains into her belly so I also found that interesting. Too high and she’ll have terrible headaches and an “alien” head (sorry, don’t mean offense by that but it’s what I’m trying to avoid for my child) and I don’t know what would happen with too little, maybe someone could tell me. Probably not good I’m assuming.I frequent some FB groups for parents of children with SB and am shocked at how large some people let their kids heads get without consulting with or complaining to a doctor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is curious.  During my research into neutral networks we depended on a neuroscience result that found waves of trophic factor (i.e. the stuff used to build up neurons [i.e. learn]) travel in cascading waves from the core of the brain to the periphery.  By adding a sense of location and a learning term contingent on the factor we saw learning 
(xor) prohibited by Minsky&#39;s result (not really prohibited because we changed the model).The take away was that our models of ANNs benefit from considering more that just neural signaling (i.e. solution contents and fluid dynamics).  Is anyone aware of modern work expanding on that front?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Re falling asleep during MRI - I was a subject in a study where for about an hour you had to lie in a machine and repeatedly indicate which of two pictures depicted a larger object.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know d3 and ggplot2, but Datawrapper is my goto when I want Excel-like convenience for bespoke, detailed viz. It’s completely free for individual use, and I’m happy to see that the charts and maps I made while teaching students about interactive data viz work just as well as they did the 5+ years ago.The variety of built-in shapefiles (international, US counties) — with the ability to upload your own custom shapefiles to quickly create interactive maps — is a killer feature on its own"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lat/Lon is really the standard. The fact that some software internally represents it as Lon/Lat doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;s not a settled issue. If you look up the coordinate of a location - it&#39;s always in Lat/Long. You can&#39;t rewrite all the books and change all the maps to make it nicer for programmersAs the linked post says, Lon/Lat is generally easier to deal with b/c it matches to X/Y (and the North/Up way we look at maps). But you still have annoyances. For instance Lon goes 0-360 but Lat goes -90 to 90. This is also mathematically inconvenientAdd on top of that the X-Y coordinate on images generally have the X flipped and starting at the top left corner. So changing to Lon/Lat doesn&#39;t fix everything.What I personally lean towards now is converting everything on read-in to a South/East coordinate system so it matches the flipped X-Y of images (like GeoTIFFs) and just always working in that system. Image manipulation, drawing to screen, output etc. - those systems/libraries I can&#39;t really modify myself. Everything else I can manipulate in whatever coordinate system I want. So it makes sense to choose the most convenient. Plus only dealing with positive coordinates is a big plus.That all said, I&#39;m a total noob and I have no &#34;geospatial&#34; background (just writing some software to deal with rain data right now) So this isn&#39;t pro advice.  I&#39;d just be curious what others think"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of two days of bug fixing, after our Python mapping tool suddenly returned bogus data, without any change in the code base.Turns out, we did not pin the pyproj library [1] and they introduced a switch from lon-lat to lat-lon order, per default.It was possible to retain the old behavior with `always_xy: bool = False`. I saw hundrets of similar reports, who knows how many users were effected. Conclusions, a) Always pin your dependencies, b) explicit is better than implicit.Besides, I have a personal, subjective preference for lon-lat, but I understood the lat-lng order to be the officially accepted norm.[1]: https://pyproj4.github.io/pyproj/stable/api/proj.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Latitude historically comes first when spoken or written because of the rule of ablaut reduplication, which makes it more natural for the &#39;a&#39; sound to come before the &#39;o&#39; sound when using phrases like this.  For instance, &#39;bish, bash, bosh&#39; sound natural/correct, but &#39;bosh, bash, bish&#39; sounds wrong.I get the order wrong when working with geojson with embarrassing frequency...http://www.macmillandictionaryblog.com/a-hotchpotch-of-redup..."</p>
