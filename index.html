								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so pleased to see this happen in a way where its not tied to Apples own payment processor. They could so easily have done that to capture more revenue but I suspect it would have opened up more chance of an anticompetitive lawsuit.Obviously they are going to vet which processors are allowed, but as a consumer you want that so you can be confident that the iPhone you are tapping your card against isn&#39;t skimming your account.I suspect there is a revenue agreement with the processors allowed on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me about an anecdote about how stock market works I heard when I was young. The story goes like,It was autumn, and the Red Indians on the remote reservation asked their New Chief if the winter was going to be cold or mild. Since he was a Red Indian chief in a modern society, he couldn&#39;t tell what the weather was going to be.Nevertheless, to be on the safe side, he replied to his Tribe that the winter was indeed going to be cold and that the members of the village should collect wood to be prepared.But also being a practical leader, after several days he got an idea.He went to the phone booth, called the National Weather Service and asked &#34;Is the coming winter going to be cold?&#34; &#34;It looks like this winter is going to be quite cold indeed,&#34; the meteorologist at the weather service responded.So the Chief went back to his people and told them to collect even more Wood.A week later, he called the National Weather Service again. &#34;Is it Going to be a very cold winter?&#34; &#34;Yes,&#34; the man at National Weather Service again replied, &#34;It&#39;s definitely going to be a very cold winter. &#34;The Chief again went back to his people and ordered them tocollect every scrap of wood they could find. Two weeks later, he called the National Weather Service again. &#34;Are you absolutely sure that the winter is going to be very cold?&#34;&#34;Absolutely&#34; , the man replied. &#34;It&#39;s going to be one of the coldest winters ever. &#34; &#34;How can you be so sure?&#34; the Chief asked. The weatherman replied, &#34;The Red Indians are collecting wood like Crazy.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story reminded me of a story written by a Czech biologist who studied animals in Papua-New Guinea and went to a hunt with a group of local tribesmen.The dusk was approaching, they were still in the forest and he proposed that they could sleep under a tree. The hunters were adamant in their refusal: no, this is dangerous, a tree might fall on you in your sleep and kill you. He relented, but silently considered them irrational, given that his assessment of a chance of a tree falling on you overnight was less then 1:5000.Only later did he realize that for a lifelong hunter, 1:5000 are pretty bad odds that translate to a very significant probability of getting killed over a 30-40 year long hunting career."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read them as sloppy caricatures that provide little value to the conversation.Let&#39;s take the security guard: &#34;The only problem is: he now provides literally no value. He’s excluded by fiat the possibility of ever being useful in any way. He could be losslessly replaced by a rock with the words “THERE ARE NO ROBBERS” on it.&#34;That is blatantly not true, the guard provide value since the wanna-be robbers don&#39;t know whether the guard will be of any value, and a rock could not provide any deterrent. Losslessly?The doctor (if there is someone skeptical of doctors it is me, if I were less lazy I would have greatly enjoyed fighting to make some useless US dermatologists lose their license): &#34;Her heuristic is right 99.9% of the time, but she provides literally no value. There is no point to her existence. She could be profitably replaced with a rock saying “IT’S NOTHING, TAKE TWO ASPIRIN AND WAIT FOR IT TO GO AWAY”.This is an unhelpful caricature, too, because if we add &#34;and call back if it does not&#34;, it looks like a very reasonable approach.Un-nuanced and quite sloppy presentation of heuristics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It sort of make sense for Nvidia&#39;s shareholders. The initial offering for ARM was only worth $38.5bn, which was already expensive due to SoftBank initial purchase price and not wanting for a loss. But at Nvidia&#39;s peak this deal was worth &#34;$87bn&#34;. For a company that makes less than $2B in revenue and at best ~$300M in Operating Income. Remember this isn&#39;t something you can buy and milk the crap out of other market players. &#34;Not a very British way of doing business&#34; is A Direct Quote from ARM. ( Edit: Because of perceptual licensing agreement, for those unaware of how ARM business model works )It didn&#39;t make sense how ARM was worth $22bn in 2016 on LSE, that has a PE100+ when I cant see how it could double its Net profit in the next 10 years, with a saner valuation of P/E 50. It make even less sense to me when Softbank bought it for $32bn. Didn&#39;t make any sense when Nvidia want it for $38.5bn, and later at $50bn+.Now we are back to square one, how many investors, in the open market are willing to buy ARM&#39;s stock at a valuation of, let say the same $32bn as Softbank initially paid? Roughly P/E 100, assuming they managed to grow ARM business from 2018 at ~$220M operating income to $300M in 2021. I much rather bet on Intel if I had the money.And of course many on HN will think ARM is worthless because the future is going to be the Riscy Silver Bullet.Disclosures: I do not currently hold any stocks or Mutual Funds, Indexes and other financial instrument."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Soooo back on the LSE or?It was such a hot stock in 2014-15. Softbank kinda bought it at the peak. Still, Apple has proven ARM on the desktop is phenomenal, and Ampere has done the same in the datacenter. Both have swiftly made compiler support accelerate dramatically. I would love for my next desktop to be arm-based, and it would be great if it didn’t NEED to be a mac. Broad adoption of ARM would be a huge win for sustainability. I’m bullish on their business, even if their business model isn’t vertically scalable.I think that RISC V also has a bright future, but its still a bit far out before its a viable competitor. Still there have been some things that look really promising such as what is coming out of SiFive:https://www.sifive.com/press/sifive-raises-risc-v-performanc...And Intel just announced a $1B fund for companies building on their Open Foundry RISC-V alliance. https://www.tomshardware.com/news/intel-1b-fund-risc-vBig things are happening for small instruction sets… watch this space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good. Never a good outcome for the industry for Arm to be owned by Nvidia - and regulators have learned by now that undertakings in these circumstances have little value.Sorry for Simon Segars who must have had a tough job essentially implementing Son&#39;s ideas. And those ideas seem to have been pretty poor - Arm China debacle, focus on IoT and selling to Nvidia have all clearly harmed Arm&#39;s prospects.It&#39;s clear by now that selling CPUs is a mature market but that Arm has room to grow and there is still lots of money to be made in hardware if you innovate - eg in accelerated computing. It&#39;s also true both that Arm&#39;s model works and that it has more competition than ever from RISC-V.A lot still to play for in my view and I think that the IPO price will reflect that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It must be noted that the satellites were not directly damaged by the geomagnetic storm. The storm warmed the atmosphere which caused it to expand, leading to additional drag that prohibited the satellites from leaving their low &#34;safe mode&#34; orbit.Shortened excerpt:
&#34;These storms cause the atmosphere to warm and atmospheric density at our low deployment altitudes to increase.... speed and severity of the storm caused atmospheric drag to increase up to 50 percent.... The Starlink team commanded the satellites into a safe-mode where they would fly edge-on (like a sheet of paper) to minimize drag...Preliminary analysis show the increased drag at the low altitudes prevented the satellites from leaving safe-mode to begin orbit raising maneuvers, and up to 40 of the satellites will reenter or already have reentered the Earth’s atmosphere. The deorbiting satellites pose zero collision risk with other satellites and by design demise upon atmospheric reentry—meaning no orbital debris is created and no satellite parts hit the ground.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SpaceX deploys its satellites into these lower obitsUnintentional pun on &#34;orbits&#34;, perhaps?It&#39;s incredible to me that launching satellites is so easy now that a failure of 40 satellites can be tolerated. On the bright side, I guess this gave SpaceX a chance to talk about their debris-limiting strategy!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"40 sats makes up about 2% of the current fleet - so a rounding error in cost and time.The important part of this news is how those 40 sats deorbit and leave no junk either in orbit or on earth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having done computer architecture and bit twiddling x86 in the ye olden days, I immediately, independently converged on the patented solution (code / circuit / Verilog, more or less the same thing). It goes to show how broken the USPTO is because it&#39;s obvious to anyone in the field. Patents are supposed to be nonobvious. (35 USC 103)https://patentdefenses.klarquist.com/obviousness-sec-103/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;SWAR&#34; approach `(a &amp; b) + (a ^ b) / 2` looks bizarre but can be understood.Adding two bits produces a sum and a carry:    0 + 0 = 0, carry 0
    1 + 0 = 1, carry 0
    0 + 1 = 1, carry 0
    1 + 1 = 0, carry 1

So the sum is XOR, and the carry is bitwise AND. We can rewrite x + y as (x ^ y) + (x &amp; y)*2Distribute the divide, and you get (x ^ y)/2 + (x &amp; y) which is the mystery expression.(Note this distribution is safe only because (x &amp; y)*2 is even.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the official response from SE:https://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/376060/update-on-th...For the past month Stack Overflow has been hit by weekly DDoS attacks that progressively grew in size and scope. In each incident, the attacker(s) have been changing their methodology and responding to our countermeasures. Initially we were able to detect and mitigate the attacks before any performance degradation could be noticed but the latest attacks ramped up very quickly and the site was brought down before we could react.While we cannot go into specifics on each attack in order to maintain opsec and not tip off the attackers, we can say that each individual attack has been using different IP addresses and targeted different aspects of the site. During an outage, our top priority is always getting the site back up and running. After traffic has been stabilized, we perform a post mortem for the incident where we assess and improve upon the actions we have taken.During the outage last Sunday, we noticed that a large amount of the DDoS traffic originated from Tor exit nodes. The decision to block Tor exit nodes did not come lightly, in fact Teresa, our CTO was on the call when we discussed remediation methods. Due to the persistent nature of the attack and our desire to bring the site back up as fast as possible we made the decision to block all DDoS traffic endpoints, including these Tor exit nodes.We did not target, nor set out to block all traffic from Tor, that’s not something Stack has ever done. However, due to the shared nature of Tor exit nodes, some of them were also routing DDoS attacks to our sites and were blocked. We have tried removing these blocks between attacks but this action has resulted in further site outages as DDoS efforts continue to originate from these exit nodes. Unfortunately blocking the Tor exit nodes also blocks legitimate users from using them. An immediate solution for users who find themselves blocked is to access our site from other IP addresses, via home internet, work internet, or other VPN services.We are continuing to evaluate the situation and will keep our community updated. Thank you for your patience and understanding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was no intentional blocking of Tor there in the past as far as I understand. But there are some mechanisms that block users from IP addresses that posted spam or abusive content. Those are automated and based on flags and not directed towards Tor specifically, but of course TOR addresses are more likely to have been misused that way so your chances of encountering these blocks is dramatically higher when using Tor. But these blocks only apply to low reputation users, I think once you&#39;re above 100 they don&#39;t matter anymore. And they also don&#39;t block reading the sites.There have been DDoS attacks recently on Stack Overflow and Stack Exchange, I think it&#39;s quite plausible those have something to do with this. They still seem to be under active attack intermittently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe Stackoverflow finally started to aggressively block everything that might &#34;crawl&#34; their data. I&#39;m super tired of all the paraphrased/translated copies in Google results."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The interesting thing this brings up is whether programming hiring is too specific. Why do we hire reactjs programmers with e-commerce experience instead of react programmers, e-commerce programmers, or programmers?To me this guy sounds like he could do anything, just see if he&#39;s easy to work with and see if he likes your domain. He&#39;s certainly said enough about programming over the years that he shouldn&#39;t need a leetcode grilling.Anyway my point was it can get quite narrow what we look for in a coder when in fact some broad experience might be just what is necessary. For instance I&#39;ve coded apps for iPhone and Android despite being ostensibly a back end financial trader. I&#39;d think a lot of coders wouldn&#39;t want to be siloed into the first thing they get a job in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this thread really exploded! My 2 cents on Haskell, since we&#39;re building https://wasp-lang.dev/ in it and also just hired several founding engineers:- we&#39;re sticking with the &#34;Boring Haskell&#34; manifesto(https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2019/11/boring-haskell-manifest...) - using only the widely adopted compiler plugins and not going too crazy with the monad transformer stack, which keeps the code easy for others to contribute to.- we&#39;ve hired 2 founding engineers so far - none of them knew Haskell beforehand! But they were both senior engs well versed in different languages and I was surprised with how quickly they picked it up - within the first month they are at 90% productivity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Login.gov is already used to access 200 websites run by 28 Federal agencies and over 40 million Americans have accounts,” Wyden wrote in a letter to the IRS today. “Unfortunately, login.gov has not yet reached its full potential, in part because many agencies have flouted the Congressional mandate that they use it, and because successive Administrations have failed to prioritize digital identity. The cost of this inaction has been billions of dollars in fraud, which has in turn fueled a black market for stolen personal data, and enabled companies like ID.me to commercialize what should be a core government service.”not great!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So basically, we are a hosting association that wanted to put their servers at home _and_ sleep at night.
This demanded inter-home redundancy of our data. But none of the existing solutions (MinIO, Ceph...) are designed for high inter-node latency.
Hence Garage! Your cheap and proficient object store: designed to run on a toaster, through carrier-pigeon-grade networks, while still supporting a tons of workloads (static websites, backups, Nextcloud... you name it)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Y&#39;all might want to get to the point a bit quicker in your pitch. A lot of fluff to wade through before the lede..&#34;Garage is a distributed storage solution, that automatically replicates your data on several servers. Garage takes into account the geographical location of servers, and ensures that copies of your data are located at different locations when possible for maximal redundancy, a unique feature in the landscape of distributed storage systems.Garage implements the Amazon S3 protocol, a de-facto standard that makes it compatible with a large variety of existing software. For instance it can be used as a storage back-end for many self-hosted web applications such as NextCloud, Matrix, Mastodon, Peertube, and many others, replacing the local file system of a server by a distributed storage layer. Garage can also be used to synchronize your files or store your backups with utilities such as Rclone or Restic. Last but not least, Garage can be used to host static websites, such as the one you are currently reading, which is served directly by the Garage cluster we host at Deuxfleurs.&#34;"</p>

This from an IPv6-only network. Since you publish an IPv6 record our DNS64/NAT64 gateway doesn&#39;t get involved hence the IPv4 immediate connect fail."</p>
