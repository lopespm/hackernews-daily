								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I understand it, the reason an HIV vaccine has been so difficult to create is that HIV mutates so easily. I understand the basics behind how mRNA vaccines are generated, but I don&#39;t understand why this approach would be expected to have any more success in evading the high mutation potential of HIV than other vaccine types. After all, it was even a concern with new coronavirus variants that the original Moderna vaccine would be less effective against them (and, indeed, while the original vaccine is still highly effective against all variants, my understanding is that it is less so than the original variant). And SARS-COV-2 mutates much less easily than HIV.Can someone with more knowledge explain the thought process behind this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember growing up being terrified of HIV/AIDS. The idea of something being permanent and transmissible via sex, and literally dismounting your immune defense to all other diseases on the planet...To this day it still terrifies me, even though the treatments have become so good.Each year it seems there are new stories about HIV research, and progress keeps being made. I pray for positive results and am really amazed. We have a lot to be thankful for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if we&#39;ll see HSV also addressed by this new wave of mRNA vaccines, or if it&#39;s just not top of mind for companies and researchers due to its &#34;mostly benign&#34; nature. At least until one&#39;s immune system starts to weaken with advanced age and it starts to cause all sorts of problems, but perhaps by then it gets swept under the &#34;problems of aging&#34; rug."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once hired a guy who had no experience, but seemed like a good culture fit for our company and seemed very interested in learning.We interviewed him and made e-mail communication a large part of the interview, because it is a critical part of our business.  And his communication was great!After hiring, a recurring problem we had was his e-mail to us and to customers were terrible.  Bad grammar, bad spelling, uncorrected typos...  It got so bad that we had to have someone review all e-mails he sent to customers.We had regular &#34;improvement plan&#34; meetings with him, but after a year of paying him, we had to let him go.  As part of the exit interview we went back and looked at his interview e-mails, and compared them with his current e-mails.  So we asked him:&#34;During the interview, all your e-mails were great!  Why was that?&#34;&#34;My wife wrote all of those.&#34;I guess we should have hired his wife!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been a hiring manager for remote positions for a long time. If your recruiting channels are good, most of your candidates are going to be honest and good intentioned.But interview enough people, and you&#39;ll start encountering people trying to abuse remote work. They&#39;re not interested in contributing to your company. They&#39;re only interested in collecting paychecks while they do as little work as possible for as long as possible. They might already have a full-time job or other remote jobs, or maybe they&#39;re just trying to travel the world and do a &#34;four hour workweek&#34; thing where they answer e-mails once a day and phone in a couple hours of work at key times during the week.The common theme is that they aren&#39;t really interested in fighting too hard for the position. As soon as the interview or job turns out to be something they can&#39;t just talk and smile their way through, they&#39;re out, just like this:&gt; I think my last update for a while: as soon as HR got on the call with him, before they could get through their first question, John said the words “I quit” and hung up the calls. He has since been unreachable!!Always makes me wonder how many dysfunctional companies are out there letting deadbeat remote employees collect paychecks and do as little work as possible because nobody cares enough to press the issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once interviewed a person who couldn&#39;t answer a single question, not even the easiest ones. He would just say &#34;I don&#39;t know, ask me the next question&#34;. A few weeks later I realized it was probably a plant that another candidate sent to collect the interview questions. And I think I even know who it was. We hired her, she wasn&#39;t very good writing code. But she answered all our questions perfectly, which only happened once before."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looks like a Miele. That menu can be exited (the image where it says &#34;Software Update&#34;, the tiny bit on the right... that&#39;s a scroll bar of multiple options including the ability to exit this menu), but it does imply that the dishwasher is already connected to Wi-Fi and that it has determined that there is an update available.There are few times that a dishwasher is interacted with, if not when you go into the menu to start it then when? It&#39;s just asking &#34;Do you want to do this now?&#34; if not that is fine (the menu can be exited), but now you know to do it later.Alternatively as the dishwasher clearly is on Wi-Fi already (the only way it would know there&#39;s an update), one can use the Miele@Home app to perform the update at a more convenient time.I have a Miele dishwasher, it is connected to Wi-Fi (on a VLAN with other white goods, outbound connections to certain domains only). The Wi-Fi is useful... the dishwasher auto-doses the powder, rinse aid, salt, etc... and can let me know the levels of those. In addition it tells me when the cycle is done. Performs updates, etc. There&#39;s a Home Assistant integration too, but I&#39;ve not done that (my VLAN setup prevented it!).PS: If you&#39;re of the opinion that a dishwasher doesn&#39;t need to be on Wi-Fi and you wouldn&#39;t connect it... then great, that&#39;s another way not to be asked to do an update. This dishwasher isn&#39;t going to ask to connect to Wi-Fi, it&#39;s something you choose to do (something that takes a degree of determination I might add)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it weird that the more tech becomes like this the more I feel checked out?I don’t want smart devices, nor do I want to be online 24/7. However it’s hard to escape this reality. My thermostat (in apartment) recently reset due to a power issue and I had to have maintenance over to do its configuration again. They had to come twice because after setting it up they have to figure out how to connect it to Wi-Fi for a software update.Before this apartment I lived in one where all the appliances were straight out of 1950/60. They were retro af but they worked without any issues for the time I lived there. Here I’ve had issues every month."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Smart devices are overly complex. The entire point should have been to make devices work for you, but now when you buy a ‘smart’ washing machine, it requires you 30min of setup. Downloading apps, connecting it to wifi, providing GPS location etc. why? What’s the point. We need devices that make life simpler. Straight out of the box."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I went car shopping this year in the new market and found that that if you want more a &#34;dumb&#34; car (UX occurs primarily outside of a touchscreen, no internet, no geolocation) you lose all potential for any nice non-smart features. So no heated/powered seats, no power windows, the material of the interior is refurbished from a spirit airlines airplane, etc.I think manufacturers are hoping that certain aspects of the modern auto become &#34;can&#39;t live withouts&#34;, e.g. bluetooth, which helps them smuggle all the other more marginally useful, security and ux intrusive features into your model. Now as others have mentioned, these unwanted smart features might actually be required by law/regulation/tax-credit/legal-dept, so it&#39;s not bad programming/design but &#34;design by committee&#34; that&#39;s dooming our chances of a good dumb car.I wonder how well my car will age when miscellaneous sensor all over the car start failing. It used to just show a light on your dashboard, now I wonder if I&#39;ll be grounded - stuck in park - or hounded by incessant bells repeating the same spurious warning over and over again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our Volvo doesn&#39;t let you adjust the volume when you&#39;re in reverse.  That means if you&#39;re backing out of the garage and the music is blaring -- you can&#39;t turn it off!The Volvo UI pops up an almost full-display warning when it can&#39;t connect to the phone over bluetooth on startup.  This UI takes priority over the rear camera.  So I guess it&#39;s better to hit Timmy and his puppy when I&#39;m backing out, so long as I know my phone&#39;s not connected!The Volvo&#39;s headlights have &#34;smart&#34; auto-adjustments.  That means I can&#39;t leave the high beams on, or force it to stay on low beams.  It will decide for me!  I think maybe I can disable this... somehow.So smart."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I hate about &#34;car discourse&#34; like this is the apparent blindness to public transportation. Trains, bikes, buses, and street cars solve almost every problem that the author complains about.The only outstanding problem, however, is that American infrastructure has been deliberately designed solely around the car. Those who suggest alternative modes of public transportation are immediately written off as &#34;impractical&#34;. Discourse ought to be centered around democratizing and diversifying the ways people can get around, not on how one ought to &#34;make dumb cars&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good and thorough article. The author got down to brass tacks pretty quickly and brings up interesting hypothesis about $MSFT.That said, I do have one gripe:&gt; To oversimplify Notion to its demographics, it is Office 365 for people below age 35.I recognize this is an oversimplification, but even so, it seems like a stretch. Notion is a decent product, and I have used it for a few small-scale team projects in uni (mainly for Kanban-related stuff) - but to call it a replacement for O365 is an exaggeration at best.Yes, you can have pretty, nested documents in Notion and that&#39;s great, but a tabular database in Notion is by no means a replacement for Excel or even Google Sheets. The velocity that is afforded by Excel in terms of formulas is unmatched and there&#39;s a reason it has yet to be unseated as the kingpin of modern finance.Most young people I know use a combination of Discord + Google Suite to collaborate. I am aware this is slightly anecdotal, but I am also having a hard time imagining myself as a founder and then asking my CFO to use Notion to prepare investor pitches.Source: Am 23 :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like the elephant in the room is culture.* Facebook seems to be a bunch of smart people working on pet projects. Monopoly profits drive a political empire where people at the top think up something random, and it gets built.* Google has customer contempt. They started with brilliant people who were used to being smarter than everyone else. They also started in algorithm-driven markets like search and ad-words, where everything was statistical and individuals didn&#39;t matter. They&#39;ve lost the smarts and the ethics, and they&#39;re in a bit of a hole. I think they&#39;ve reached the end of the growth line.* I know nothing about Apple. Too secretive.* Microsoft has a bunch of cut-throat teams, competing with each other. Their technology is middling. However, they&#39;re the only one of the bunch you&#39;d want to partner with for B2B.* ... except for Amazon, which is hyper-customer-focused, and has a track record of successful forward-looking projects. AWS has been rock solid. On the other hand, I&#39;d never want to work there; they treat employees like crap. But it somehow works out for them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, as a developer, Microsoft is a company with deep roots in compilers and operating systems. All of the business empire started from these two foundations. 
Since its inception till today, Microsoft has been producing some global products every decade. And then making these products unbeatable in the global marketes. 
Be it Windows, Office, Exchange, Developer tools &amp; Compilers, Web Servers, XBox, Azure, Teams etc. You just name it and Microsoft is right there in almost every field with profitable products. 
A lot of people don&#39;t like the traditional Microsoft products but all of the products just work and are being used for tens of millions of customers around the globe every day. 
Any Software company with ability to create profitable products every decade is a killer company. That is the secret souce Microsoft has.As a developer just imagine about a company which gives you a developer tool to make a web application, using the company&#39;s provided compiler, which then can be deployed on a company&#39;s provided webserver and can store some data on company&#39;s provided database which is running on company&#39;s provided operating system.The company also happens to provide end-to-end tools for running a company of a 5 people to a company of 500,000 people.This is Microsoft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Similar things happen surprisingly often in companies.  Many intense arguments can be diffused by first being specific about what we agree upon.Just to add to this, one strategy from the rationalist community that I rarely see practiced is to &#39;taboo&#39; certain words.  For example if two engineers are arguing about a solution not being scalable, taboo the word scalable.  They both re-explain their POV without using the word scalable at all.  It often works like magic and they quickly reach a shared understanding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s weird it took her so long to realize what was happening - I knew as soon as I read the first paragraph what was going on.I suppose it&#39;s because I am younger (and thus have memories of being a kid) and was rather short as a kid, so I know what sorts of limited visibility you can have as a kid, and more recently I&#39;m also used to driving at confusing intersections where it&#39;s not clear which light applies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a kid my mom ran out of gas several times, and it was always on the same road, which had a gravel shoulder.  We&#39;d be riding along, she&#39;d pull off into (what I call &#34;the rocks&#34;), the car would stop and she&#39;d say &#34;we&#39;re out of gas&#34;.  Since the car was moving along fine before pulling off the road, and I had no concept of how cars worked, I made the connection that pulling into &#34;the rocks&#34; caused the car to run out of gas.  After making that connection, I used to scream not to pull into the rocks when she ran out of gas.  My parents eventually made the connection as to what I was thinking, and instead explaining how it worked used to tease me with it well into my adult years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of water pooling and etc.  i wonder how much work it would take to fix it up.I had a friend growing up who had a missile silo on the edge of their property.Folks in the area never talked about them but everyone knew where they were.   We would go look at it once in a while.   Really eerie that out in this peaceful prairie was a horrific weapon just sleeping and waiting.  Ready to go at all times.  Pointed at folks on the other side of the planet nobody in the prairie knew or would likely ever meet.After the Cold War they were decommissioning them.  While driving out there I was waved down my an APC and some soldiers.   I pulled over, they asked me to wait with them.A couple convoys of more soldiers drove by, trucks, then a big convoy with a big white truck.I asked “Was that the real thing?”   The soldier said “They don’t bring us ALL out here unless it is.”They thanked me for waiting and told me I could go after one more group when by."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the early 2000s, there was a massive DEA bust involving a decomissioned missile silo turned into an LSD lab (which was apparently responsible for manufacturing 90% of the LSD on the market at the time). Other levels of the facility were turned into a massive party/tripping space - it&#39;s a fascinating story.The man responsible (William Pickard) served quite some time in federal prison but was finally released sometime last year.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s no shortage of creative uses for a property like this.https://historydaily.org/skinner-pickard-1990s-lsd-lab-built...https://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/2-Bay-Area-Men-Busted..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are much better underground bunkers for sale. AT&amp;T had chains of underground bunkers they operated for DoD. Many of those are for sale. Here&#39;s one.[1]These are much more useful. No silo, mostly big high-ceiling areas sized for telephone switches. 3-phase power. Onsite well. These were only shut down a decade or two ago, so they&#39;re often in good shape. They&#39;re all far from cities, because the whole point was to have backup network nodes that were unlikely to be attacked.[1] https://homeslandcountrypropertyforsale.com/sustainable-prop..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The full version of Brin and Page&#39;s classic paper &#34;The Anatomy of a Large-Scale Hypertextual Web Search Engine&#34; [1], which describes the early architect of Google and is an interested read in its own right, literally has &#34;Appendix A: Advertising and Mixed Motives.&#34; Highlights include:-&#34;We believe the issue of advertising causes enough mixed incentives that it is crucial to have a
competitive search engine that is transparent and in the academic realm. &#34;- &#34;We expect that advertising
funded search engines will be inherently biased towards the advertisers and away from the needs of the consumers.&#34;- &#34;A better search engine would not have required this
ad, and possibly resulted in the loss of the revenue from the airline to the search engine. In general, it
could be argued from the consumer point of view that the better the search engine is, the fewer
advertisements will be needed for the consumer to find what they want. This of course erodes the
advertising supported business model of the existing search engines.&#34;To be clear: the &#34;we&#34; in these quotes are the founders of Google.[1] https://storage.googleapis.com/pub-tools-public-publication-...As an aside, I&#39;ve been reading a bunch of academic papers about early web crawlers and search engines. It&#39;s a fun and interesting subject. Mercator [2] (which became Alta Vista) is another early search engine and one of the few that discusses its architecture in detail.[2] https://www.hpl.hp.com/techreports/Compaq-DEC/SRC-RR-173.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The screenshot text does not say at all what the author of the tweet claims it does (and what&#39;s in the HN title). Nowhere in the text does it actually talk about &#34;above&#34; and &#34;sidebar&#34;, that is just an interpretation that the author made up about what &#34;buying a better position in the search results&#34; would mean. Given the context of the times, it was clearly not a statement about layout but about actually reordering the &#34;organic&#34; search results based on payments and without marking those boosted results as ads."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This practice has enabled scams. Many crypto sites now have a fraudulent version showing as a top result in ads which will allow the user to enter their seed phrase and empty their accounts.at this point an adblocker is more useful than an antivirus software"</p>
