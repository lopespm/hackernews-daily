								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks fantastic!A thought-experiment that may interest you coming from someone (me) who already has happily spent several hundreds of dollars on mechanical keyboards and uses them every single day:Let&#39;s imagine the keyboard could be bought today as-is with a simple &#34;Buy Now&#34; button and price was no concern.The two main reasons I would _still_ hesitate to hit that button are:1. I absolutely and undoubtedly need to know what it SOUNDS and FEELS like. Is it linear, tactile, clicky? How much? I turned my speakers to max because I assumed you&#39;d have some audio-track running but to no avail. Did I miss something?2. I wish there was a &#39;blank&#39; version with zero typography anywhere. Just all black. I touch-type and have not looked at my keyboard in 15 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Low profile ergonomic mechanical keyboard is a pretty deep hole to dive into.
You can design your own PCB, order it from manufacturer and build the exact keyboard you want (split, wireless, with knobs, any form and key count).
It is not for everyone and might require soldering, but possibilities are endless.Additional resources:- r/ErgoMechBoards: https://www.reddit.com/r/ErgoMechKeyboards/- Low Profile Discord: https://discord.com/invite/dBSRZ2a- Collection of split low profile mechanical keyboards: https://kbd.news/tag/low-profile/- &#34;A Tiny, Ultra-Affordable Keyboard You Can Build Yourself!&#34; video:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JqpBKuEVinw"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess this is a good place to share my open source large format laser cutter design for sewing projects. It’s cheap to make, works pretty well, and the whole gantry assembly slides right off leaving just a sheet of plywood with low profile 3D printed rails on the sides. So I throw my rug over it and it becomes my floor when not in use. Important because the laser cutter can cut a full 60” wide piece of fabric two yards long. It’s basically 5 foot by 6 foot, and I don’t have space in my apartment for a dedicated machine that takes up all that space. But since this doubles as my floor it works great! Also includes a raspberry pi camera on the laser head which serves as a pattern scanner. I really want to finish my video on this thing, I’ve just been busy. But please take a look and considering building it! If you have any questions open a GitHub issue and I will do everything I can to help. I think it’s a great starting point (designed in three weeks) and I’d LOVE for other people to reproduce it and extend the design! The machine has a few hiccups but I use it all the time for my sewing projects and it is SO nice to get all the cutting done repeatably and automatically. You can even scan existing clothes often without disassembly and turn those in to digital patterns!https://github.com/tlalexander/large_format_laser_cutter"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Didn&#39;t expect to see sewing patterns on HN, but not complaining, this looks really cool!While on the topic, my girlfriend recently showed me this site: https://freesewing.org . It&#39;s fully open source and all the patterns are actually parametric, meaning you can customize the patterns to exact body measurements. Their custom JS framework for designing patters as well as the rest of the platform is MIT licensed [0] and the patterns are all Creative Commons.[0] https://github.com/freesewing/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the British Army every subunit is entitled to train someone in sewing and using sewing machines so that they can repair the subunit’s clothes and webbing equipment, including in the field. It’s a very creative course and people come back able to build you all kinds of rigs and pouches and things like this from webbing and Cordura that are extremely robust. The soldiers are all super keen to get on the course and to learn to sew."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really appreciate this post and how it highlights the power of becoming involved in occupation. I use that term in the context of the fact that my spouse is an Occupational Therapist by trade. In that field, the term occupation refers to a collection of activities of daily living, not a &#34;job&#34; per se. Rather than seeing patients through a framework of diagnosis or disability, they look at activities and people&#39;s ability to perform them, and intervene where there is lack. In practice that may involve helping an amputee learn how to put on socks, or helping an autistic child participate in education. More broadly, a central philosophy of their field is that meaningful occupation is a powerful motivator that has cascading effects across the many component activities in somebody&#39;s daily life. OP&#39;s post described how becoming involved as a Guix contributor effectively organized and motivated other areas of their life as well. The fact that we all are here hanging out on a VC&#39;s forum tends to color our idea of what value means. I think this post inspires that there is value to not only the community but also the individual as well in just &#34;doing cool stuff&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://guix.gnu.org/en/about/&gt; Guix is an advanced distribution of the GNU operating system developed by the GNU Project—which respects the freedom of computer users.For anyone looking for more context. I did not know anything about the what and why and who of this post.Having read it, I like the author&#39;s point of view. Working on it is good for his well-being. That&#39;s more than enough reason to pursue it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not a developer but I totally relate to this. Most of my creative pursuits are weird, niche, sometimes avant-garde. If I didn&#39;t make my artifacts, nobody else would, and it is so intrinsically rewarding to see my visions instantiated, even if they pale in comparison to my first imagining of what they might be. Because I have fringe-y interests, most people don&#39;t necessarily &#34;get&#34; it. (Probably true of everyone else on HN as well.) But the people who do get it, I found them on the internet, and I thank God for that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They&#39;re going to heavily lockdown WKWebView after the Instagram and Tiktok revelations, probably in iOS16.1. They may even remove it entirely and force people to use SFSafariViewController (heavily locked down web browser, opaque to developers other than URL). Best of luck to anyone that was using javascript injection for legitimate purposes, others have ruined it for everyone by abusing user trust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In-app browsers are a huge mess and security/privacy nightmare. Browsers implement a security sandbox. In-app browsers break and circumvent this threat model in nasty ways. I hope this gets the same attention as cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks and browser engines implement strict countermeasures by default locking WebViews to the equivalent of an Incognito/InPrivate tab."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can’t quite figure this out: it sounds like if you click a link in someone’s TikTok content, the in app browser can read any text entered on that site using the in app browser. Does just not entering any keyboard input in the in app browser mitigate this?Does Apple Lockdown help in this situation? I thought that typical TikTok use just involved scrolling and watching video content. Are users who only view content subject to this security flaw?Thanks in advance for any clarification.Also, off topic but doesn’t YouTube’s “Shorts” take the place of TikTok? I have my Google privacy settings set so YouTube can store my viewing history for one month so I get reasonable recommendations. Does TikTok have similar settings?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I believe already some 2 decades ago Bill Gates said that the biggest failure in software is the lack of productivity gains in software development.Just to cherry pick a dramatized example. In the late 90s, one of my first programming experiences was in Delphi. It&#39;s a very visual way to program. You drag and drop a UI together from standardized elements. You could data bind things like input fields to a data source. You&#39;d double click a button and it takes you to the already created &#34;onclick&#34; event where you do the actual coding. In a way, this is still similar to how you can &#34;program&#34; Microsoft Access today.In this same period (I was in a computer science study) I was moaning to my teacher how tricky programming in C was. I made tiny memory management errors crashing the entire PC, with zero debug output.His words: &#34;Don&#39;t worry. By the time you get to work, you&#39;ll just do modeling&#34;.Now I work on the web. It&#39;s been 30 years since Delphi and instead of productivity gains, we&#39;ve taken steps in the opposite direction. There is no standardized UI library. JavaScript has no standard library. There&#39;s no single unified architecture. There&#39;s no standard tool chain. It&#39;s all very low level after which we stitch together fragile semi-abstractions.I know it&#39;s an imperfect comparison, but I hope it gets the point across. It&#39;s all far too low level and fragile.This doesn&#39;t just hurt productivity, also accessibility. It&#39;s simply not beginner friendly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great post - the one word missing, &#34;maintenance.&#34; Most programming work is done maintaining/enhancing existing code. The greenfield work is a piece of cake by comparison.You want to do the hard stuff? Maintain existing code you&#39;re not familiar with.The problems around maintaining unfamiliar code are huge, largely unsolved, expensive and risky. There&#39;s a little branch of computer science called Program Comprehension and no one pays any attention. Though most programming money is spent on maintenance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been programming for over 30 years, and never been as productive as before. Need to load and decode a jpeg/png, I grab stb_image.h. Need to decode an ogg file, libogg. Need to decompress, libz. Need to decode video, libavformat. Need physics, libbullet. Need truetype fonts, freetype. Need a GUI, Qt. Need SSL, libssl.My day becomes selecting libraries, integrating them, and testing integration. My business code is &lt; 20% of our entire codebase. And I’m much more productive in 2022 than in 1992."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Aside from running Ceph as my day job, I have a 9-node Ceph cluster on Rasberry Pi 4s at home that I&#39;ve been running for a year now, and I&#39;m slowly starting to move things away from ZFS to this cluster as my main storage.My setup is individual nodes, with 2.5&#34; external HDDs (mostly SMR), so I actually get sligtly better performance than this cluster, and I&#39;m using 4+2 erasure coding for the main data pool for CephFS.CephFS has so far been incredibly stable and all my Linux laptops reconnect to it after sleep with no issues (in this regard it&#39;s better than NFS).I like this setup a lot better now than ZFS, and I&#39;m slowly starting to migrate away from ZFS, and now I&#39;m even thinking of setting up a second Ceph cluster.  The best thing with Ceph is that I can do a maintenance on a node at any time and storage availability is never affected, with ZFS I&#39;ve always dreaded any kind of upgrade, and any reboot requires an outage.  Plus with Ceph I can add just one disk at a time to the cluster and disks don&#39;t have to be the same size.  Also, I can move the physical nodes individually to a different part of my home, change switches and network cabling without an outage now.  It&#39;s a nice feeling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man, Ceph really doesn&#39;t get enough love. For all the distributed systems hype out there - be it Kubernetes or blockchains or serverless - the ol&#39; rock solid distributed storage systems sat in the background iterating like crazy.We had a huge Rook/Ceph installation in the early days of our startup before we killed off the product that used it (sadly). It did explode under some rare unusual cases, but I sometimes miss it! For folks who aren&#39;t aware, a rough TLDR is that Ceph is to ZFS/LVM what Kubernetes is to containers.This seems like a very cool board for a Ceph lab - although - extremely expensive - and I say that as someone who sells very expensive Raspberry Pi based computers!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will once again lament the fact that WD Labs built SBCs that sat with their hard drives to make them individual CEPH nodes but never took the hardware to production.  It seems to me there&#39;s still a market for SBCs that could serve a CEPH OSD on a per-device basis, although with ever increasing density in the storage and hyperconverged space that&#39;s probably more of a small business or prosumer solution."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is hard to imagine the scale of these things, I know if you had tapped me on the shoulder at Intel in the 80&#39;s and said, &#34;in 40 years, the chip your looking at will fit in a couple of square mm of silicon.&#34; I would not have believed you. Of course it doesn&#39;t &#34;really&#34; fit in that small a slice as you need to get the signals into and out of it and those points take space, but it is doesn&#39;t take much space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Housing in the US has gotten to where it is due to horrible laws effectively allowing total tax avoidance for landlords.Take some investment property. You buy it at some basis price, let&#39;s say 500k. You rent it out for 15k a year. Each year you can offset your rental income against deprecation of the property and property taxes - meaning, you pay no income tax on your rental income.~30 years later, you&#39;ve deprecated it down to an effective value of $0, so you hypothetically would have to start paying taxes on your rental income(of course, you can still deduct property taxes against that). What do you do? Well, there&#39;s something called a 1031 exchange - this lets you sell an investment property, and as long as the funds go directly into another investment property, you pay no capital gains taxes. So guess what? You can buy a brand new investment property with a new(albeit adjusted) cost basis, and you can start the entire cycle of depreciation and deduction all over again on your new, more expensive, property.So, you&#39;ve now held this property your entire life, and you die and pass it to your kids - well, great news, unless your estate is over 12 million dollars(and double that for a married couple), you pay no estate taxes.  And even more fun - when you inherit property, the cost basis is &#34;reset&#34; to the present day value of the property at time of inheritance - So your children can now rent the property out, deprecate it, and pay no income tax on the rental income either, and continue the cycle.The net result is that rental properties generate a ton of income for the owners, who pay almost nothing in taxes. Even if they do pay property tax, property tax rates are generally much lower than income tax rates."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a simple problem, we turned housing into an investment.  Now everyone who owns a home is incentivized to ensure their investment is maximized and that results in a lot of NIMBYism.  The simple solution is we need more housing in cities and suburbs.  How we get there is an exercise that&#39;s taken on by local housing authorities and they are not incentivized to solve the problem.  That&#39;s because they work for voters who are currently living in the area opposed to future people who aren&#39;t contributing to the vote.States are going to have to step in and override cities that aren&#39;t being effective, this cannot be solved from the federal level.  They are going to have to say, these permitting processes are too restrictive, homeowners can add backyard units or convert their homes to duplexes/etc, and make it easy for apartment builders to buy a few homes to make small apartment complexes even if the neighborhood hates it or the city has been stalling on that kind of development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fraud protection of credit cards is the root of modern e-commerce. In some ways, Visa and Mastercard are the privatized court systems of the internet.If I end up on a random, self-hosted ecommerce site and decide to make a purchase - what guarantee do I have that the item will show up or be as-described? If I bought something through a bank transfer, reversing that purchase would be incredibly difficult. And, suing a merchant is prohibitively slow, expensive, and arduous.Also, modern B2C SaaS is built on credit card subscriptions. The ability for a merchant to pull payments on a recurring basis from a credit card requires an incredible amount of trust. If consumers had to push payment every month or year to continue subscriptions (instead of having it automatically debited), then churn rates would skyrocket and modern SaaS multiples would crash - taking company valuations with it.So, I&#39;m sure online merchants are happy to keep paying their ~3% fees as long as sales continue. Nobody wants to go back to &#34;Cash on Delivery&#34;, and nobody wants to hire workers to knock on doors asking for bills to be paid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Living in New York City, I&#39;ve noticed that there are a whole lot of businesses that are either cash-only or card-only.I always understood the cash-only ones. If you can get plenty of customers who are willing to pay in cash, why would you want to pay credit card fees?The card-only ones were harder for me to understand, until I realized that handling cash costs money, too. Somebody needs to count it all at least once a day, if not more. Employees can steal it. Robbers can steal it. You need a safe. You need cash registers. You need to get the cash deposited in the bank, by paying someone to go do that. You need to maintain an inventory of smaller bills and coins to make change. You need to train people on all of this.Even just the accounting costs might make up the 2-3 percent in fees. &#34;Your register said you made $150 in cash that day, but the deposit that night was only $135.&#34; That&#39;s what you pay accountants to deal with, rather than just exporting from your Square account to Quickbooks or whatever.I had this realization because I went to a new coffee shop that had opened up. It appeared to be owned and operated by just one lady, and she was really nice. So, as I normally do for the nice local business owners in my neighborhood, I got out some cash instead of a card, thinking it would benefit her business. But then she told me they were card-only and it dawned on me: she&#39;s just one lady running a store by herself, _of course_ she doesn&#39;t want to deal with cash.So, I&#39;m not sure the 2-3 percent fees are all that bad, though I could be convinced otherwise. Plenty of small business owners seem pretty happy just setting up a Square reader and not dealing with the headache of cash. I think there&#39;s a lot of value in that for them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pretty funny to see this video at the top of HN! My kids still think I&#39;m an idiot for not having somehow parlayed the enduring popularity of this video into being a YouTuber -- despite my protestations that I was merely the videographer here. If anyone is curious about the video&#39;s origins, I had a fun conversation about it with Ben Sigelman a few years ago.[0][0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_IYzD_NR0W4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In case anyone needs to know, the shouter in question is none other than Brendan Gregg (of flame graph, eBPF, and Systems Performance fame). And the guy who took the video is Bryan Cantrill of Oxide Computer, DTrace, and Joyent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man. Once, when I was a young padawan doing maintenance by myself on one of our three racks in a colocation DC, I dropped a 1U server from about 2m/6ft high.  It was scary as hell. While trying to grab it I hit the off button on one of the other servers, causing an outage for about 50 customers. What&#39;s more, it fell on the floor and just missed the SAN with the spinning disk array at the bottom of the rack. Everything was fine, including the fallen server, but shit, that was stupid. The vibration alone could have caused a lot of data corruption."</p>
