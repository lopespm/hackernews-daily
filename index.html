We devoted an entire month of resources to this project and thought that was enough! Sadly it hasn&#39;t met our expectations. We&#39;re not sure why more publishers and players didn&#39;t get involved, but we&#39;re going to have it to shut it down.Everyone: No shit, lol.At least they&#39;re giving refunds."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an owner of a Video Production studio, this kind of tech is blowing my mind and makes me equally excited and scared. I can see how we could incorporate such tools in our workflows, and at the same time I&#39;m worried it&#39;ll be used to spam the internet with thousands and thousands of souless generated videos, making it even harder to look through the noise.A fun related experiment, I thought it was fun to see what kind of movies AI would generate, so I created a &#34;This Movie Does Not Exist&#34; website[1] that auto generates fake movies (movie posters + synopsis). It basically uses GPT-3 to generate some story plots, and then uses that as a prompt (with in-between steps) for Stable Diffusion. Results may vary, but it definitely surprises sometimes with movies that look and sound amazing![1] This Movie Does Not Exist: https://thismoviedoesnotexist.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I want to see is a model that can generate 3D models for use in applications such as Blender. It would provide a good starting point for someone with talent to make beautiful. Or just save people like me time for making games."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s mind blowing is that you can extrapolate where this is going to go. Eventually, you will be able to generate full movie scenes from descriptions.What&#39;s interesting to me is how this is so similar to human imagination. Give me a description and I will fabricate the visuals in my mind. Some aspects will be detailed, others will be vague, or unimportant. Crazy to see how fast AI is progressing. Machines are approaching the ability to interpret and visualize text in the same way humans can.This also fascinates me as a form of compression. You can transmit concepts and descriptions without transmitting pixel data, and the visuals can be generated onsite. Wonder if there is some practical application for this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s cool to see this on HN.I originally wrote this article for a “microcourse” I ran at the University of St Andrews—aimed at a non-tech background—on building a personal webpage. Especially in mathematics, having a personal site (that you control) to host research and other information is pretty invaluable!Older personal math sites tend to have a very particular “historic” feel. While I personally have a lot of nostalgia for the look, I also think it’s good to take advantage of some of the newer tools that are available today!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really nice, focused write up.  Very useful and to the point.HTML is really very accessible to someone with basic computer skills. It&#39;s a shame that a standard business website is now a facebook page.There is a local gym near me with a static HTML webpage, hosted on local ISP web hosting.  It&#39;s quick to load, responsive and always up to date. Checking the opening times, address and special events is much easier than on some aggregator site or google maps (which is often out of date).  It&#39;s also very easy to read on many devices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My personal approach might be too simplistic for some, but this is what I did for my webpage, though I already had some HTML &amp; CSS experience:&gt;No website generators, no frameworks, no nothing (not even JavaScript)&gt;Just design the site on the go through some trial and error using vim, CSS and HTML documentation always at hand&gt;A single .css file to style the entire website--I even threw in some cool animations, which took a while to get right, admittedly&gt;Publish it through GitHub Pages in under five minutes&gt;If I want to upload a new blog post, for instance, I just make a copy of an existing one and manually edit the content, then push it through git after I&#39;ve edited the blog index accordinglyReading terms like &#34;static site generator&#34;, &#34;content management system&#34;, &#34;templates&#34;, &#34;analytics&#34; or &#34;deployment&#34; gives me an instant headache, especially since it&#39;s so easy to open your favorite text editor and design your own website by hand, so to speak. I&#39;ve self-hosted eepsites, gemini capsules and many other sites this way and the process wasn&#39;t remotely as contrived as some approaches I&#39;ve seen out there for publishing a personal blog"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought an expensive LG Oled a few months back and was quite annoyed that every time my kids would turn it on, they were greeted with an ad depicting Peter Griffin in a thong lying on a beach. It was crass intending to be humorous; typical Seth McFarlane fare. The ads on the home screen are a very worrisome indication of where smart consumer products are headed. This root is cool, but I accomplished what I needed by blocking all the LG ad URLs in my router. You can find the list by some simple Googling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Around June-July 2021 LG started rolling out updates which added some minor mitigations that broke our original exploit chain.It&#39;s a damn shame companies feel incentivised to do this.People hacking on their own TVs is quite literally a victimless crime (besides yourself, if you brick your one TV), because you knowingly void the warranty.Mazdas have a great third-party firmware called Mazda AIO Tweaks[0] that fixes a whole host of bugs and allows you to customize the infotainment system. The best part is you can use it to enable Android Auto on older Mazdas (this was before AA was even released for Mazda!)Mazda then proceeded to lock down the firmware so much you now need to take apart some consoles and attach a serial connection. Disgusting behaviour.(vis-a-vis plugging in an SD card with the scripts you want to run.)[0] https://mazdatweaks.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The most incredible thing here is that this demonstrates a level of 3D understanding that I didn&#39;t believe existed in 2D image models yet. All of the 3D information in the output was inferred from the training set, which is exclusively uncurated and unsorted 2D still images. No 3D models, no camera parameters, no depth maps. No information about picture content other than a text label (scraped from the web and often incorrect!).From a pile of random undifferentiated images the model has learned the detailed 3D structure and plausible poses and variants of thousands (millions?) of everyday objects. And all we needed to get that 3D information out of the model was the right sampling procedure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who dabbles in 3d modeling, this is going to be an incredible resource for creating static 3d objects. Someone ought to come up with a way to convert to mesh better than the Marching Cubes algorithm I&#39;ve seen applied to most NERFs. The models still lack coherent topology and would probably be janky if fully rigged."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"the servers inside Iranian data centers still have access to the outside world.Knowing that, the simplest and easiest solution that would avoid detection is to SSH tunnel into that datacenter and SSH-ProxyForward out of that datacenter into Amazon AWS via SSH and use that SSH proxy chain as a SOCKS proxy for browsers.  Make sure the browser is using the SOCKS proxy (SSH) for its DNS.  Many sites will make your friends solve captchas if they show up from Amazon so if you have a friend outside of Iran in the same AWS region that is willing to open SSH on their home router then one could add that private home router as their last hop in the SSH proxy forward.  Do not go directly from the datacenter to the home.  It is normal and expected for Datacenters to SSH to Amazon.SSH Client -&gt; Iranian Datacenter / Server -&gt; AWS VM -&gt; Home router in same region as AWS -&gt; Internet.If many people are using the same server and VM then make sure that MaxStartups and MaxSessions have been increased in sshd_config as well as any PAM limits on the servers for open files on every node in the path.  Clients should enable ControlPath / ControlMaster in their ssh_config or ~/.ssh/config.  To harden each hop configure PermitOpen to only allow the SSH hops and the final hop should also permit *:443Examples of all these steps can be found on SuperUser  / StackExchange / ServerFault and are all public knowledge.  All above-board, no hacking involved.[Edit] Removing the Squid MITM SSL-Bump proxy idea.  That would make follow on questions harder to explain.[Edit from Fatnino&#39;s input] If your Amazon VPC&#39;s are too outbound-restricted then pick another VPS provider that is commonly used for hosting 3rd party tools for datacenters, preferably one already used by that datacenter.[Edit] In theory hypothetically speaking every hop possible could have misconfigured but realistic looking syslog so that SSH connections are not logged on the server and in theory a log-less silent rule in the edge firewall to not log SSH connections.  Sometimes syslog disks also fill up by mistake.  SSH can also be performed in ephemeral diskless containers such as Docker, Podman and LXC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish you the best of luck.When similar events unfolded in Syria, people created redundant social networks of fake Facebook accounts.  This seemed to work well.  When captured and tortured, people would hand over credentials for one account.  People would detect that network was &#34;burned&#34; and move to the next one.This gave the officials very little information, since the accounts did not reference real names, and locations were obfuscated.  High risk private messages were deleted, etc.The key to this working was that Facebook was not sympathetic to or cooperating with the Syrian government, and accessing Facebook was a common (not worth prosecuting) infraction.I&#39;d be worried that they will fingerprint / honeypot tor infrastructure, then round people up.  The existence of the tor client or connection logs basically proves guilt.Friending facebook accounts with cutsey names is much less incriminating.  Edit: Also, any honeypot proxy connection logs just show that you used https to access facebook."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Signal is setting up proxies so users in Iran using Signal could update their proxy settings in the app to bypass the block for that at least. Not sure to what extent things are being blocked, but if you can get connections to SOME outside services, this might help people to organize means of communication. The proxies are also setup by people outside of Iran and it doesn&#39;t really matter if someone in Iran leaks a proxy address, new ones can be setup in minutes. Look for the #IRanASignalProxy hashtag on twitter/other social media and ask people for the address. Signal also made a guide to help users set this up on Ios/Android - https://support.signal.org/hc/en-us/articles/360056052052-Pr..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s sad to me how successful people have been sanitizing the internet.The whole point was to be decentralized, and now we have Visa, Mastercard, Apple, Google, Amazon and Cloudflare deciding what we are and are not allowed to see, read and buy.  And virtually in lockstep, they are becoming increasingly prudish.I&#39;m curious if this could be addressed with laws that force companies to either be utilities or publishers.  If you&#39;re a publisher, you take liability for your content and can edit it at will.  If you&#39;re a utility, you do not take liability for your services, but you cannot pick and choose which customers you service so long as it&#39;s legal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t tell one way or the other if people have forgotten that SESTA/FOSTA passed in 2018.All of this is consequence of that law working as intended (not as described; it&#39;s supposed to stop human trafficking, but those supporting it made no bones about their position that if it chilled all online pornographic content, they didn&#39;t care).All of these companies pivoted hard because hosting previously-legal content may now be a federal crime, and nobody wants to get dragged through the mud of that legal case. Until and unless that changes, this is the new status quo in the United States (and therefore, much of the Internet).Matt on Tumblr seems to have missed that even if a company does all the things on his list, their owners could still end up in prison if they are aware that any pornography on their sites was &#34;facilitating sex trafficking,&#34; which is an extremely broad category (is someone using racy pictures as advertisement for face-to-face meetups? Oops, go to jail; Section 230 protections were specifically stripped out for that case and if it violates state law in the state you&#39;re operating in, the state the poster is in, or the state the viewer is in, you&#39;re now liable as the site operator!)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This mentality change goes far beyond porn. A decade ago comment sections like Slashdot and Hacker News were almost unanimously in favor of keeping the internet as unregulated and open as possible.Now it seems like every headline about social media companies attracts a lot of comments demanding regulations, restrictions, and laws to crack down on... something. Even here on HN it&#39;s common for threads about Meta to devolve into a lot of angry calls for Facebook to be &#34;banned&#34; for kids or for lawmakers to step in and regulate.Meanwhile, journalists and politicians love to amplify stories about tech companies doing harm to kids. Allowing, or even encouraging, something like porn on your platform is an open invitation for these journalists to put you in their sights. No company wants to be the most lax company in the space, so it&#39;s a constant game of companies tightening their standards."</p>

A Meta spokesperson declined to comment.The economy is stabilizing. It&#39;s being weaned off of ultra-loose money for the first time in years. The stock market is starting to behave more rationally, demanding that a company whose earnings potential is sinking and which offers no dividend be valued accordingly.&gt; ... Meta had more than 83,500 employees as of June 30, and added 5,700 new hires in the second quarter.  ...FWIW, 28 % annualized hiring growth for a company the size and age of Meta is not normal. It&#39;s a sign of mismanagement and especially loss of focus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our startup spends a little bit on Facebook Ads (across FB, Instagram, etc). It&#39;s very clear over the past few months that there&#39;s trouble in the ads engine. Attribution is a mess, ad efficiency fluctuates randomly, the UI and API are flaky. I don&#39;t know whether this is a result of the ios privacy changes, the broader economy affecting ad spend, or internal issues... Maybe a mix. But it&#39;s clear that Meta&#39;s main revenue engine is a complete mess at the moment.PS it&#39;s not just us. We&#39;ve seen industry-wide data showing that it&#39;s a broader issue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This kind of idiocracy reminds me of the GTA json thing.. It&#39;s kind of hard to attribute these things to ignorance, but there&#39;s been a notable shift in perception among developers.. It used to always be about &#34;tricking&#34; the result out of the computer by applying deep understanding of both system and problem to find the fewest, most performant steps required to yield the result.30 years ago, nobody in their right mind would have thought &#34;du&#39;h, I&#39;ll just recursively scan whatever directory THIS environment variable points at and then apply whatever this library does to each file in it to get some list and then extract the files I need from that list&#34;..Even IF you had to do such a terrible and expensive operation, you&#39;d at least have the good sense to save your result so that you can do it more efficiently the next time.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Alternative hypothesis: (brace yourselves) people don&#39;t care enough. Any vendor will prioritize requirements, if performance is not in there, that CPU and memory is going to be used if in any way it helps the developers. Conversely, by looking at a system you can infer its requirements.For commercial airplanes it may be safety first, ticket price second (passenger capacity, fuel efficiency) and speed third. For most software, functionality, signing up for a subscription, platform availability etc are usually prioritized higher than response times and keyboard shortcuts.Game devs worry a lot about latency and frame rates and professional software care a lot about keyboard shortcuts. This proves (anecdotally) that performance isn&#39;t unacheivable at all, but rather deprioritized. Nobody wants slow apps but it&#39;s just that developer velocity, metrics, ads etc etc are higher priorities, and that comes with a cpu and memory cost that the vendor doesn&#39;t care about."</p>
