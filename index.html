								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a lot of bad advice being tossed around in this thread. If you are worried about having to jump through multiple files to understand what some code is doing, you should consider that your naming conventions are the problem, not the fact that code is hidden behind functional boundaries.Coding at scale is about managing complexity. The best code is code you don&#39;t have to read because of well named functional boundaries. Without these functional boundaries, you have to understand how every line of a function works, and then mentally model the entire graph of interactions at once, because of the potential for interactions between lines within a functional boundary. The complexity (sum total of possible interactions) grows as the number of lines within a functional boundary grows. The cognitive load to understand code grows as the number of possible interactions grow. Keeping methods short and hiding behavior behind well named functional boundaries is how you manage complexity in code.The idea of code telling a story is that a unit of work should explain what it does through its use of well named variables, function/object names, and how data flows between function/objects. If you have to dig into the details of a function to understand what it does, you have failed to sufficiently explain what the function does through its naming and set of arguments."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Finally! I&#39;m glad to hear I&#39;m not the only one.  I&#39;ve gone against &#39;Clean Code&#39; zealots that end up writing painfully warped abstractions in the effort to adhere to what is in this book.  It&#39;s OK to duplicate code in places where the abstractions are far enough apart that the alternative is worse.  I&#39;ve had developers use the &#39;partial&#39; feature in C# to meet Martin&#39;s length restrictions to the point where I have to look through 10-15 files to see the full class. 
 The examples in this post are excellent examples of the flaws in Martin&#39;s absolutism."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes let&#39;s please do this.  I&#39;m tried of this book being brought up at work.My clean code book:* Put logic closest to where it needs to live (feature folders)* WET (Write everything twice), figure out the abstraction after you need something a 3rd time* Realize there&#39;s no such thing as &#34;clean code&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Worth noting in all of this that Belarus recently closed their land borders to citizens [1], under the guise of COVID, but in reality to stop people leaving. The only way out was flying from Minsk, which is now even less of an option if there are no flights to the EU.As others have said these sanctions will likely do more to harm the repressed citizens of the regime than Lukashenko[1] https://www.bnt.eu/cs/zpravy/pravni-novinky/3137-belarus-int..."</p>

decision has still to be made by the council, and then - to my understanding - implemented by all member states one by one. It&#39;s a typical example of media interpretation of facts.See here https://en.belavia.by/news/4674378/ -&gt; Belavia confirms UK and FR banned, but it was their decision."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who used to be involved in the decision to not implement native context menus, and did a bunch of work on the non-native ones, I want to try to explain why this took a long time.It has nothing to do with engineering resources, and we always wanted native context menus, but they were not customizable enough to meet the perceived needs of web, XUL, and extension developers at the time. People expected to be able to change colors and layout with CSS, for example. The native APIs put heavy limitations on what you could do with a native context menu and it was just not compatible with the expectations of people building against the rendering engine at the time.There was some discussion of switching back and forth between native and non-native menus based on styling, but that got complicated quickly and it wasn&#39;t thought to be worthwhile.It sounds like perceived needs have changed, and maybe the native APIs allow for bit more flexibility now. Glad it&#39;s happening, excited to see how well it works!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN! We’re Matt and Brendan, co-founders of Fig (https://fig.io/hn). Fig adds VSCode-style autocomplete to your existing terminal.We built Fig because of our own struggles in the terminal: we were tired of context switching between man pages, Stack Overflow posts, and Medium tutorials anytime we got stuck. We wanted our CLI tools to be more discoverable.The terminal is powerful, but unforgiving. It emulates the constraints of hardware (like teletype printers and video terminals) that became obsolete a generation ago. There are no built-in affordances. No hints about the &#39;right way&#39; of using a tool or even finding the right tool for the job. Beginners are thrown in the deep end. And even seasoned developers can screw up their system with a few unfortunate keystrokes.To solve this, we add a UI overlay that is linked with the interactive shell. As you type, Fig pops up subcommands, options, and contextually relevant arguments in your existing terminal. For example, you can type `npm run` and Fig will show you the scripts available in your package.json. You could also type `cd` when SSH&#39;d into a remote machine and Fig will list the folders within your current directory on the remote machine.We use the Accessibility API on Mac to insert text on your behalf and read what you&#39;ve typed. We also integrate with the shell to determine the current process and working directory. We are built natively for macOS in swift. We built our UI using web technologies so we can ultimately go cross platform. We render it using a WKWebView (not Electron).Fig is free for individuals and always will be. All completion specs - the templates used for generating CLI suggestions - are open source and anyone can contribute [0]. We plan to monetize by supporting autocomplete for companies&#39; custom scripts and internal CLI tools. Ultimately, we want to bring other process documentation (like SRE runbooks or deployment workflows) closer to the environment where it&#39;s used. You can see an early iteration of Fig in this HN thread from last July. [1]Fig is designed to be private. All processing happens locally on your device. None of your keystrokes are ever transmitted or stored by Fig.We&#39;d love to hear your feedback on what we’ve built! We&#39;re still in private beta (so things may break!!), but we are letting HN users skip our waitlist today and tomorrow using the link above! :)----Edit----We really appreciate all of this feedback! Brendan and I want to address some of the most common concerns below:Telemetry:
Fig has basic telemetry in order to help us make product decisions. We currently give the you option to opt out of all non-essential telemetry by running `fig settings app.disableTelemetry true`. This removes everything except for one daily ping. We use this ping to help us understand how many people were using Fig.Adding this ping was a mistake. We have already removed it and will be pushing this change in our next build (v1.0.43).Business Model:
Under the hood, we&#39;ve built an API layer on top of the terminal. This API lets you create visual apps. Autocomplete is the first app we&#39;ve built using this API. We have many more planned for things like interactive runbooks for SREs and automating deployment workflows. You can see some early prototypes here. [2] We plan to monetize these team-based apps by charging per-seat.Autocomplete will always be free for individuals. We will never sell your data.[0] https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23766980[2] https://withfig.com/videos/old-sizzle-reel.mp4"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very smooth, downloaded it and played around a bit.My first thought is why not use built-in shell autocompletion functions instead of redefining them in JS?Zsh completions are super powerful: https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions/blob/master/zsh...Typing `git a&lt;TAB&gt;` yields this in my terminal:    ~ git add
    add        -- add file contents to index
    am         -- apply patches from a mailbox
    apply      -- apply patch to files and/or to index
    archimport -- import an Arch repository into git
    archive    -- create archive of files from named tree

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My ex-wife Grandmother had spent over 10 years (1964-1975) in Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia as a reporter on the Vietnamese side during the Vietnam War and consecutive conflicts (Vietnamese intervention in Cambodia 1978).She was the first European to walk all length of Ho Chi Minh trail, lived in Saigon undercover during American occupation and wrote couple of books about the Vietnam Wars.She was telling a lot of stories and I remember some people from US visiting her in 90s hoping to use her contacts in order to find some lost American POWs.Unfortunately her books had been not translated into English.https://pl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monika_Warne%C5%84skahttps://www.amazon.com/PFADE-DURCH-DEN-DSCHUNGEL-Vietnam-Rep...https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh_trailhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cambodian%E2%80%93Vietnamese_W..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a software developer in the US with a Vietnamese origin, so I am no historian and my views are probably skewed.I am among the minority Northern Vietnamese people in the US, most Vietnamese people in the Bay Area are (refugees) from the South. People can tell where one comes from with one&#39;s accent. It was undeniable that much suffering and injustice was done for Southern people, especially after the war ended. So many still have a lot of resentments against the Hanoi government in particular and people from the North in general. Some still secretly view Northen international students in the US as red princes and princesses. The truth is far from that, they are just ordinary people looking for a better life. Many of the Northern people also have resentments with the current government as much as anyone else. However, I have to say much of the suffering and conflict is fading. I am so glad that in the last three years I was in the Bay Area, I have made many new Vietnamese friends, and have gone to many Vietnamese-owned shops buying groceries. I have not once had bad experiences with anyone in here. We spoke to each other and caring about each other despite of the differences.When I was a student in the US, I borrowed as many books and DVDs about the Vietnam war I could from the library and began watching to understand where I came from, and what to make of the war. I am still searching for the answer. One thing I began to understand is the reason that the North won the war. The people from the North did have a charismatic leader and more importantly, they had a sense of righteousness and revenge when they participated in the war. I still remember vividly, one day I watched an (American) documentary about a farmer after the 1972 bombing operation. The bomb killed all of his family members and all the pigs he raised and left him with nothing. He cried and vowed to fight till he dies. The guy had lost everything, he had nothing left to lose. That was the moment I realized it was inevitable that the North would inevitably win.I see that pattern a lot in places that talked about the war, for example in the article:&gt;She was only 24 years old but had been widowed twice. Both her husbands were soldiers. I saw her as the embodiment of the ideal guerrilla woman, who’d made great sacrifices for her country.I do not have as much exposure (or at least as much as I wished) to the literature, arts, and music of the South, but I can say that the sense of righteousness while fighting wasn&#39;t as strong in places that I have looked into.My (personal and flawed) conclusion is that it wasn&#39;t the policy, the brainwashing, or the political power of communism, or the help of Russia that made the North win. They won despite despite being poor as hell, they won despite being communist, and they won despite having lost more troops. They won because they took part in the war with a sense of righteousness.By chance, I just revisited the Vietnam war and the scar it left a couple of days ago, how much it matters in my everyday life, and wrote an essay about it on my blog. Here is the blog I wrote a couple of days ago about the war, btw, if you&#39;re so interested: http://www.tnhh.net/posts/lullaby-of-the-artillery.html"</p>

When I throw up an SVG on the web, I don&#39;t want it to contain potentially personally identifiable information."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Inkscape. Taught my self how to use this 15+ years ago. Use it 2-10x per year since.It&#39;s always there. It does not change UI much between releases. I dont have to download a cracked version of some commercial tool because I&#39;m to stingy to buy expensive software for a simple task at hand.Inkscape (and Gimp) have helped me a lot in this regard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used Inkscape last week to convert an SVG vector image to EPS, for insertion into a PDF.The conversion was not perfect. I am using FPDF with an EPS add-on, and after study of the PHP source, I was able to open the EPS with a text editor and reformat it so that it would successfully import.Unfortunately, it loaded upside down, so I was forced to flip and save again in inkscape, then repeat the formatting. This odd behavior is also present in the (downstream) TCPDF library, which appears to have close to the same code.Complain as I may, I didn&#39;t have to buy Adobe Illustrator."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I came here from a news site and they didn&#39;t tell me any of this at all!&gt;&gt; Then perhaps you should stop reading that news site, just like they stopped reading this site after the first 2 paragraphs.Marcan is a genius, in every aspect. He is on my top list of people I could read all day long without getting annoyed.Pretty much everything he posts on Twitter is interesting and curious. I&#39;m a huge fan!The other person I have similar feelings for is Geohot.These guys are really, really smart."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Was this responsibly disclosed?I tried, but I also talked about it on public IRC before I knew it was a bug and not a feature, so I couldn&#39;t do much about that part. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯This whole site is a good read.  A great mix of real information, jokes, and a good send-up of how some security releases appear these days (I understand to a degree the incentives that cause those sites to be as they are, and I don&#39;t think they area all bad, but it&#39;s still good and useful to poke fun them I think)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Wait. Oh no. Some game developer somewhere is going to try to use this as a synchronization primitive, aren&#39;t they. Please don&#39;t. The world has enough cursed code already. Don&#39;t do it. Stop it. Noooooooooooooooo"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At this point AWS has gotten so complex that one has to jump through a dozen hoops to get the simplest of things done.To scale up our reporting I thought it’s a good idea to offload report generation to a lambda function. Read from MySQL, dump into S3 and mail a link to that S3 file, make the link expire after couple of hours. Reasonably simple enough. But by God was it painful!! IAM is a rabbit hole, now later VPC restrictions on top and couple that with terribly organized document it makes no fun at all.I get the need for all those layers of security but without well organized document everyone has to go through the ordeal. What we need now is plethora of how-tos for these common architectural patterns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, author here. I&#39;m so happy to see this appear on HN front page! I almost didn&#39;t post this on HN as I wasn&#39;t sure if there would be interest towards a site like this. I spent so many hours tinkering with the UI and crafting questions that I&#39;m happy to see that people are finding value in it :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well done! Thanks for those who needs to pass AWS Certs.But on another side after checking few flashcards it seems you will turn into an AWS Marketing Parrot, more than really learning skills (Eg: question about AWS Shield)"</p>
