								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember when Rails first was released. I kept the source code for Ruby and for Rails handy, and it was sort-of possible to wrap my head around both. One of the most fun non-AI conferences that I ever went to was Merb Camp in San Diego where the Merb team announced merging with Rails.I have such good memories of the four or five years when Ruby was my main driver. Great job by Matz and core team with the 3.0 release.I have gone back to my 1980s roots and now once gain use Common Lisp as my main driver, except for deep learning where I need to use Python (tried Julia and Swift).I think Matz has it exactly right. As programmers it is important to be happy using a language. Life should be fun most of the time, and there is nothing wrong with trying to optimize life for maximum joy we bring to ourselves and other people.BTW, happy holidays!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I owe my career and livelihood to Ruby, Rails and the community. When I started learning programming I was overwhelmed because of c, c++ and JavaScript. Tried a bit of Python too. 
I thought I would never get a hold of any programming language ever. One day I tried this mysterious language from Japan(That&#39;s how I knew Ruby at the time) on tryruby.org. Ruby was breath of a fresh air. Code read like English. I was making small CLIs which required so much work in every other language. That was enough to get me hooked. Then I learned about Rails and never looked back.
Happy to see this language making new strides with this release. This is a thank you note to Matz and the community."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been working as a developer for9 years. For most of that time I gravitated toward the DevOps/SRE/Platform niche because I care about quality, but the process of developing resilient, maintainable and clean code in all the languages I had used seriously (PHP, Python, JavaScript, C, Go) just didn’t work with my mind. I couldn’t wrap my head around it and make myself apply the discipline.A year ago I was dropped in as the lead on a large Ruby project. Suddenly everything clicked. Now all the reading I’ve done on domain driven design and TDD actually has meaning and I’ve written more solid code in a year than the rest of my career combined.And on top of that, while every corner of tech has its toxic personalities, the Ruby community is overwhelmingly friendly, welcoming and mature."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Too bad, maps.me was by far the best maps application for non city use, and ideal for hiking. Commendable initiative to bring it back in its original version!A few examples of why it was so great:Simple, non social bookmarks. As in: place a bookmark so you don&#39;t get lost while hiking, or when you find a nice spot you want to come back to later. Yep, a utility feature that doesn&#39;t somehow map to some stoopid business OKR in advertising. I am sure this is possible with Google maps or Apple maps somehow, but only after you&#39;ve created an account, logged in, and made sure you have the equivalent of a South Korean inner city internet connection.Also, easily downloadable maps that just stay on your phone. I am hiking, I don&#39;t have internet and need the map on my phone. 
I know Google Maps allows you to do that but it is tedious unlike maps.me, which is instant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is an existing f-droid version of Maps.me [1] and this looks like a separate effort. Despite having access to the source code, map hosting is a non-trivial problem [2].[1]: https://gitlab.com/axet/omim[2]: https://gitlab.com/axet/omim/-/issues/176"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t have much simpathy for MapsWithMe: they were illegally using OpenStreetMap data by not providing attribution[2] to the project and never complied.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One time when I was younger, in my late teens, I was walking through the city around 8pm. I suddenly felt rather cold, and went through the typical 15 seconds of internal grumbling. I then had an epiphany, and walked into a nearby department store to purchase a jacket. Somehow I&#39;d never even considered that as a possibility previously.As silly as it may seem, I use that singular point in time as the reference for when I commenced adulthood. I&#39;ve got no idea if others have similar experiences (I grew up very poor, so I was probably primed against the idea of spontaneously buying something to begin with), but the contents of this list seems to be very much in the same vein."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of an old video of Steve Jobs. His idea is simple, but it&#39;s really powerful. In short: the world is something you can change, not merely participate in.When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money.That’s a very limited life. Life can be much broader, once you discover one simple fact, and that is that everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.And the minute that you understand that you can poke life and actually something will, you know if you push in, something will pop out the other side, that you can change it, you can mold it. That’s maybe the most important thing. It’s to shake off this erroneous notion that life is there and you’re just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it.I think that’s very important and however, you learn that, once you learn it, you’ll want to change life and make it better, cause it’s kind of messed up, in a lot of ways. Once you learn that, you’ll never be the same again.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYfNvmF0Bqw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An astonishing amount of this list amounts to “spend money”, so while these things may play well here I think it’s worth pointing out that a large majority of the population is not allowed to do those things because they can’t afford to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"People don&#39;t realize that a day 1 &#34;pop&#34; in share price of an IPO (sometimes 100% or more, like some of the recent ones) benefits only wall street, not the company itself. Big banks are, therefore, incentivized to underprice IPOs as much as they can get away with. And employees themselves are subject to long lockup periods. With the recent success of direct listings, cutting them out of the process is a logical step."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find myself aligning closely with Bill Gurley on this since it sure seems like Wall St. is just siphoning value off of their mispricing of tech IPOs. Bill&#39;s been a huge advocate of change and he&#39;s really enthusiastic about this, so seems like a really positive change:https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1341438991401242625.htmlEdited with threadreader link: Thanks toomuchtodo"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not really an AirDrop equivalent if it requires you to be on the same network. AirDrop is really useful when you&#39;re out and about somewhere and you want to send someone a file. In those cases there&#39;s possibly not a WiFi available or in the case of visitors to your home; only you are on the network, not your friend. So I would not see the point of using this instead of AirDrop unless you have to send a file to someone using Android."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You are known as Azure BugOk, that’s cute.I would perhaps delay showing the funny name until at least one other machine is detected, it makes it feel like my name is being broadcast over the public Internet for anyone to connect to, and not just a LAN connection, the way it is.But worked perfectly for me to send a few photos back and forth.LAN connections seem like the perfect application for WebRTC not having to deal with TURN or STUN.It is a bit unnerving that there’s no permission request before being able to do network discovery on the LAN however.How is one machine finding the other? Central server matching the public IP used to then share their private IP? Or does WebRTC provide a discovery service?Edit: Ok, Looking at the server code [1] there is indeed a “room” per public IP and the server passes messages between peers in the same room.[1] - https://github.com/RobinLinus/snapdrop/blob/master/server/in..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jeremy Howard&#39;s &#34;I Like Notebooks&#34; JupyterCon 2020 TalkHoward makes the case for why even &#34;real&#34; programmers should give notebook environments a chance. In addition to supporting literate programming (&#34;code as literature&#34;) and exploratory programming (&#34;code as scientific notebook&#34;) in a live coding environment, Howard explains how notebooks can improve documentation, learning and sharing, testing, and deployment. And add-ins and tools, like Howard&#39;s own nbdev, can help address what&#39;s missing in Jupyter Notebook. As an example, Howard notes how fastdoc even enabled him to write and publish &#34;Deep Learning for Coders with Fastai and PyTorch: AI Applications Without a PhD using Jupyter Notebooks.&#34; Excellent, inspiring talk!Jeremy Howard - Creating delightful libraries and books with nbdev and fastdoc | JupyterCon 2020

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a UI/UX agency that focusses on B2B SaaS, I’ve always found Fantasy UIs fascinating. It’s the complete opposite of the simple &amp; clean interfaces clients ask us to design.I’ve spent some time thinking about why these Fantasy UIs are so fascinating despite the fact they seem not very user friendly.My conclusion was that fantasy Interfaces are very much like the early web. Lots of moving parts (dancing banana gifs) and you had to figure out the navigation on each website you visited. Today, everything looks and feels the same and we lost the creative spirit of interface building.Figuring out the interface might not be best practice. But at the same time, I remember sharing websites with friends purely based on how fun the navigation and overall controls were.We lost the Art of interface building and turned it into a complete science. There are arguments for both sides.My wish is that... Hopefully.. one day, someone will contact us with a project that allows us to build the first fantasy UI for a real-world SaaS product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fantasy UI of Neon Genesis Evangelion[1,2] left a deep impression on me when I watched the original series for the first time. And, in my opinion, it has aged very well.[1]: https://imgur.com/a/PF3oA[2]: https://imgur.com/a/uDeBs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The single biggest common denominator between so many fantasy UIs, is transparent (HUD-style) interfaces. I was just watching the latest episode of The Expanse, last night, and saw them all using these transparent PDA/phones.Ever try using a transparent UI? It&#39;s absolutely maddening.Looks cool on the screen, but is pretty much unusable IRL."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looking up who Roderick Colenbrander is (person who submitted the patch over at https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/linux-input/patch/20201...), it seems they are the &#34;Director of Hardware &amp; Systems Engineering&#34; over at Sony. I&#39;d expect them to spend time on more higher-level things, but seems here they either was involved with actually writing the driver, and/or are just the public face for the patch. Seems unusual though. Kudos if directors at Sony still get to write code, especially low-level code like this.Edit: Seems there is more details in a almost year old article on phoronix (https://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=Sony-HID...):&gt; Roderick Colenbrander of Sony who serves as their Directory of Hardware &amp; Systems Engineering, chimed in on the matter of adding this Gasia controller support (And, yes, this is the same Roderick Colenbrander who in his spare time serves as a Wine developer and if going back to the early 2000&#39;s was the NVClock NVIDIA overclocking tool developer as opposed to being some eager Sony employee):So seems Roderick is a true hacker! I&#39;ve used both Wine and NVClock in the past so if you&#39;re around here, thanks for your work on all these things and upstreaming them as well! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still remember that I connected a PS4 controller a few years ago to test a unity game that I was making. I typed apt search ps4 but could not find something so I pressed some buttons and magicly the UI changed. It all just worked no setup no nothing. I also used the controller on windows 10 but you had to use the xbox driver with special software to map the controls to that driver. The fact that everything just worked on linux amazes me to this day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sony support PS4 and PS5 remote play on Android, so having Linux support for their controllers makes sense (the PS4 controller driver is in Android 10, but DualSense controllers aren&#39;t supported there yet)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me YouTube recommendations are not toxic, they are so amazing I some times wonder how comes the world around is not heaven when everybody has free access to this.That&#39;s because I always watch high-quality educational content and some beautiful comforting and inspiring music. So for me YouTube is a fountain of knowledge, visual and musical aesthetics etc. Every day I get inspiration, healthy kind of fun and learn something cool, useful and healthy.But people who watch stupid and destructive stuff (even once) are doomed because they are going to get the same and worse kind of content recommended over and over. This is a particularly underestimated social problem indeed.That&#39;s why I recommend to avoid signing-in into YouTube. Better watch anonymously so you can always clean the cookies and get out of the pit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know I&#39;m old but dang for some reason I really dislike recommendations from almost any company.For media I grew up in the 70s and had the TV Guide. I&#39;d look through to see what I wanted to watch, circle some things and then watch. No spying what-so-ever.So, I like for example HN where AFAIK I&#39;m not tracked so much and I choose what I want from the top of the list.Conversely I mostly hate Amazon, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Spotify, Youtube, Twitter, Instagram, and all the ad services and any other service that uses some algorithm to decide what to put in my face.It&#39;s to the point that 3 out 4 time I&#39;ll open videos in private windows so they don&#39;t get added to my profile and used for recommendations.I don&#39;t mind going to a tech sight and seeing ads for tech or a car site and seeing ads for cars. Do mind visiting an apartment listing site and then going around the net and having every other sight shove ads for apartments in my face."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want a glimpse of the average person&#39;s youtube experience, open the site in incognito and go to the &#34;trending&#34; tab.It&#39;s a completely different site depending on what you initially search for when you start using it.The problem is, 80% of youtube userbase never really typed a search query for anything in the first place, and as a result the stuff they get recommended and watch is pure shit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m dumbfounded why Microsoft can&#39;t fix this, it&#39;s essentially just a parameter validation issue. They must have some ghoulish software actually relying on the broken behavior.Add to that their recklessly incompetent initial fix:https://twitter.com/maddiestone/status/1341781306766573568"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be some confusion in the comments about the nature of this exploit.This exploit is a kind of sandbox escape. It allow a low integrity process to run code as a medium (aka normal) integrity process. The exploit runs `splwow64.exe` which explorer &#34;helpfully&#34; auto elevates to medium integrity. The exploit then tricks `splwow64.exe` into running arbitrary code.It does not grant admin privileges.In practice this vulnerability isn&#39;t that scary on its own. Sandboxes don&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t) rely solely on this form of mandatory access control for their security. However this attack could be used as part of a chain of exploits in ored to escape a sandbox."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In May, Kaspersky (@oct0xor) discovered CVE-2020-0986 in Windows splwow64 was exploited itw as a 0day. Microsoft released a patch in June, but that patch didnt fix the vuln. After reporting that bad fix in Sept under a 90day deadline, it&#39;s still not fixed.https://twitter.com/maddiestone/status/1341781305126612995"</p>
