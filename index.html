								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve never thought to do something like this as a way to detect whether or not js is being used.    &lt;html lang=&#34;en&#34; class=&#34;no-js&#34;&gt;

    ...

    &lt;script type=&#34;module&#34;&gt;
      document.documentElement.classList.remove(&#39;no-js&#39;);
      document.documentElement.classList.add(&#39;js&#39;);
    &lt;/script&gt;

It&#39;s so simple but so effective. Will be copying that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few notes:&gt; It must come before the &lt;title&gt; element to avoid faulty characters in the page title.This isn’t quite true. Rather, any meta element declaraing a charset should occur within the first 1024 bytes, or it may be ignored.———Print styles: you might think that putting print styles in a separate file would let the browser not load them unless the user actually seeks to print, but in practice browsers load all stylesheets, even for media queries that will never match. I think this may be for fingerprinting reasons, but I don’t truly know. In the distant past (maybe a decade ago), print stylesheets would block rendering while they loaded in most browsers. No idea whether they still do, but I’d guess (uneducated) that they may be deferred a bit now.In light of all this, I generally recommend a small @media print { … } block in your existing stylesheet, rather than a separate print stylesheet file.———The favicon prefers-color-scheme thing: don’t put too much weight on this, it doesn’t actually do what people are commonly saying it does: there is only a slight correlation between prefers-color-scheme and the colour the favicon is rendered atop. prefers-color-scheme is for content, not chrome. If I recall correctly, Chrome’s incognito mode renders the tab bar dark; and in Firefox the concept of browser theme (light/dark/all kinds of custom) is completely separate from prefers-color-scheme—so I have dark browser chrome but light content.Understand that the favicon could be being rendered atop anything at all. Any solid colour, any image, anything. Very light and very dark greys are the most common colours for them to be rendered against, but you want to make it so that your favicon is at least not horrifically bad on any background."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you wanna get real fancy, you could replace    document.documentElement.classList.remove(&#39;no-js&#39;);
    document.documentElement.classList.add(&#39;js&#39;);

with    document.documentElement.classList.replace(&#39;no-js&#39;, &#39;js&#39;);

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is big news, because it shows that Google will permanently yank your Android app if your website violates AdSense&#39;s secret fraud detector! If you&#39;re running Google AdSense ads and you have an Android app that you care about, take down the ads immediately and switch to another vendor.AdSense is the product where Google pays you for running banner ads; they can and frequently do kick people off of it for secret reasons. When my company was kicked off of AdSense back in 2010, I wrote about it extensively. https://www.choiceofgames.com/2010/08/were-banned-from-googl...Google will never tell you why they ban people from AdSense, and there&#39;s no effective way to appeal. (They have an &#34;appeal&#34; process, but what are you supposed to write in the appeal when the charges against you are secret?!)At least we can still publish Android apps, right? (We now run Facebook ads instead.)But Google&#39;s email to DroidScript saying that the DroidScript app was removed from Google Play Store for &#34;Ad Fraud&#34; says otherwise.    Publishing status: Suspended

    Your app has been suspended and removed due to a policy violation.
    Reasons of violation
    APK:206 Ad Fraud
    App violates Ad Fraud policy.

Surely Google could have just revoked DroidScript&#39;s access to Google ads, while allowing DroidScript to ship on the store, like they did for us.If Google ever yanked our Android app over &#34;ad fraud,&#34; we&#39;d have no recourse. We&#39;ve appealed our AdSense rejection a dozen times over the last 10 years and we always get a form letter rejection. We have no idea what they think we did wrong, and we never will, so we can never fix it.Thank god we don&#39;t run AdSense ads anymore. Based on this, I never want to run them again!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a lot about the sexual events in this post that, to me, highlights something I feel is important which is: we parents need to get better had having conversations with our children around sex.This girl was feeling uncomfortable and crying but at the same time &#34;didn&#39;t think those behaviors were problematic&#34;.  I can&#39;t help but wonder if her parents never sat her down and discussed situations like this and, I get it.  That&#39;s a really uncomfortable conversation to have with your child.  It is, however, an important one.This doesn&#39;t just apply to girls by the way.  We parents need to be telling our sons what kind of behavior is and isn&#39;t acceptable.  It&#39;s not enough to expect them to figure it out.  Who are they figuring it out from if not us?  Probably other inexperienced boys.Please don&#39;t rush to put words in my mouth by thinking I am suggesting the guy in the article is innocent of the accusations.  I&#39;m making no commentary on either party from this article.  That&#39;s for the courts to decide should one or both parties choose to take that course of action.I&#39;m simply saying it is important that parents overcome their discomfort around discussions of sex with their children so that the children can make informed decisions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"General PSA from someone who has studied such things:1. Alcohol is the number one date rape drug and it&#39;s problematic in part because men tend to have a much higher tolerance than women.2. Date rape frequently involves two people from different cultures with different social expectations. This often fosters terrible misunderstandings.3. It&#39;s always problematic to &#34;try a case&#34; in the court of public opinion. Probably better to try to use a piece like this as a jumping off point for general discussion of the problem space and not an attempt to determine what &#34;really&#34; happened in this instance.4. It&#39;s good to think about what women can do differently to try to protect themselves. Trying to talk about that is not, per se, blaming the victim anymore than it is blaming the victim to say &#34;It&#39;s a bad neighborhood. Make sure you lock your car.&#34;5. When someone is a habitual offender and genuinely a predator, their victim can do all the right things and still get assaulted.6. Whether a woman did or did not do all the right things, a man choosing to assault her is still on him, just like you are still a thief even if someone failed to lock their car."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"first, a small rant:
tbf. I dislike the title.
the real title is sexual harassment from Jon Pretty a leader of certain Scala Community standups.because the current title actually sounds like it&#39;s the whole commnity, but the blog is about a specific guy.---second I really do not understand, how other people can be so horrible. he basically abused her in a moment where she was really really desperate and I think such a thing is really really bad."</p>

In order to get the system log, you need root or adb. At that point you can just log GPS directly, inject code straight into the COVID tracking app, etc. All bets are off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s a little surprising how much effort went into things early in the pandemic that didn’t pan out.Official contact tracing in the US is a complete dud and had negligible impact on the spread. People informing their fiends/family “hey I just got Covid you should probably test/isolate” was what practically can make a difference.Ventilators were the critical thing until we realized they were a very sub optimal treatment.All the surface cleaning was a massive waste too... and the chemicals used in some places destroyed a bunch of furniture.Masks, fresh air, don’t go out when sick or after close contact with someone when sick. Simpler things that make the most difference."</p>

Typically, they’ve followed a sort of six-month tick-tock pattern for the A-series, launching a new major revision in the fall with the new iPhone, and launching an “X” revision in the spring with new iPads.I think most observers have been expecting an “M1X” for Apple&#39;s first pro-oriented ARM Macs, so an M2 already would be a surprise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m confused as to why this headline has to be so close to clickbait. I&#39;m not even one to stand up for people like Lambda, I think a lot of bootcamps are shady at best, and actively deceptive at worst (Trilogy).It is definitely important to note that that these loans can be discharged in bankruptcy. But as far as I know, isn&#39;t this less stringent than typical student loans, which can&#39;t be discharged in bankruptcy? Is the point here that there was a population of Lambda students who weren&#39;t aware they could discharge their loan, and this contract prevision was preventing them from doing so? Or was the school deliberately making that process more difficult? The article makes none of that entirely clear.On the whole this doesn&#39;t scream &#34;deceptive educational financing practices&#34; to me. That sounds like a government agency press release making a mountain out of a molehill and trying to knock Lambda down a peg, but I might be wrong.Edit: after reading how dischargeability impacts people&#39;s ability to take out the loan in the first place, yeah, this matters quite a bit, and I was wrong because I didn&#39;t understand how education financing works. I&#39;ll own that. Seems Lambda was being less than equitable in how they approached the matter, and hoping no one would notice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It makes me sad that many of the prominent boot-camps now have such a bad reputation, and seem to be run so poorly, or recklessly.I feel lucky to have enrolled at, now defunct, The Iron Yard at it’s peak in the end of 2016. I owe them everything for teaching me and coaching me into how to break into my new career as a web developer. It was life changing.I can only speak for my particular campus, but I imagine it was similar at every other location. Never once, starting from my first interview, did they mislead me or make empty promises. They never guaranteed us anything.They basically said, “You’re going to pay us $15K for 3 months, and it’s going to be one of the hardest things you’ve ever done. We can’t guarantee you a job but we will do our damndest to teach you &amp; help you navigate the application process.”And I still respect them for that. The people there were super smart and amazing mentors. The onus was always put on us to work our asses of and make our dream of being a coder come true on our own accord. RIP The Iron Yard.I hate reading stories about Lambda and others, and reports from students who got chewed up and spit out by the system. They give ‘boot camps’ a bad name, and I’m hopeful soon there will be a school who rises to the top and will be as upstanding as the people I worked with. Someone needs to give coding bootcamps a good name again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wanted to clarify two things, since I saw some confusion.The law changed to make a deceptive statement about what can and can&#39;t be discharged in bankruptcy illegal, but it was always false to say that it couldn&#39;t be discharged in bankruptcy, even before the law changed.This isn&#39;t a new California department, it&#39;s the old DBO under a new name as the DFPI, with enhanced powers to regulate financial matters that were previously unregulated and protect Californians against unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices. Basically there have been lots of innovative financial agreements that weren&#39;t well regulated under California law. They also weren&#39;t well regulated federally, but that&#39;s a whole other issue.More info on the law here.https://dfpi.ca.gov/california-consumer-financial-protection..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Maybe I&#39;m biased (I certainly use powerful-ish machines, so maybe I&#39;m not the target market), but I genuinely can&#39;t relate when people on here talk about the web being slow as a category.Sometimes a heavy web-app like Twitter will be slow on first load, but Mighty wouldn&#39;t help with network speed, right?Slack is slow because it&#39;s slow to load actual conversation data; the iOS app is just as slow as the Electron app. This is not UI jank; it&#39;s a slow API and/or insufficient prefetching.Jira is slow because it sucks; I&#39;ve used native apps that are slow because they suck.Other than that, I don&#39;t have many relevant experiences to point to. I&#39;m sure for people running older machines the picture is different (the state of web engineering as a whole could certainly be improved on several dimensions), but I also doubt people stuck using slow computers can afford to spend $30-$50/month on something like this.I&#39;m genuinely asking: what things are slow for you? Is it just the fact that the code has to load before it can request the data (or render anything) that makes it feel slow? Or is there genuine sluggishness? What web apps are you using that I&#39;m not?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fact that a web email client (gmail) can turn the fan on when it’s mostly text and runs in a VM written and published by the same company that wrote the email client just makes my head spin.And the solution to this is to put the browser in the cloud? So what’s the desktop browser on your new $3,000 mbp now, like... a demo environment?It boggles my mind that we’re not demanding the web bloat stop. Maybe figma just doesn’t really work as a web app! If I have to run my browser in a datacenter, I think it’s fair to say it doesn’t.As a web dev I’m just embarrassed. How are we not saying “this is too much, stop making web apps that crash my computer it’s not worth it.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"$30-50/month is a wild price point for this. Who is going to pay that? It feels too expensive both for enterprise (existing remote desktop solutions run about half the cost) and for end-users.I worked on a similar solution to this and we had a price point of $5/month per user...EDIT: 16GB of RAM and 16vCPUs. What a weird balancing of resources. Chrome is typically memory bound, not CPU bound. This also explains why it would be so wildly expensive compared to anything else out there.EDIT2: A lot of the replies I&#39;m getting seem to think my implication here is that no one would pay for this or it would be easier for people to build this themselves. I&#39;m not saying that at all, I&#39;m just critiquing the price point. There&#39;s huge market demand for browser isolation, I&#39;ve worked on products in that field, I just haven&#39;t encountered any customers willing to pay $30-50/month for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the end this makes sense; an actual car company is much better positioned to actually profit from marginal improvements in self-driving (read: safety improvements) year over year, rather than wait for the windfall of FSD taxi service at some unknown point in the future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m impressed by how clear the article is for a layman. I only know the very basics of graph theory and Ramsay theory and I understood the topic perfectly. This is in comparison to the paper [1] which at a glance seems terse and difficult to understand.If anyone likes Ramsay theory and these kind of articles, I recommend Erdős&#39; biography &#34;The Man Who Loved Only Numbers&#34;.[1] https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.04994"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Question for people knowledgable about Ramsey theory - with current computing tech, will we ever be able to find the exact value of R(5,5) within our lifetimes?I&#39;ve read the famous Erdos quote about R(5,5) vs R(6,6) and he seemed to think that it was at least theoretically possible if the whole human race had to find it quickly or face destruction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;... if the room has at least six people, you can say something about them with absolute mathematical certainty... [that it contains] either a group of three who all know each other, or a group of three who have never met.Maybe I&#39;m incredibly dense, but this seems tautologically true, and not worth mentioning. Could somebody kindly explain what I&#39;m missing?"</p>
