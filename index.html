								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey cool, this is my project. Happy to answer questions.Edit: I am also looking for a new opportunity. If you need a good Staff/Principal Engineer, check out my resume here: https://heckel.io/resume.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclaimer: I know the developer of Ntfy and have worked with them in the past.I love this tool because it sits in a very convenient place in the alerting and monitoring stack.At work the kind of alerting pipelines and frameworks needed can by necessity end up being nontrivial and somewhat sophisticated. If you run some stuff at home or in the cloud or whatever, I have often wanted some kind of simple alerting but never want to deal with mocking out similar systems that I&#39;ve built at work.Ntfy sits perfectly in this space, and I&#39;ve used to to frame out my own kind of micro-alerting frameworks for a bunch of stuff that I run. It&#39;s incredibly easy to encapsulate in something like a bash TRAP or even || conditionals on random cronjobs, and just makes getting some kind of alerting so trivial. As such, it&#39;s spiraled out into a lot of different stuff that I run."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this project. Super simple to interface with, accomplishes the task very well, reliable, good documentation. It&#39;s hard to think of better design and execution for this type of utility.I use it to get notifications of the CI running on build.wireguard.com, which took less than a minute to get working. Sometimes I&#39;ll use it for random one-off notifications, like when a command finishes running or some shell script sleep-loop scraper finds what it was waiting for. It&#39;s the nicest thing I&#39;ve had for that kind of thing since mytelephonenumber@txt.att.net."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I get a lot more mileage out of &#34;have you tried...&#34; than &#34;why don&#39;t you just...&#34;.As a recent example, I wrote a system that auto-generates PDF packing slips from an order form, to send to a warehouse for picking and packing.Yesterday a client told me to &#34;just make it landscape&#34; while I was explaining why &#34;just making it landscape&#34; won&#39;t solve the problem of giving the warehouse whitespace to pencil stuff in, because even though &#34;just making it landscape&#34; solves this same problem in Excel, when the client was sending out Excel files as packing slips... the current system is not Excel&#34;.I couldn&#39;t find a way to get the client to get from &#34;just make it landscape&#34; to listening to me ask &#34;what is the warehouse actually trying to pencil in?&#34; and &#34;how much space do they need? Are they penciling in notes globally at the top of the document or on a line-item basis next to each SKU?&#34;To the client I was wasting their time because &#34;just make it landscape&#34;.Needless to say working with this client is challenging on an interpersonal level. The work itself is fun though, and it&#39;s improving my EQ handling a client like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Alternatively, if you’re not fit for work, then don’t be at work?I mean, at what point is it over the line to be useless at a job you’ve agreed to do, and that you demonstrated competence for and interviewed for?Many times I’ve said things like “just restart the cronjob for this” or “just tag this issue to so-and-so if you can’t get it, they wrote the original” etc.I’m all for taking care of yourself, but if you can’t handle the literal word “just” then maybe there’s bigger issues riding on your shoulders than my vocabulary.These types of article are alienating to me, a bit. I’ve lead teams in government sector contracts, private mil, *-int, and many different analytical capacities and I’ve never heard someone criticize me for saying “just restart rstudio” or “just put a cache in and tag the issue to me for later”.Truly bizarre. I don’t think the youth are this soft. The young folks I work with, granted are graduate age and older for the most part, are often very cordial and respectful and slick. Occasionally I see some hangovers, some sick calls, some romance drama, the usual bullshit, but never anything as microscopic as this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the case of helping someone with a technical problem, as author notes. words like &#39;simply&#39;, &#39;merely, &#39;just&#39; are downplaying the person&#39;s efforts and inherently cause unnecessary strife, discouragement, resentment, etc.  Sometimes, letting them work through it for a while longer on their own is the better course.In the situation where help is clearly needed, &#39;let&#39;s consider possible solutions&#39; is a better entry point, along with &#39;let&#39;s ensure we don&#39;t make it worse&#39; - i.e. take a snapshot of the current situation, store the current working file, etc.  Now you&#39;ve gone into a collaborative situation, and if there&#39;s a solution the person will feel like they&#39;ve been a part of it, not like they&#39;re an idiot who should have been able to figure it out on their own.  Makes for a much better working environment, better morale, sense of being on the team, etc.For the person on the other end, the person who needs help, this is where keeping a log of your activities (in the lab world, this means a detailed and updated lab notebook, maybe a logging app of some kind for programming), so if someone asks the (sometimes irritating) question of &#39;what have you tried already&#39; you can just point them to it.For the case of seriously depressed people who can&#39;t get out of bed, that&#39;s a bit tougher.  Cup of psychedelic mushroom tea perhaps, plus someone to hold their hand for a few hours?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Binance was threatening to dump a huge amount of FTT tokens on the market. FTX has a big+vulnerable position in FTT. FTX asked Binance to sell them the tokens for a fixed price, so as not to crash the FTT token price. Binance declined - this was yesterday/today. Of course the price of FTT crashed today. And now Binance buys FTX to help them out... smells like Binance played 4D chess all along.https://decrypt.co/113674/binance-moves-to-liquidate-its-ent...https://decrypt.co/113788/binance-ceo-declines-alamedas-bid-...https://decrypt.co/113866/battle-crypto-titans-ends-binance-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some more background: the companies were engaged in fighting over regulations, and on a personal basis between the 2 CEOs. It went down to really childish levels at some point.But one thing is undeniable: SBF (FTX CEO) was trying to weaponize US regulation against his biggest rival CZ (Binance CEO). CZ retaliated by selling the FTT token, exposed the fact FTX was over-leveraged, and took over.This is, as the kids on Twitter say, the embodiment of the old &#34;F#$k around, find out&#34;.Along the way every FTX client who couldn&#39;t withdraw, and every crypto user losing value got screwed - but why should these 2 characters care? The space just became more centralized, and whatever smidge of trust was left after the Celsius debacle has evaporated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was worried about sharing broadly and leaking info from 1 contact to another, but it seems like the Signal team did all the right things here.When you create a story you can make it a group story or not.If you do not make it a group story, reactions and replies to stories get sent to you over your 1:1 chats and not shared across other recipients of the story.If you make it a group story, and share it with multiple groups each group receives their own copy of the story and replies and reactions can only be viewed by others in the same group.After having been burned SO OFTEN by other social platforms embarrassingly notifying others when I did something I thought was a passive post, or leaking information from 1 of my subgroups with another I was very worried that would happen here, but great job signal team!The only awkward part that I&#39;ve noticed so far is if I have a contact in 2 groups that I create 2 group stories with, they now have 2 identical stories show up on their story board.  It makes sense and I think the UI clearly indicates for which group replies and reactions to each story it would go to which is probably the safest (best?) solution, but I could see that getting a little annoying if I share multiple groups with a frequent story poster."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of course my first reaction was &#34;I hate this&#34; but then I thought about it and whatever I don&#39;t care at all. I downloaded the update and it&#39;s a new tab. They don&#39;t force it on you at all. They very very clearly state that you can opt-out and how to do it. This was tastefully done, which is fresh air in the world of social media crapware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My gut reaction to this was disappointment that Signal is working on yet another not-messaging feature a la their crypto integration... But the longer I think about it, the more positive I feel. I actually enjoyed using stories on other social media platforms before I left them. The idea of something similar, but end-to-end encrypted, is actually exciting!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I mean this story is cathartic, but I don&#39;t get what the &#34;rabble rousers&#34; expected to happen. You don&#39;t go into a meeting like that to present problems, but to present solutions. And a 12 month delay on a $60 million contract isn&#39;t a solution, it&#39;s another problem for the sales/client success people. And doing it in front of a group of management, no less - that&#39;s like firing a shot across the bow, declaring that the current PM team is incompetent.It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re right, it matters how you communicate and strategize. This seems to be a skill that many people lack. This sounds like a conversation that should be had with a handful of managers who you can convince to your side, and concoct a plan to stage the product development and release such that it gets done and you don&#39;t cost a giant contract (and people&#39;s jobs).People talk shit about office politics, but sometimes you need to read the room..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I spent about 18 months working on a doomed project. For a lot of that time, I thought I was the only one who realized it was doomed.I had a similar feeling about a project once. I thought &#34;Boy is this stupid. No one in their right mind is going to pay for this. Why are we building this.&#34; Let me manager know my feelings. Stayed and built it.Thing is a huge success. One of our best selling products. Boy do I still feel dumb. Very humbling, honestly. Shows what little I actually know about what people want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah, that freeing feeling. I had that once.I was a new security champion for a team. The product had schema owner SQL injection vulnerabilities on every page we developed. I had a meeting with the department head and explained the whole situation and two remediation options. He chose the third option - do nothing. According to him we have a realtime DB backup. Has it ever been tested? No. Do you have procedures for it? No. How long will it take (15 minutes is the end of the world for this system to be down)? No idea.I walked out with a clear answer in my head and that free feeling. I left for another team. Not my problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been chasing infrasonic ranges in home audio for over 2 decades. You can&#39;t &#34;detect&#34; these frequencies in the normal way. You experience them by way of your physical environment being excited by them. Feeling pressure waves move through whatever you are standing/sitting on can add an entire new dimension to the experience.I used to run experiments with friends and family using a 800L ported subwoofer tuned to ~13Hz with a 40Hz cutoff. Not one person would mistake it for being on vs off. Certain content makes these frequencies substantially more obvious. Classical music performed in large concert halls is one surprising candidate outside of Mission Impossible scenes. Being able to &#34;feel&#34; the original auditorium in your listening room is a very cool effect to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They really should have said &#34;inaudible&#34; rather than undetectable.  It is detectable (as they note)... just not as what we think of as sound. [edit - fix; how did I leave out words?]I don&#39;t know how common this is now, but at one time it was popular in the car audio world to mount &#34;ass shaker&#34; devices to seats to emphasize bass feeling without requiring the space of a normal speaker.  I think cinemas have done this too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not a veteran (though I went through 1.5 year of mandatory service back in my country) but I constantly have nightmares for as long as I could remember. There are nights where I don&#39;t want to go to sleep because the night before I had a particularly disturbing nightmare. Remarkably scary dreams.I&#39;m healthy, exercise nearly ever day. I avoid eating several hours before bedtime.I was diagnosed with GAD (general anxiety disorder) but I don&#39;t take any meds. I&#39;m slowly coming to the realization that my baseline anxiety level is way higher than of the average person. For no apparent reason.It&#39;s frustrating but I&#39;m trying my best to figure out a long term solution.edit: grammar"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that they require you to get a phone and watch through them, its not an app you can drop on your own device.  I saw this thing this morning, and got excited as I have friends with service connected PTSD only to find out the only way to get it is to beg the VA.I should add that this is likely because the FDA approved the whole watch/phone/software as a system and they can&#39;t separate them.  Its crap, but what are you going to do?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love a lot of the innovation going on in the healthcare digital space wrt apps, but this NightWare service reminds me of Sleep.io, which has become a nightmare to try to procure.I&#39;ve been trying for months to get on Sleep.io as I suffer from chronic insomnia, and it has been one of the most frustrating journeys I&#39;ve endeavored upon. They only provide their app to insurance customers that partner with them, there is no option to buy a subscription directly. Despite their marketing and outward &#34;shoot us a message and we&#39;ll help you out&#34; virtue-signaling, you quickly realize that you&#39;re just sending messages into the void. I tried so hard and offered to pay a subscription rate to try the service. Didn&#39;t even get a response.It&#39;s the absolute worst of all worlds: being prevented from being able to use an app that I shouldn&#39;t need to talk to a doctor about or have the correct insurance for is unbelievably frustrating. Stuff like this terrifies me for our future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"How I have waited for this: A simple, accessible library for graph-like data with datalog (also in a statically compiled language, yay). Have even pondered using SWI-prolog for this kind of stuff, but it seems so much nicer to be able to use it embedded in more &#34;normal&#34; types of languages.Looking forward to play with this!The main thing I will be wondering now is how it will scale to really large datasets. Any input on that?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a really impressive piece of work! Congratulations!I note that it appears to be a library, but it&#39;s licensed under the Affero GPL. I believe this means that if I link your library into a program, and if I then allow users to interact with that combined program in any way over a network, then I have to make it possible for users to download the source code to my entire program. Is that your goal here? Were you thinking of some kind of commercial licensing model for people writing server-side apps that use your library?(I&#39;m curious because I&#39;ve been deciding whether or not to roll my own toy Datalog for a permissively-licensed open source Rust project.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is amazing!Have you looked at differential-datalog? It&#39;s rust-based, maintained by VMWare, and has a very rich, well-typed Datalog language. differential-datalog is in-memory only right now, but could be ideal to integrate your graph as a datastore or disk spill cache.https://github.com/vmware/differential-datalog"</p>
