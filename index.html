								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s a beautiful page! I miss sites like this.Though strangely, it seems to disable all of my browser keyboard shortcuts. Even basic ones like going back, selecting the address bar, or changing the zoom level. I assume it&#39;s just listening for all key events, though I didn&#39;t even realize it was possible to override just basic ones.edit: I found the bug! It has a list that&#39;s supposed to contain all possible keycodes, and if all the keys in your shortcut are on it that list it works. But I&#39;m on macOS so my shortcuts all involve the &#34;MetaLeft&#34; or &#34;MetaRight&#34; key and those are missing from the list. Appending those keycodes to the minified array named `ba.G` fixes shortcuts for me!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Voluntary Chapter 11&#34; in Delaware. Figures.That gets them out from bankruptcy in the Bahamas, which is much tougher than US law. The Bahamas still has classic tough bankruptcy laws, where there&#39;s no debtor-in-possession reorganization. It&#39;s straight to liquidation, with a court-appointed receiver in charge.This should be, and may be, converted to a straight liquidation. Chapter 11 can be useful for restarting companies that actually do something, like General Motors. There, much of the value is in the ongoing business. FTX, going forward, has no ongoing business. Lawyers for creditors will be making that argument.Note that Bankman-Fried is still employed by FTX, &#34;assisting&#34;.Current banners at FTX.com: &#34;FTX is currently unable to process withdrawals. We strongly advise against depositing. Deposits of TRX, BTT, JST, SUN, and HT are disabled. All onboarding of new clients has been suspended until further notice.&#34;&#34;We have reached an agreement with Tron to establish a special facility to allow holders of TRX, BTT, JST, SUN, and HT to swap assets from FTX 1:1 to external wallets. This functionality will be enabled at 18:30 UTC, November 10, 2022.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen some comments saying that this is all delayed fallout from the Luna/Terra collapse last spring, it&#39;s just that FTX had the means (its own token that it could pump and move around its own entities) to paper over the hole in its balance sheet until now. Can anyone more familiar with the situation elaborate? How much further will the contagion spread?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some really weird product decisions this year. E.g. they are also hellbent on showing me &#34;shorts&#34; in my search results. I can&#39;t think of a single occasion lately when I didn&#39;t want to see the full description and comments and they make it hard to get directly to the video. Worse still they are applying this &#34;shorts&#34; concept retrospectively to any video that happens to be short in length, meaning I get videos that were never intended for that format by the creator.Fortunately this bookmarklet (which i&#39;ve named &#34;eat my shorts&#34; in my bookmarks) does the job:  javascript:(function()%7Bwindow.location.href %3D window.location.href.replace(%2Fshorts%5C%2F(.*)%2F%2C &#34;watch%3Fv%3D%241&#34;)%7D)()

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s bad enough that they remove the feature, but I&#39;m also honestly puzzled by Google&#39;s communication strategy here. According to the article, Google&#39;s responses to the issue over time have been flipping between all of the following:- it&#39;s an intentional change, they are planning to remove the feature.- there is no change at all, if you don&#39;t see the option, clear your cookies.- it&#39;s a bug and they are currently investigating it.- they have found the bug, fixed the issue and everything is back to normal now. (except users report it isn&#39;t)- it really was an intentional change - but a temporary one, in order to isolate/fix another bug. The other bug got fixed, they reverted the change and everything is back to normal now! (except users still report it isn&#39;t)- they didn&#39;t want to remove the option, but they had to disable it for the time being, because it&#39;s breaking another feature.- the option is somehow gone for good, but they&#39;d consider reimplementing it if there is enough demand.Either Google&#39;s PR department is engaging in russian propaganda levels of gaslighting here or there is enormous chaos going on inside YouTube and no one knows what the other is doing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Second of all, there&#39;s no need to include &#34;window shopping&#34; in our recorded history; this is when you undo a ways, take a look around, then skedaddle out of there back to &#34;the present&#34; without changing anything. This is just a matter of moving information back and forth from undo-stack to redo-stack.Usually the whole reason I might undo for a while is to get back part of something I was working on and merge it into other changes I’ve made since then. I’m curious why the author dismisses this, personally cherry picking old history is my primary workflow with undo. In editors that support the undo history they’re advocating here, like emacs, I’m usually undoing a long way so that I can put something in the clipboard, then redo all the way back and cut-and-paste the previous partial state.It is nice in emacs that typing after undo doesn’t lose my undone edits, that is handy and is a nice little safety net, but it doesn’t actually solve the problem I normally want to solve."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many times I want to undo to a previous state, but then apply again a few of the changes I just reverted, basically cherry-picking from the future (from the redo stack).It would be interesting to be able to see all edits as individual patches/diffs that you can commit/discard individually. Like a mini automatic git inside the editor, automatic in the sense that every &#34;edit&#34; creates a commit, undo/redo move HEAD.This would be entirely optional, you can continue using Undo/Redo as usual, but if you need to do a more complex history operation you can open this &#34;git&#34; view and operate on the edit tree directly.Photoshop has this nice undo panel where you can see individual edits and click your way to the desired point in history:https://www.bwillcreative.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/how...One can imagine such a view in a text editor, where each entry shows a diff of what that step did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Vim has this, it&#39;s :earlier and :laterhttps://vimtricks.com/p/vimtrick-time-travel-in-vim/    :earlier 3 – Undo the last 3 changes
    :earlier 5m – Go back to the state of the file 5 minutes ago
    :later 2 – After undoing something, redo the next 2 changes
    :later 1h – Travel forward through the change history 1 hour

Vim also stores the tree of changes, but it&#39;s a pain to access without plugins."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Big fan of Git style guides in teams. We had one at Thread. It was common for engineers to come in and find we didn&#39;t do rebasing and find it weird, but we took the opinion that history should be exactly what you actually did, not some clean and idealised version of what you wish you had done. There are advantages and disadvantages to this, but having a defined approach was the most important aspect.Also the fact that we didn&#39;t rebase and used merges everywhere was a major contributor to no one ever breaking their git repos, something that git seems notorious for elsewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Modern Git workflow is very simple on its own:1. Your codebase has a `main` branch which is write-protected2. Devs submit changes to `main` from their own branches using PRs3. Devs can do whatever the fuck they want on their own branch4. PRs are merged one at a time5. When merge happens a dev&#39;s PR is squashed into one commit that gets appended to `main`6. If next dev wants to merge their PR with a conflicting change they have to resolve the conflict first and then they merge7. The end result is that `main` is a linear history of all PRs with the time they were committed to the `main` branch i.e., when they could&#39;ve started to break prod.This is a solved problem and it works great in industry. Why break it? If you want interactive rebase then make 2 PRs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMHO the single most important idiot proof of git should be a universal &#34;undo&#34; command.- Committed wrong? Undo- Switched to wrong branch? Undo- Pushed wrong? Undo- Merged wrong? Undo- Wrong reset? UndoThere should be a &#34;idempotent&#34; undo for every action in git. If not, warn the user for possible outcomes.In this way, we can safely learn git via trial &amp; errors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an excellent description of a false sharing perfoance issue, and I wouldn&#39;t envy the work involved in tracking that code down through the JVM. These sorts of issues are common inside the OS kernel itself. Kernels are managing lots of shared resources, and as you add more CPUs, these sorts of issues emerge as bottlenecks. They&#39;re enough of a problem that the perf tool recently got a new sub-command, &#34;perf c2c&#34;, which tries to help identify false sharing (and other cache ping-ponging) issues much quicker.If you&#39;re interested in learning more about this class of issues and the new tool, there was an excellent talk at LPC 2022 by Arnaldo Carvalho de Melo. And as luck would have it, the videos just came out, so I can link it here. In my opinion it was one of the best talks of the conference.https://youtu.be/A23UopXKq6E"</p>

The new recording is then played back and re-recorded, and this process is repeated. Due to the room&#39;s particular size and geometry, certain frequencies of the recording are emphasized while others are attenuated. Eventually the words become unintelligible, replaced by the characteristic resonant frequencies of the room itself.performance recording: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bhtO4DsSazc"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I talk to my Google Home then 50% of my brain power is engaged in predicting and working out how to best phrase something so that the &#34;AI&#34; understands what I mean and the other 50% is used to actually think about what I want to accomplish in the first place. This is just about okay for things like switching lights on/off or requesting a nice song I want to listen to, but I could never be productive programming like this. When I&#39;m in the zone I don&#39;t want to have to waste any mental capacity on supplementing an imperfect AI, I want to be thinking 100% about what I want to code and just let my fingers do the work.For that reason I think this will be less appealing to developers than GitHub may think, otherwise I think it&#39;s a cool idea."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Markdown is a convenient but deeply limited markup language  with only a small subset of html&#39;s features. And yes, limitations are good because we want documents not web apps, etc, etc, but I mean &#34;images can&#39;t have captions&#34; limited, &#34;navigation bars don&#39;t exist&#34; limited. Actual important features of html don&#39;t exist in markdown, which is why almost every markdown platform ends up adding extensions and shortcodes. Why use markdown at all? Just use html.&#34;But html isn&#39;t style-agnostic&#34; yes it is. CSS isn&#39;t style-agnostic. Instead of a markdown browser, how about a browser with a fixed stylesheet and no js? You don&#39;t even need a browser for that, that could just be a userscript that gets plugged into an existing browser. It&#39;d break non-compliant websites that require javascript or custom css, but so would a markdown browser. Most people wouldn&#39;t write content for it, but most people wouldn&#39;t write content for a markdown browser either.&#34;But html is cluttered&#34; it doesn&#39;t have to be. This is a valid webpage:    &lt;!doctype html&gt;

Personally, I prefer writing in markdown, but that&#39;s no reason to insert a markdown renderer into browsers. HTML can already be as sleek and readable as you want. If we added a new type of markup for anybody with a personal preference, we&#39;d never stop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This doesn&#39;t really make sense, for a couple reasons...There are many flavors of markdown. We&#39;d need a standards body, compatibility suites, etc., and for all the browser vendors to adopt it.Meanwhile, markdown is designed to transform to HTML, which browsers already render. Adding a markdown-to-html plugin/step to your web server or publishing process is not exactly the most burdensome thing, relative to everything else it takes to develop, publish, and maintain a site. And it resolves the markdown flavors issue.The thing is, people could choose to publish, simple uncomplicated sites now -- it would be cheap and easy, too. The HTML is barely more complicated than the equivalent markdown, and it would take a few lines of CSS to apply a basic style.The many sites that choose to be complicated, cluttered, and expensive will continue to be so, for the same reasons they are now. Markdown would just be another way to build simple sites, which they don&#39;t want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HTML is already a markup language. You could just as easily make basic websites using HTML and some basic inline CSS.(They’d even have some extra features missing from Markdown that I’d consider still part of a basic content formatting suite like floating or multi-column layouts. They’d even have a defined standard for machine readable metadata!)The problem is that people don’t make websites like that very often, even though they can. This is trying to solve a problem that doesn’t currently exist."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The cycle of building, burning, and rebuilding the Great Digital Libraries of Alexandria (e.g., Napster, Pirate Bay, Demonoid, what.cd, redacted, etc.) has gotten old.At this point I&#39;m inclined to ask-- what would a cypherpunk not do? I.e., let&#39;s remove crypto and magically-dev&#39;ing-ourselves-out-of-holes from the equation.There must be policy wonks here on HN who know the ins and outs of local/state/federal government, copyright law/fair use, etc. (I&#39;m assuming the U.S. IP lobby is the 400 pound gorilla in the room.)What are some good starting points to look for a more robust way out of the problem-- how do we sustainably grow a crowd-sourcable archive for copyrighted digital artifacts? What&#39;s an approach that could eventually be on a referenda or party platform? Does archive.org have any idea? Any other orgs have an idea?There should be a sustainable solution to bootstrapping civic databases to archive and make available/discoverable all the shits citizens care about without waiting 70+ years for it to enter the public domain.It&#39;s absurd as it is now. We&#39;ve got a scientific database duct-taped together by a fucking grad student in hiding, and AFAICT nearly every researcher uses it.What&#39;s the reasonable legislation to say, &#34;As long as the project does X and avoids Y, the project may archive Z&#34; for all digital artifacts Z in some domain?Edit: clarifications"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What.cd was one of the last few truly beautiful communities on the internet (that I know of). It was the best music discovery platform ever, and was what got me into listening to and loving music after years of disillusionment about the state of the industry and the music I&#39;d been previously exposed to. May it rest in peace. At least I still have my favourite hoodie [0].OP, for what it&#39;s worth, your post just inspired me to go make a donation to the EFF.[0]  https://imgur.com/a/FORtyX7"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You&#39;ve stumbled upon a door where your mind is the key. There are none who will lend you guidance; these trials are yours to conquer alone. Entering here will take more than mere logic and strategy, but the criteria are just as hidden as what they reveal. Find yourself, and you will find the very thing hidden behind this page. Beyond here is something like a utopia - beyond here is what.cdThis is a mirage."</p>
