								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://archive.is/egPlc“The research that we’ve seen is that using social apps to connect with other people can have positive mental-health benefits,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg said at a congressional hearing...“We make body image issues worse for one in three teen girls,” said one slide from 2019, summarizing research about teen girls who experience the issues.
“Teens blame Instagram for increases in the rate of anxiety and depression,” said another slide. “This reaction was unprompted and consistent across all groups.”From what researchers said in a March 2020 slide presentation posted to Facebook’s internal message board."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it Facebook / Instagram&#39;s fault or us as a culture? As a culture we adore beauty, wealth, power...Facebook seems to be just a platform where our natural desires can have a play. Facebook hasn&#39;t created this impossible beauty ideal, it was created long long ago by Hollywood and the fashion industry. Facebook just makes it super easy for people to become obsessed with something by &#34;connecting&#34; with it. 
It used to be that 40 years ago you watched some supermodel in a commercial for 20 seconds and she was gone. The novelty with the internet is that now you can follow this supermodel and get dozens of alerts a week about her.
If it&#39;s not Facebook it&#39;s gonna be TikTok or something other platform."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So here&#39;s a potential business model for this: salvage rights.When ships sink, the owner generally still retains ownership of any property. Sometimes the location of the wreck is known. Sometimes it needs to be found. It can cost a lot of money to find a wreck and recover any property.So salvage rights are a principle of maritime law such that whoever does this is entitled to a reward commensurate with the value of the goods recovered (eg 10%).I imagine there are orbital slots that are essentially unusable because of space debris (eg Project West Ford [1]). If orbital slots are sufficiently scarce then these could have value. At some point it may become commercial to spend the effort cleaning up an orbit and making it available. Companies could then be compensated for the value they create this way.I do believe this will still require a dramatic decrease in launch costs, as in orders of magnitude more. But we&#39;ll see.My personal belief (and hope) is that the future of getting into orbit is orbital rings [2]. If so, that completely changes the game because cleaning up an orbit essentially becomes a problem of just holding up a giant &#34;paddle&#34; (for lack of a better word) that is fixed to a point on Earth (essentially) and just letting the debris hit it.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Project_West_Ford[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LMbI6sk-62E"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very skeptical of the technical challenges associated with this problem (business model and financing aside). The amount of delta-v required to perform maneuvers to repeatedly &#34;dock&#34; with different pieces of space junk, and then again to de-orbit is very high. You MIGHT be able to de-orbit on the order of magnitude of ~10 pieces of low-earth orbit debris per mission. Maybe. If you&#39;re really good. And low-earth orbit junk isn&#39;t the major issue since it will de-orbit naturally in a reasonable time-frame. Higher orbit junk is what really matters, and will require much more delta-v to reach, and then again to de-orbit after &#34;docking&#34;.Allow me to blindly speculate here: a space-junk company is going to take one of the two following paths:1) Perform low-earth orbit missions to de-orbit a few pieces here and then there, use the good PR to drive funding (let&#39;s just assume they can make the finances work via getting governments to pay for it or something). It will technically work, but it will only deorbit pieces that would naturally decay anyways at a meaninglessly low-volume. But the PR will be good and regulatory capture will ensure their investors get paid. The real problem will remain.2) Go after the really big pieces in higher orbits. These pieces tend to be well-tracked and aren&#39;t really a large problem, but all the same outcomes in option 1 will occur. Investors will get paid, and of course, the real problem won&#39;t be solved.Maybe I&#39;m being pessimistic, but I see space-junk removal companies largely relying on the general public&#39;s lack of knowledge on how orbits work to drive PR. Maybe Kerbal Space Program 2 will go viral enough to fix that problem? We can only hope"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(Stripe cofounder.)Ugh, apologies. Something very clearly went wrong here and we’re already investigating.Zooming out, a few broader comments:* Unlike most services, Stripe can easily lose very large amounts of money on individual accounts, and thousands of people try to do so every day. We are de facto running a big bug bounty/incentive program for evading our fraudulent user detection systems.* Errors like these happen, which we hate, and we take every single false rejection that we discover seriously, knowing that there’s another founder at the other end of the line. We try to make it easy to get in touch with the humans at Stripe, me included, to maximize the number that we discover and the speed with which we get to remedy them.* When these mistaken rejections happen, it’s usually because the business (inadvertently) clusters strongly with behavior that fraudulent users tend to engage in. Seeking to cloak spending and using virtual cards to mask activity is a common fraudulent pattern. Of course, there are very legitimate reasons to want to do this too (as this case demonstrates).* We actually have an ongoing project to reduce the occurrence of these mistaken rejections by 90% by the end of this year. I think we’ll succeed at it. (They’re already down 50% since earlier this year.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Edwin from Stripe here. (OP, I&#39;ve just sent you an email and we can talk more over there—I&#39;m terribly sorry for the trouble.) I can&#39;t get into too many specifics about an individual business publicly, but unauthorized charges have high potential to be disputed in the near future—and while Stripe itself doesn&#39;t have a dispute threshold, the card networks require businesses to keep disputes low.Although that email in the post was admittedly a template, a human did review the transaction activity and actively sent the email. We&#39;re digging more into exactly what happened here to prevent the confusion from happening again. Over the past few weeks, we&#39;ve been overhauling how we work with businesses in situations like these and are rolling out some meaningful improvements soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went through the same thing.
Some ML algorithm at Stripe randomly classified my business (bog standard WooCommerce/WordPress e-Commerce store selling a single product in low volumes) as a risk and I found that the process for escalating it was Kafkaesque and slow.Switched to Pin Payments[1] shortly after that experience and have never looked back.  Of course, we live in the 2021 century and algorithms will flag issues automatically (I ported my phone number and changed my bank account on the same day, which was fun!), but they&#39;ve always made sure to contact me and resolve the issue within minutes instead of cutting access.  The few times I&#39;ve contacted them, a competent person has both understood the issue and responded to it appropriately and promptly.[1]https://pinpayments.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m gutted on hearing this. I’ve been on one of my regular Norm YouTube binges, and was watching a ton of them just last night. His dedication to comedy was legendary, and his complexity was intriguing.Norm’s fake late gift to Conan for The Tonight Show, given after Conan was leaving, is a great example of his sort of expectation-bending humor.https://youtu.be/uarJj-K4XH4His appearances on The View are legendary examples of his ability to be uncontrolled and play the dumbest guy in the room at the same time while actually being the sharpest. His intentional subversion played off as uninformed is a seemingly one of a kind talent. There are videos of interviews where he describes some of the background to things he did on the show.https://youtu.be/a4ageUPHgnohttps://youtu.be/Z3PP_SWHUQQ“Not everything has a point” just gets me. It’s amazing how the hosts just want to jump from talking point to talking point and just refuse to let the guest actually talk, which Norm really plays off of.And lastly, the moth joke remains a shining example of his anti-jokes.https://youtu.be/jJN9mBRX3uoHis monologues at roasts, awards shows, and the correspondents dinner were examples of not being afraid of anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I literally gasped when I heard this. There is something uniquely sad when one&#39;s favorite comedian passes away.There were many things that made him special, but one thing stands out right now:I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a comedian pursue Truth so rigorously. So much of his comedy was him shining a light on a given topic and giving 100% unflinching attention toward it, even if everyone else wanted to ignore it or &#34;move on&#34;. This often made the &#34;joke&#34; the audience, in that we found ourselves laughing when we thought we shouldn&#39;t be. But why shouldn&#39;t we be laughing? Why shouldn&#39;t we be discussing this? Wait, why is this uncomfortable in the first place? Have I thought about this enough?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Awhile ago I wrote a Python library called LiveStats[1] that computed any percentile for any amount of data using a fixed amount of memory per percentile. It uses an algorithm I found in an old paper[2] called P^2. It uses a polynomial  to find good approximations.The reason I made this was an old Amazon interview question. The question was basically, &#34;Find the median of a huge data set without sorting it,&#34; and the &#34;correct&#34; answer was to have a fixed size sorted buffer and randomly evict items from it and then use the median of the buffer. However, a candidate I was interviewing had a really brilliant insight: if we estimate the median and move it a small amount for each new data point, it would be pretty close. I ended up doing some research on this and found P^2, which is a more sophisticated version of that insight.[1]: https://github.com/cxxr/LiveStats[2]: https://www.cs.wustl.edu/~jain/papers/ftp/psqr.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One way to think about why we tend to use averages instead of medians is that it is related to a really deep theorem in probability: The Central Limit Theorem.But I think we can twist our heads and see in a way that this is backwards. Mathematically, the mean is much easier to work with because it is linear and we can do algebra with it. That&#39;s how we got the Central Limit Theorem. Percentiles and the median, except for symmetric distributions, are not as easy to work with. They involve solving for the inverse of the cumulative function.But in many ways, the median and percentiles are a more relevant and intuitive number to think about. Especially in contexts where linearity is inappropriate!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For some things, you can&#39;t even sensibly measure the mean. For example, if you&#39;re measuring the mean response time for a service, a single failure/timeout makes the mean response time infinite (because 100 years from now the response still hasn&#39;t been received).&#34;Why Averages Suck and Percentiles are Great&#34;:

Preset management is a nightmare, there are so many things that they could do to go forward, but the Sequencer market is stall and hasn&#39;t moved in years.Imagine if they applied something similar to a git versioning system to music projects.... I don&#39;t even know if the VST interface can be used or if it&#39;s licensed somehow from Steinberg.Also consider that there are no good audio drivers for Linux (like Asio for example) so you&#39;re almost forced to stay in windows or Mac...No plug-in or DAW has a CLI...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love to see the cultural differences between korea/japan and the West on the matter of artificial stuff. Whereas in the West people would try to hide fakeness as much as possible, people in the far East have a much more candid view of it.In the West we do understand and like artificiality, but we really want to contain it to the realm of fiction. When some artificiality spills out in the “real” world we raise red flags: “tssk, this temple is not authentic, it burned down 80 years ago and they rebuilt it from scratch”In the East, there is a deep philosophical difference that I would like to understand better - if anyone can point to any reference on that matter? It’s like people have understood that fiction and artificiality are part of our lives, cause people embellish things all the time, and we humans are happy when we believe in things. So instead of being suspicious, they let themselves invaded by artificiality, not unlike the way Western people create emotional connection with novel characters, but in real world situations.And I mean why not? In the West, we get cartoon character-based advertising, we get actor-based advertising. How is AI-based influencer (that doesn’t hide the fact that it’s artificial) is any different? If Tony the Kellogg’s tiger had an instagram account, we’d find it totally normal. Here is the same, except that we just jumped over the uncanny valley.There is a lot to talk about on the subject and doesn’t fit in a hn comment :-)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because it&#39;s a terrible policy prescription.  If natural immunity is acceptable, what proportion of the unvaccinated-uninfected population will just take the risk? Half?  More?Millions of people will just (continue to) take the risk, get sick, go to hospital, and die (in decreasing proportions), incurring substantial personal and social costs along the way.Accepting only vaccination as evidence of protection reduces the size of that risk-taking population, and the concomitant social costs.Should there be a third policy option - accepting test-verified infection and recovery as of _now_ as evidence of protection, but discounting future recoveries?  Based on the observational studies cited all over this thread , probably yes.  Seems like associated costs would be higher though, and the only benefit would be less gnashing of teeth here and elsewhere, so its understandable the CDC isn&#39;t rushing to implement it.Should those people just be allowed to assume the risk?  Not while the costs are predominantly social. Insurance (or tax-payers) pay the financial costs, healthcare workers bear the burden of treating a preventable illness, and we all assume the risk that healthcare resources will be stretched to the point of unavailability.  While risk-takers do pay into the same system, their premiums don&#39;t yet reflect the increased expected costs of their personal choice.  While ICUs often run close to or at capacity in one hospital, rarely do they run close at every hospital in a region, as is happening in the south and will happen elsewhere.  While it would be nice if there were more doctors, nurses and facilities able to treat patients, we&#39;re at war with the army we&#39;ve got."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The answer is pretty simple - the moment authorities start saying &#34;well, natural immunity is probably just as good as vaccination, we&#39;ll accept that as equal to vaccination for passport purposes&#34;, a huge segment of the population who&#39;s on the fence about getting the vaccine might just opt to wait until they&#39;re infected naturally, or, even worse, get infected purposefully (EG, chicken pox parties). Which leads to more deaths and outbreaks.In a perfect world, everyone would understand that getting the vaccine is the appropriate choice of action and we could accept natural immunity from people who were infected before vaccines were available - but unfortunately we&#39;re forced into playing these weird games where authorities have to try to incentivize people who aren&#39;t behaving rationally - which in turn leads to further distrust from people on the fence."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s amazing how far Intel has fallen.The 10nm debacle exposed how far they&#39;ve fallen behind on fabs to the point that they&#39;re outsourcing to TSMC. Like, how humiliating must that be?Intel completely missed the mobile revolution. They had a stake in that race but sold it (ie XScale).Intel&#39;s product segmentation is bewildering. They&#39;ve also kept features &#34;enterprise&#34; only to prop up high server chip prices to the detriment to computing as a whole, most notably ECC support.And on the server front, which I&#39;m sure is what&#39;s keeping them in business now, they face an existential threat in the form of ARM.Intel had clearly shifted to a strategy of extracting as much money as possible from their captive market. I&#39;m not sure price cuts here are necessarily about AMD but more than their previously captive market now has more options in general.How the mighty have fallen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Have been with Intel for almost two decades, I finally moved to AMD for the very first time recently and I&#39;m glad I did. Intel is being called &#34;Toothpaste Company&#34; for a reason. It has deliberately slowed down its innovation since gained performance advantage over AMD with CORE, for over a decade now. Between each iteration, there was not many changes but kept adding fancy instruction sets such as AVX512 useless to most if not all ordinary users. It&#39;s a shame that I bought it actually. But over time I gradually realized that the only occasions I used those fancy stuffs were benching marking new systems. So those fancy things mean nothing to me other than showing off to friends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Intel is NOT competing against AMD only. In the past couple of years, we’ve seen a number of big tech companies developing their own chips. Focusing on AMD would be quite myopic from a strategic pov. This market is only getting more competitive. Either you compete on performance or price."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It makes me sad that FF browser share has continued to decline steadily.  The past couple years of releases have been some its the best in terms of my own UX, since perhaps the Phoenix era.It&#39;s pretty fast these days, the UI is good, has a lot of great extensions and privacy features.I use Brave at work to have a better chrome-based experience with gsuite.  It&#39;s also a fast, excellent browser with good privacy features, built-in ad/tracker blocking and for the time being seems to be user-not-revenue-first.But using a non-free browser feels like a trap to me.  Just as what happened with Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Netscape before, being the middle man between the user and the rest of the internet is just too tempting for any company not to try to leverage for their own advantage.FF hasn&#39;t been always perfect, but for 20 years now they have made a browser that didn&#39;t have a shady corporate agenda.  It feels like the writing is on the wall though.  Even people I know who care about FLOSS are using Chrome as their daily driver these days.Mozilla is great and I hope they continue to focus on building a best-in-class browser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to mention (once again), that Firefox on Android is a huge leap in everyday browsing experience over Chrome - and you should try it if you haven&#39;t. Due to mainly one reason: ad blocker extensions; which aren&#39;t supported on Chrome.Since that&#39;s where most users are, I hope Mozilla will be able to communicate these advantages better. Chrome is arguably better on the desktop for most users, unless they&#39;re in the tiny subset of users who care about privacy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The fact alone that FF is the best-optimized browser for uBlock Origin makes it an easy choice for me.It&#39;s interesting to me that many of my favorite/most used web technologies in the past decade or so have come from individual, non-profit developers just trying to make something useful, free and flying in the face of a lot of legal and industry norms (e.g., gorhill, elbakyan). In my experience, these tend to work best on FF + VPN, or on Tor (built from FF)."</p>
