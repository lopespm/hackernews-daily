								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google had a brilliant advertising business with AdWords originally,  where the ads were simply based on the search term and not a bunch of Orwellian surveillance on the person searching.From the research I&#39;ve seen, all this privacy-invading crap doesn&#39;t even improve ad performance much - it&#39;s small incremental gains at best. And per this article, those gains are clearly coming at the expense of user trust and goodwill, something not reflected in click thru rates and RPM.Here&#39;s hoping we can get past all this invasive retargeting / surveillance / privacy-invading crap and get back to straightforward contextual ads, like car parts ads on a hot rod website - our world would be better for it, and maybe Google could restore a little of its rapidly fading goodwill."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There’s a huge privacy battle on the horizon in tech. The initial scuffles are just the beginning. Google and Facebook’s business models depend deeply on being able to track information that consumers are increasingly unhappy to share. Both companies attempts to diversify their dependency on such info for their revenue have been broadly unsuccessful (Google fiber or a Google car anyone?).Meanwhile the likes of Apple and others are taking a stance of making it increasingly hard for Google and Facebook to do what they want to via updates now advertised as “features” that protect consumers. As these documents highlight Google knows consumers want this privacy and it scares the $&amp;!&amp; out of them. Interesting days ahead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had a string of Google phones going back to the Nexus 5x but, for the very reasons laid out in this article, my next phone will likely be from Apple.  That will be my first Apple product."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;In addition, the researchers are investigating a gel or solution with the engineered peptide to treat hypersensitive teeth. This problem results from weakness in the enamel that makes the underlying dentin and nerves more vulnerable to heat or cold. Most common products currently on the market can put a layer of organic material on the tooth and numb nerve endings with potassium nitrate, but the relief is only temporary. The peptide, however, addresses the problem permanently at its source by strengthening the enamel.I want this so badly.I&#39;ve never had a cavity despite my poor dental hygiene habits and lack of dental practice visits but apparently I suffer from bruxism that can make half of my teeth hurt whenever I bite on anything harder than a wet noodle. Just now I brushed my teeth with a pain-numbing toothpaste and just the act of brushing my teeth made them hurt. Although sometimes I can go for some time without pain, it&#39;s been pretty much a constant in my life for the last years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The idea for the lozenge design originated with Deniz Yucesoy, a graduate student in the UW’s Genetically Engineered Materials Science and Engineering Center who received a $100,000 Amazon Catalyst grantThis grad-student/researcher just handed over a multi-million dollar business to Amazon in exchange for $100k towards the research. Why on Earth would anyone sign over 100% ownership of their idea, just to be able to test their idea? I guess he thought it would look good on his resume as begs a company for a job after graduation?Who owns the IP if I join Amazon Catalyst?[1]Amazon Catalyst is a place to see your idea come to fruition without the risk of starting a company on your own. As such, the IP that is developed in Amazon Catalyst is property of Amazon.[1][1] https://catalyst.amazon.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The lozenge produces new enamel that is whiter than what tooth-whitening strips or gels produce.I wonder how white?I&#39;m a bit nervous about having those over-whitened glow-in-the-dark teeth, that you sometimes see. Memories of that Friends episode, too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Estonian here. At Skype (10+ years ago) I observed, that members of large cultures (American, British, Hindu etc.) had real trouble adjusting to the predominantly Estonian-based engineering culture. Probably because they had never had to adjust, commonly people adjust to _their_ culture as it tends to dominate large organizations. But once they did make an honest attempt, that was always most welcomed and gained them a large amount of goodwill. Our US CEO going to a sauna with 20 naked engineers...I’ve also seen the “how are you” thing described in comments unfold.A Hindu pm had the habit of sitting next to developers while they worked, sometimes putting a hand on their knee. After being politely explained  that the size of an Estonian personal space is measured in astronomical units and that this was the reason devs literally scattered upon his approach, he immediately changed his behavior and became great friends with the team.A US lady came to hr complaining about an Ukrainian dev approaching them inappropriately during a party. The hr-person, having witnessed the situation, explained that this was just their way of showing friendly interest and no disrespect was intended. A while later, a Japanese guy came to the hr person complaining the original lady from us had hugged them. Again, it was explained that this is just what Americans do.Cultures are hard and take a lot of mutual respect to work through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Plenty of contribution already,so I&#39;ll just add a personal anecdote. Some years ago I happened to have some beers with a Latvian Russian,who lived here, in London. He tells us that he doesn&#39;t get the Brits. He just doesn&#39;t understand the reasoning in some situations. I ask to elaborate. He says: last year, I had a pretty serious trauma and ended up in a hospital. It&#39;s so bad, pain, lots of tests,etc. And I&#39;m pretty fed up with all of it. Then, one day, a surgeon comes in, says hello and asks me &#39;how are you?&#39;. And I reply: &#39;really bad!&#39;. And suddenly surgeon&#39;s face changes: his eyes start moving faster,he looks at me and then observes the room,then at me again. Then the surgeon,in a slightly panicky voice ask me again: well what&#39;s wrong,is it the food? Is it the nurses? Did they do all the tests? What&#39;s going on?&#39; Then the Russian looks at the doctor and says: well look, I&#39;m in a hospital, I&#39;m ill as hell, I&#39;m in pain and you have the audacity to ask how am I? Are you crazy? It should be pretty clear that it&#39;s definitely not my day! The surgeon goes on to explain the subtleties of the question and etc. At that point I already lived in the UK long enough to understand the doctor&#39;s position but I also found the Russians point to be absolutely hilarious.From personal experience I find the Russians absolutely hilarious even without much smiling (the young ones smile more).They are somehow similar to Italians,who are also hilarious, but as is the case with the Russians, the funniest things tend to be equally tragic too. Kind of a never ending tragicomedy on full blast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am Ukrainian. Came to the US when I was 14. I may never be cool like all the hard looking dudes in movies and whatnot but I smile all the time because either I find something funny in what I’m engaged in or if I don’t that I try to think of it as such. I have always been this way and I can’t imagine not doing it.Also, I have read a few comments in this discussion about how fake American smiles and “how are you?”s are and I have to disagree somewhat. To a large extent Americans use “how are you” and “what’s up” as generic greetings but at the same time you can often tell when someone is using it instead of “hello” vs having 30-120 seconds to chat pretty easily. If my day is going well I make a point of telling the random person I’m interacting with why that is: “I’m doing great. The weather is so nice and I had a lovely cup of coffee on my back porch today.” Quick interaction, mostly meaningless, but to me it’s a nice way to break up the monotony. On the other hand if I’m having a bad day I don’t feel like hiding it but the trick is to not make it the other person’s problem: “I’m getting by. I blew a tire on the way to work and I just had all four tires replaced. But oh well, that’s just how irony works I guess.” Again, quick and simple and not the typical “fine” response. At worst they go “oh that sucks. Paper or plastic?” but more often it could result in a short conversation and I don’t think there is anything wrong with that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can’t wait for electric motorbikes to be more diverse and advanced.I used to be a “my loud exhaust helps me to be seen” kinda guy. Until one day, sat in standstill traffic in my car on the M74 motorway just outside Glasgow, a rider on a BMW S1000XR, with the same loud exhaust as on mine, filtered past the window and I didn’t hear him until he was level with my rear passenger door.Exhausts sound great, i love the sound of a nice engine, it’s utterly intoxicating but it turns out that modern insulated cars block out the noise too well to make them useful as an awareness tool.So, i’m fine with a silent electric bike from a safety point of view. The exhaust noise was a false comfort blanket that deserves no faith put in it as a device to be better seen on the road."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really interesting concept. I like the general lines of the bike. Looks really well thought out/clean sheet mechanical design.Two points of contention:1) 
After putting over 40k+ miles on various bikes, I never once wished there was a self balancing feature to make it stand up on its own. At a stop light; I put my foot down; at a really long stop light, I put the kickstand down.If the self balancing feature can function as form of driver aid. Meaning you declarivity tell the bike &#34;I want this line with this apex&#34;; then the bike will follow through with it&#39;s active systems. That would be wild.2) 
The device right behind the rider gives me goosebumps. In a crash; seems like a great way to break your back and be pinned in the bike.Background data:MechE background. Owned and crashed high CC several motorcycles. I&#39;m doing totally fine healthwise; just really lucky."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this looks great. Straight out of some sci-fi animeI absolutely love motorcycles. Sadly, most people into seem to be in the game just for the sound alone. I have very, very strong feelings about the vast majority of this &#34;community&#34; and cannot wait for electric to take over.Sorry for the rant. I have to endure a lot of racers during all hours. It&#39;s hardly pleasent"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a potential subset of people who don&#39;t know who Richard Feynman is, but might recognise a segment of one his lectures from the movie theatre puzzle in The Witness (the 2016 video game by Jonathan Blow).https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/fml.html#5(The section clipped in The Witness begins at 38 minutes, 34 seconds.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought it would be nice to listen to these with my podcast player on iphone. Here&#39;s my too-complicated process that worked:- in Chrome inspector, look at the network tab when you click play on a Feynman lecture. Right click the mp4 and do &#34;copy as cURL&#34;.- Go to command line (unix style) and paste. Then append to that command line something like &#34;--output flp1.mp4&#34;. That will download the file locally with that file name.- Put the file on Dropbox or something that will get it to your phone.- From dropbox on iphone, share and export the file, then choose your podcast app. The podcast app that worked for me is &#34;Pocket Casts&#34;.- Now in Pocket Casts -&gt; Profile -&gt; Files, you should be able to play the mp4s with nice podcast-style controls and learn physics and be happy!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know what building an MMO is like, having worked on one 10 years ago that was already 10 years old and still exists today (small audience though).Building something like these people are talking about requires more $ than a Marvel superhero movie to get anywhere. We could manage about 100 simultaneous players visible to each other in a reasonable time but no more; the internet is not fast enough to manage more than that many &#34;people&#34; with anything resembling real behavior, even then its hard to maintain the illusion of fluidity with the random latency of so many streams using prediction. Supporting millions of users like these people claim is fantasy even if you only saw a handful. Maintaining state in a single world at that volume is impossible with real people (you can fake a lot of &#34;AI&#34; characters but not actual players). There is reason why most MMO and similar games limit the number of players, or like Eve throttle the game time and slow everything down if too many ships appear in the same place (not possible in a &#34;on ground&#34; sort of world).Also building something of this magnitude and even getting it to do even a small subset of what they want requires people with lots of experience, as this is highly complex and specialized programming, not to mention an enormous amount of art creation, lighting, audio, story and other content, unless you go the No Man&#39;s Sky route and generate everything. But they don&#39;t support huge numbers of&#34;local&#34; players either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been following the DreamWorld saga on YouTube for a hot minute now, mainly because I find it so interesting how they got through the YC vetting process when I myself have applied twice (maybe 3 times) and I also know plenty of people -- brilliant, motivated, entrepreneurial folks -- that applied many (many) times as well and were rejected (YC is mega-competitive after all).IMO, it&#39;s a bit insulting to the struggling startup community at large, and not to mention damaging to the YC brand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was a recent submission saying the same things:DreamWorld (YC W21) MMO raises all red flags - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26898266 - April 2021 (195 comments)I&#39;m not sure what&#39;s driving this, but I&#39;m not inclined to moderate the current thread in any way, even though the title is breaking HN&#39;s rules egregiously, as I explained here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27321926.The reason is that we moderate HN less, not more, when YC or a YC startup is the story: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;qu.... It&#39;s important that when people accuse us of manipulating HN to serve YC—as internet users, you know, kind of do from time to time—we can answer in good conscience (https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...). Taking lumps like this are the price we pay for that. This a low-quality drama story that normally wouldn&#39;t clear the bar for HN&#39;s front page even if it weren&#39;t a quasidupe of a thread from a month ago.Moderating HN less, however, does not mean not moderating it at all—that would be a loophole you could drive a truck through. If and when the story comes up again, we&#39;ll probably start moderating it closer to the standard rules that we&#39;d apply to any similar story: when it&#39;s an ongoing saga, we downweight follow-ups unless there is significant new information. Here are the relevant links about all that in case anyone wants to know:https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;so...https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sor...https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;so..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting to read this here. When my son was born (naturally, normal weight, fully healthy, and around expected due date), the midwife in Denmark had educated us about the Danish way of handling the birth - as soon as the baby comes out, they literally put the baby on mom’s chest, and leave us(parents, and baby) alone in the room for about an hour. Nothing needs to be done other than the baby being in care of it’s parents! They believed it helps the baby form a natural bond, but also acclimate to the outside world better than being whisked away and cleaned.It was such a lovely experience. One of the many things I am thankful to Denmark for.Several things that I was surprised to learn while going through this in DK.1. Childbirth is handled by midwives (Jordemothers) instead of doctors. Doctors are brought only when medication or any treatment is necessary.2. Child birth is considered a natural process and never treated/thought of as a sickness or medical condition. This is reflected in the whole process.3. The social healthcare system works great. It changed my perspective even more. Not having to think about hospital bills or insurance leaves us parents to enjoy the arrival of our little one.4. If everyone in the country, regardless of their current financial condition gets such an experience for their childbirth, I will gladly pay my taxes, and never complain. Healthcare should not be a business imho."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting.Our baby arrived 10 weeks premature and although it wasn&#39;t immediately after birth (as I&#39;ll explain why below), the hospital strongly encouraged the kangaroo care as mentioned in the article, which mom did daily until we could take our baby home.In a week it will be a full year since birth and the baby is in no way behind developmentally compared to other 10 month olds (when adjusting age due to prematurity). So although anecdotal, I can believe this can be a very helpful practice.Due to arriving mid-pandemic and because neither of us had COVID tests prior to the unexpectedly premature birth, we weren&#39;t allowed to visit the baby in the NICU until our tests came back negative, which was about 30 hours later. I wasn&#39;t even allowed to be with mom during delivery, but the doctor did allow me to see the baby for a couple of minutes from a distance and under the proviso that I touched nothing in the NICU (including things like walls, windows, doors, handles, etc).Anyway, somewhat superfluous information at the end there, but it was quite an experience and I&#39;m just happy everything turned out fine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I received the opposite care. Was delivered by C-section, no contact with anyone while in incubation for several weeks. My mother would often tell the story of how she was unable to touch me for weeks after my birth.45 years on and I haven’t a single bond, not with family, not with friends, not even with animals. Like a ghost floating through the world with no attachments and seemingly no compelling interest in them. Active avoidance is on point. But don&#39;t be sad for me. It&#39;s just the way I developed. And the lack of bonding, skin-to-skin contact with my mother is one possible reason.They’ve tried to make a number of diagnoses fit, from autism to Schizoid Personality Disorder, Bipolar to Asperger&#39;s. Nothing. Nothing fits. There&#39;s nothing wrong with me except that I don&#39;t bond, at all.One of the more disturbing experiences was watching what happened to chimpanzees when their mothers were taken away from them after birth (or were denied bonding entirely). They rock back and forth with anxiety; they grapple for the nearest comfy thing; more rocking. It was like watching myself. I&#39;m typing this 45 years later holding a pillow for comfort. You&#39;ll rarely see me seated without one. I rock all the time. The pillow, the rocking. They fill a hole. It&#39;s protective somehow. I&#39;m sure a shrink would say it reminds me of the womb that was stolen from me.And I know I&#39;ll live the rest of my life like this, without bond, alone, and not really sad because of it, just totally missing what compels others towards their own kind, to bond.So, yeah, more skin-to-skin sooner. No more lost people like me. Again: not sad about it, but life without others 
(and very much not wanting them) can be a severe challenge. You have only yourself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Fortunately, JPL knows exactly what went wrong.&gt; and while the flight uncovered a timing vulnerability that will now have to be addressed, it also confirmed the robustness of the system in multiple ways.This is so important. Imagine if it would have crashed and damaged communications, that would have been the end of it. This extra step in engineering effort really payed off and gave Ingenuity a second life, and NASA a really good opportunity to learn important lessons and do further debugging.Also, the article at mars.nasa.gov is a delight to read, with all the information one would like to know being in there. Not to mention that there is even a video for us to see."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel this bug in my bones. I work a lot on WAMI/aerial imagery. I&#39;ve dealt with this exact problem of timestamp-off-by-one-image. I have 9 cameras with different exposure times all triggered by the same hardware pulse. Fortunately my system is data-collect only so the worst outcome is some wrong filenames.I learned only way too late in the project that most GigeVision cameras emit timestamps that can be synched using NTP and/or PTP. The camera specs/manual said nothing about this. Only found it by accident looking through the GeniCam XML API.Moral of the story: ensure your cameras emit timestamps on device. Don&#39;t rely on system time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the kind of failure mode that I imagine (now with hindsight) should be mitigated by (re)designing the system in such a way that the timestamp desync would always be detected because each part of the system should have its own internal model of the approximate times that it should be receiving from other systems and never blindly trust them.I imagine it is sort of like the organisms early in evolution that simply believed their sensory system when it had in fact been hijacked by something that wanted to eat them. There aren&#39;t many sensory systems with those issues these days because anything that doesn&#39;t have an internal model that it can use for comparison winds up being a snack or crashing on an alien planet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"They look cool but aren&#39;t avatars mainly used to uniquely identify someone based on a picture?A lot of these look too similar. The really boring approach IMO is to choose a random solid color and put the user&#39;s initial(s) on top of it. This makes it pretty unique and much easier to associate someone back to their avatar."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HIBP has really grown from kind of a cool toy to a serious public good. Kudos to Troy for his great stewardship over the years, you can tell he is passionate about this and is very careful about making sure this dataset is used for everyone&#39;s benefit. I&#39;m glad he decided to head this direction after the discussions of acquisition a while back."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Brief mention in the post, but FYI to the thread - .NET Foundation is an independant non-profit (501c6) foundation that supports the .NET open source community. It&#39;s run by a community elected board and funded by member donations and a diverse group of corporate sponsors. This is a great example of the kind of work they do to support the community.Disclaimer: I was on staff at .NET Foundation 2016-2019."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This makes me wonder if the FBI is taking stolen credentials off these sites in order to use them against suspects under investigation. Do they have my passwords? Might they have yours?"</p>
