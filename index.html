								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have any questions directly, just wanna say that I love VLC, it&#39;s one of the first programs I install on any computer, and I will continue to use it as my primary media-viewer for the foreseeable future.The number of features that the devs have packed into VLC is staggering; I&#39;ve been using VLC for almost 15 years now, and I still find new things about it occasionally. Fun fact (though probably not as surprising to an HN crowd as it is to most people I tell this to), VLC can also be used to convert media to different formats, AND works as a quick ad-hoc media server if you want to display something on a TV.  This can be really handy if you have a video file in a weird format and want a way to quickly watch it on a device that doesn&#39;t support weird formats.I think I&#39;m going to donate.  Keep up the good work folks!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You guys rock and the entire Linux community owes you big time.
Once you installed videolan you were ready for all media formats.
It was so tiresome to tell the people you convinced to try Linux that no, by default they couldn&#39;t play their media, that they needed gstreamer this and that.
You made the transition to Linux so much easier to lots of people by offering a simple to use very feature rich application everyone needs and uses.Thank you!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh my god, they don&#39;t even bother implementing the app any more...It reminds me of my first App Store experience. I made an app that was somewhat successful (about 2000€ a month, enough to pay for a students living expenses).Within short time, a chinese speaking developer cloned it. They copied the icon (slighlty different color), they copied the UI, they even copied all the text in the dialog boxes. They released the app with a slightly different name.I contacted Apple to complain about the obvious copyright infringement, but they only forwarded my complaint to the developer. Interestingly enough, the developer actually replied to me. They sent an email threating legal action. I asked them to at least change the icon, and they did. But until today, the rest of the cloned app is still on the app store and competes with my app.It&#39;s not comparable to your case, since in my case the competitor wasn&#39;t a scammer, just someone with a very lose interpretation of intellectual property.But it makes me feel that Apple really doesn&#39;t give a shit what goes on in their store, as long as they make their 30%. (or 15% from small fish like me now)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI, in situations like this the best way is to:1. Register your videos and images with the USCO. It&#39;ll cost &lt;$100.2. You can now file DMCA takedowns. Send one to Apple with the USCO registration ID and a copy of the image and a link to the app in question.3. Apple will either immediately remove that fake app, or be liable for up to $350k in punitive damages for wilful infringement and lose all DMCA protection.4. If Apple didn&#39;t react a week later, approach a lawyer. They&#39;ll likely be willing to work purely for 50% commission, because it&#39;ll be a slam dunk in court.5. Repeat the same with Facebook / Youtube if they advertise there with your images or videos. Take Screenshots and write down the url and date and time.Of course, one would hope that Apple will do the right thing, but it&#39;s also reasonably easy to force their hand.That said, I don&#39;t know anyone for whom app development worked out financially if you fairly price your own labor. So maybe just stay away from cheap apps in general."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m dumbfounded at Google&#39;s lack of planning on this. I tried Stadia, and they had (have?) so few games that they seem to have neither search nor pagination on the list that you can play. None of the games are ones that I care about.It feels like they could have—at the cost of short-term profit and pride—partnered with Valve and shipped something mind-blowing. But instead we&#39;re left with a bunch of AAA games that feel half-baked (Hitman crashes on first boot and complains about a lack of a controller) and a bunch of indie games that feel like a sad attempt to squeeze a few extra bucks out of a middling title (the Hello Neighbor hide and seek game) and titles released half a decade ago (superhot).Minecraft is on every console imaginable—except Stadia. What about Roblox? Fortnite? Factorio? Among Us? Any Sid Meier&#39;s game? Any Paradox game? Every genre of game that I actually put time into is completely absent on their platform. Every game from the top 10 (perhaps 20 or more?) on Twitch right now is absent on Stadia. I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, but whatever it is, it&#39;s wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know Google/Stadia recently partnered with LG to bundle the Stadia app with LG TVs, but I wonder why Google doesn&#39;t do this with every TV manufacturers (save Sony.)If I were Stadia&#39;s marketing chief, I&#39;d1. Bribe the TV manufacturers to include the Stadia app2. Advertise that the TV includes _a game console_ during TV commercials.3. Allow the TV users to pay a bit extra ($20?) to buy a basic game controller.4. Have all the store demo units to auto stream Stadia playing video games and explicitly explain you don&#39;t need a xbox/playstation to play these games.5. Buy out Witcher 3/Call of Duty 4/Project Cars 2/other older games and make them free for TVs with Stadia bundles.Most smart TVs these days are more than fast enough to stream HD broadcast. I don&#39;t understand why Google doesn&#39;t push this.Fiddling with my phone to play Stadia on my TV is pretty crumple some. It&#39;s just too much work for normal folks. People just want to turn on the TV and start playing.Edit: I guess monopolistic abuse is a concern. However Sony and MS have their own streaming services. Google can just advertise &#39;play games with Stadia and Playstation Now and Xbox Cloud on your TV!&#39; I am 100% if players switch to playing games on TV without game consoles, it hurts MS/Sony a lot more than to Google."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is totally the right move.  I am a (very happy) user of Stadia. If you haven&#39;t tried it, you really should...it&#39;s an amazing piece of tech. I can find myself with 20-30 minutes worth of downtime during the day, fire up Cyberpunk 2077 or Hitman or Assassin&#39;s Creed in moments from my browser *on a macbook* and play at high settings with no noticeable lag.Obviously you need a strong, steady internet connection for Stadia to shine, but I&#39;d guess that the HN crowd skews towards that.If you&#39;re an old gamer who wants to play newer games but doesn&#39;t have a ton of time and don&#39;t want to drop $1k+ on a gaming rig, check out Stadia.The game library does leave a lot to be desired, no question about that. But this decision seems to be the right move to mitigate that by giving developers better access to getting their games on Stadia rather than Google trying to be both the platform and the content."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been using Spacy3 nightly for a while now. This is game changing.Spacy3 practically covers 90% of NLP use-cases with near SOTA performance. The only reason to not use it would be if you are literally pushing the boundaries of NLP or building something super specialized.Hugging Face and Spacy (also Pytorch, but duh) are saving millions of dollars in man hours for companies around the world. They&#39;ve been a revelation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok so I’ve evaluated spacy a few years ago, but nowadays we’re using huggingface’s transformers / tokenizers / etc to train our own language models + fine tuned models. I see there’s now transformer based pipeline support, how do the two relate?Phrased differently, how does spacy fit in with today’s world of transformers? Would it still be interesting for me?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SpaCy and HuggingFace fulfill practically 99% of all our needs for NLP project at work. Really incredible bodies of work.Also, my team chat is currently filled with people being extremely stoked about the SpaCy + FastAPI support! Really hope FastAPI replaces Flask sooner rather than later."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s simultaneously remarkable and utterly unremarkable that Facebook has been dragged kicking and screaming into building a consent screen for this kind of tracking.Watching this tracking notification conflict unfold in the media has really helped me to refine where I stand on this: if a business depends on non-consensual tracking to be able to survive, then I&#39;d prefer that the business has to fold before stripping users of their opportunity to understand and agree to the surveillance infrastructure at issue here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey! FastAPI creator hereNice surprise to find this shared on HN!It&#39;s also great to see so many products/projects and companies using it successfuly in production!I see a bunch of questions related to &#34;how FastAPI compares to X&#34;, FastAPI was built from the learnings from other awesome tools, and is built on top of great packages. You can read a lot more about it here: https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/alternatives/If you have questions or problems, you can ask in GitHub issues: https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/issues/new/chooseThere&#39;s also an official Discord chat: https://discord.gg/VQjSZaeJmfAnd finally, if you use FastAPI, I would love your input in the first user survey (you could win stickers ): https://tripetto.app/run/RXZ6OLDBXX?s=hn"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huge FastAPI fan here.I use it for my projects (and one project even makes enough revenue that I sponsor Sebastián’s work through GitHub sponsors at $250/mo) and it for sure has increased my development velocity.It’s an absolute joy to work with. The automated interactive docs are great for iteration. Type hints as first class citizens is an awesome developer experience that I didn’t think I wanted.Using the auto generated OpenAPI you can even generate client side code and typings to interact with your API.It feels like flask but with lots of quality of life improvements.[1] https://www.vim.so"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently used Starlette, which FastAPI also uses, for a project and absolutely loved it. I went with Starlette over FastAPI because I didn&#39;t need a lot of what FastAPI provided for that particular project.I want to start nudging my coworkers into using FastAPI over Flask because some of the async APIs they&#39;ve started using.  FastAPI seems to come with all the things they want out of the box instead of adding a bunch of individual Flask packages.Just for my own understanding, where would FastAPI be appropriate vs. Starlette and vice versa.Thanks!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article touches a point I have been wondering about regarding the Notice condition: &#34;But web developers, as a whole, haven’t got the memo.&#34;.The JavaScript and npm ecosystem are extremely dependency-heavy. Even if you only take a few yourself, the number of sub-dependencies of even a simple application are often in the hundreds.Why does &#34;everyone&#34; ignore the attribution of their dependencies and sub-dependencies? Laziness? Risk of getting sued too low? What happens if Oracle buys all the left-pads in the world?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, how has nobody noticed this before? This looks seriously rotten:&gt; Michigan-based entrepreneur Robert Simpson decided to see what would happen if he bought the entire stock of one company. Using a single broker, within a couple of days Simpson had paid a little over $5,000 for 1,285,050 shares in OTC bulletin board property-development company Global Links. According to Simpson, these shares were delivered into his account shortly afterwards. Yet the following day 37,044,500 Global Links shares were traded on the bulletin board. The next day, 22,471,000 shares were traded. On neither day had Simpson traded a single Global Link share, he insists. And events surrounding Simpson&#39;s investments became yet more confusing. Global Links had only ever issued 1,158,064 shares. Simpson had managed to acquire 126,986 shares that did not exist. How he had managed to be sold more shares than were in issuance is exactly the question Simpson hoped his foray would raise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recent events have a lot of people confusing high short interest with naked shorting.A stock can have short interest greater than 100% without any naked shorting.How is this possible? The textbook definition of a &#34;short sale&#34; is that someone borrows stock and then, literally, sells it short. The buyer of the stock is free and clear to do whatever they want with the stock, including re-lend it for another short sale. Wikipedia has a good primer on how this works: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)This has created a lot of confusion on WallstreetBets, where many participants have come to believe that Gamestop&#39;s short interest of 113% means that there are 13% more shares shorted than long positions to cover. It&#39;s not true, though, because the long interest is always greater than the short interest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Summary:Every so often, someone gets very steamed about short selling, often with no real reason. Back in 2005, someone got very steamed about short selling, and then got a journalist to write a somewhat confused article about it. It&#39;s not clear anything was actually wrong then, but in any case, the rules have been changed a few times since then, so there doesn&#39;t seem to be any obvious relevance to current times.It&#39;s also worth noting that there&#39;s no real theoretical basis for why naked short selling would be harmful, no real empirical evidence showing it is harmful, no general laws against it, and the structure of the market allows and expects it to take place in some specific cases. If your mental model is that the stock market is a tool to allow people to trade a fixed number of concrete objects back and forth, this probably seems odd, but since that&#39;s not really a good model of how the stock market works or is intended to work, it&#39;s not clear that means much."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Summary: if you have an index on a column which is mostly NULL, consider using a partial index covering only the records where it&#39;s non-NULL."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Partial indexes are amazing but you have to keep in mind some pecularities.If your query doesn&#39;t contain a proper match with the WHERE clause of the index - the index will not be used. It is easy to forget about it or to get it wrong in subtle ways. Here is an example from work.There was an event tracing structure which contained the event severity_id. Id values 0-6 inclusive are user facing events. Severity 7 and up is debug events. In practice all debug events were 7 and there were no other values above 7. This table had a partial index with WHERE severity_id &lt; 7.
I tracked down a performance regression, when an ORM (due to programmer error) generated WHERE severity_id != 7. The database is obviously not able to tell that there will never be any values above 7 so the index was not used slowing down event handling. Turning the query to match &lt; 7 fixes the problem. The database might also not be able to infer that the index can be indeed used, for example when prepared statements are involved WHERE severity_id &lt; ?. The database will not be able to tell that all bindings of ? will satisfy &lt; 7 so will not use the index (unless you are running PG 12, then that might depend on the setting of plan_cache_mode[1] but I have not tested that yet).Another thing is that HOT updates in PostgreSQL can&#39;t be performed if the updated field is indexed but that also includes being part of a WHERE clause in a partial index. So you could have a site like HN and think that it would be nice to index stories WHERE vote &gt; 100 to quickly find more popular stories. That index however would nullify the possiblity of a hot update when the vote tally would be updated. Again, not a problem but you need to know the possible drawbacks.That said, they are great when used for the right purpose. Kudos to the author for a nice article![1] - https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/plan_cache_mode/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Coming from Oracle, I was always taught that NULLs are not indexedThat left me wondering how, if all indexes are by default partial in Oracle… how does one make an unpartial? nonpartial? index.https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/where-clause/null/indexApparently, you add a computed column to the index that just computes a constant value. And single non-null column then causes the nulls in other columns to get indexed, it&#39;s only if the whole tuple is composed of nulls that it gets left out.That also seems like a bug waiting to happen; someone inverts a query to find unset (NULL) entries, and now you&#39;re doing a table scan.…but it seems also like a form of brain rot, induced by a particular implementation, e.g., similar to how I&#39;ve had MySQL users ask how to make a key on a table. Where a &#34;key&#34; is an index, it&#39;s just that MySQL by default uses the word &#34;key&#34; to mean index, instead of … key¹. (The query language even supports &#34;INDEX&#34; in place of &#34;KEY&#34;, but things like &#34;SHOW TABLE&#34; default to the &#34;wrong&#34; (linguistically, not programmatically) word.) And then you might have to de-tangle why these two are different concepts, how they&#39;re different. It&#39;s very Arrival, in the sense of language (mis-)shaping perception.¹a key is a set of columns that are sufficient to identify a row. The primary such set of columns is … the primary key. An index can index a key (if more than one exists within a table), but it doesn&#39;t have to."</p>
