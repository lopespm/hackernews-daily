								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is such an incredible amount of vulnerable mission-critical data.- all contacts, including 3rd party messaging apps, with metadata (interactions, timestamps, other stats)
- full address book
- whether any app is installed
- SSID of connected wifiand formerly,- medical info
- device usage
- screen time
- device accessoriesI don&#39;t keep anything mission critical on mobile, but this is still a gargantuan set of exploits, and each appear extremely straightforward to validate and pay out the security researcher (and maybe even patch). It&#39;s utterly tragic how Apple (and others) have devolved to become the same monolithic, careless organizations they once displaced.I really, really hope something changes. Soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Explain I&#39;m naive: why would Apple&#39;s bug bounty program be so poorly run? Is it simply a sign of organizational failure?  
 (e.g. perhaps the managers running the program have been promoted to a position that they simply don&#39;t belong in, and higher up execs don&#39;t care? Or are they prioritizing profit over success?)I would think that, given the profitability and positioning of Apple in the marketplace, that they would be heavily incentivized to provide large bounties for finding such destructive vulnerabilities. And I imagine that there are plenty of security people working there who genuinely care about fixing fix these issues right away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If your annual revenue is above $100M, you should be held accountable to a strict version of GPDR enforced by an ombudsman, that requires you to patch all data leaking vulnerabilities within 90 days, or pay out everyone who bought your product.I just updated to iOS 15 and it now tells you which sites you have been compromised on, or had your passwords/info compromised on. To be clear, I use a password manager with a unique password on every site, so it is difficult for something like this to have a significant impact. Nethertheless, I was compromised on hundreds of sites and products, and those were just the accounts that iOS Safari knew about. None of them bothered to reach out and tell me. Even my coffee machine was compromised. Ridiculous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a mid-sized US manufacturer that recently went through a ransomware scare, we contracted with FireEye for remediation and cybersecurity consultation.  I was shocked that they recommended we install ad-blockers as a corporate policy.  I remarked ads are sometimes useful and that many local companies rely upon them (e.g., the local newspaper).  I use an adblocker just to make the internet more useable, but I was reluctant to make that a corporate policy.  I couldn&#39;t imagine there was any meaningful threat from malware in ads as every company from the Journal to the Times to Nordstrom would be screwed without ads.  But FireEye insisted and we now have adblocking installed with the usual image.  Wild times.  I have to believe this is truly disruptive to the internet as we know it.  It seems to me the ad providers would have a huge incentive to counter this narrative and to make damned sure ads are safe.  I have no idea why that&#39;s not happening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I worked at reddit, I refused to run Adblock.  I felt like it would be hypocritical to work for a company that made its money from ads, and then block them.  Also I wanted to make sure that I had the same experience as the users.When I left reddit, for the longest time I still didn&#39;t run Adblock because as a shareholder it still felt hypocritical.But a few years ago I couldn&#39;t take it anymore -- the web go so awful with ads on it became unusable.  And so I relented and went full Adblock.  And life got a lot better.(I did however whitelist reddit and a few other sites that I like whose ads are bearable)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Scrolling through some of the comments here, I haven&#39;t read anything that praises ads. Which begs the question, why do we still tolerate ads? If employees from Ad companies themselves use adblock (!!!), something must be fundamentally wrong.Isn&#39;t it about time we change the financial model of the internet? Or should we just let humanity suffer through this non-value adding ritual?Personally I&#39;ve never bought anything directly because of web ads. I understand that some people do and that some people find them beneficial. But I believe the cons outweigh the pros this time.I don&#39;t claim to have a solution, but it annoys me when we all agree that something sucks yet do nothing about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a big fan of the idea of manufacturing meat in an environmentally sustainable way (and without having to resort to raising and killing animals), reading this article felt as if someone was throwning a bucket&#39;s worth of ice-cold water on my face.According to the article, the barriers to cost-efficient manufacturing of lab-grown meat at large scale are fundamental, e.g., impossible to overcome according to the Laws of Thermodynamics and our current understanding of cell biology and chemistry.Quoting from the OP:&gt; David Humbird, the UC Berkeley-trained chemical engineer who spent over two years researching the report, found that the cell-culture process will be plagued by extreme, intractable technical challenges at food scale. In an extensive series of interviews with The Counter, he said it was “hard to find an angle that wasn’t a ludicrous dead end.”&gt; Humbird likened the process of researching the report to encountering an impenetrable “Wall of No”—his term for the barriers in thermodynamics, cell metabolism, bioreactor design, ingredient costs, facility construction, and other factors that will need to be overcome before cultivated protein can be produced cheaply enough to displace traditional meat.Is there anyone on HN with deep expertise in this area who can comment on this article&#39;s scientific accuracy?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article tries to get away with a giant sleight of hand for a reader that might not be super clear on lab grown vs plant based. The overwhelming majority of fake meat is plant based, not cultured. Sure, one day we might see competitive economics from cultured meats, but claiming that it won’t happen because their factories aren’t pound for pound equivalent makes no sense. People are choosing alternatives to meat because they don’t want the Amazon further destroyed for cattle production, because they watch a video of how animals are treated (I dare you to watch one slaughterhouse video from peta), and because the carbon intensity is simply too high broadly. Plant based meat is now widely available and just about at price parity (not $50/chicken nugget as the post misleadingly suggests of fake meat when actually referring to R&amp;D phase cultured meat production). The main “source” of perspective for the first half of the article is an “animal health” industry insider aka, meat industry representative.  His career has been literally to keep cows alive long enough to kill them at the perfect time before serving them in happy meals, forgive me if I think he more than a little biased"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FINALLY an article that looks at the basic scientific fundamentals of this. Lab-grown meat, similar to carbon removal tech, is currently super hyped in the mainstream media.Like Pat Brown, founder of Impossible usually says, paraphrasing: &#34;There is no such thing as lab-grown meat, and there will never be. If somebody figures out how to grow cells reliably in a bioreactor, it will make much more sense to sell it as organs for use in medicine than to eat it (financially).&#34;It just doesn&#39;t make sense to grow meat in the lab if we can make it from plant proteins directly. Period.What makes me sad and angry about the startups and billions of VC money that goes into this is that we need to reduce emissions NOW. We don&#39;t have time to fuck around with sci-fi tech that maybe brings down the price of lab-grown meat to a level that the top 10% of the population might afford it, in 10 or 20 years. It has been proven that there are great ways to make meat alternatives from plant proteins directly, we should invest time and money into expanding that!On a side note, I think for a lot of people the existence of research and startups on lab-grown meat is an excuse to continue eating meat. They say that once it&#39;s there, I&#39;ll of course switch over. But they are not ready to switch over to alternatives like Impossible burgers that are just as good now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the last year or so I&#39;ve noticed an increasing amount of my legitimate professional interactions going into my &#34;Promotions&#34; tab in Gmail. The effect of which has been, after discovering a few mishaps of this sort, to now regularly and meticulously go through a massive pile of &#34;Promotions&#34; just to make sure I haven&#39;t missed something legitimately urgent or important. Prior to Google&#39;s classification errors producing this particular anxiety I used to basically treat the &#34;Promotions&#34; tab as spam to never look at. Now I&#39;m going through all of it with prejudice which means I&#39;m waaaaaaay more aware of marketing drivel than I used to be. As such, I&#39;m pretty sure this &#34;error&#34; is intentional on Google&#39;s part to produce exactly this outcome of drawing eyeballs to inbox advertising."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yup, getting a few of these each day and manually marking them as Spam (to no avail). Not sure how GMAIL&#39;s filter is missing them.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I understand Apple&#39;s decision to do this. They want to stick it to Epic. Completely understandable desire on Apple&#39;s part. But, sadly, Apple is letting their desire to get vengeance outweigh the interests of their users in having all the games they want to play on their devices.I have been realizing lately that my loyalty to Apple has been waning over the years after having invested heavily in the ecosystem. This is another representation to me of how Apple&#39;s ecosystem is something you have no control over, and you are at the whim of Apple&#39;s legal team in situations like that to be able to play the games you want to play on your devices.Apple remembered their corporate games they were playing and forgot who their real customer and focus should be: the end users. This decision doesn&#39;t benefit their end users in any meaningful way. It hurts end users to score points in their feud with Epic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Epic took a stand and we should be behind them 100%. This case was never about winning on the letter of the contract law, it was about moving the standard of practice and attempting to gain some ground against the evils of mega-Apple. If you are reading this Grubber post and thinking you agree, that&#39;s only because you are used to thinking this way by now.The courts simply do not understand the power companies like Apple and Google have apparently. The startup cost of a competitor would be astronomical, as we&#39;ve seen reflected in the quality, cost, and size of the small handful of other smartphone companies recently. Even if we seem new players become competitive, then what&#39;s to stop us from being back in this same situation in 10 years? 5 years? This is why we have Laws.Not even to mention that the telecom companies are still working against progress and taking absurd cuts for themselves.Hosting, platforming, and The Web are in crisis, as we&#39;re all aware. We should be firmly on the side of open access to our (developers) content. Why let the platforms eat our lunch? Maybe we should just be giving them a snack, or a little treat, but even that would just be for &#34;services rendered&#34;, not as a condition for our meal.I&#39;m just so fucking done with this, sorry I can&#39;t help but be a bit angry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to compare the situation Epic got itself into with previous episodes of Facebook &amp; Google breaking Apple&#39;s rules.When Facebook and Google misused Developer Enterprise certificates to go beyond internal testing and distribute apps to end-consumers, Apple revoked their accounts.  Both Facebook &amp; Google simply admitted they screwed up and Apple reinstated their accounts.[1]  No lawsuits.Epic broke Apple&#39;s in-app-purchase rules and now Epic promises they will comply but Epic didn&#39;t get their dev account reinstated yet.  Big difference is that Epic rolled the dice by filing a lawsuit about Apple&#39;s unfair rules and because they thought there was enough anti-Apple sentiment that they&#39;d get a sympathetic judgement in their favor.  Their gamble didn&#39;t work and in the process, Tim Sweeny&#39;s defiant attitude just made Apple dig in their heels even further.I&#39;m reminded of that quote, &#34;you come at the King, you best not miss.&#34;EDIT reply to some comments saying Epic didn&#39;t make a &#34;promise&#34; to comply with Apple&#39;s rules:&gt;Did i miss something where they actually said that? In this thread&#39;s Fireball blogpost is a link to Tim Sweeney&#39;s tweet of an email screenshot to Apple&#39;s Phil Schiller stating his &#34;promise&#34;:&gt;Sep 16, 2021 at 5:01 PM; Subject: Fortnite and the App Store; To: Phil Schiller&gt;[..] Epic promises that it will adhere to Apple’s guidelines whenever and wherever we release products on Apple platforms.[...][1] https://www.google.com/search?q=apple+reinstates+google+face..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think part of the problem today with individuals trying to figure out how to moderate their social media usage is that it&#39;s not clear what specifically within social media constitutes harm.Is it the like/upvote mechanism? Hacker News would constitute harmful social media in that case. But what might be lost is a powerful lever for democratic input in terms of content curation and moderation.My vote for what&#39;s more harmful is the scroll. I have a web extension that just removes the scroll on my Facebook feed. A few months after setting it up I all but stopped using Facebook, checking in once maybe every two months to visit folks individually. I haven&#39;t done this for Twitter or IG, but then the quality of my main feed is such that I don&#39;t want to remove it outright and want that aggregation of content, somehow.I think that scrolling in general is harmful as a UX pattern, but the obvious alternative of pagination could create all kinds of complexities around deep-linking and fragmentation of content. All the same I&#39;d love to see more platforms adopt this intentional cap on content associated with a given URL. It turns my engagement with content online from scanning to actual reading."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; After the habit of scrolling and liking wears off, you suddenly find yourself in a joyful place. A quieter, calmer, less demanding place where you don’t want to know what others are doing. You focus on what you want to do.But what if you don&#39;t know what you want to do?I feel like this post was written from the perspective of someone who already has their own life goals sorted out, and social media was clearly acting as an obstacle to accomplishing those well-defined goals, so they dropped social media.But when you&#39;re on your own, it is not a given that you have everything figured out and all you need to do is give yourself a lot of free time and just do what you want. The void that remains is exactly the kind that social media is designed to fill for many people.That kind of feeling almost legitimizes the concept of FOMO, because at a certain point you cannot imagine how anything you&#39;re doing could be more interesting than the things that other people are moving forward with in their lives. You want to aspire to be something, and looking for someone else to copy would mean you at least have some kind of aspiration to work towards, instead of nothing at all.Social media is a net negative overall, but once it&#39;s out of the picture you have to work on yourself, and in that domain there are no easy answers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“ We persuade our minds that liking pictures and joining virtual groups gives us a sense of belonging. Connection with others”Except in many cases its not persuasion. Joining groups actually does give us these things. My gf is part of “bay area moms” group and the amount of useful tips she gets out of participating in that is significant. Or “bay area hikers” for me. Also, if i want to sell something, I hire facebook to find a buyer for my old ipad or iphone.Social media has caught on to the jobs framework. Jack Dorsey references it directly on Twitter earnings calls. He says we need to fill more jobs for more people. He constantly asks what can people hire twitter for?I think to reduce social media to some of the crappy jobs it does serve artificially diminishes what it can be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not reinvention of PHP as some are commenting.
In fact I think this is extremely cool.If I understand it correctly, it allows you to achieve reactive data flow in a single page app without any boilerplate.Meaning - you update the database on the server and all the relevant UI(s) will automatically receive the updated data and re-render only the parts of the UI that display that data.This would require a ton of PHP and Javascript dealing with networking, websockets, routing, serializing data and so on.Haven&#39;t tried it yet, but very curious to see if it works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I admire about the Clojure community is audacious projects like this. While a ton of these seem to run out of steam, they certainly shoot for the stars and tend to come pretty dang close for a while.For those working in Typescript, Blitz.js seems to do a great job at drastically decreasing the plumbing you have to write to shuttle data between Postgres and React. There’s also a ton of goodies like auth built in. From my first impression it’s the closest the JS community has ever come to a Django, and that’s very high praise in my book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of Meteor.js[0] from back in the day (2014?), which had a very similar approach—you wrote code that ran on both the frontend and the backend, and database updates were propagated automatically. It suffered from a pretty hard reliance on Mongodb and its own package manager (Atmosphere), and it was at odds with the rest of the JS ecosystem which was settling on NPM.This project looks very cool! I like the focus on composition, Meteor was lacking that (and really, most other frameworks do as well).[0] https://www.meteor.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love how honest this is about the limitations and the whole design process. Truly a great example of a real hacker projectI have a Georgi keyboard (mentioned in the article) which I started getting to grips with then put aside during a way too busy period at work. This has made me want to dig it out and try again.I’m also thinking that two of those faunchpads put together on the long edges could make an even better ‘back of phone’ keyboard (or back of mini tablet) for a handy portable note taking device"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a Blackberry fanboy. My Key2 was far, far superior a device to the latest gen iPhone I own. I have tried for years to get used to glass, and while I&#39;m ok with it, it&#39;s still a massive compromise.My second favourite mobile-device keyboard was that of the Ericsson T28 [0] from about 20 years ago. At some point I accidentally discovered a feature I just found outlined at the bottom of page 28 of the T28 user manual [1], where the volume rocker switch on the left side would act as a text entry modifier key, so that pressing the number 2 button normally resulted in a B, holding the volume up and pressing 2 gave a C, and holding volume down and pressing 2 gave a D.I remember getting so, so fast and so comfortable at texting with this method. By random chance, an acquaintance a few years ago in a co-working place had an old T28 that still worked and let me play with. Naturally the first thing I tried was the old input method - and it was like my muscle memory never left. I was so fast and so comfortable with it. She was blown away... after 20 years she still had no idea that that mode existed.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ericsson_T28[1] https://www.lokety.com/ericsson_t28s_manual.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I applaud any effort to rethink keyboards from first principles.After years of shoulder, neck and back pain I discovered that the root cause was the standard keyboard design. It causes rounded shoulders. Perhaps my shoulders are just too wide. This pinched all sorts of muscles, tendons and nerves. Doctors and physical therapists just failed to identify the issue. Weight lifting didn&#39;t help all that much, even with a strong back I had to scrunch and round the shoulders to type.I finally picked up a second keyboard, and used one for each hand. It was surprisingly easy to convert to. Just added some larger rubber nub things on home row.It&#39;s been life changing. Years of pain was gone in days. No special design necessary.Each keyboard is arranged at an outward angle, distanced so my shoulders are in a natural position.I can&#39;t recommend this enough.On Mac it required a system preference tweak (Karibiner app) so each keyboard can share shortcut keys."</p>
