								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If there is going to be a metaverse, I&#39;m not sure I want Facebook to own it. It&#39;s like a bad sci-fi pulp story.Given their investment and research, I wonder if they should open it all up (even if contradictory to short-term gains in ad revenue) so it has a chance to grow? Federate it a bit more than they are comfortable with, to at least give it a chance. I could see this flubbing out hard otherwise.I&#39;m personally keen on the AR/VR space (surrounded by headsets here), but the early adopters are so polarized about Facebook/Oculus&#39;s involvement. I don&#39;t know if a rebrand (is this really that?) would be enough for the tech crowd to forget and move on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The rebrand was introduced as a &#34;One More Thing&#34; during the event keynote.A 2007 &#34;One More Thing&#34; was the announcement of the iPhone and the future of mobile computing. Now a 2021 &#34;One More Thing&#34; is the announcement of a company rebrand to avoid government regulation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In London, in the area around the London Eye, there is a tourist trap that offers a very poor &#39;haunted house&#39; type of attraction, usually something having to do with zombies. As each iteration of this tourist trap gains a reputation for being total rubbish and gains one star reviews online, every few months the attraction rebrands to another name."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;My favorite part of the photographic process was watching prints come to life. I loved starting with a blank sheet of paper and applying various photographic methods to bring the image to life.&gt;I found that building websites was similarly satisfying. For example, click the &#34;Reveal Image&#34; button to watch an image fade in to the blank canvas!I think a lot about why I went into computer science and this is the same conclusion I came to. There&#39;s something really cool about starting with a blank page and coding in elements that appear one by one and adapting the code to be what you want. Maybe there&#39;s other ways to do it but programming seemed to be the most powerful.Just to be clear, it was video games, not photography that kinda nudged me into programming, but same idea with a blank canvas and having control of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All of this talk about supply chain issues are totally missing the point in my opinion. So many articles (and tweet chains I guess) have been written about supply chain issues, yet every one of them seems to ignore the elephant in the room which is demand for goods vs services. Over the course of the pandemic there was a staggering re-balancing of consumer spending [0] from services to goods, to which supply chains have not caught up.If the spending doesn&#39;t re-balance again as restrictions are lifted this is not a temporary supply chain issue caused by just-in-time methodology, it&#39;s just the new normal.[0] https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=19&amp;step=2#reqid...EDIT: That link is broken, should have been this https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&amp;step=3&amp;isuri..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company who made products on contract, but the contract stipulated the vendor we had to use to get the raw materials. The raw materials were just aluminum castings, but they were a custom shape specifically for this customer of ours. They could only be used for this one product.I noticed that the inventory levels of our vendor were dropping, but we weren&#39;t buying. Meaning our customer was ordering the same product from a competitor.I proposed that we spend the money to buy the rest of the material at the vendor. Basically denying our competitor the materials and forcing either them to come to us or the customer dropping the order and reordering through us. This would have been a risk because that&#39;s about a year supply of proprietary castings that we can&#39;t use for anything else, but I really thought it was a worthwhile opportunity. But it went against lean principles so we didn&#39;t do it.Fast forward 6 months and our competitor basically did the same thing to us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe the claim is completely defensible and ultimately correct.A) This was a multi-factoral event certainly but all of these other factor are &#34;immediate causes&#34; which can themselves be traced to absolute maximum return on equity as a more final cause.B) No doubt &#34;hard to restart&#34; process are were involved. But the world relies on single-source, hard to restart, large scale production of many things today because these produce the highest returns for those who invest in them and the lowest prices for those who buy from them. And both kinds of actors have been willing to just stop producing rather than doing something that might be costly to keep production going (and they decided they didn&#39;t want backup before this for the same reason).C) Supply lines that stretch around world exist as a combination of economies of scale and &#34;labor market arbitrage&#34; and both these are driven by return, even though &#34;labor market arbitrage&#34; doesn&#39;t increase efficiency or robustness.D) Chip manufactures put money into &#34;up-date&#34; chip processes, notably leaving the sorts of chips actually used in cars woah fully under-invested and generally many sorts of lack of robustness can be traced down to money flowing only to the normally profitable. Shutting down production isn&#39;t necessarily that bad for a company - they don&#39;t wages and they can start back up once things stabilize. It&#39;s much less disastrous than making a bunch of stuff and not being able to sell it. Clearly, that thinking is guiding a lot of decisions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been testing one for a couple weeks, and a quick rundown on it: it has a quad-core A53, same CPU/SoC core as the Pi 3, with 512 MB of RAM.This means it can run 64-bit Pi OS, but it is memory-limited and even some of the benchmarks I ran needed extra swap space to complete. But for anything that does run in the 512 MB of LPDDR2 RAM, it is at least twice as fast as the Zero/Zero W, and sometimes 3-8x faster, depending on how things handle threading (4 cores is better than 1!).My biggest concern is overheating—even at the base 1 GHz clock, it will start to throttle after a few minutes in a case with no airflow or heat sink. You can overclock to 1.2, 1.4, or even in some cases 1.5 GHz, but it starts throttling a lot more quickly unless you have really good cooling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running one of these for a few months too and was excited when I saw an ARMv7 CPU. In the open source and container world, many projects have stopped supporting the Zero and RPi1 due to its lack of RAM and slow CPU speed. Even running &#34;go build&#34; can take multiple seconds on a simple program. Starting Node.js was also fairly slow.The RPi zero shines for Python scripts that access hardware - for sensors and camera projects that are low power and cheap to make. It was actually perfect for the GrowLab project that we did over the summer with 20 others from the community https://growlab.dev - sensor data and camera images were aggregated to a more powerful RPi3/4 and then either uploaded to a static GitHub Pages site, fed into InfluxDB to create beautiful charts with Grafana.The new Zero 2 means that I can start to run ARMv7 or even ARM64 containers on the zero again, but with the limit of 512GB of RAM. The launch blog post explains why this couldn&#39;t be made higher.The first thing I tried out was not K3s, which I knew already suffers on a Raspberry Pi 3, but faasd. Faasd is OpenFaaS but built for pure containerd, no multi-node networking and no Kubernetes. It works fairly well for a few functions, even with NATS and Prometheus being deployed as part of the stack.So whilst you&#39;re not going to be building K3s clusters with these, they can run containers - with Docker, containerd, nerdctl and even as a full application stack with faasd.Where this gets more interesting for me, is hosting small applications, integrations or APIs. Perhaps with Ingress via a tunnel that can penetrate NAT/firewalls like Inlets, Argo or Ngrok.I&#39;ve ordered one of the release models to see how it performs. Look out for a blog post from me soon."</p>

The Radxa seems to be better value. I&#39;m looking for a backup device for my RPi Zero W v1.3. The Zero has been such a amazing companion for me. I use it as Wi-Fi repeater on campsites such that we can all have internet simultaneously. Over the years I added temperature sensors, light sensors and an entire cooling system for the photovoltaic system. It now keeps track of the ambient temperature in the tent and fridge and sends me an SMS if the gets too high. Endless fun.[0] https://forum.radxa.com/t/introduce-the-radxa-zero/6550[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huAKEbyPcBc"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many good points. I&#39;d like to add a common open secret that I believe is wrong: 1 upvote = 1 karma point.This might be true internally and initially, before any ant-spam, anti-upvote-ring detection takes place. Effectively, from a user point of view it is not - at least for me.When I look at the points one of my submissions get and compare my increase in overall karma it is very roughly 50% most of the time.   Needless to say that I never participated in things that would be considered unethically (voting-ring etc.). Also not a complaint at all, just an observation that goes against what is often written in &#34;about HN&#34; type posts (but not OP).EDIT:1. My observation is from more than a year ago, so things might well have changed.2. As lordnacho points out below this seems to be true only for stories. Regardless why it happens, awarding stories with less points than comments makes a lot of sense to me. After all posting a suitable story is much less effort than writing a decent comment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A collaborative resource with more information about undocumented/norms on HN: https://github.com/minimaxir/hacker-news-undocumented&gt; Personally, I’d stay at 3.

If I&#39;m about to submit something and I found an older submission with the same URL, my personal rule is that it should be older than a year ago before I&#39;d submit it again. Three posts with the same URL for three consecutive days seems a bit too much.&gt; Hacker News is moderated mainly by dang aka Dan Gackle (pronounced ‘Gackley’). He’s not of asian descent???

I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s strictly endemic to web or frontend, but I feel like we&#39;re solving the same problems over and over again, using the same low levels of abstraction.There&#39;s no reason for lists to scroll slowly after so many years of scrolling lists. There should just be one way to do a scrolling list, implemented natively and left alone.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great news!  This is a wonderful project, and the fact that it wasn&#39;t accessible from Germany made me profoundly sad and angry.I hope the responsible copyright lawyers have a hard time sleeping because of this and consider changing their line of work.  If you are blocking people from reading books in the public domain, it is a good indication that you are one of the bad guys.Even worse, they only blocked people from Germany that didn&#39;t know how to use a VPN.  German courts really don&#39;t get how the internet works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want state here on fact, the &#34;copyright&#34; is an rather new  anglon-saxon invention and was only later imported to Germany[1]. Interestingly, the era of the &#34;land of poets and thinkers&#34; and the economic rise of Germany was boosted by the fact - that there were no copyrights laws which hindered. Authors had to publish good and more work.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright#BackgroundQuote from WikipediaPrinting brought profound social changes. The rise in literacy across Europe led to a dramatic increase in the demand for reading matter. Prices of reprints were low, so publications could be bought by poorer people, creating a mass audience. In German language markets before the advent of copyright, technical materials, like popular fiction, were inexpensive and widely available; it has been suggested this contributed to Germany&#39;s industrial and economic success. After copyright law became established (in 1710 in England and Scotland, and in the 1840s in German-speaking areas) the low-price mass market vanished, and fewer, more expensive editions were published; distribution of scientific and technical information was greatly reduced.And from the history arctileHeinrich Heine, in a 1854 letter to his publisher, complains: &#34;Due to the tremendously high prices you have established, I will hardly see a second edition of the book anytime soon. But you must set lower prices, dear Campe, for otherwise I really don&#39;t see why I was so lenient with my material interests.&#34;It is not okay to claim other works as yours, publish private material or just don&#39;t give you a fair share upon your work. Probably we should have opted for another approach than &#34;copyright&#34; or &#34;patents&#34;. Luckily the US at least got &#34;Fair Use&#34; and maybe the idea of a &#34;Culture Flatrate&#34; from Germany is also a good idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious as to what changed PGLAF&#39;s mind. Blocking those specific works was all that the court ordered 3 years ago. Blocking everything was PGLAF&#39;s own decision based on perceived risk of further lawsuits about other works. Nothing has really changed to decrease that risk. The plaintiffs may have agreed that those are the only works they own that were in violation, and won&#39;t sue about anything else, but any other German who hold the copyright to works are still valid there but not the US still could."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There was a rule in the Port of Los Angeles saying you could only stack shipping containers two containers high.This is incorrect.
There was a zoning rule which affected truck yards in Long Beach and Los Angeles. Truck yards. Not the port itself.As stated in the linked tweets actually.But if you don&#39;t believe that you can just google an image of the Port of Los Angeles from let&#39;s say 2019 and count how high the container piles go. Here is a randomly selected image from 2019 where 5 high piles can be clearly counted: https://www.joc.com/sites/default/files/field_feature_image/...Accuracy is important. I&#39;m not an expert on logistics, or zoning laws. But how could I trust the article&#39;s author when they clearly unable to parse their own sources?&gt; Normally one would settle this by changing prices, but for various reasons we won’t get into price mechanisms aren’t working properly to fix supply shortages.It&#39;s nice that the article is not going into that. Instead it hammers on that politicians regulate where and how many containers can you plop down. That is not the real issue.If you are moving containers into an area, and you are not moving an equal amount out then you are going to run out of space to store the containers. It is that simple. You can tweak rules to make a bit more space, for example by stacking them higher in the truck yards. But the real question is: why are the people who own these containers incentivised to move them back to where they want them to be filled?  If you solve that the problem solves itself. If you can&#39;t solve that piles of containers will fill up what little more space you won by tweaking. So the very point the article decides to &#34;not go into&#34; is the only one worth going into."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but my understanding is that the &#39;stacking rule&#39; meant that people with more empties than they could stack 2 high on their property were &#34;storing&#34; empties on trailer chassis that carry one container.As I understood it, by letting them stack empties higher, it freed up trailers to be used by trucks to go get containers out of the port. When that happens the port then wants empties to put back on the ship (or full if they are going somewhere) and then the ship can continue on.So the &#34;win&#34; here was that more trailers would be available to take full containers from ships and that would move things along."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a big fan of this form factor, specifically just big enough to fit a motherboard/CPU/RAM plus a real-size GPU. These all use SFX PSUs and typically just an M2 SSD on the motherboard. They also have only 2 RAM slots.The days of needing a tower are over for most people. I&#39;m all about space-saving while still having a full-power PC.It&#39;s a niche, boutique market but there are some really interesting cases. My personal favourite is the Louqe Ghost S1 [1]. I&#39;ve built one PC with this (the Mk II). I bought a Mk III case but couldn&#39;t source a GPU so ended up just buying a CyberpowerPC prebuilt (which is actually a pretty nice PC, to be fair).They&#39;re not cheap and they&#39;re kind of annoying to buy. Louqe in particular has had huge distribution problems in the US (through Amazon&#39;s logistics service).Another popular one is the Dan A4 [2]. It&#39;s smaller. I personally prefer the Ghost for having better airflow, being more modular and being able to expand the case with &#34;top hats&#34;. This allows you to add a 240mm AIO and bottom fans for some pretty darn good cooling and airflow.Anyway, I&#39;m always excited to see entrants in this market.[1]: https://www.louqe.com/ghost-s1/[2]: https://www.dan-cases.com/dana4.php"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean...neat? But the price is insane. £195 for a very basic case that you have to assemble yourself?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love &#39;no frills&#39; PC cases, but to me, this case has frills. The bright orange, the rounded corners and all the cutouts. This PC case is a &#39;wow! what is that weird PC case!?&#39; type of case. I like cases that you dont even notice: Sliger designs [1]1: https://www.sliger.com/products/cases/cerberus/"</p>
