								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As the developer of a pretty popular &#34;utility&#34; browser extension, I&#39;ve been shocked by the volume of email I get every week about it.On a daily basis, I will get requests to sell the extension. Once or twice a week, I will receive an offer to add &#34;a couple lines of code&#34; to my extension which are always generously described as &#34;allowed in the Chrome Web Store&#34; by little fly-by-night organizations that only even have a landing page half the time and usually have throwaway-looking gmail accounts. Out of curiosity, I&#39;ve asked a few what their code does and they never fully describe it, but it either collects analytics to ship home (my extension runs on all sites, so it&#39;s appetizing to them!) or places paid results at the top of any search results, for which I can make &#34;thousands of dollars a month based on the number of North American users I have&#34;.Here is an example email I received yesterday. It&#39;s a good example of how they call it &#34;an SDK&#34; and looks like one of the more legit ones (they registered a domain to send email from, at least).  We at [redacted] are considering purchasing the complete license and ownership of the extensions which have 50K+ active users, may I know if you would be interested in selling? If so, - what is your estimated price?

  Regarding the SDK monetization which we discussed earlier, as it is not distractive and is compatible with any other monetization. We have straightforward terms and provide support for your users agreement. Our partners generate 3-20 K USD monthly with our solution for the browser extensions.

  As a kind reminder, we are [redacted] — a reputable global peer-to-peer ethical proxy network. All our clients are big reputable companies, we authorize their business before providing any proxy plans. 

  Look forward to your further feedback and discussing further details of our financial proposal for your Software in a short Zoom call or here by emails.

Finally, I am also hounded by teams at Microsoft and Apple, who want me to port the extension to their new plugin ecosystems so it can be featured/showcased. I worked with Apple on one similar thing for an extension and it caused such a huge jump in support and feature requests from users that I was overwhelmed, so I am not keen to do it again until I have more free time. They can&#39;t understand why I don&#39;t want to grow by tens of thousands of users a week, but I&#39;m just one person and don&#39;t make money from it whatsoever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really Google&#39;s fault. They make it impossible to turn off automatic updates for Chrome extensions from their store. That would be kind-of-ok if they actually had a rigorous approval process. But they don&#39;t. The Chrome Web Store has become one of the prime Vectors for malware.
The only way to be safe is to exclusively download releases from the extensions github repo and to manually install them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find interesting that GNOME Screensaver&#39;s security depends on it to not crash.Meanwhile, in KDE the lock screen is managed by KDE Session Management Server which ensures that lock screen cannot be bypassed by simply crashing its process.The way it works is follows: ksmserver draws a black rectangle over everything and spawns kscreenlocker. If kscreenlocker crashes, the black rectangle is still here, and ksmserver will spawn kscreenlocker again but this time with software rendering (just in case it crashed due to graphics driver issue). If kscreenlocker crashes four times then KDE Session Management Server gives up, stops respawning kscreenlocker and simply draws the following text on the screen.  The screen locker is broken and unlocking is not possible anymore.
  In order to unlock switch to a virtual terminal (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+F2),
  log in and execute the command:
  
  loginctl unlock-session %1
  
  Afterwards switch back to the running session (Ctrl+Alt+F%2).

If ksmserver itself crashes then the entire session closes.I&#39;m not sure why GNOME screensaver cannot do something like this. Lock screen crashing seems like something inevitable (especially considering buggy graphic card drivers and so on), and it makes sense to prepare for it so that crashes won&#39;t bypass the screen locker."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone know why lockscreens in Linux have been such a joke? I remember trying Ubuntu couple years ago and when waking up my laptop it would show me my entire desktop with all the information displayed right there in the open for about 10-20 seconds before suddenly engaging the lockscreen. All you had to do was close the lid and open it again and you could just copy whatever was on the screen before the lock screen appeared. I guess it&#39;s because the lockscreen was a separate process that had to start up? Still, what an awful awful design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago I taught a high school typing class in a K-12 school.  The school didn&#39;t have the funds to get a commercial typing program so I wrote my own typing program.  It evolved over time with features to help me track the students&#39; progress etc.  One day we had a school open house where all the parents could come to school.  We had a bunch of different activities set up in different classrooms and I ended up getting assigned to the 3rd grade classroom to set up my typing program so anyone coming through could test their typing speed.  It was a DOS program and I didn&#39;t want people using anything other than my typing program, so I modified it so you couldn&#39;t quit the typing program.  Over the course of the day the 3rd graders were hanging out in their homeroom not really doing anything productive.  Of course the computer was a novel attraction and they were just smashing keys and exploring my program&#39;s UI.  Eventually at one point I noticed that they had somehow crashed my program with a segfault in what had otherwise become a pretty stable piece of software.  To this day I have absolutely no idea what the bug was."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s important to note the reason the President has the power to pardon anyone for any reason is it&#39;s one of the checks and balances, the Constitution is full of them. It&#39;s meant as a check to blunt overzealous prosecutions.Note that the President does not have the corresponding power to convict anyone.An interesting set of pardons was when Andrew Johnson pardoned all the rebels in the Confederacy, including Jefferson Davis.As far as I know, the only Confederate officers convicted and hanged were the ones running the POW camps. The crime was the brutal way they ran them, not rebellion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think some (maybe vim experts) jumped a bit too quickly to vimtutor.  In some regard, I agree.  But I tried the initial exercise on my 8 year old and was impressed, so I purchased to have access to the rest.  I&#39;d say I&#39;m a sub-par intermediate vim user - knowing enough to know that I don&#39;t know or use the true power of vim day to day, but have memorized a few &#34;tricks&#34; that seem to impress basic vim users.  Hoping I can leverage this to break a few bad habits I&#39;ve gotten into.  Nice UI and I think the pricing is fair.  Hopefully the content expands, but even if the service isn&#39;t around more than a few years I feel like the $15 will have been worth it.  Nice work!Edit: question for Kenneth - do you plan on expanding the content?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While working on Pebble, we ran into a lot of issues as we tried to enable messaging from the watch. For example, we never figured out how to send an iMessage or WhatsApp reply. While digging around for a solution to that problem, I thought it was odd that no one had built a Adrium/Trillian/Meebo chat app for modern chat networks. I buried that thought for a while, until I learned about Matrix two years ago.Matrix is the holy grail of chat. It&#39;s end-to-end encrypted by default, federated and open source. The only problem is that not a single one of my friends or family was on it! Luckily the Matrix folks had already envisioned a solution to this problem - they built an API enabling &#39;bridges&#39; between Matrix and other chat networks. This struck a chord with me, maybe we could finally build a single app that I could use to chat with all my friends, regardless of which chat app they used. Through the Matrix community I met Tulir, the most prolific bridge developer and we started working together on what would become Beeper. I&#39;ve been using it as my primary chat client for almost 2 years now. I could not imagine going back to the hot mess of 12 different chat apps I had before!Beeper is a paid service because I think it aligns interests between us and our users. We make a featureful and secure app, in exchange you pay us money. For those who prefer to self-host, you can run the entire Beeper backend stack on your own server. The vast majority of the code we&#39;ve written for Beeper is open source on gitlab.com/nova. Our desktop client is closed source, but you can use Element (or any open source Matrix client) if you prefer. See our FAQ for more info or I&#39;d be happy to explain more."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First of all, I&#39;ve never heard of PING.Second:&gt; Concerned that web privacy issues were being routinely ignored by many working groups of the W3C, the Privacy Interest Group sought to expand its charter, such that it would have the ability to block any new technical specification that it felt would have negative implications for web privacy.This wasn&#39;t just that Google &#34;vetoed&#34; a new privacy standard, they actually just vetoed the group&#39;s ability to &#34;veto&#34; future standards.Everyone voted for it, except Google.  And that was enough to block it.To Google engineers: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VImnpErdDzA"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The title seems a bit misleading.  If I read this right, Google didn&#39;t veto a privacy proposal- it veto&#39;d giving an interest group within the WC3 &#34;the ability to block any new technical specification that it felt would have negative implications for web privacy.&#34;It&#39;s still probably bad, I&#39;m quite prepared to believe the spirit of the headline (that google is anti-privacy), but it doesn&#39;t seem like this is a case of google directly hurting privacy in web standards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is precisely why I&#39;m so disappointed in Microsoft for choosing Chromium for Edge. This only gives Google more power to run roughshod over user privacy. I would&#39;ve much rather seen them adapt WebKit or Gecko for Edge. Chromium doesn&#39;t need to be any more powerful.At least will still have Firefox and WebKit to prevent Google from having total reign over user piracy on the web."</p>

They immediately understood the seriousness of the problem and took prompt action to get a fix shipped, thus preventing quite the disaster for the users of this product.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Apple Silicon chips are one of the first desktop chips that are a heterogeneous design with distinct performance and efficiency cores. We’re revising much of our core threading and thread pooling architecture to handle the distinction better, improve efficiency, and eventually be able to schedule less performance-critical tasks on the efficiency cores.I found this bit interesting.  Likely more prevalent in mobile apps, but perhaps shifting desktop code to Big.Little approach and using core affinity will result in a lot less wasted energy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any way to select the core &#34;pelvic floor&#34; muscles (or whatever their technical name is)?Beyond anything to do with incontinence, my understanding is that they are intimately involved with back pain and are one of the most important muscle groups to strengthen, as flexing them (or not) influences the position of most other parts of the body.  (When people say &#34;walk tall&#34;, what they really mean is &#34;turn your pelvic floor muscles on&#34;.)Maybe it&#39;s just assumed that you must use your pelvic floor / core to do any exercise with good form?"</p>

Particularly for the hips and calves, but the abdominals and spinal muscles are myriad, and addressing back problems involves addressing them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blog post author here. Since this post, there&#39;s now an option available for DRM-enabled Electron. However, it&#39;s only available through a single vendor, castLabs [0].This is a closed source, downstream effort which means no modifications can be made to Electron itself. All changes must make it upstream to show up in this fork. When asked whether they would eventually merge it upstream, they didn&#39;t provide a clear answer [1].I also wrote a followup blog post with more detail on the current state of DRM options on the web [2]. Spoilers: it&#39;s not great.Regardless of all of these problems, I still hold an interest in browser development and have been working towards making Electron a viable option for building a browser [3].[0] https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases[1] https://github.com/castlabs/electron-releases/discussions/24[2] https://blog.samuelmaddock.com/posts/the-end-of-indie-web-br...[3] https://github.com/samuelmaddock/electron-browser-shell"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t this just how DRM works? It&#39;s precisely why so many were concerned about EME being adopted into web standards, and why so many are passionate about DRM-Free media. DRM is designed to put restrictions on where, when, and how media is played, including what software it&#39;s used with.This doesn&#39;t invalidate any of the author&#39;s points, and they&#39;re right to be upset. But the problem isn&#39;t Chrome per se, it&#39;s DRM-encumbered media.And that&#39;s why I buy audiobooks from Libro.fm†, games from GOG†, and (out of necessity) movies and TV shows from iTunes—which are still DRM&#39;d by default but are at least relatively easy to decrypt.----------† Among others, I don&#39;t use any one source."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not sure if this is covered under Widevine, but Google also blocks anything that is not a major browser from logging into any of its services.https://security.googleblog.com/2019/04/better-protection-ag..."</p>
