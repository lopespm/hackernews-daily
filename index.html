								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A modern circuit simulator, that has a fully featured programable API, that can be run from a real modern programming language, would be a dream.
Every simulator i have used has been pretty limited in that way, or at least those features were not well advertized.
Even the insanely expensive ones.
I mean the most expensive ones (like $100K liscense type deals, like Cadence) are if anything even less modern from a user interaction perspective.My first academic paper 
(https://www.oxinabox.net/publications/White2015PsoTransistor...) was based on doing a search over parameters for the transistors being used in a circuit.
The way that whole thing work was by string mangling the netlist file to update the parameters.
Triggering the simulator on the commandline.
Getting it to output a CSV of the signals.
Parsing that CSV, and detecting edges and then measuring timing that way.
Then throwing it at a particle swarm optimizer to fine a new one.
That sucks from a user experience.
It&#39;s a super cool way to  solve problems though.
that would be so easy with a real API.Further, with julia being a differnetiable programming language, rather than having to use a particular swarm optimizer to search, I could have been differentiating it, and using some sophisticated gradient descent like LBGFS etc.I hope that some of the general tools like this will be an outcome of this project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Call me skeptical but to claim 1000x improvement for circuit simulation is at least hyperbole or outright lying. I will love to be proven wrong though. This by the fact that Julia is still depending on third party numerical libraries, e.g. OpenBLAS that depends on faster numerical languages like Fortran.If you want to see next generation circuit simulation and automation that already working check out JITX. The simulator is using their advanced LB Stanza language which similar if not better than Julia[1]. This is the same team from Berkeley that proposed CHISEL and FIRRTL.Other promising efforts on next generation digital and analog circuit design are from MLIR by LLVM team and LLHD from ETH Zurich [2][3].[1]http://lbstanza.org/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have opinions about writing. So does Mr. Graham.What our opinions have in common is that they are not falsifiable. Unless we validate our conjectures with empirical evidence, we&#39;re really just sharing our taste.&#34;Oh no,&#34; you may say, &#34;I have tested it, and when I write a longer essay, my retweets and upvotes decline.&#34; Very well, but the plural of anecdote is not &#39;data.&#39;Somewhere else on the Internet, there is someone with poetic, dense writing. When they simplify it, their audience dries up.Writers and audiences find each other. If you try to measure the effect of your writing using only an audience that has selected your writing voluntarily, you are not measuring your effectiveness, you are measuring the degree to which your writing pleases people who already like your writing.Absent a properly constructed empirical approach, we might as well be discussing hemlines and necktie widths."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For grins I pasted PG&#39;s text into the demo readability tool at &lt;https://app.readable.com/text/?demo&gt;.&#39;Write Simply&#39; received an overall grade of &#39;A&#39;, and a very-approachable Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 5.9. It&#39;s said to be readable by 100% of the literate general public, which is only 85% of the full general public.But, out of the 507 words and 38 sentences, 4 sentences were flagged as &#34;very long&#34; (over 30 syllables) and 15 as &#34;long&#34; (over 20 syllables).Two &#39;hard words&#39; – over 12 letters or over 4 syllables – were flagged, somewhat ironically: &#34;unnecessarily intellectual&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Am I the only one not very fond of this style of writing? It&#39;s the constant pauses and hiccups that I&#39;m reading. Four paragraphs into it, and I still don&#39;t get a lot of information about what the author is trying to convey.In good essays, the first and last sentence in a paragraph are often enough to summarize the points. It helps set the context, and makes it much easier for the reader to make a mental map of the overall idea. In this article, its &#34;hiccup&#34; style of writing makes it much harder to build a mental map. You can&#39;t predict where it will go until you fully read the sentence.I usually enjoy reading most of PG essays. For this one, I don&#39;t enjoy reading it, and I stopped reading after paragraph 4."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some of these recipes seem decent if you&#39;re already somewhat experienced and have developed cook&#39;s intuition. Otherwise they&#39;re way too vague. For instance, the chicken parm recipe:- There should be a photo of how to slice the chicken breast. Saying &#34;through their width&#34; isn&#39;t good enough. I had to explain what &#34;lengthwise&#34; was once because my friend cut all the vegetables the exact opposite of it.- Pound with what? A lot of people will come up with very bad answers to this question.- How much flour? How much egg? I&#39;ll bet that plenty of beginners will use a tablespoon of flour or a singular egg- Ditto with oil. Beginners do not know how much oil is necessary to fry stuff- How high heat? You probably want to turn down the heat after the oil starts smoking.- Is there a single mention of adding salt? Sounds like a pretty bland recipeI don&#39;t mean to be too harsh but recipes are hard. There&#39;s a reason why professional recipe developers have developed certain standards like measurements, terms (folding batter, shimmering oil, etc.), and development procedures (cross testing)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Am I the only one who thinks that this concept is perfectly good, and all the things the site doesn&#39;t have are just great further development of the idea?What&#39;s wrong with a &#34;wikipedia for recipes&#34;? I would LOVE that.All the complaints about the quality of the recipes or the lack of more in-depth explaination of each one, some kind of  voting/reputation system for the recipes and for the submitters and the voters, Yes those are all good ideas to make the db more useful than just a db.But you have to start somewhere. How is the core idea here of a public cookbook not fundamentally awesome? I mean hello... GIT. Recipes that are living documents that can be honed over time, complete with viewable history of what changes have been made so you can decide if you agree with them. Branches and forks for all the hundred variations on any given thing. Revisions by better experts than the original submitter of some recipe.So, today on day one it doesn&#39;t already have the benefit of years of contributions and incremental improvements and revisions, Quelle Suprise!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The info about salt is plain wrong. Kosher salt is used for curing meat and as a mainly decorative addition to baking, you don&#39;t need to use it for cooking, it doesn&#39;t dissolve noticably slower in liquids. In fact when most recipes specify a volumetric measurement of salt they mean table salt and if you were to use kosher or sea salt you would be under seasoning due the reduced volume, nothing to do with how quickly it dissolves.You should definitely not be using large grain salt in baking for this reason, unless it is to decorate a finished product.Iodine deficiencies were and are very, very real. They&#39;re also on the rise due to food deserts and rising poverty. Iodised salt largely eliminated iodine deficiencies so people with poor knowledge of the history think they just went away. Most processed food does not contained iodised salt, so table salt is an essential source or iodine for a great many people around the world.Idosing salt was and is one of the greatest public health success stories of the 20th century, do not talk about it like some conspiracy by government."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Brings back some memories because this was the first &#34;large&#34; program available to me for study when I was first learning to program, around 1978.Having talked my way into using the local university EE dept&#39;s 11/45, I found the source tree was mounted (they had a 90MB CDC &#34;washing machine&#34; drive) and decided to print it out on the 132-col Tally dot-matrix printer.Some minutes into this, the sysadmin bursts into the terminal room, angrily asking &#34;who&#39;s running this big print job&#34;.I timidly raise my hand. He asks what I&#39;m printing. I tell him the C compiler source code because I want to figure out how it works.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Plastic card distribution can be extremely frustrating, because the only time you need it to happen is when you don&#39;t actually want it to be needed (fruad, loss, damage, new account, whatever). You just want to fucking buy things, not deal with shipping incompetence, you know?This reminds me of a time I was traveling and had to cancel a lost credit card. I told the card company that I was not at home,was definitely outside of the country, not going to be home, definitely staying at an address that was not the home address listed on the account, wanted the card to be sent to _me_ and not my _home_, gave them my foreign delivery address 5 times over as many weeks, got 5 separate promises that the card was definitely going to reach me at my outside-of-the-country-and-not-at-home location in just a few business days, and the card never showed up. So I just gave up. And then, when I finally went home there were 5 goddamn cards in my mail slot.Honestly this reason alone makes Apple&#39;s purely digital credit card my favorite. Need a new card number? Just push a button. No incompetent shipping divisions with 5 hops and as many business days between you and your ability to buy things when your card number is breached."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in the Netherlands, a country that primarily uses debit cards. I do have a credit card that I rarely use. Only when I buy something in the USA for example.Some years back I moved to a different city. About a year later I wanted to make a purchase with my credit card. I found out it had expired. I rang the bank and asked for a new one. They promised to send it to me. It never arrived. Rang again, got the same promise, and still no card. When I called them the third time, the employee found out my old address was still in their database. Turns out the credit card department had a different client database then the debit card department (who had my new address).To change my address, I had to log in to their site. They weren&#39;t allowed to change it on the phone. As soon I tried to log in, I noticed I forgot my password. When I clicked &#39;reset password&#39;, there was a new surprise: they send the new password by snail mail.... to the old address of course!So I had to go in person to the house I used to live in and explain the situation. I asked them to ring me when the letter with my name on it arrived on their doorstep. Luckily the people who now live in my old house were very nice and gave me the letter!"</p>

    }

with sentinel strings like &#34;\04&#34; and &#34;\0\06&#34; for IPv4 and IPv6-no-zone was rejected.  Sure, this 8 bytes larger for the implicit string length, but its still not terribly large, and the string comparisons in the normal IPv4 / IPv6 case are very cheap (just length and pointer equality checks).  And it doesn&#39;t require opening the unsafe jar.  Was the extra 8 bytes enough to disqualify it?  Or are the authors worried about the fact that this may allocate on each parse of an IPv6-with-zone?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is why I still use a 720p LCD TV from the early 2000s.Am I ever tempted to get a bigger, higher-def, TV? Sure, but then I remember that they&#39;re all &#34;smart&#34; and realize I don&#39;t actually have a problem with how I&#39;m watching TV now.I don&#39;t want smart anything in my house. My lights are hardwired to a switch on the wall. My washer and drier need me to turn dials and push buttons and go ding when they&#39;re done. My fridge has no microprocessor in it.I honestly don&#39;t understand people who want all this internet connected garbage. These things weren&#39;t broke, they don&#39;t need fixing!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s been said many times here over the past few years, and it&#39;ll get said a lot right here today, but rule of thumb: never  enable WiFi on a TV except maybe temporarily to do an update or something. And even then only if it&#39;s absolutely necessary. Get a Roku or an Apple TV or a game console or whatever you want for watching streaming services. Never use what&#39;s built in to the TV, not just for privacy reasons but because it always seems to be a terrible experience compared to running Hulu, Netflix, etc. on anything else. But for privacy too- the TV companies were incredibly egregious about privacy years ago and AFAICT it&#39;s only gotten worse since then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At this stage, these threads are getting kind of boring, it&#39;s clear that almost all manufacturers are in a race to the bottom in terms of cost - and now the only way that they can compete on price is by bundling adverts into your internet connected set.All talk of &#34;voting with your wallet&#34; doesn&#39;t work when there are literally no &#34;smart&#34; consumer sets that can compete on features and are without adverts.If you really wish to have your smart TV connected to the internet - I&#39;ve listed some of the adservers that you can block at : https://factory-reset.com/wiki/Smart_TV_Adverts - however this is also going to be a tiresome game, as manufacturers will just seek to find more creative ways to serve adverts.The reality is though, if you want to avoid this behaviour - buy the set that has the screen that you want and only connect it to the internet if you wish to do a software update. Only software update if your set has a bug that the advertised firmware actually fixes, as newer updates tend to add more &#34;features&#34; - adverts, slower apps etc etc. Use something like and AppleTV or a Roku device connected via HDMI if you really need smart features - but be aware even the likes of Roku / Nvidia Shield / FireTV will at some point in the future also be serving you adverts.I&#39;ve also heard that some sets are trying to find open wifi networks - if you are really that worried, cut the traces on the wifi card inside the set and hope that manufacturers don&#39;t start to use ethernet over HDMI."</p>
