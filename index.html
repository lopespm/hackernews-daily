								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tangentially related, but I&#39;m reminded a little bit of Desert Bus, which was an unreleased bideo game from the mid-90s which was designed to be the most annoying video game to play.The idea is that you&#39;re driving a bus from Tucson to Las Vegas in real time. The maximum speed of the bus is 45 mph so it takes about eight hours. The bus constantly tilts right so you have to constantly correct it&#39;s course, otherwise you&#39;ll drive off the road and have to be towed back (also in real time).The only break in the monotony is a bug that splats on the windshield at around hour 5."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Okay so I got to the wrap-up at the end, about &#34;why did nobody else find this&#34;, the author sets up some logical dominoes but doesn&#39;t knock them down. Allow me to try:Earlier in the article, the author mentions that they recently upgraded some network hardware, and the problem seemed to become more frequent after that.Packet loss or other network issues would force the stack to fall out of fast-path and update the counter, avoiding the bug.Running over ssh would avoid the bug. The only time you&#39;d run rsync not over ssh would be within your own network.So it sounds like (this is my conjecture here) this would only appear to someone running rsync internally, over a high-performance network with no packet loss, and upgrading the switches might&#39;ve finally gotten the network good enough to expose the bug?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who thrives on tracking down rare but annoying bugs in a debugger, I love stories like this. It is not just bugs that cause real failures which can be headaches; but also bugs that just slow things down unexpectantly. They can sometimes go undetected for decades like this one.I wrote an article this past year that talks about silent bugs that slowly eat resources and collectively can be very expensive in terms of wasted time and energy: https://didgets.substack.com/p/finding-and-fixing-a-billion-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love when you&#39;re using open source software and can find the bug yourself, even if it&#39;s deep down the stack.Imagine if this bug were somewhere in closed source software. You&#39;d have to reach out to the software&#39;s customer support team. Every time I reach out to customer support I expect to have an unpleasant experience. It is rarely otherwise."</p>

More context is on wikipedia:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vogtle_Electric_Generating_Pla...The site has two nuclear reactors already, in use since the 80&#39;s.  3 and 4 are each 1250 MWe reactors.By way of comparison, the Zaporizhzhia NPP (largest in Europe) has 6 950 MWe reactors.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Did a little more reading on Wikipedia, and found this bit of &#34;oof&#34;[0]:&gt; Cost overruns at Vogtle and the cancellation of Summer [Nuclear Generating Station in South Carolina] led to Westinghouse&#39;s bankruptcy in 2017.This raises a somewhat-scary question: in this case, Westinghouse&#39;s bankrupt remains were bought out by a private equity firm, and they presumably took on Westinghouse&#39;s obligations toward in-progress nuclear plant construction, but... what if that hadn&#39;t been the case?  What if Westinghouse had just completely failed and ceased operations?  Who would support the remainder of projects like Vogtle 3 &amp; 4, and ongoing maintenance for the next however-many decades?I guess a company in a heavily-regulated sector like this must have some sort of succession plan, but it&#39;s not clear to me how this would work, in the case of e.g. the company going bankrupt, and all the staff with institutional knowledge about a reactor design dispersing to various other companies.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m quite familiar with this whole lawsuit, and I still think it&#39;s total and complete bullshit (and, to be clear, I have huge concerns about Google&#39;s tracking and surveillance).Incognito Mode basically puts you in a mode as if you had installed a fresh, new instance of the browser every time, e.g. none of your past cookies can be accessed by any websites. Websites, though, can still use analytics APIs, including things like Google Analytics, to track you within that Incognito Mode session. They may also be able to correlate you by, for example, matching your IP address. And, to be clear, the Incognito Mode new window has always made this clear.I can still be really concerned about Google&#39;s overall tracking and also point out this lawsuit is a bullshit money grab from lawyers hoping for a lotto payout."</p>

It is, in fact, reasonable for naive users to expect that their identity would be concealed while using &#34;incognito mode&#34;, Google&#39;s disclaimers to the contrary notwithstanding.&#34;What?  Everyone should have known that we didn&#39;t literally mean &#39;incognito&#39;!&#34;Luckily, every company&#39;s engineers can be counted on to point out the irony of the company&#39;s marketing bullshit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(I work on Stripe Billing).  This is a question we raise fairly regularly internally at Stripe. The real, prosaic answer is because when we started working on Stripe Billing in 2017, Stripe had already built an internal billing system to bill its own customers. Stripe was 7 years old at that point.At the time, we got lots of feedback from the folks who had built that system. Our goal was to build a flexible billing system for all kinds of companies at different sizes, but we were definitely focused on smaller (doing maybe $100k–$10M of ARR) SaaS companies to start. We&#39;ve come a long way since then and now power billing for a number of large/public companies. Atlassian, Figma, Notion and Slack are either using or migrating onto Stripe Billing today.Stripe Billing is a powerful tool with a role to play in any company&#39;s revenue management system, including Stripe&#39;s. Newer Stripe products (such as Atlas) do build on top of Stripe Billing but we haven&#39;t gotten around to migrating our existing stack. That said, I do have a personal goal of taking on more internal billing responsibilities over time (e.g. I think we could easily use Stripe Invoices internally today, and it&#39;s mostly opportunity cost keeping us from actually doing so).I do want to say that the specific use case covered in the post is something we have thought about a lot. I think about it as a pipeline with stages for collecting high volumes of usage events, aggregating them, mapping them to rate cards based on usage, and then producing recurring bills, collecting payment, dunning, etc... The post claims we don’t do a good job on the first two stages (collecting usage events and aggregating them) is perhaps missing that the style of percentage-based fees is a one-line addition to a Connect integration as my colleague edwinwee mentioned below.  It is also possible to have a scalable usage event collection/aggregation pipeline integrated with Stripe Billing.  You can read this AWS blog post https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/apn/building-a-third-party-saas... for information about how to build such a system according to our best practices.While I’m here, I’m always eager to hear feedback on Stripe Billing from folks who are using it.  My email is ark@stripe.com."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work at an HR/Payroll company with a phenomenal app that we put our blood, sweat, and tears into every single day. And every single day I clock in with Oracle Time and Labor. There&#39;s a legal reason for this and we do it for compliance. I&#39;m guessing Stripe is in the same boat with this product despite its flaws."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First off, yes, Stripe uses Stripe to bill our own customers. In fact, for our larger customers who have negotiated complex pricing plans, we&#39;re currently migrating much of our manual billing to a system that&#39;s inspired by Stripe Billing.Second, this article seems to miss the point of Stripe. It seems to want to build a platform, which is what Stripe Connect is designed for.For example, charging a percentage fee is just one line (https://stripe.com/docs/api/application_fees):` $application_fee_percent = 5`Slack, Atlassian, and Notion have all built their B2B billing on top of Stripe. But we don&#39;t target just B2B or B2C ecommerce in case a business has multiple revenue streams (which many businesses are increasingly adding). In fact, we designed Billing so it can flex across any business model—per-seat, usage-based, tiered, or even graduated.This is the point of Stripe. A single stack that flexes with your business as it grows and pricing that&#39;s public."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that isn&#39;t really covered in this article is relevance calculations.A surprising (to me) thing about PostgreSQL FTS is that it doesn&#39;t do TF/IDF or BM25 relevance calculations.These calculations take statistics about the entire corpus into account - they do things like ranking a document higher if it contains terms from the search which are statistically rare in the overall corpus.PostgreSQL FTS uses how often the search terms appear in the document as part of the ranking score, but doesn&#39;t look at how common/rare individual terms are. https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/textsearch-controls....OpenSearch/Elasticsearch uses BM25: https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/rest-api/expla...SQLite stores these kinds of statistics and can support BM25 or TF/IDF or custom ranking functions. I wrote more about that here: https://simonwillison.net/2019/Jan/7/exploring-search-releva...Meilisearch does something a bit different (on reading this I don&#39;t think it considers full corpus statistics, but I may be misinterpreting that): https://docs.meilisearch.com/learn/core_concepts/relevancy.h...It looks like Typesense only considers the documents, not the overall corpus: https://typesense.org/docs/guide/ranking-and-relevance.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In case you skip to the comments like I usually do, this post is a light comparison of Postgres FTS vs:  - MeiliSearch: https://www.meilisearch.com/
  - OpenSearch: https://opensearch.org/
  - SQLite FTS: https://www.sqlite.org/fts5.html
  - Typesense: https://typesense.org/

Some of the callouts from the results:  - Even when consuming similar content, engines can produce different results, but generally ratios between queries on the same engine should be consistent.
  - Postgres FTS is quite close performance-wise to many other solutions, at least in their default configuration.
  - Only Typesense and MeiliSearch properly handled mis-spellings (the &#34;suprman&#34; query).
  - Typesense was relatively strict with matches compared to other engines.
  - OpenSearch was very fast with ingest, but also failed with the misspelling out of the box.
  - In-memory SQLite is by far the fastest, and PG isn&#39;t too far behind for this small data set."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty much all these engines (and PG) are fast enough.Gist/Gin indexes are great and do a fine job to make millions of records searchable in very few milliseconds.The problem is accuracy.I’ve tried a few of these and accuracy is wildly different with most of them.Accuracy depends on how much you index.For example, even with decently designed weighting: If you index title, subtitle, tags and content — too much of content ruin relevancy.And yes, we have proper relevancy sorting setup nicely.The best is something like elastic search, but it does not integrate nicely with PG for our use case. Because of the multi tenant nature of our data setup.PG will get us to that magic 80% but that leaves the all important 20% which is not great.Not to mention the inability to index and search Asian character sets.So even though we exclusively use it, it’s not great and every time our team can’t find something that drives my team into the Psql CLI — I start searching for alternatives again.The big brick wall is updating, inserting and deleting from an external solution fast enough so we don’t miss stuff.And quickly searching multi tenant records in that external solution.And no I’m not ready to use ES as my primary database."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey HN!Plane came from our desire to build tools that have the low friction to use of running in the browser, but use more memory and compute than the browser will allocate. The basic idea is to run a remote background process, connect to it over WebSocket, and stream data.This ends up being a surprisingly useful primitive to have, and it&#39;s been used to:- Pixel-stream X11 applications to the browser over WebRTC[1]- Run IDEs and notebooks- Power Figma-style realtime collaboration backends (including https://rayon.design).Here&#39;s a direct link to our repo: https://github.com/drifting-in-space/plane and docs: https://plane.dev/[1] https://twitter.com/drifting_corp/status/1552773567649091584"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A related and also very useful usage pattern: &#34;backend instance per customer&#34;.Because…There are many ways to implement multi-tenant SaaS; but a highly underrated approach is to write a single tenant app, then use infrastructure to run an instance of it per (currently logged in) customer. Plus a persistent database per customer of course.This has the tremendous advantage that you can add another column to your pricing page easily: the &#34;bring a truckload of money and we will set you up to run this behind your firewall&#34; tier. There are still a lot of orgs out there, large ones with considerable financial capacity, who really want this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The implementation makes some weird choices like rebuilding a bunch of services like DNS, cert, weird dependency on SQLite. Wish people would stop reimplementing Kubernetes and just build on top of it.I think &#34;per-user&#34; is probably the wrong killer feature for something like this. Much more potential in shared distributed processes that support multiple users (chat, CRDT/coauthoring). Appears that the underlying layer can probably do that.In any case, super cool idea, and I hope something like this lands in the serverless platforms from all the major cloud providers. It&#39;s always been mind blowing to me that Google Cloud Functions supports websockets without allowing you to route multiple incoming connections from different users to the same process. That simple change would unlock so many useful scenarios."</p>
