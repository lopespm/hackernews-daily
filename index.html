								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My first software dev job was in the 90&#39;s writing PHP for a mom and pop ISP that was trying to get into app development. It was originally supposed to be Perl, the job interview was something like:Me: demos CRUD app for keeping track of my record collection, hosted on a free siteOwner: You wrote this?Me: Yeah.Owner: This is in Perl?Me: Yeah.So I got hired. The day I got there, he told me they were going to use PHP instead of Perl. Sure, cool, whatever. He told me that I had to start being productive in the first couple weeks or he would have to let me go, couldn&#39;t afford to keep people that weren&#39;t working out. I was down with that. He had some HTML pages that he had created in a WYSIWYG editor, I think it was Dreamweaver, and I was going to add some PHP scripting to those pages.How hard could that be?So I get to work and open these HTML files and I don&#39;t even remember exactly, I think like the login page HTML was 20 pages of code long, maybe I&#39;m exaggerating, I&#39;ve blocked most of it out of my memory but I seem to remember nested tables inside of nested tables inside of nested tables with spacer GIFs and &amp;nbsp;s all over the place and I remember looking at it and thinking: What. The. Actual. Fuck.But I did it! I managed to get the guy to take a look at what the editor he was using actually created and get him to simplify some things, I fixed a few bugs and was working on features and he came in around noon and told me you know what I said about being productive in the first few weeks? Forget about that, we&#39;re good.The week before I was doing manual labor in a factory. It was like going from the 1800s to the 2000s over a weekend. I made $9 an hour, less than I was making stacking boxes on pallets, but of course totally worth it in the long run. Good times."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I miss the good ol’ days. Today we have abstractions on top of abstractions on top of JavaScript, of all thingsIt seems I learnt HTML just between these two eras. After the &amp;nbsp;, 1px spacers and tables, and before the piles of abstractions.People cared about doing well formed XHTML and having those W3C Valid XHTML badges, and also those &#34;install Firefox&#34; buttons.This was short so today everything looks ugly to me, old and new, in different ways.I still use (polyglot) XHTML5 (HTML5 if I don&#39;t control everything being input) and avoid frontend frameworks and web fonts when I get to decide. This is a world where implementing a search bar for people who haven&#39;t discovered CTRL+F yet takes 30 lines of dumb Javascript and filters 200 items in 1 second on a slow computer without any caching trick and that does not require minifiers and bundlers. Which does not actually sound impressive, or shouldn&#39;t anyway. A world where when you disable Javascript, the page is still perfectly readable. A world where a silly mistake in the HTML markup is noticed.To build an actual web application where it does not makes much sense to have the content as a web page, I started liking Svelte but I&#39;ll still at least consider doing things by manipulating the DOM directly before deciding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow. That took me back. All those things, every day. And table layouts of course. And let&#39;s not forget slicing images, and slapping those into tables too. If I remember rightly, Photoshop had an &#34;export to slices&#34; thing built in. Amazing. Loved it.And of course one of the biggest issues with today&#39;s web: you can&#39;t just view source and copy paste. You&#39;re in the land of chasing back up CSS files, js libraries, or finding yourself unable to steal an image because it&#39;s not just an image you can right click on any more.Golden times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been to Shenzhen and seen (been taught) how they reball BGAs for phones in the markets, none of that futzing about with solder balls - they just clean the pads on the chips, re-tin them, lots of flux, then place the steel pad stencil over the top of the pads, spread solder paste over and through the holes, wipe off any excess then hit it with some hot air until you see the balls form, if you do it right the stencil will just pop off (don&#39;t push it)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funny I just saw this thread, today I learned that my integrated (not removeable) XPS 15 9570 laptop battery just died just a few months after my warranty expired on my Dell XPS laptop... The Internet is littered with complaints about dell PCs failing after warranty, and how recalls are covered up on them frequently.And my XPS desktop had faulty connections on it&#39;s mother board (That were known by Dell even before I bought it) for the Hard Drive controller that I discovered just after the warranty replacement expired on it... 2 problems that lead to costly repair and buying expensive replacement parts.... I have a 10 year old Dell XPS 16 that still runs (granted only windows7), but I never had any problems with it.... XPS quality has declined greatly since my first one.The standard 1 year warranty isn&#39;t enough for the way Dell computers have become shoddy, I&#39;m deeply disappointed in Dell, and will not be buying any more of them... I don&#39;t have time to build my own, does anyone know a rock solid/powerful brand I can buy instead of Dell? I kind of miss Micron PCs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am reminded of an organization I read about years ago with the tag line &#34;Seeing like a mountain.&#34; It was founded by someone who noticed that excess deer were stripping the mountain of vegetation and they concluded that reintroducing wolves was important for creating a sustainable environment.In the US, deer-vehicle collisions make deer the deadliest animal for people that we have in this country.https://www.worldatlas.com/articles/10-deadliest-animals-in-...In the US: Deer–vehicle collisions lead to about 200 human deaths and $1.1 billion in property damage every year.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deer%E2%80%93vehicle_collisi...Part of my incomplete BS in Environmental Studies was a class in quantifying the economic value of natural resources. I did a case study on wetlands in the San Francisco Bay Area that are currently quietly being threatened by the county rail plan.The US used to pay people to fill in swamps and create &#34;productive&#34; land and then learned that swamps do useful and valuable things of various sorts. We updated the name from swamp to wetlands, overhauled their public image and reversed policy. We now protect and restore such areas.Quantifying the economic value to humans of a natural resource is a good means to convince people it needs protecting and it is in your best interest to protect it. This is not &#34;charity&#34; and shouldn&#39;t be viewed as a sacrifice.We are cutting our own throats when we ruin the world because of fixation on some overly simplified idea that it needs to put money directly into our pockets for humans to care about it. One of the best ways to fight such entrenched ideas is to quantify just how much it costs us to think that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really cool article. They show that Wolves create a “landscape of fear” which reduces deer engagement with roads. So wolves do what hunters can’t; not just reducing populations but also changing behavior. Kind of creepy, if you are a deer!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hitting the deer is just the beginning.We were driving on a semi-wilderness highway when a medium-sized deer staggered up from a deep drainage ditch on the same side of the road, about 50 yards ahead. Managed to slow from 65-70 to 50 mph before hitting the animal, which slid along the highway and into the deep ditch on the other side.The slowdown helped limit the van&#39;s damage to $10,000, but it was undriveable. Even if we somehow removed the hood (bent in two over the unbroken windshield), all the fluid had ran out of the crushed radiator and into the semi-wilderness ditch.Luckily it was a hot July afternoon, and a truck going the opposite way came along in 15 minutes. The driver put the deer out of its misery. Had it been in the winter, after sundown, it might have taken hours just to be found.Happened in the 1990s (no mobiles), so we waited for a vehicle heading toward the nearest little town to find a tow -truck. With the van towed to that town (no repair shop), it was another hour before relatives arrived from the bigger town (that tow-truck had a repair shop).The insurance company paid for the repair, then dropped the policy. I never drove that route after noon again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Note that most of the performance improvements come from PGO, which is enabled with following environment variables. PGO is not enabled in .NET 6 by default, but will be in .NET 7 IIRC.  set DOTNET_ReadyToRun=0 
  set DOTNET_TieredPGO=1 
  set DOTNET_TC_QuickJitForLoops=1

Here are my own benchmarks from a CPU intensive application without any IO and already optimized for allocations. Application runs a task graph either serially or in parallel.  .NET 5
  --------------------------
  |      Method |     Mean |
  |------------ |---------:|
  | RunParallel | 473.4 us |
  |         Run | 513.5 us |

  .NET 6
  --------------------------
  |      Method |     Mean |
  |------------ |---------:|
  | RunParallel | 452.5 us |
  |         Run | 499.8 us |

  .NET 6 PGO
  --------------------------
  |      Method |     Mean |
  |------------ |---------:|
  | RunParallel | 381.8 us |
  |         Run | 412.2 us |

  .NET 5 - .NET 6     -&gt; ~5%
  .NET 5 - .NET 6 PGO -&gt; ~20%

Here is what I learned from micro-optimizing a .NET application:- Use BenchmarkDotNet[0] for general measurements and Visual Studio profiler tools for detailed inspection. They help a lot.- Memory allocations matter. Using capturing lambdas, LINQ, even foreach on interfaces introduce allocations and slows down the application. You can use ClrHeapAllocationAnalyzer[1] to find these hidden allocations.- Using abstractions with interfaces and casting back to concrete types cause some overhead, though PGO will probably eliminate most of these.- Use LINQ cautiously as its variants are mostly slower than explicit coding. E.g. .Any() vs .Count == 0- Checking Logger.IsEnabled() before calling Logger.Debug() etc. helps a lot. You can even automate this with Fody [2], but it breaks Edit&amp;Continue and possibly .NET Hot Reload too, so it may hinder your productivity.[0] https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet[1] https://github.com/microsoft/RoslynClrHeapAllocationAnalyzer[2] https://github.com/jorisdebock/LoggerIsEnabled.Fody"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the same vein as what Linus is trying to do now at LTT, it would be useful if there was a &#34;programming journalism&#34; lab which builds &#34;test benches&#34; to create canonical benchmarks and verify the claims made on tech blogs (etc.).Eg., highly standardised docker builds, on highly standardised hardware, running popular tasks using popular libraries for each &#34;programming tech&#34; (eg., website, stat modelling, event system, ...)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The speed-up very much depents on the (micro)benchmark in use. I did some measurements using the Are-we-fast-yet benchmark suite which includes both micro and larger benchmarks and got an overall speed-up (geometric mean of factors) of only 2% on x86 and even a little speed-down on x64.See https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Mono-CLR-really-slower-than-Cor... and http://software.rochus-keller.ch/Are-we-fast-yet_results_win... for the details."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me, this study has a few &#34;smells&#34; that makes it dubious:&gt; We collected cross-sectional data between November 2019 and July 2020 from
self-selected respondents recruited via media related to psychedelic use such as podcasts and online psychedelic
research conference presentations.This is already a significant bias in participants.&gt; Mental health was assessed with the questions “Do you currently have any psychological, mental health or
addiction concerns?” Participants who endorsed concerns identified specific mental health and substance use
categories from a drop down menu, and were allowed to select more than one categorySo mental health is not actually accessed medically and simply self-reported.To be clear I lack an informed opinion on microdosing psychedelics, but any study that picks its participant from a community engaging in X to study X but then uses the same community to sample their control group (for lack of a better expression) is questionable.EDIT: Page 6 has a table that compare microdosers/non-microdosers and the latter was actually less likely to self-report *any* mental health or substance use problem by 5%. It&#39;s only when using the DASS-21 subscales that they can draw the conclusion that non-microdosers are more anxious, depressed or stressed. Their microdosers/non-microdosers ratio is also almost 1:1."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This study is non-blinded, non-RCT based on individuals who self-selected through social media, self reporting symptoms through an app.While I&#39;m hopeful that psychedelics may prove to be a treatment for some mental health issues, but this study doesn&#39;t tell us much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I replied something similar elsewhere, but I think the real story here is about using tech to administer large scale studies and what that could mean for future research.A lot of people here are discounting the fact that this study would typically be very hard (or impossible) to administer at such a large scale, especially in such a short amount of time.In my mind, the important questions here are:Are the benefits of massive scale studies worth the trade-offs of self-reporting?What can we do to reduce or eliminate those trade-offs?Imagine the scientific value of having easily created, easily administered, massive studies be easily accessible to any research group. If the research data can be made even a little bit more reliable (direct mobile health-kit measurements for example), that&#39;s hugely valuable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For over 25 years I wondered why social events drained me and what neurological phenomenon the metaphor &#34;energy&#34; stood for (which this article and many others like it don&#39;t seem to bother investigating). I&#39;ve recently come to realize that it&#39;s the extent to which you see other human beings as a threat, which causes your brain to keep its &#34;shields up&#34;, which can feel exhausting. After a observing myself a lot during social interactions, I&#39;ve noticed that I feel drained to the extent I think the people around me can potentially judge me: I feel highly drained during extended family events, class reunions or ceremonies, but I feel perfectly fine amongst a small group of friends who have a don&#39;t-give a-sh*t attitude toward social propriety. I&#39;ve also noticed that alcohol (a disinhibitor) can dramatically reduce the drain. It&#39;s also significantly reduced if I find a table with a few people I like, and get engrossed in a deep discussion and end up forgetting that I&#39;m surrounded by other tables.Perhaps this energy we speak of is the energy the brain expends to continuously compute the requirements of the social contract in members of our species who don&#39;t have it sufficiently hardwired."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who typically gets their energy depleted around people, there are certain people that increase my energy. There are also times where I almost need to interact with people on a biological level.Listening to my body is the thing that weirdly, used to take up a lot of energy because I wasn’t used to/ allowed to as a child. So I was constantly making difficult real-time decisions.As an adult, I’ve learned how to listen to my body and crucially adhering to it’s signals. As someone who like to think, perhaps too much, its the best investment I’ve ever made."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Technically introversion refers to people whose dominant cognitive function[1] has an “internal model” of the world, vs. extraversion where the world is the model.Introverts need down time because it takes processing time to update the internal model in response to stimuli.Extraverts don’t like being alone because when the world around them is empty “nothing is happening”.It’s not the enjoyment of company or solitude that makes us introverted or extraverted.[1] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_Types"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You know what Amazon did to me? They delisted my product claiming it was counterfeit. Then they started to directly promote and sell my own inventory.I know it was mine because I contacted the brand to check if Amazon had bought from them. They hadn&#39;t. Also, I was the only one selling this item on Amazon so they couldn&#39;t have stolen from someone else. What&#39;s more, I was the only one importing it to the US. I know because I&#39;m acquainted with the brand owners.When I finally managed to get my stuff out of their warehouses, which took almost a year, they admitted that some of the inventory had been &#34;lost&#34; and compensated me pennies on the dollar.It was a surreal, Kafkaesque, experience that still brings back painful memories. I avoid thinking about it but I hope that one day Amazon will crash, burn, and hopefully never recover."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can tell you a more likely story than &#34;big conspiracy on Amazon&#39;s part&#34;.Amazon has systems in place to say &#34;We cannot ship from X to Y anymore&#34;, but they require manual intervention and maybe those tools don&#39;t get used very much. Until someone finds the right button and presses it, orders are dropping into the warehouse to be fulfilled. Ship this sprocket from Vancouver to Calgary since Calgary&#39;s site has none.But the truck didn&#39;t show up, or maybe it did but now it&#39;s got nowhere to go.Now the dock has one section slowly filling up with packages. It&#39;s been days. Dock doors are a limited resource, and here&#39;s a bunch of them with a mountain of packages blocking them. And the site leadership, well, they have metrics to hit. Just like every other cog in the machine, they will be fired if they don&#39;t make rate. What, you thought it was just the lowly associates who are running with dogs nipping at their heels?What&#39;s a site leader to do? Well, there&#39;s a returns department right here. They&#39;ve got tools that can handle the package being returned, allowing them to restock those items, refund the customers, clear the dock, and make everything go back to normal for the site.Sounds like good &#39;Customer Obsession&#39; to get those orders refunded as quickly as possible.Sellers? Those aren&#39;t customers. Those metrics are not something the leadership needs to worry about, so they won&#39;t."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It was a good idea to post this to HN.  Back when I was an LLVM contributor I was using an email address from a provider who is no longer around.  I had no idea that the LLVM maintainers were trying to get a hold of me.  There&#39;s probably a lot of overlap between LLVM contributors and HN readers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"MAMEdev hit this problem a few years back as well. Thankfully, the end result of code that needed to be ripped out and rewritten ended up being pretty small comparative to the whole project. A lot of that came down to there being no corporate interests involved, so no corp VS author arguments-- the worst ones to deal with were contributors who were adamant about keeping the original non-commercial license on their contributions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It wasn&#39;t clear to me that &#34;the list of remaining individuals and corporations we need to get agreements from&#34; in &#34;Call for help&#34; was a link since it&#39;s not underlined and styled with exactly the same color, font, and font size as normal text. The link points to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/18_0Hog_eSwES8lKwf7WJ... If you know anyone on that list, consider reaching out to them with a link to this blog post."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What does &#34;the most determined attackers&#34; mean in this context?Are we talking the real most determined attackers like the US or China who can easily deploy $10B (i.e. a team of ~3,000 people fulltime for 3 years) for a strategic advantage?Or $1B (i.e. ~300 people for 3 years) which is within reach of every government, international criminal organization, and thousands of multinationals?Or $100M (i.e. ~30 people for 3 years) which is now just a line item for those organizations?Or $10M (i.e. ~3 people for 3 years) which is 10x better than the &#34;gold standard&#34; used by every other bank in the world, but still profitable for small criminal outfits doing ransomware attacks?Are there any legally binding marketing statements made by any associated security executive on where they sit in these 4 orders of magnitudes of &#34;most determined attackers&#34;?It is frankly absurd that we continue to allow statements like &#34;secure&#34;, &#34;reasonably secure&#34;, &#34;most determined&#34;, or whatever without expecting some degree of quantification within 4(!) orders of magnitude. If you can not quantify or demarcate an accurate lower bound within 4 orders of magnitude you probably have no idea what you are doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re interested in how other folks handle super important private keys, I highly suggest reading the IANA documentation on the DNSSEC Root Zone and how they manage that:https://www.iana.org/dnssec/archivehttps://www.iana.org/dnssec/ceremonieshttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UChND9hEeJQjtLDFZ-m8U47A"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish there was a coordinated public service campaign around &#34;Hang up, Look up, Call back&#34;. I feel like if we could really ingrain those 6 words that it would go a long way to blocking these types of phishing scams.Number one thing I tell folks in my security training is to never respond or click a link on an inbound message. Instead, look up your bank or service provider and make an outbound call (or direct URL navigation) to them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s so strange to read this is still happening in US. I live in Europe - 95% of such attacks are prevented by something called Strong Customer Authentication, which anybody  serving or providing access to an account (cards including) must implement. Basically, that&#39;s 2FA implemented in myriad different ways. So, this Zelle thing wouldn&#39;t be possible at all: Zelle would have to ask for a SCA verification from the customer, just to connect/use his/her account in the first place. That would eliminate ground for such scamming messages ever appearing (if the customers knew and were accustomed to SCA).Though to be fair, scamming is still present here, typically involving calling older people and trying to persuade them to reveal bank access codes during a phone call. There two differences with US banks here:
- banks are required never to ask for access credentials over insecure channel (phone/email) (though SMS is also not perfect in this regard);
- banks are required to educate customers that they never ask for such credentials, educate about fraud scenarios, etc. And they do (at least the reputable ones)Seems that the PSD2 regulation (including SCA) are really making payments much safer in Europe when you compare to rest of the world.Also, to admit: I&#39;m a head of financial institution here, quite knowledgeable of the field, both on regulatory and on technical level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I fell for this, and I have never fallen for a computer scam in my life, nor even had so much as a virus in the last two decades.However, it is very sophisticated.  They somehow managed to actually get a fraudulent charge on my card.  When I got the spoofed message from &#34;my bank&#34;, the first thing I did was log onto my legitimate account.  Sure enough, there was a charge I did not recognize.The rest was just a series of unfortunate &#34;rookie&#34; mistakes  on my part.  But the person who called me was highly professional, easily could have been a real customer support representative and spoke English perfectly with no accent.They took the max, $5,000.  My bank thankfully refunded it."</p>
