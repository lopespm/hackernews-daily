								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was prepared to get my pitchfork out, but after reading I&#39;m struggling to connect the dots. This article is scant on details of what illegal or favorable behavior Microsoft is expecting in exchange for money. The only concrete mention is a previous SEC filing that has nothing to do with this whistleblower. The first example about $40k doesn&#39;t seem to explain what Microsoft was actually thinking it would get for that money, let alone whether that money was illegal. At worst, it seemed to violate corporate policy, which I can understand if that got missed in an initial review. The other examples don&#39;t sound like bribery on Microsoft&#39;s part so much as resellers squeezing as much out of a deal as they can get away with. I call that a problem with the reseller model.I imagine Microsoft looks the other way while resellers make lots of money because, realistically, being in some of the markets mentioned is impossible unless you&#39;re connected with the right person. While not necessarily efficient, I wouldn&#39;t call that illegal or even unethical without a lot more detail than this article provides.But maybe I&#39;m missing something. This article reads as poorly researched, and the whistleblower comes off as disgruntled more than ethical.Edit: It&#39;s worth noting that the whistleblower&#39;s original words are a little more well-written than this article [1]. However, it makes the contrast clearer between what is factual vs what is only insinuated.1: https://www.lioness.co/post/microsoft-is-using-illegal-bribe..."</p>

It’s literally one disgruntled former employee claiming this. But as usual for HN these days a tiny populations claim - in this case a population of one - is stated as fact."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would speculate that this is mostly meant to be used for identifying bot rings and ATO (account takeover).  Brand new accounts on a site with open signups are, on average, quite a lot more suspicious than older accounts.  There&#39;s a significant demand for aged accounts to use for various banned activities (mostly spam first and vote manipulation second), and fingerprinting is likely a high value signal in combating it.  Two easy ways to generate aged accounts in bulk - create a whole lot of them and wait (and optionally do some activity on them to make them look real), or take over abandoned or compromised accounts.  Fingerprinting is very good at identifying clusters of the former, and at least helpful for the latter.EFF appears to have rebranded Panopticlick as &#34;Cover Your Tracks&#34;, but it&#39;s usually a fun thing to look at in discussions of this type as an example of what can go into a fingerprint and the informational value of various parts:https://coveryourtracks.eff.org"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"5 of us wrote Microsoft Works for the Macintosh while working at home from 1984 to 1992. Without the internet, we got together as needed to merge code, usually once a month, but sometimes once a week. We talked on the phone. We went to Microsoft once in awhile. It was ideal and worked very well.Maybe it was just our personalities that made it work, but I am astonished that any programmer would rather go into the office. With high speed internet and video conferencing, I assume that some people are just very lonely and need face to face. I see nothing wrong with that. I understand it, but after 1992 I took a job that forced me into an office and I hated it.I can safely say I never wrote any good code while working in an office. There are too many distractions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The coding used by this survey is a joke.  If 40% of an occupation says they work outdoors that&#39;s below 50% so it&#39;s bucketed into the work from home category on that criterion.  I think if even 20% of a job is saying they work outdoors that&#39;s pretty strong evidence you&#39;re missing some information about what the other 80% are doing in their job that prevents it from being a work from home job.  The net result of their setup is obviously a vast overestimate so take the 37% number with a grain of salt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know some companies are trying to get their employees to go back to a hybrid schedule, but for me, I think the bell can&#39;t be unrung.  My company is a f500 company that I would not have thought would remain remote, but we have, and it really helps us hire and retain talent.  It honestly helps us recruit people that would otherwise have sought out trendier employers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The idea that we should classify food by shape is clearly erroneous. Our food classifications should be based on method of eating, not by shape! A sandwich is any food that uses a carbohydrate to protect your hands from a messier food, so that you can eat it at a card table without getting your hands dirty (a la the origin myth). Let&#39;s go through the things here:Pizza: YesSushi: Mostly no (the carbs don&#39;t protect you from the insides, the seaweed does)Pumpkin pie: No (unless eaten with hands, without falling apart)Quesadilla: YesToast sandwich: No (inside is not messier)Victoria sponge: No (eaten with fork)Hot dog: YesSub sandwich: YesSlice of pie: No (unless eaten with hands)Falafel wrap: YesPigs in a blanket: YesEnchilada: No (the one pictured has cheese and sauce on the outside)Quiche: No (unless eaten with hands)Cheesecake: No (unless eaten with hands)Soup bowl: No (I&#39;d love to see you try)Falafel pita: YesDeep dish pizza: If eaten with handsSalad in a bread bowl: NoKey lime pie: No (unless eaten with hands)Calzone: YesCorn dog: No (if held with stick)Pie (whole): No (good luck)Dumplings: Yes (unless they have sauce on them)Pop tarts: YesUncrustables: YesThis is the best and most accurate method that actually provides a strict definition that lines up with my intuitions—the cube rule is fun, but you&#39;re really gonna claim that a subway sandwich isn&#39;t a sandwich?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the cube rule to be naïve in its ignorance of topological spaces. A sandwich is just a cross section of mobius toast.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something that doesn&#39;t seem to have been discussed from the legal angle is this: if one can make any copyright claim about these datasets qualifying as &#34;prior art&#34;, doesn&#39;t that then open itself up for trolls to claim that the datasets infringe on existing prior art? It&#39;s not like I can draw a pikachu, release it to public domain and make a slam dunk legal claim that all other pikachus are henceforth kosher.I think Adam Neely makes a more relevant point in his videos about Dark Horse and Levitating: it doesn&#39;t really matter what any actual infringement claim is because you can typically find relevant prior art from legitimate works of music if you dig deep enough, even without going through the exercise of autogenerating note sequences.As I understand, the legal arguments focus on whether there is a clear and traceable connection between the creative process for a song and the alleged infringed work, and whether there is clear intent to omit credit where it is due. I.e. the argument already starts from the assumption that similarities and inspirations from existing works of art can and do exist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised to learn that copyright doesn&#39;t take into account the length of notes, which to me is part of what makes melodies unique."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a mathematical approach to music, and lacks (from my point of view) what is the mere essence of music : choice.I understand why they want to take back the copyright on music, but they do so in such a geeky way that it seems completely useless to me.Ultimately, musicians will pick good / cool melodies from this dataset, in the same way they do when in front of an instrument.I might be missing the point ?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s worth noting that William Osman stopped producing videos on his YouTube channel due to the fallout of this video.It was a long time coming because he comes off as very aloof and has received criticism about the safety of many other projects, but this one appears to have triggered a lot of outrage.FWIW, I think we need more young, brilliant minds sharing this kind of content. It has the entertainment value needed to capture the interest of young viewers who may not be otherwise interested in engineering disciplines. There are many, many other channels out there (backyard scientist, action lab, Cody’s lab, stuff made here, etc.) who are very successful on YouTube, but they tend to cater to viewers who are deliberately choosing to watch their videos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Steve Yegge tells the story[1] of his dad cooking:&gt; When I was a teenager, my dad and my brother Mike decided to make homemade chili. I&#39;d never seen it made before, and I watched with keen interest as they added beef, beans, some veggies and spices, and other ingredients. Dad would taste it, add some more ingredients, wait a bit, taste it again. My dad has some pretty good recipes. So you can imagine my puzzlement when he opened the cupboard, pulled out 2 cans of Hormel chili, opened them and dumped them in. I waited a respectful moment or two before asking him why he was adding canned chili to his chili.Similarly, I think it detracts a bit from building a home-made x-ray machine if one of the ingredients is an x-ray tube from an old x-ray machine.[1] http://steve-yegge.blogspot.com/2006/10/egomania-itself.html"</p>

This implies these FOBs don&#39;t use them, but per my previous understanding, they do.Perhaps there is more to the setup of this CVE than they&#39;re talking about. Is it possible they&#39;re doing a rolljam attack + replay?The CVE is really scant on details, so while I believe they did manage to get this to work, they don&#39;t really say how.If rolling codes are implemented, it should be pretty simple with the right gear to prove it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be honest, I&#39;m annoyed by the benign protestware messages when they start to get in the way of using the software, particularly on mobile. I was looking at the isomorphic git documentation the other day, and noticed that their &#34;#BlackLivesMatter #DefundThePolice&#34; banner scrolls under the rest of the content, leaving this annoying gap that takes up screen real estate, especially in landscape mode on a phone.[0] What&#39;s the point? Is a single person going to be persuaded to support either cause by seeing this banner on a relatively niche JS library that reduces readability of its documentation? Will anyone find the library any more useful because they support the cause? (I support neither cause, but find the library useful nevertheless.)Recently, I saw a similar pattern with the Svelte REPL adding a pro-Ukraine message.[1] The banner along the bottom is so large that landscape mode becomes unusable, and non-trivial examples are hard to see even in portrait mode. Again, who does this help? (I support Ukraine, so feel like, &#34;yeah, I get it; can I close the banner now?&#34;)The worst part about these patterns is that they can&#39;t be disabled and seem to be deployed haphazardly without regard for the overall design.While these aren&#39;t malware, they are still hostile for the majority of users who aren&#39;t so gung ho in their support for the current thing.[0] https://isomorphic-git.org/docs/en/deleteBranch[1] https://svelte.dev/repl/hello-world?version=3.46.4"</p>

Wait, who am I actually targeting again?&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It harms all of technology and by extension anyone who participates in the modern world.  Just like any malware or other antisocial behaviour.It&#39;s a bit too indiscriminate to be a good protest, unless the thing you want to tear down IS the whole modern development process, which is based on the idea that most people are somewhat trustworthy and you can get the risk down to an acceptable level through the usual means.It doesn&#39;t quite work if malware is not only a threat, but a semi-mainstream thing sometimes made by people you would think you could trust.   The normal social process of trust breaks down if malware is included in the scope of normal things people sometimes do, as opposed to purely being something by the more criminal types.I almost wonder if these people don&#39;t actively want to tear down tech itself, or not care, given how many coders dislike the fact that society is tech dependant."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It would be really great to recreate loved ones after they have past in some sort of digital space.As I’ve gotten older, and my parents get older as well, I’ve been thinking more about what my life will be like in old age (and beyond too). I’ve also been thinking what I would want “heaven” to be. Eternal life doesn’t appeal to me much. Imagine living a quadrillion years. Even as a god, that would be miserable. That would be (by my rough estimate) the equivalent of 500 times the cumulative lifespans of all humans who have ever lived.What I would really like is to see my parents and my beloved dog again, decades after they have past (along with any living ones at that time). Being able to see them and speak to them one last time at the end of my life before fading into eternal darkness would be how I would want to go.Anyway, there’s a free startup idea for anyone—recreate loved ones in VR so people can see them again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My prediction/hope is that NeRFs will totally revolutionize how the film/TV industry. I can imagine:- Shooting a movie from a few cameras, creating a movie version of a NeRF using those angles, and then dynamically adding in other shots in post- Using lighting and depth information embedded in NeRFs to assist in lighting/integrating CG elements- Using NeRFs to generate virtual sets on LED walls (like those on The Mandalorian) from just a couple of photos of a location or a couple of renders of a scene (currently, the sets have to be built in a game engine and optimized for real time performance)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great, and the paper+codebase they&#39;re referring to (but not linking, here [1]) is neat too.The research is moving fast though, so if you want something almost as fast without specialized CUDA kernels (just plain pytorch) you&#39;re in luck: https://github.com/apchenstu/TensoRFAs a bonus you also get a more compact representation of the scene.[1] https://github.com/NVlabs/instant-ngp"</p>
