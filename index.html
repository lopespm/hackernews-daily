I&#39;m a frequent jq-to-less piper and probably a more frequent mobile browsing opener of ESPN scoreboards/subsequent grumbler about ESPN&#39;s web performance and experience. I think I&#39;ll get a lot of mileage out of plaintextsports as long as it stays up.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve developed quite a few SNES-related things for fun, mostly using Go and C++, with some 65816 ASM sprinkled in.https://github.com/alttpo/alttpo - A Link To The Past Online. Lets multiple players see and interact with one another in the same game world and synchronize their progress through the game. Exclusive to a customized fork of the bsnes emulator which provides a scripting language and PPU-integrated drawing routines to render remote player sprites. In retrospect, I consider this a dead-end architecture; redesigned in o2 project (see below).https://github.com/alttpo/o2 - Second version of alttpo (see above) but this time targeted at SNES hardware console support (via SD2SNES flash cart USB feature) and does not require a customized emulator nor a scripting language. Trade-off here is a loss of the visual aspect (cannot see remote player sprites) due to tight hardware limitations in the amount of VRAM and limited SNES CPU cycles available. Work is in progress to gain back the remote sprite rendering as an optional add-on via the bsnes-plus WASM module support (see below). This project includes a 65816 machine code emitter library (pure Go) with support for named labels of branch targets. There is also a bare-bones headless SNES emulator library (pure Go) included for unit tests to verify the generated 65816 ASM and ROM patching mechanism.https://github.com/alttpo/bsnes-plus - A fork of bsnes-plus in development that invokes WebAssembly modules when certain general SNES events occur, e.g. `on_nmi`, `on_power`, `on_reset`, `on_frame_present`. WASM code has access to a draw-list API for drawing into the various PPU layers, e.g. extra sprites, text (with PCF font support), basic shapes. WASM code can also receive arbitrary binary messages from external applications, e.g. to update remote player positions or exchange custom sprite graphics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally instead of Mesen-S, I&#39;d use the fork at https://github.com/NovaSquirrel/Mesen-SX, which contains a fix for saving settings on Linux Mono 6.12 (https://github.com/NovaSquirrel/Mesen-SX/commit/c374ca8b9ed3...).I&#39;m more interested in SPC700 development for SNES music. Mesen-SX has a SPC debugger separate from the main debugger, but I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s more or less useful than bsnes-plus (I know the Mesen emulators have a far worse Linux UI when running under Mono, and I haven&#39;t tried running the Windows Mesen under Mono or real .NET yet). I don&#39;t know enough to judge if the disassembler is better or worse than bsnes-plus though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I never expected this to be on the front page of HN, it brings back so many memories. I was big into this game when I was a teenager back in 2010, 2011 until 2015, also being very active in the community that made this page in that period. Sadly, even all those years back, the online scene was still what most would consider dead. I have a bit of a thing for &#34;dead&#34; games, I wouldn&#39;t really consider 1-2 full servers at night to be dead, which is what we had. In the following years, however, server population declined even more, to the point where I would really consider it to be dead. I&#39;d love to be proven wrong though, but that was what I percieved.If you really wanted to ride the wave, I&#39;d tell you to get yourself a time machine and go all the way back to 2005, 2006 or 2007. Servers were ablaze with squadrons (~groups of people having their own paint schemes on certain aircraft, playing air-to-ground missions and air-to-air missions against other squadrons...) fighting and calling each other names. It wasn&#39;t pretty, but according to what I was told, passion wasn&#39;t exactly in short supply.Fun fact: the game looks like that because it has no textures. Instead, every polygon is colored individually. Through a recent update did give the terrain textures. Aircraft still don&#39;t have them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting; I was not aware of their existence. They seem to be free as in beer; not as in speech. They seem to make money with shareware provided by the same company.Nothing against closed source though. For example, I enjoy x-plane a lot which while not free (in either sense) of course has a large community providing both free and non free add-ons. This seems more of a game with a focus on combat and less on realism or looks.An actual free, open source flight simulator that deserves mentioning is Flightgear. I&#39;ve played with that a couple of times but always end up reverting to x-plane. But flightgear has some nice features and also a nice community. It just doesn&#39;t look and feel anywhere near as good as x-plane (which is a tall order because it is very good).Anyway, I checked out some footage on Youtube. Visually, it has nothing on even Flightgear; which I&#39;m pretty sure probably has some combat mods. Or even any version of that the last few decades or so, actually. It actually reminded me of some dos games I used to play in the early nineties. E.g. Jetfighter II (released 1990) was pretty awesome back in the day. It looks like that but with higher resolution. But e.g. the ground is a featureless green blob; just like in Jetfighter II, and clouds are white polygons hanging in the sky, etc. And Jetfighter II had a HUD that was about as feature rich as the one in this game. Of course it was way more pixelated than this. But they even managed a cockpit panel :-). I wouldn&#39;t call it photo realistic but it didn&#39;t look half bad for the time. There are probably better/later game that this thing is shooting for. But I just never really got into combat flight simulation.I guess they are trying to recreate some of that experience. Not that it matters; but I guess the gameplay is more important than the looks for this. Actually looks like it could be a lot of fun.BTW. I have nothing against MS Flightsimulator. The latest version looks great. But I just don&#39;t have any windows computers anymore at this point. Combat is not really something either of the other flightsims I mentioned are made for or even good at."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Often put on various Cat TV channels from YouTube on before leaving for work. They are usually like 8 hour long shots of birds and squirrels eating nuts someone left on log, the cats love it and will watch diligently. They are monetized channels often enough, and its just funny to  me knowing that every once in a while the cats, who are otherwise alone in the house, are being treated to a commercial for some sports betting service, or for profit college experience. This entire edifice of targeted ads being directed to two cats who suddenly experience a very human moment in this absurd context. Can&#39;t help but feel like they sense it, that they are suddenly interpolated into this thing, subjects to the streams of money and incentived attention. brought down into our inferior world of commodities and money. Have been close to getting the premium YouTube just for their sake, and of course for the sake of the nice people making the videos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is always funny to see how watching TV can be so differently culturally.  With my Spanish in-law family the TV is on almost the whole day in the background, even during big family dinners as background sound. With often news, sports or game shows. With their late dinner times of 9pm they often watch series and movies even later. 
And here in the Netherlands it is with many a sin to have the TV on in the background if there are visitors and should only be on if you watch something together."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What is strange about Discord is this great discrepancy between the ones that love it and the ones that hate it. If I were to guess on the reason of why that might be it would be that Discord is probably really good for the people that are constantly on it, and don&#39;t really miss any communication going in. These people have probably been there for some time so they don&#39;t feel the problem of not knowing where the past information is, because they were there when that information was communicated and therefore never need to look back at it. These people will (obviously) recommend using Discord, since it works so well for them!The problem arises when you have people that just now-and-then hop into the Discord. These people are not in the &#34;clique&#34; so they don&#39;t feel comfortable talking/discussing too much in the channels, and they also really have no clue where to go for any of the lost information these super users don&#39;t even think about. This is probably why I never really use Discord except for voice, since I just don&#39;t get anything at all from reading an endless chat log. It&#39;s like being someone stepping in to a tight knit friend group with a long history and no way of looking into it.Discord will most likely have to figure out how they can keep it so that it works for these super users, but somehow make the information organized for people that aren&#39;t hard core community members.Edit: Wrote &#34;clique&#34; wrong"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Endless scrolling is a black hole for information. And the hawking radiation that comes out is keyboard diarrhea.If I were trying to subtly encourage pounding out content free crap, I would probably want people to use difficult to search, non paginated scroll feeds as much as possible.Discord might be a black hole, but Discourse has some of the same properties. Facebook is the same way.Anything that funnels people into multi-thousand post individual pages is going to lose information.Old proboards forums, github issues, and wikis don&#39;t have this problem.  Content is in smaller blocks that can be linked to easily, and there is a strong culture of keeping topics focused.  You don&#39;t have multiple unrelated conversations in one place.You can jump to the end or beginning of a thread when quickly skimming to see if it&#39;s relevant.And you can see all threads in a given time period pretty easily with pagination, when you want to understand the larger picture at a point and time.These are all things that are useful both for a sense of community and for technical work itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a strong believer in Zulip with respect to a perfect mix between instant messaging and actually retaining information- functionality for a public export (can also restrict to specific channels), .e.g. https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive/- in addition to the above, they are working on a guest mode, so you can read the discussions without logging in -- hopefully that would make it possible to index without setting up a separate archive hosting https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/13172- messages/threads have proper meaningful URLs (unlike random obfuscated UUIDs like in Discord)- you can easily open things in new tabs -- unlike Discord, where search pane takes like 10% of the screen, or Slack where once you clicked on search result, you lose the context about the remaining results- you can login with Github (so no need to register for many people, at least for programming-related projects)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I grew up in Egypt, my dad is from a town on the Suez Canal called Ismailia, famous for its mangoes. We would wait the whole year for mango season (August/September). As kids, our clothes would all get mango stains. Our parents would make us take our shirts off before we eat them to avoid that.I moved to the US, and I haven&#39;t had a good mango here. When friends visit Egypt, I tell them to get mangoes (in season, around September), especially a variety known as Eweis. They get obsessed. I&#39;ve never figured out why the US just doesn&#39;t have good mangoes, I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re hard to grow locally or ship."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For growing mango from seed, or really anything from seed, you cannot beat a small plastic container (like what cottage cheese, sour cream, or green yogurt might come in) filled halfway with coconut coir. It&#39;s absolutely the best medium for germinating seed. Fill halfway with coir and water once a week. Coconut coir keeps water evenly distributed and I&#39;ve never had a seed or seedling mold over using it.I personally use 2 lb greek yogurt (or soup, as in from Costco) containers because the extra height also lets me keep the seed in there longer and develop initial root structure. That&#39;s incredibly helpful for transferring to pots, and a little coconut coir in the soul doesn&#39;t hurt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really want a solar powered time lapse camera that takes a photo around noon every day, saves to SD card.Would be great for plant time lapses.I haven&#39;t been able to find anyone who&#39;s done this already.   It seems like there are trail cams and similar that have all the parts, so this should be possible to manufacture for a price point of around $50, and I think it would be an amazing product: I bet every gardening enthusiast would want one.Anyone know of a sku that already exists?  I Google it a couple times a year, still haven&#39;t found it.  Anyone want to get this made, maybe send me one as thanks, and you keep all the profits you reap? :-D.  I really just want this to exist.(Happy to 3d model prototype housings to help! But I don&#39;t know EE.  Chris at mckoss dot com)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made the backend for this MMO on SSE over HTTP/1.1:https://store.steampowered.com/app/486310/Meadow/We have had a total of 350.000 players over 6 years and the backend out-scales all other multiplayer servers that exist and it&#39;s open source:https://github.com/tinspin/fuseYou don&#39;t need HTTP/2 to make SSE work well. Actually the HTTP/2 TCP head-of-line issue and all the workarounds for that probably make it harder to scale without technical debt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SSEs are one of the standard push mechanisms in JMAP [1], and they&#39;re part of what make the Fastmail UI so fast. They&#39;re straightforward to implement, for both server and client, and the only thing I don&#39;t like about them is that Firefox dev tools make them totally impossible to debug.1. https://jmap.io/spec-core.html#event-source"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We use SSE for our APIs Server Events feature https://docs.servicestack.net/server-events with C#, JS/TypeScript and Java high-level clients.It&#39;s a beautifully simple &amp; elegant lightweight push events option that works over standard HTTP, the main gotcha for maintaining long-lived connections is that server/clients should implement their own heartbeat to be able to detect &amp; auto reconnect failed connections which was the only reliable way we&#39;ve found to detect &amp; resolve broken connections."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is there any word about when sci hub is going to start adding new articles again? It&#39;s currently only useful as an archive of old research articles. New papers from the last year are not available. I never understood the rationale for stopping new content, though I believe it had some relation to some court case in India...but I don&#39;t understand why that was a reason to stop adding articles, and why it hasn&#39;t been restarted yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting. Medical field dominates research in terms of publications. Chemistry produces double the papers compared to physics, and humanities are smaller than biology but larger than physics.  I wonder where machine learning papers fit in - CS or Math or both?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting how sci-hub&#39;s papers on medicine dwarf those in many other fields like comp-sci, math, and physics.  I wonder if that reflects the number of papers in those fields, or if sci-hub just has a non-representative sample.  If the latter, why?"</p>
