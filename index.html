								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everyone&#39;s got 2c on bitcoin but here&#39;s mine: I don&#39;t consider the price of crypto when looking to see progress / success.Could you explain to somebody why Bitcoin is successful without mentioning that the price goes up, by talking only about the technology, product, and adoption? What if that person was unimpressed by Bitcoin 5 years ago, could you explain what changed in the last 5 years (again, not mentioning change in price) to change their opinion of bitcoin?AFAICT the main changes in Bitcoin in the past 5 years have been some incremental evolution of the technology that I&#39;m not aware of changing the fundamental usage of the product in any way (SegWit, LN, and most recently Taproot).A note on blockchain proliferation: The author considers it a bad sign that there&#39;s an explosion in new blockchains. While I also consider it a bad sign for Bitcoin, I think it&#39;s a good thing for the ecosystem. My hope is that some day we&#39;ll have ubiquitous inter-chain protocols so, rather than obsessively hyping the coin/chain we&#39;re invested in, we can move all our digital assets and contracts to whatever blockchain offers the best technology, the best performance, and the lowest fees. This will allow for increased competition and evolution in the blockchain space. You can see the beginnings of this movement in some places, but it has a long way to go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting, the original article is one giant Appeal to Consequences fallacy.  The arguments are structured like &#34;If Bitcoin succeeds, X will happen, and X is bad, therefore Bitcoin will fail&#34; or alternatively &#34;Bitcoin undoes policy Y, policy Y was a good thing, therefore Bitcoin is bad and will fail.&#34;  And then the epilogue here finally acknowledges that yup, all the bad stuff did happen, and yet Bitcoin still succeeded, and the future will probably involve more bad stuff but that&#39;s the way it goes.I feel like one marker of maturity is understanding that not everything true is going to be good, and not everything that we want is something we&#39;re going to get.  So many timely debates take the form of an Appeal to Consequences fallacy.  &#34;Hyperinflation would be bad for everyone, therefore the government will not allow hyperinflation to happen&#34; - ignoring that the government may not have the mechanisms to stop it once it begins.  &#34;If it&#39;s too late to do anything about global warming, we&#39;re all fucked anyway, so let&#39;s proceed on the assumption that it&#39;s not too late&#34; - ignoring that &#34;we&#39;re all fucked anyway&#34; may mean many different things and some of them might be significantly more pleasant than others.  &#34;America is a great country, so it can&#39;t possibly collapse&#34;, ignoring that many once-great countries have collapsed before.I found my predictions got significantly more accurate, though significantly less comforting, when I realized that good doesn&#39;t always win out in the end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"«it’s now obvious that use of bitcoin (and related blockchains) for payments is almost entirely scams and illegal stuff»It is neither obvious, nor is there any data that suggests that is the case for Bitcoin. I suspect people who hold this opinion form it passively while reading the occasional flashy news headlines &#34;Drug lord used Bitcoin!&#34; and don&#39;t actually do any research. After all, news reporters write about what drives readership, and &#34;Grocery merchant used Bitcoin&#34; just doesn&#39;t quite get the same engagement.There are very few research papers that conclude a large percentage of Bitcoin&#39;s transaction is tied to illegal activity, for example [1] claims 46%. However they are fatally flawed: they fail to consider the amplifying effect of mixers/tumblers that, by design, create thousands of automated mixing transactions per original transaction. So 1 illegal transaction will look like 1000 transactions in their analysis... facepalm[1] https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3102645"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Created by Steve Ruiz, his timeline is full of little interesting thoughts played out in the development of this, a fascinating insight into the minutiae that users take for granted but that make the difference: https://twitter.com/steveruizok"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey, author here! Glad folks are enjoying this.A few notes:- I post a _lot_ about tldraw on Twitter. If you&#39;re curious about how this came together, or want to follow along as we ship new features, check out my timeline (https://twitter.com/steveruizok).- The whole tldraw project is MIT licensed and open source (https://github.com/tldraw). And it&#39;s still in development! If you&#39;d like to contribute, join the Discord channel (https://discord.gg/SBBEVCA4PG) or drop by the repo (https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw).- The multiplayer is using a pre-release version of Liveblocks (https://liveblocks.io/)—and honestly isn&#39;t using it in a very clever way—and so can have some desync issues. Consider this part of the app an early beta.- We also ship a Visual Studio Code extension that lets you use tldraw inside of VS Code! (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=tldraw-o...)A little more about the project itself:The tldraw project has a few different layers.At the bottom, there is a renderer named @tldraw/core (https://github.com/tldraw/core) that is essentially a &#34;put React components on a canvas UI&#34; engine. You give it a data model along with a set of utilities to interpret that data model. Simple but very fast, very flexible, and packed with helpers for building these kinds of apps. It&#39;s already being used for some pretty ambitious projects apart from tldraw itself.The main library, @tldraw/tldraw (https://github.com/tldraw/core), exports the whole tldraw &#34;app&#34; as a React component named &lt;Tldraw/&gt;. This component can be embedded in any React project. It can be controlled either by props or by its own API (ie `app.selectAll().duplicate()`).The website is a very thin Next.js app that embeds the &lt;Tldraw/&gt; component.There are also a few other libraries: @tldraw/vec for the vector math and @tldraw/intersect for intersections. If you like to work on these kinds of projects, definitely bookmark those libraries! They contain a lot of useful code.As for its development, I&#39;ve taken off a few months between jobs to work on this full time. Until now, the site has been accessible only to my Github sponsors, but it&#39;s now free and open to everyone. If If you&#39;d like to support the project&#39;s continued development, you can sponsor me here: https://github.com/sponsors/steveruizok.I&#39;ll answer questions here but if you want to contact me directly, my DMs are open @steveruizok."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;New Project&#34; asks if you want to &#34;Save your current project&#34; and the options are &#34;Yes&#34; and &#34;Cancel&#34;.I would expect Cancel to cancel the new project rather than losing the current work, and would expect a &#34;No&#34; option instead to mean lose the current project."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Now switch to Linux too.The more we invest together, the easier it becomes. German states can help Spanish states, and Finnish schools, Danish universities, and French businesses, etc. - collaboratively investing so that everyone benefits and Europe can build its own Tech industry and have some independence from the US.This is absolutely critical to move away from the dominance of &#34;Big Tech&#34; to FOSS solutions that independent, small co-operatives can maintain together."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the main &#34;drawback&#34; of LibreOffice is that it is not widely used. If you receive a docx document and it formats funny, or vice versa (common on LibreOffice and not entirely their fault), it&#39;s on you for using weird software, or penny-pinching on a MS Office license.If it becomes common, people just accept the minor incompatibility and move on. It will also get better as funds and attention flow to these projects.As far as I&#39;m concerned, LibreOffice lacks no features I would remotely consider using.It&#39;s like when Windows was the sole mainstream OS, it wasn&#39;t an excuse &#34;oh but I&#39;m on Mac and can&#39;t run this&#34;. Now Macs are mainstream, and Linux is not, it&#39;s still in a &#34;weird nerdy&#34; corner. But not so if it just gets more widely used (it&#39;s happening, just slowly)."</p>

But here we are in 2021 and a major organization having the temerity to not pay the Microsoft tax is newsworthy.  This is not what a free market looks like."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We tried our hardest back in the early 2000&#39;s to make this stick. I cofounded a startup building servers, clients, and SDK&#39;s. Maybe the world is finally ready for it now. The issue we ran into was customers/consumers just didn&#39;t care about federated systems. And various implementations had all sorts of quirks making interoperability between domains and clients difficult, at best. There are just SO MANY THINGS you have to do to make good messenger software that lining up all the pieces with open standards proved impossible in the ~8 years I was working on it. Again, maybe it&#39;s better now, but I&#39;m skeptical, probably jaded. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s little known that XMPP is a big hit with military and police organizations.  (e.g. the Baltimore police department has XMPP-based chat and feeds the messages into Lotus Notes)Vendors in that market heavily use extension mechanisms.  For instance commanders of infantry units might fill out forms every day about what kind of contacts they had with the enemy and get them sent to a central location."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Every exploit listed for my router (tplink Archer A7) has no &#34;affected version&#34; listed nor indications if it has been patched, but clicking through to the CVEs indicates all have been remediated. As near as I can tell this website is just scraping CVEs, poorly, in order to sell their security services (which consist, at least in part, of an email reminder to rotate your router password...seriously?)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of these routers have DD-WRT, OpenWRT, FreshTomato or maybe pfsense support. Since the manufacturers long ago abandoned security updates and feature upgrades an open source firmware will vastly improve the security and the devices functionality.Not all routers can run one of these firmwares but many can and I wouldn&#39;t choose a device that didn&#39;t in the future. Its relatively easy to setup a basic secure home router using a Raspberry pi 4 and USB Ethernet and then attach one to a hub and the other to the modem and you have a 1 gbit/s capable routing device that can do SQM and remove bufferbloat and not a lot of consumer routers can remotely achieve that level of performance.It is more hassle than the manufacturers firmware, but its also a surprisingly good way to extend a routers usable life and functionality as well. VPNs, Virtual LAN, File and web servers or just better QoS you can do just about anything you might want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I already have little hope for consumer networking equipment, this just seems like a big old list of scraped CVE&#39;s.One has to remember that the majority of the development ends up being by the SoC vendor, usually a horribly out of date fork of OpenWrt with weird looking proprietary kernel modules to support wifi, accelerated nat, etc.Quite a few of the older devices lack some pretty basic mitigations as well; ASLR, Position Independent Executables, Stack Canaries, etc. Either they get forgotten or they&#39;re off because of they can&#39;t be bothered getting the drivers up to scratch. (Assuming they haven&#39;t just been handed a binary)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"  [0] Some people, when confronted with a problem, think &#34;I know, I&#39;ll use regular expressions.&#34; Now they have two problems.

I love regular expressions and figuring out the syntax to solve problems I encounter where I can use regex. Such as searching code for calls with specific named params that may be in different order across the code base. But I always have this quote in the back of my mind if I&#39;m thinking about using regex in code, especially areas that get hit a lot.[0] https://blog.codinghorror.com/regular-expressions-now-you-ha..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I respect regex for being a widespread DSL that makes certain things very declarative.My problem with it (other than all the different flavors—that’s just history’s fault) is that you don’t tend to get integrated help/tool support for them.  They are often just plain strings—how is e.g. Intellij supposed to spot them reliably and help you?It’s too bad if we have to copy and paste regex strings into websites in order to figure out what they do.The number one most useful tool support in my book would just be to highlight metacharacters.  Are parens a metacharacter in the dialect that I am using now?  Is `+` significant?A bigger ask would be more verbose regular expression declarations and compilers that can translate to and from them.  It’s nice if you can use comments in a regex dialect, but comments should be treated like they are treated in code writ large; don’t use them if you can make the code “self-describing”.  Imagine a more verbose declaration language where you can make local aliases, for example `let ident = [a-z][a-z1-9_]*`."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Classic in marriage counseling. Many fights occur not because of what the other person has said or done, but because what your own brain has added to their behavior. Often, you see what you are most afraid of. Or what you used to experience in childhood. To “see” that your partner here and now is actually completely different takes a lot of energy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related but also not: One of the most interesting aspects about a &#34;shroom&#34; trip is the incredible ability to visualize. Visualizing is something that we all think we can do normally, but if you really try to picture something in your head -- specific faces, the design of a bicycle, the layout of a room -- it&#39;s quickly evident that we are actually terrible at it (it&#39;s hard to reverse information from that neural network). Even if you&#39;re drawing it&#39;s often an iterative process where each line drives the next.Maybe other people are better at it, but when self-interrogating and inspecting one&#39;s own vision, it just completely falls apart. https://www.booooooom.com/2016/05/09/bicycles-built-based-on...Normally.I can only speak to personal experience, but under the influence of psilocybin I find that closing my eyes and visualizing complex environments and machines -- of literally inspecting and walking through gearing systems, for instance, and rationalizing their operation -- with complex lighting, etc, leaves me just in awe at the mind&#39;s capacity. It literally feels like looking into another  universe, the construction of the reality simply too complex to be imagined and visualized.I&#39;ve actually felt my head to ensure I&#39;m not overheating, contemplating the process like the mind was a GPU."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ideas in this article are strongly reminiscent of those in Jeff Hawkins&#39; &#34;On Intelligence&#34; (2004).The idea of the brain operating (at least in part) as a &#34;prediction machine&#34; is certainly not a new one. I&#39;m actually surprised it&#39;s taken this long for this sort of experimental confirmation and theory to become more mainstream."</p>
