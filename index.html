								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see a lot of people saying things like &#34;this is why package signing is important&#34; and &#34;we need to know who the developers are&#34; and &#34;we need to audit everything.&#34; Some of that is true to some degree, but let me ask you this: why do we consider it acceptable that code you install through a package manager implicitly gets to do anything to your system that you can do? That seems silly! Surely we can do better than that?This article from Agoric is extremely relevant here, from a previous such incident (re: the event-stream package on npm): https://medium.com/agoric/pola-would-have-prevented-the-even...Put simply: in many cases, the dependencies you install don&#39;t need nearly as much authority as we give them right now. Maybe some of these packages need network access (I see a few named &#34;logger&#34; which might be shipping logs remotely) but do they need unrestricted filesystem access? Probably not! (They don&#39;t necessarily even need unrestricted network access either; what they&#39;re communicating with is likely pretty well-known.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This doesn&#39;t surprise me. Horrify.. yes.I&#39;ve noticed more dev teams succumbing to the temptation of easiness that many modern package managers provide (NPM, Cargo, Ivy, etc.) - especially as someone who has to work with offline systems on a regular basis.Because of that ease there are fewer tools and tutorials out there to support offline package management.  There are more for using caches, though these are often along the lines of either &#39;the package manager will do this for you and it just works (but in case it doesn&#39;t, delete node_modules or cargo clean and re-try)&#39;, or stand up a dependency server on your own machine with these proxy settings (which has it&#39;s own security issues and is frequently disallowed by IT cybersecurity policies).As an example, many blog articles I found a while back suggest using yumdownloader from the yum-utils package. This is unfortunately not reliable, as there are some packages that get skipped.I have found I need to script reading a list of dependencies from a file; then for each dependency: create a directory for it, use repotrack to download its RPM and it&#39;s transitive dependency RPMs in the dependency&#39;s directory; then the script aggregates all the RPMs into one directory, removes the OS installed RPMs, uses createrepo to turn that directory into a RPM repository, and then makes an USF ISO image out of the directory for transfer onto offline system and installation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised the reverse fully-qualified domain name (FQDN) model used by Java isn&#39;t more widely adopted. If you want to upload artifacts to the main repository (Maven Central) you first need to show ownership of a particular domain. For example, via a DNS TXT record (example [1]). Would make these kind of attacks a lot more difficult.[1] https://issues.sonatype.org/browse/OSSRH-61509"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nic Carter&#39;s rebuttal to a Bloomberg comparison between Bitcoin/Visa, including assessments of total and per/transaction energy usage:&#34;First of all, Bitcoin and Visa are fundamentally different systems. Bitcoin is a complete, self-contained monetary settlement system; Visa transactions are non-final credit transactions that rely on external underlying settlement rails. Visa relies on ACH, Fedwire, SWIFT, the global correspondent banking system, the Federal Reserve and, of course, the military and diplomatic strength of the U.S. government to ensure all of the above are working smoothly.Any energy comparison must take the above into account – including the externalities from the extraction of oil, which implicitly backs the dollar. As those who make this comparison inevitably fail to mention, the dollar’s ubiquity is partly due to a covert arrangement whereby the U.S. provides military support to countries like Saudi Arabia that agree to sell oil exclusively for dollars. It’s worth noting that the grossly oversized U.S. military, whose presence worldwide is necessary to backstop the international dollar system, is the largest single consumer of oil worldwide.&#34;https://www.coindesk.com/what-bloomberg-gets-wrong-about-bit..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At that rate and assuming 4tx per second a single Bitcoin transaction consumes 165kWh. A Tesla battery is bit over 50kWh. So let&#39;s round that to 3 full charges of Tesla battery.That&#39;s 350km/220 miles of range per charge. In total 1050km or 660 miles of driving.So basically if you want to transfer money and the recipient is closer than 660 miles from you it&#39;s more efficient to just get a bunch of bills, drive there with a Tesla rather than send a Bitcoin transaction. Or alternatively 330 miles roundtrip. For each single transaction.It is hilariously inefficient system. It is literally better to drive a full car and give things physically than use Bitcoin.A small addenum: Visa apparently uses 146kWh for 100000 transactions. Coming at 1.46wH per transaction. That can drive a Tesla for 9 meters (0.4 seconds of driving at 80km/h) or alternatively keep a nice led lamp lit for an hour. And that includes everything the company does, not just the actual transaction but the upkeep of their offices etc divided by the amount of transactions they perform per year.EDIT:Apparently on 2020 it was 741kWh per transaction in practice and/or I made a tiny error in my calculation. Either way it&#39;s even better!https://www.statista.com/statistics/881541/bitcoin-energy-co...That simply increases the ranges so that it becomes a 3600 mile trip. Or 1800 mile roundtrip."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since this is posted here I&#39;ll ask a question that has been bugging me for the last year: Who does the captions on these YouTube videos? Is it automated? I ask because every CS193p video starts with the same opening scene/music and the caption describing the music is different on every single one. Is this an auto-caption algorithm just getting it wrong? Or is there a person having fun behind the scenes waiting for someone like me to notice and spend an irrational amount of time wondering what happened? I feel like it has to be a person, right? YouTube&#39;s captioning wouldn&#39;t give 12 different results.Edit- For anyone curious, here&#39;s how the music is described in the captions at the beginning of each lecture:1. regal music2. mellow ambient music3. light music4. gentle music5. air whooshing6. gentle music (turns out there is one repeat)7. peaceful music8.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Similar thing happened to me. I built an online Japanese - English dictionary and used AdSense to monetize it. One day I got an email saying that my domain has been permabanned because my website appears to be promoting rape and pedophilia. As an example of one of the many offending pages on my domain they sent me urls to the definition and translation of words &#34;pedophilia&#34; and &#34;rape&#34; in Japanese.Of course none of my competitors using the exact same data set had any such problems.I tried for YEARS to appeal it. There are simply no humans working at Google and nobody reads your emails.Edit: Actually, I did get a response a couple times but it was obviously automated. They just said to remove the ads from the pages where such words are displayed. So I added a simple rule and a column in the database to hide ads for those keywords. That just triggered the bot to move down the list of their &#34;obscene&#34; language. Next it was the names of various sexual positions, acts and fetishes (Japanese does have a very rich vocabulary in that topic), then manga slang, even silly sounding onomatopoeias that when explained in plain English are &#34;vulgar&#34;, etc.. It seems once your website is flagged there is simply no way get clean."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think what we&#39;re learning from many debacles on YouTube, Amazon, and Google is this:Algorithms are not even close to substituting for human customer service, human moderation, and human judgment.Maybe this means web-scale sites like Amazon&#39;s marketplace aren&#39;t viable. I&#39;m fine with that implication. Stores like Target and Walmart seem to have the same prices with human-curated inventories, and I don&#39;t really miss the millions of extra products Amazon has."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nowadays when I want to buy anything on Amazon it takes so much effort to go through which listing is the Sponsored/ad-based listing vs organic in search. Once that hurdle is crossed, it comes to going through the reviews to see which reviews can be trusted and which can not be. And even after that hurdle, once I place order, I am not sure the item I received is counterfeit or genuine. Too much work and definitely not customer-focused experience!I guess going to Target is much easier to get the necessary shopping done."</p>

This expansion has been in the works for years. Samsung has a 100k wafer per month fab in austin texas. They are negotiating for tax abatements for expansion and using alternative sites as leverage.They are not building a new fab they are expanding their S2 fab in austin texas. There was a permit application that was released a few years back that shows the true scale of their expansion plans.https://www.swf.usace.army.mil/Portals/47/docs/regulatory/pu...If this goes through it could made Samsung&#39;s S2 fab larger than even TSMC&#39;s monster gigafabs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; New $17B Fab in the USA by Late 2023Impossible.Leads times on fab hardware are on all time high.Not to say that construction, and setup itself would be extremely challenging in such timeframe.And not saying that US has no supply chain locally for modern fabs. Intel famously flies a lot of its consumables from abroad.Samsung will have similarly to transport its consumables by air if they go with this plan."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really happy to see this. It&#39;s really frightening how dependent we are on other countries to manufacture our chips.

The lawyer is probably using an ancient dell computer with this software and hasn&#39;t used video chat on it before this.This is extra hostile, because it&#39;s separate from whatever video chat application they were using - so it would have been harder to know about and turn off.As an aside, Microsoft fought in court to force OEMs to not install this crap alongside Windows (reasonably since it was damaging their brand and making the machines less secure), but they lost. Another reason why the macOS model is better for users. OS companies should make their own hardware."</p>

Refactored code is almost always radically better, even when it&#39;s in the same language, for reasons that might be insulting to explain on HN.Point is, this is not an apples-to-apples comparison.(I&#39;m not arguing Rust isn&#39;t better.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another reason not to use EST/EDT is that they are overspecifying the time zone in most cases. If you ask for output in EDT, but the date is in December (which is not part of daylight savings time) then should the date output be UTC-4 or UTC-5?  Technically you asked for EDT.Using EST as a shortcut isn’t a good idea, either - most software will “know what you mean” and use EST or EDT appropriately... except, both The USA and Canada have been toying with the idea of dropping daylight savings time, so it’s very possible at some point in the future that 6:00pm on July 1st will be EDT in America/New York, but EST in America/Montreal (or vice versa). This is already true for CST - Saskatchewan doesn’t use DST.  And there have been times where one country or another changes the start date or end date of DST too, so there’s no reason to assume those will always be the same between Canada and the US."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only situation where our datetime instances deal with timezones is on a one way trip to a user&#39;s display, document or email. If you are playing around with parsing timezone strings, you are probably making a huge mistake unless you are parsing someone else&#39;s trash data.I feel the standard interchange format for datetimes really should be 64 bit Unix timestamps. These are trivial to store in any database as a native type, can be compared using the fastest arithmetic instructions possible, and are a locale agnostic representation suitable for direct business logic comparisons.Trying to carry timezone information around is a mistake. This is state that should be terminated and normalized at both ends, not passed through the system.The only thing I would store pertaining to timezone is for user profile or server environment configuration. These would be settings in the application that are used to produce locale-specific UI and reports.There are probably some other use cases I am not thinking of, but that is the extent of how we do it and we have a really complex app that has to serve customers who operate in multiple timezones at once."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#39;There is no good reason to use short timezone codes like EST, CST, PST — doing so will only bring you pain. Either use the tzdb name like America/New_York, or use an offset from UTC, depending on what you want.&#39;All you need to read/remember is this, this applies everywhere not just with date."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to work as a scholar of Britain (specifically executions in Early Modern England, but you pick up a lot along the way) and I&#39;ve tried to explain to a lot of people the amount of influence and control that the monarch actually holds.  I&#39;m not sure that this is such a bad thing.  The Queen can&#39;t create legislation, she can restrain it.  She is purely a moderating influence in this sense.  She could, in theory, name new people to the House of Lords, but the Lords is no longer a hereditary body and there is a mechanism for the House of Commons to override the Lords.Parliament does have power over the monarch in some senses, of course, in that there is precedent for Parliament changing the order of succession or introducing a regency.  This happened without the monarch&#39;s assent, though admittedly over a hundred years ago.  But the British constitution is one that replies on precedence, not a formal document.I&#39;ve characterized the Queen&#39;s powers as &#34;reserve powers&#34; inasmuch as, if everything goes wrong and Parliament dies from a meteor strike, the government still legally operate provided there is a monarch (even if you have to reach deep into the line of succession to find that person).  By law she has to call elections within a certain amount of time.  Obviously there&#39;s nothing to force her to follow the laws, but that&#39;s true of any country.  She (or her heirs) are the leaders of last resort."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most obvious difference between the American and British legislative systems is the presence of a foundational document like the Constitution.The British system is strictly about convention and precedent, whereas Americans have a little more explicit guidance from the Constitution.I think what we&#39;ve learned as Americans in the last few years is that it isn&#39;t enough to have a foundational document.  Convention and precedent indeed play a large role in the function of how the well government works.  Congress is now terminally defective, largely because of the loss of the norms and violations of precedent, starting roughly in the mid 90&#39;s.Perhaps the idea that convention and precedent is the only thing holding the British system together makes it stronger."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t Britain a Constitutional *Monarchy*?Did they forget that? There&#39;s still the House of Lords and the House of Commons for a reason. The monarchy and the landowners are still a thing and are still a ruling class."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi everyone, thanks for the enthusiasm so far!We are going to make the repository open source next week and, for those who haven&#39;t listened to the podcast, I want to align everyone&#39;s expectations and say it is very early material. Expect bugs, breaking changes, etc.On the other hand, it is also a great time for anyone who wants to jump in and help shape things, so feedback will be very welcome!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Exciting to see that heavy numerical computation might be available to a language running on BEAM. It has always seemed to me like an area that people would point to where Elixir couldn&#39;t stand up to Python.I&#39;ve always dreamt that someday you might be able to reach for Elixir and get everything you needed for an entire stack of a company and it seems to be getting closer and closer. The building blocks for a web app have been around with Phoenix and Ecto for quite some time. LiveView was introduced to make more user friendly frontends. GenStage, Flow, and Broadway introduced ways to run data processing pipelines. And now we&#39;re seeing the initial steps to potentially have ML capabilities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really excited about this project. Seeing Elixir inch this much closer to being a viable option for machine learning and related fields is great.In case someone here wants to read rather than listen to all the details, I wrote down some notes over at: https://elixirforum.com/t/anyone-who-wants-to-speculate-abou..."</p>
