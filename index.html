								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a massive YouTube and Instagram industry of outright faking craft and cooking tips. They&#39;re not just bad or a stretch, they&#39;re intentionally fabricated, made at scale by TheSoul Publishing with 550 employees. That&#39;s because making cool things looking surprisingly easy goes viral way better than actual reality-grounded instructions, and for the adtech giants nothing matters except the number of clicks.Before people realize that they can&#39;t really make a 3-layer cake in a toaster, the fakers already cash in on the views. Usually the risk of these faked craft hacks is just cut fingers and kitchen fires, but the &#34;just grab 2000V, it&#39;s so easy!&#34; videos take it to another level of lethality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"YouTube&#39;s moderation is ridiculous, and it demonstrates the problem Google has in general. They don&#39;t like paying actual people to moderate their sites, and rely on automated systems and bots to do everything for them. So, if there&#39;s ever an issue (or you have a bunch of scammers mass reporting you because you debunk their &#39;work&#39;), then YouTube/Google seems to think you&#39;re the problem instead of the scumbags.We need things to change here. We need Google to moderate their services properly, and we need these scammers to get arrested/sued/whatever for misleading info, and putting people&#39;s lives at risk."</p>

It&#39;s a really big deal in the industry that the prices that insurance companies pay doctors are now being shared publicly. It will have all sorts of positive impacts over time, hopefully making rate negotiations more consistent and fair between different insurance plans. Right now, 10x differences in prices paid for the same healthcare service from the same doctor between insurance plans is not uncommon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work in healthcare.Here is an exchange I had with a major hospital about standard surgery (one of those deemed &#34;Shoppable services&#34;) earlier this year. This exchange was possible after I was able to get an email recipient, following a 30min conversation.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Hello!I was told by the very helpful Ms. XXX, that you would be able to provide patient responsibility amount , related to CPT codes for XXX procedure.
I am attaching front and back of my insurance card (Payor). The member DOB is MM/DD/YYThe specific 2 codes in question are :
CPT 12345
CPT 01234Can you please provide the total cost and patient resp. for the CPTs above?___________________________________________________________Response:Good morning,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The hospital does not process estimates for patients with insurance coverage. However, our web portal contains charges under the Hospital Price Transparency link. I have included the link in the subject line for easy access. [comment: This link was broken. After much browsing.. I was able to find an alternate route. The linked file turned out to be a JSON. I couldn&#39;t figure that one out] As far as out-pocket responsibility, your insurance company is the best source for that information; they will advise if you have any copay for the encounter._______Read the 1st sentence of the reply again. My blood still boils from that..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My teenage son knocked on our bedroom door last night after we&#39;d all gone to bed. He was crying and told us his cousin had just texted him the news, and then he watched the video. We watched it again together. I cried and hugged him and we talked about it a little bit.My kids were so isolated during covid lockdown, we were getting really worried for their mental state. They weren&#39;t seeing other kids their age, they felt like they had no friends, and there was one point when it seemed like they even stopped missing other people altogether.But my son, especially, was deep into Minecraft Youtube at the time, and I could tell that this cast of creators was really important to him. It often felt like he was on a call with his fun and hilarious buddies, just on mute.I think Technoblade, and other creators like him, helped get my son through the past couple years. I&#39;m so grateful to him for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In his message, Techno, who reveals his name is actually Alex, talks about how the money from merch and other “sell-out” pushes over the last year is being used to send his siblings to college, if they want to go, along with thanking his viewers for giving him such happy moments—all while a slideshow of images showing him throughout various points of his treatment are shown on screen.&#34;What a beautiful legacy. Fuck cancer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My teenage daughter made an irregular visit to my study about an hour ago to let me know of this news.  I let her know that I didn&#39;t know this Technoblade, but this news seemed to hit my usually tough exterior daughter pretty hard, so he had some type of positive impact to my family.  It is a touching tribute video they released."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am just wondering how many people have to die before it finally dawns on on us that the current approach is idiotic.The supposed smart cars can&#39;t even talk to each-other directly &#39;without internet&#39; to warn of a car pileup! They can&#39;t report to city traffic control about their condition.We should be innovating in infrastructure instead - create standardised computer readable infrared road markings, equip each traffic light and each lamp post with a radio beacon, each crash barrier could have a radio marker, create PUBLIC maps of each city, have a central traffic control sypercomputer in each city provide directions to cars. Have each car painted with infrared markers so they recognise each-other. Provide cyclists with something these cars can recognise.We could even make radar-reflective pants so that autonomous cars see them better.the whoe traffic system needs to be looked at and brought to a new set of standards, whatever they may be. I am not sure what they are, but it should be clear to anyome with half a brain thay having a car use a camera to tell if the traffic light is red or green is idiotic.untill a new system is ready, no car without AGI level ai will ever be safeThe only problem is that such collective approach conflicts with the way VCs work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The promises of self driving cars have always seemed weird to me. Sure, I would love to have a world where all cars are self driving. The security benefits seem large.But decreasing congestion? We already know how to do that, and in many ways it seems like a safer bet than some kind of technogy with large problems and even larger unknowns; public transport.Cheap, well developed, reliable public transport will beat autonomous cars on throughput and resource use any day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related. I listed something for sale on Craigslist recently and got a bunch of messages right away that asked obvious questions that were in the listing. One suggested that his wife pick it up, and can I take Zelle? Went silent when I said cash only.But the most interesting scammer said: &#34;for my safety, can I send you a 6-digit number, and you confirm it, so I know the listing is not fake?&#34; I say yes, unsure what the scam was going to be, but sure it was a scam. Moments later I got an SMS from Google Voice asking me to verify my phone number. Mofo tried to steal my number, presumably to use it to scam other people. I was pissed and impressed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For a while I grew quite fond of wasting phone scammers time. I’d pick up, talk suuuuuuper slowly— like Emo Phillips speed at one syllable every one or two seconds— interrupt with irrelevant questions or anecdotes, and overall just see how long I could keep them on the phone without giving them any information. The best strategy I found was telling them that, yes indeed I did remember owing the IRS or whoever money and I could pay them however and insisting that first they needed to take down my new email address… I’d just start spelling random words incredibly slowly, say I messed up and start over, ask if they needed my checking account number to keep them engaged and then start spelling my email address again. They prey on intellectually disabled folks so pantomiming a stereotypical version of that wastes a ton of time while keeping their interest. Got boring after a while but I got pretty good at it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, how interesting. I started getting these a few months ago, right after starting a new job in a somewhat high-profile area. I have been getting 1-2 per month but found them quite unusual because none of them ever progressed to an actual scam - just a few messages back and forth about the fabricated &#34;wrong number&#34; situation and then each thread would stop, seemingly earnestly.Since there was no obvious scam, I&#39;ve been wondering what the motivation for these was, and actually started worrying about whether someone might be trying to compromise my phone via some yet-undisclosed SMS exploit - why else would there be a systematic effort to get me to spend time exchanging a few pointless messages around the &#34;wrong number&#34; pretext that otherwise went nowhere?I tried calling the senders by phone and found they were all Google Voice numbers, which eliminated the possibility that some actual rich guy had innocuously ended up with a number similar to mine.I asked a few friends and no one else was experiencing the same thing. Glad to hear it&#39;s not just me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As Vim9 comes alive, and Neovim community focuses on Lua plugins instead, it seems this release is finally the update that will put a hard branch on the two communities. Up until now, most plugins (except Lua-only ones of course) have worked in both editors, but it doesn&#39;t seem like Vim9 will be supported in Neovim, so I guess what people go with now, will decide what you might stick with in the future (unless you&#39;re eager to switch development environments)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shame that Bram is doubling down with vim9script. This will give vimscript a Python 3 moment, splitting an already small community into even smaller pieces.I wish he’d have embraced Lua like Neovim. It has already been proven to work great (half my plugins are Lua these days, and it performs great), but alas, it was not to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is mostly cliche popsci trash that isn’t worth reading.  Good for a game of logical fallacy bingo.The only interesting development seems to be the methodology but that only gets a passing mention.The rest is basically fearmongering.&gt; In humans, for example, gut bacteria influence how the immune system responds to pathogens and allergens, or interact with the brain, affecting mood.Ok.  But what does that have to do with diversity?  Humans have not been an emotionally rational species at any point in the past.  Arguably the relationship between gut biome diversity and civilization is inverse.  Maybe we want fewer microbes.Lifespan has also increased with decreased gut biome diversity.This is why correlation alone is uninteresting.  You can find it anywhere.&gt; Splitting the difference, people in less developed parts of the world have between 60 and 65 of those bacterial groups, an observation that ties the decrease in microbial diversity to urbanization.Oh come on.  How does a line like this get published?  This is fine if you define “ties” as “moves with” but not “is connected to”.  IOW correlation doesn’t imply causation.&gt; Kyle Meyer, a microbiologist at UC Berkeley, argues such losses are not necessarily a problem. “Maybe we don’t need them,” he points out. But Moeller is worried. “We are really doing some scary stuff to our microbiomes,” he warns.Why is it “scary”?  Nothing in this article established any cause for concern.The guy that developed the methodology is now in search of a problem his solution fits."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About ten years ago my former PI (second author in the below paper) did quite a job on this in Burkina Faso, analyzing the composition of the gut in children living outside cities, in cities, and a comparison with European children.Obligatory disclaimer: I was working in his laboratory at the time, but I wasn&#39;t involved in that research.https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1005963107"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty much every culture around the world 100 years ago had some staple fermented food. Nowadays, a lot of people in western culture at least outright refuse yogurt or other fermented foods like saurkraut or pickled cabbage that used to be staples in these people&#39;s ancestor&#39;s diets a few generations ago. People are becoming even lactose intolerant. You have to fertilize your microbes so to speak and eat these sorts of foods. Plus once you are doing stuff like making your own yogurt, a jug of whole milk works out a lot cheaper than the chobani stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The sad thing about news like this is that most people only pay attention at all because they&#39;ve been bombarded with anti-Russian propaganda, not because this showcases Google&#39;s awful anti-privacy practices. Despite years of warnings, examples and analysis of where this can lead, the only thing that matters in the end is some emotional trigger word that makes the public think they are dealing with an &#34;outgroup&#34;.The cherry on top of it all is that ProPublica uses Google Search for their website. I am moderately sure that after I post this someone will jump in to comment and defend this practice, showing nothing has been learned.Privacy is important precisely because after your data has been collected and stored, there is no telling where it will end up and what it will be used for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This means Google may have turned over such critical information as unique mobile phone IDs, IP addresses, location information and details about users’ interests and online activityCan someone help me to understand this?I thought Google kept this kind of user-preference (interests/activity) data to itself, and used that as the sauce powering its ad auctions. If you run a site, GA will give you IP, location, etc. for inbound traffic, but I didn&#39;t think they would give you data on other users.Does Google actually sell user preference data and IPs in bulk? What product are they referring to here?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this really a complaint that a single, well-established Russian ad company got the same information from Google that they would give to any US company with an email address?This is part of the cognitive dissonance that insists that Russia has the most effective intelligence services in the world, that can manipulate elections at will and subsume every US social movement to spread its propaganda, but is too stupid and helpless to create a US front company."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the US at least, any refrigeration technician should already have passed his EPA 608 or 609 and be fully aware that venting a unit can cost him his card rendering him unable to buy refrigerants. Before working on all but small self contained units he must have access to a refrigerant recovery unit. This a compressor sort of thing that can move the gas from the installed unit into a tank for either reuse on site or taking to a reclamation center, where allegedly they can be paid for it.(Yes, my AC units broke and the time to even get a technician to look at them, was so long I researched how to diagnose them and do the easy fixes, ran into the EPA requirement, studied the material and got my EPA certification, bought a bunch of gear off Amazon and refrigerant from a “good old boy” at an exorbitant price (global shortage, plus most is sold in palette quantities), and fixed my own unit in half the time it would have taken to get an appointment with a professional company. The first unit is working. If I succeed at the second unit I’ll even be money ahead. Of course if my yak had already been shaved maybe it could have tolerated the heat.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problematic refrigerants are pretty diverse, being made up of short carbon chains (1-4 atoms typically) decorated mainly with chlorine or flourine atoms. For example:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,3,3,3-TetrafluoropropeneInterestingly the best option for a refrigerant may be CO2 itself, which if collected from the atmosphere has no global warming or ozone depletion issues.  The only drawback is CO2 refrigeration equipment has to operate at relatively high pressure, but this isn&#39;t a major problem:https://www.rsi.edu/blog/hvacr/carbon-dioxide-refrigerant/Getting rid of the chloro-flouro stuff makes lots of sense, but not producing any of it in the first place would be even better."</p>
