								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Finally, something that I can speak to!I once ported Quake 1 to the Rockbox operating system for MP3 players, which enabled it to run on the Apple iPod: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6V-4AZ7pkAThe whole world of software ports basically boils down to &#34;anything is possible, given enough memory, pixels, and time&#34;. The actual process of porting anything is sometimes incredibly tedious (e.g. &#34;scour the entire source code for unaligned memory accesses, and manually rewrite all of them&#34;), but also gives a chance to do some very clever things (like, &#34;use the piezo speaker to beep out the address of a fault, because nothing else works on the device after a crash&#34;).What made me do it was 1) the satisfaction I got from seeing my work produce something which, at first glance, shouldn&#39;t exist (Quake... on an MP3 player?), all while 2) learning deeply about software close to the bare metal, which is fairly hard to do early in one&#39;s career. There&#39;s of course also the factor of having lots of free time - I did my port when I was still a student with not very many responsibilities, so I could afford to spend entire evenings and weekends poring through mountains of C code. Nowadays, not so much..."</p>

This IMO really highlights the power of having an ecosystem built around tools like tree-sitter because they allow for powerful dev UX tools to be more democratized.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a really cool example of tree diffing via path finding. I noticed that this was the approach I used when I did tree diffing, and sure enough looks like this was inspired by autochrome which was inspired by my post (https://thume.ca/2017/06/17/tree-diffing/).I&#39;m curious exactly why A* failed here. It worked great for me, as long as you design a good heuristic. I imagine it might have been complicated to design a good heuristic with an expanded move set. I see autochrome had to abandon A* and has an explanation of why, but that explanation shouldn&#39;t apply to difftastic I think."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One reason this has been difficult to get approve is that low-tax crusaders have been blocking it. However you want to frame that -- people who want no taxes at all, people who simply don&#39;t want taxes to go up more, whatever.Automatic income tax withholding was opposed for the reason reason(s). People who want taxes to be lower don&#39;t want the &#34;pain&#34; of taxes to be hidden. They want people to cringe every time they write a check for tens of thousands of their hard-earned dollars, not just have it magically spirited off to the government.Filling out taxes helps share some of the same pain. Every year, every tax filer thinks &#34;man, taxes suck.&#34; This undoubtedly has at least some effect on voters&#39; willingness to pay even more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the hurdles here is that the IRS has increasingly deputized tax preparers as their first line of enforcement via preparer penalties [1].Another is that a free filing system with pre-populated returns shifts the information asymmetry involved in tax filing to be fully in the taxpayer&#39;s favor. Many people have an &#34;I need to report everything because I don&#39;t know what the IRS knows&#34; mindset. If the IRS populates a taxpayer&#39;s return with all the info they have, there&#39;s no incentive to report anything not listed.[1] https://www.irs.gov/payments/tax-preparer-penalties"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I rely on Otter pretty heavily these days. 100% agree that recording and sending the transcript to meeting attendees without their knowledge is a really bad move from several angles.I work sales calls set up with Calendly and Otter joins them all. These are very technical so normally it&#39;s fantastic - EXCEPT if we start talking early or the prospect doesn&#39;t follow the invite and never joins the call, then they would get a transcript of my team&#39;s chatter. I learned to not allow Otter to join the call until everyone is in attendanceWhats more frustrating is that you can&#39;t disable this auto-email &#34;feature&#34; unless you are on a business plan of some sort. But I have a paid plan through the iPhone app and apparently can&#39;t convert it to a business plan associated with my company. So no good way to disable itI get the network effect of referral business but sharing private conversations without consent is not the way to achieve it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just deleted my account because of that, also they share conversations with everyone in the meeting by DEFAULT, it wasn&#39;t nice receiving a message from a co-worker telling me that he received an email with the transcription it generated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I am not much of a privacy person but I feel completely abused in this situation&#34;On the plus side you have been given a valuable lesson.For example: you may be more of a privacy person that you thought, you may want to be more careful about sharing your data. You may want to consider if you are paying for a service or not makes any difference in the way your data is handled."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a newbie in nuclear fusion, this explanation is the most interesting part:&gt; Lee Margetts at the University of Manchester, UK, says that the physics of fusion reactors is becoming well understood, but that there are technical hurdles to overcome before a working power plant can be built. Part of that will be developing methods to withdraw heat from the reactor and use it to generate electrical current.&gt; “It’s not physics, it’s engineering,” he says. “If you just think about this from the point of view of a gas-fired or a coal-fired power station, if you didn’t have anything to take the heat away, then the people operating it would say ‘we have to switch it off because it gets too hot and it will melt the power station’, and that’s exactly the situation here.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know everything about nuclear fusion so I have to ask: Is it actually renewable?In other words, are the byproducts able to form back into the &#34;fuel&#34; at a reasonable rate with the energy input of the Sun? I know that a selling point of fusion is that there is such an abundance of fuel that this doesn&#39;t matter. But if we treat finite energy sources as infinite, exponential growth in our energy budget means that we will undoubtedly run out of energy, as is being done with forests and such.After all, I have a feeling people at the dawn of the industrial revolution thought the amount of coal available in the world would serve their needs &#34;practically forever,&#34; until energy consumption scaled up by thousands of times."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was at school in Abingdon, Oxfordshire (UK) around 1988 my physics class (A level aged 17) was somewhat enlivened by a visit by a bunch of clever chaps from JET at the Culham labs from up the road.This was the first time I heard the &#34;nuclear fusion is 25 years away&#34; joke and it was told as such.  We were also shown a graph of how many orders of magnitude away from ignition (for want of the correct word) by date.  It had an initial steep decline but then turned right quite sharply and had annoying looking tendency to avoid the magic value.Now, once you have ignition, you have to sustain it and extract power from it.  That&#39;s quite tricky too!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two things...First, looking through their design guide (https://www.wikihouse.cc/guides/design), the only thing they mention is that space (32mm in walls, I guess, and 70mm under ceilings) is provided.Given that the plumbing, electrical, ventilation, appliances, etc. are the majority of the cost of a home, I find this a bit odd.  A typical American full bathroom costs something like $5k to $20k (and up... way up) depending on the quality.  A kitchen can cost multiple times more.  Sure, you can build them cheaper, but that&#39;s the rub... most people who are in the market to purchase a home don&#39;t want low-end bathrooms and kitchens.  Or windows.  Or lighting.  Or wall fixtures.  Or anything really.Second, IMO, the problem with affordable housing is not a construction cost problem.  We can build small, livable (for various definitions) homes for $50k (or less) today, ignoring land costs.  But the regulatory costs, the land costs, the market demands all make building such homes a non-profitable endeavor.   Why build 20 $50k homes on the land and make $200k profit when you can build 10 $500k homes and make $1mil in profit?The affordable housing crisis in the America do not have a technical solution, only a socio-political one.  And since nearly all the power related to zoning, building costs, etc are managed at the local and state level, that means engaging with local politics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is overly complicating the process. If you want an open source DIY method of building a home, just learn basic framing and construction. It&#39;s not hard, lots of people have built their own homes, you just need some common sense and a willingness to learn.If you want to go all in on modular, wood based, zero carbon housing then learn how to build a timber frame house. If you really want zero carbon you can use only hand tools and harvest your own trees.Wikihouse seems more for people who want to buy something off the shelf, pretty much a kit house. That&#39;s not a bad thing since it takes a lot of effort to build something as big as a house and lots of people don&#39;t want to do that. But I don&#39;t think this should be sold as a solution for DIYers since the existing methods already satisfy the listed requirements."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like the concept of this, it&#39;s basically a step further on from SIPs (structural insulated panels) by having standard composable blocks. The things I think are particularly good:- Standardising on screw pile foundations. Standard concrete foundations are often be about 30% of the build cost, with the quantity of earth removed and cement used it&#39;s a massive part of the carbon footprint of a home. For a &#34;light weight&#34; timber construction, screw piles are the future.- Having services recesses and notches built into the panels, and there is no need to batten the internal walls for boarding. this will increase the speed of construction significantly.- Being an &#34;Open&#34; standard allows any timber frame or prefab construction company to adopt it.My one concern (I wouldn&#39;t go as far as criticism) is that the panels have a somewhat complex manufacturing process by having to be CNC machined. Realisticly they almost always will be, but I would have liked to see the panels designed to be constructed a little more simply - you will always have to make changes on site.I wander why they went with ply over OSB, they have similar structural properties but OSB can be cheeper."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These blog posts have been great. I&#39;d love to see a deep dive on the query planner at some point.I&#39;ve done lots of benchmarking SQLite while writing ducks [1], and found some interesting stuff. It seems like SQLite will only use one index, even in cases where two indexes would better suit the query. Or, in cases where the query is fetching most of the table, it will use an index even though a full scan would actually be much faster.Don&#39;t get me wrong, SQLite is awesome, and it&#39;s quite possible to work around these behaviors. Just interested in why they&#39;re not built in.[1] https://github.com/manimino/ducks"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SQL was originally designed for non-technical users to interact with the database, however, it&#39;s used almost exclusively by software developers peppering it throughout their applications.Interesting claim! In my experience, the # of data analysts / BI analysts / etc that write and have mastered SQL vastly exceeds the # of web developers (especially if we focus on developers actually writing SQL instead of using ORMs)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The EXPLAIN keyword is really awesome. It also allows you to quickly validate SQLite command text without actually executing it. We have found this to be useful for real-time validation of user inputs when working on SQL-based config tools.Note that EXPLAIN also seamlessly incorporates any application-defined functions, so you can validate everything is as expected. Useful when being clever with DSLs and such."</p>

It’s seems astonishing to me that they would be using this much bandwidth for that emergency feature, and (at least initially) only on a small portion of iPhones.My only thinking is that they may be planning to make the satellite network available to none emergency messaging too, and that’s what’s covered in this filing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The carbon monoxide is possibly more valuable than the oxygen.It&#39;s a good feedstock for making hydrocarbons and petrochemicals and also as good a reducing agent as hydrogen for making metals.  In fact you could use the CO to make,  say,  iron,  producing CO2 which gets cycled back into the above reactor."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Of course, the other plausible explanation is that (at least at the time) Weird Al didn&#39;t know the difference between RAM and hard drive space (especially likely, because he&#39;s talking about defragging a hard drive).  In fact, I&#39;d be surprised if that wasn&#39;t what he meant.  I will, however, leave room for him knowing the difference, but intentionally being absurd (it is Weird Al, after all).That problem (referring to things that are not conventional fast, volatile random access memory as RAM) seems to have only gotten worse in the last twenty years - exacerbated, I believe by the increased use of flash technology (SSDs, etc - which have, admittedly blurred the lines some).It also doesn&#39;t help that smart phone and tablet manufacturers/advertisers have long insisted on referring to the device&#39;s long-term storage (also flash tech) as &#34;memory&#34;.  I doubt that will ever stop bugging me, but I&#39;ve learned to live with it, albeit curmudgeonly.Whippersnappers! :-D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting point that RAM has basically not moved up in consumer computers in 10+ years... wonder why.The article answers its own question by pointing out SSDs allow better swapping, bus is wider and RAM is more and more integrated into processor, etc.But I think this misses the point. Did these solutions make it uneconomic to increase RAM density, or did scaling challenges in RAM density lead to a bunch of other nearby things getting better to compensate?I&#39;d guess the problem is in scaling RAM density itself because performance is just not very good on 8gb macbooks, compared to 16gb. If &#34;unified memory&#34; was really that great, I&#39;d expect there to be largely no difference in perceived quality.Does anyone have expertise in RAM manufacturing challenge?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a big piece that is ignored is how much normal compute/memory usage has been shifted to the Cloud.I no longer need to have local resources to do amazing things. I don&#39;t need an 10GB+ GPU in my phone to be able to hit some website and use AI to generate images. I have fast web/email search capabilities that don&#39;t require me to have a local index of all of it. I can spin up a remote compute cluster with as much RAM as I need if I want some heavy lifting done, and then throw it all away when I&#39;m finished.&#34;Back in the day&#34; we would try to build for all that we could perceive we would do in the next 5 years, and maybe upgrade memory half way through that cycle if things changed. We ran a lot of things locally, and would close apps if we needed to open something needy. I think also systems have gotten a lot better at sharing and doing memory swapping (see comments about SSD helping here). Back in the old days, if you ran out of memory, the app would just not open at all, or crash."</p>
