								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I first entered the working world as a programmer and administrator of an &#34;academic computing center&#34;, in the early 70s, you met men like Ray - ex-military, GI-bill educated, learned computers from the electricity on up in their mid-career, rather frequently, either as customer engineers for one of the big mainframe manufacturers (there were 7 or 8, depending on when and how you counted), or from the minicomputer upstarts who were then assaulting the mainframe world of computing with their smaller, cheaper, 12 and 16 bit newcomers.   Sometimes you&#39;d get the privilege of a lunch or dinner with one sent out &#34;from the lab&#34; who was actually designing and building the machines you were working on.It&#39;s hard to explain just how new it all felt, then.   But in 1973, even though we were sitting on the cusp of the single chip microprocessor and personal computer revolution, the commercial computer was less than 20 years old, and college recruiting materials might well brag that at their institution, there were not one, but two computers on campus.  I remember the day the total RAM at our institution passed the megabyte mark - closer to the end, than the beginning, of the 1970s.  The ability to &#34;program&#34; was a rare skill - even the people  who taught it were still just learning it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the minimalist resume is appealing, can we also bring back walk-on hiring?In warehouse and construction work, if someone shows up at 7:30 AM on a Monday morning, odds are quite good that the foreman will have something for them to do. Maybe not that day, but maybe tomorrow, or maybe someone on the list above them won&#39;t show up that week and they&#39;ll get called. I made rent doing that in my early 20s and they even let me leave early sometimes to work on my internet business because I didn&#39;t have a family to support and maybe someone else had a bill they needed to pay and wanted my shift.Why again does boutique startup need to interview 500 overqualified people? Hire someone right away and let them quit if they want to and hire someone else. It&#39;s just business for crying out loud."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My mother was a systems analyst in the 1960s. She got a contract as part of a team installing a brand-new IBM/360 at the University of Ibadan in Nigeria, her job was to write administration software.She told me it was a top-of-the-line model with 64K of RAM. At some point, it had a malfunction and they had to replace one of its memory &#34;boards,&#34; which were lattices with ferromagnetic cores suspended on filaments. She brought the defective board home for me to play with.Although I went on to write software on punch cards, and built a PC in the 1980s, I think the moment that I held core memory in my hands was the closest I&#39;ve really gotten to &#34;the metal&#34; in my life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve had more ideas come to me after hiding in my office to take a nap than sitting at my desk. It got to be such a gold mine of solutions that I still to this day allocate 30 minutes of my day to a nap. Non-negotiable. So many hard problems that have been brought to me, or complicated needs for architecture, etc were solved by simply turning my active brain off. When I was in graduate school I&#39;d regularly get stuck on some stupid thing I didn&#39;t understand and slamming my head against the paper/book/whatever didn&#39;t help. Again, a quick nap and I was good (or at least better than I was).Performative work is a disaster. I worked in a stuffy IT office of a company before I got my degree and became a software engineer. It took YEARS to deprogram performative work. I still hide when I take a nap. I suspect that if my current company found out I was sleeping on the job they&#39;d still be upset with me. However, my output is so good the results speak for themselves. It would be difficult to fire me for napping."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Software development is creative work. Creative insight can come anywhere, any time. Better ideas can make difficult things easy. And make the impossible– possible.So the most important thing on a software team (or really any team creating high technology products or services) is an environment where team members feel safe to be themselves– psychologically safe, where they can try out new things, make mistakes, fail, and not be punished or belittled. Say their ideas and have them improved by others, not criticized. It&#39;s an environment where team members take care of themselves so they can be creative– sleep enough, exercise enough, be with friends and family enough, play enough.You have to be at your keyboard or lab bench or whatever enough to make things. But if you are there too much your creativity plummets. This is what I try to get across to my teams."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These ideas are intuitive, but I can&#39;t find the research backing them. The blog quotes another blog [1] which claims research but doesn&#39;t reference it.  That one uses a quote from an MIT article [2], which is a perspective piece with no actual experiments.People use &#34;research says&#34; to add gravity to ideas, but it&#39;s important to share (and check) the sources.[1] https://paulitaylor.com/2022/05/06/the-case-against-collabor...[2] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/226279557_A_Complex..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The better error messages alone make it worthwhile to upgrade. The trend started in 3.10, and it already made a difference for me, my coworkers and students.But remember that while it&#39;s great to play with it freshly out of the oven, and that you might want to test your projects/libs with it, we should wait a bit before migrating production.Indeed, every first release of a new major version of Python eventually important bugs that get ironed out in a later patch. Also, some libs on pypi may simply not be compatible with it yet, breaking your pip install.I usually wait until the 3rd patch myself, after many years of paying the price of greedy upgrades."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About this new asyncio.TaskGroup thing, I found this from Guido on the related GH issue*&gt; After some conversations with Yury, and encouraged by the SC&#39;s approval of PEP-654, I am proposing to add a new class, asyncio.TaskGroup, which introduces structured concurrency similar to nurseries in Trio.I have never used but have been told that Trio&#39;s nurseries make it much easier to handle exceptions in asyncio tasks. Does someone more knowledgeable can tell if this will help? Looking at the docs*, this only seems to be a helper when you want to await several tasks at once, so I am not sure this changes much for exception handling.* https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/90908** https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/asyncio-task.html#task-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These bundlers do not do the same work as webpack. Turbopack is using swc for typescript which means it will not do typechecking during compilation which effectively makes it fairly useless as a compiler. Now, if you only want bundling and minification then sure but why would anyone want only bundling? Good luck having a sensible workflow when your type checking has to run separately and perfectly match whatever typescript version is hidden inside your bundler, good luck dealing with constant mismatches when there are errors on either side.EDIT: The responses pointed out that the author is the maintainer of webpack, I removed that part of the comment calling it deceptive. Maybe the entire intent is to deprecate webpack. I still think that it should be renamed to &#34;Turbopack: our webpack successor&#34; because calling it &#39;the&#39; successor is a bit presumptuous and the article doesn&#39;t even directly say that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After years of configuring webpack for various projects I have finally decided to migrate all my projects to Parcel[1] manly because I got tired of creating and maintaining hundreds of lines of webpack.config.js files, I wanted something that just works. I am really happy with that decision.Parcel is plenty fast and is pretty much zero config, I can use it to build libraries[2] as well as applications[3] for the browser and node.I am manly building client side react applications, so your mileage may vary.[1] https://parceljs.org/[2] https://parceljs.org/getting-started/library/[3] https://parceljs.org/getting-started/webapp/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is Microsoft&#39;s second go at a developer-focused ARM kit. You may recall the first was called the Snapdragon Developer Kit [1] and was a miserable machine. It appears Microsoft has already pulled it from the Microsoft Store [2].There is no other supported desktop/CI/etc. solution for Windows on ARM. (Mac mini with Parallels/VMware is a popular unsupported alternative. It may still be your fastest.)Seems like a truly decent machine (ordered one) but I&#39;m not sure if there&#39;s remaining appetite for Windows target-specific development.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My 2013 MacBook Pro is/was my last Mac.  It worked just fine, but I opted out of newer OS X updates because I noticed each successive &#34;upgrade&#34; was making the OS worse, in countless ways, and adding exactly zero improvement I could discern.  Change for the sake of change, as far as I&#39;m concerned.  I feel the same way about Windows...I ended up just going out and buying a bunch of old ThinkPads and running OpenBSD and Linux on them.  I think I got like five computers for less than the price of a single MacBook Air.I&#39;m pretty much done with proprietary operating systems because they clearly no longer provide the best experience, from my perspective.I&#39;m tired of being locked out of software I paid for because I &#34;upgraded&#34; the OS (looking at you, Logic Pro), or vice versa, unable to use new software because I didn&#39;t &#34;upgrade&#34; (most new Mac software won&#39;t run on my MBP).  If I upgrade, I literally throw away a $250 piece of software and have to spend another $250 (or whatever) to use the new version of _that same software_.  At least open-source OSes allow me to stay up to date while still having nearly-maximum agency over how the computer works and what software it runs.I&#39;m tired of my computer doing a ton of stuff I didn&#39;t tell it to do.  The amount of notifications/nags/etc. on a modern Mac/Windows computer is absolutely mind-boggling to me.  The always-online aspect, software-update-checks, &#34;telemetry&#34; and &#34;analytics&#34;, phoning home every time I launch a program...I&#39;m tired of my computer not being a tool for me to use, but rather just a gateway to a bunch of stores and ways I can spend money, with a bit of &#34;productivity&#34; sprinkled on the side.  I could go on and on.Oh, I didn&#39;t even touch on the software design/UX aspects.  Like Riccardo wrote, it&#39;s a worthy of an entire article itself.  I could probably spend an entire day documenting/critiquing the degradation of user experience in Mac OS and Windows.  Mac OS had a lot further to fall, and indeed has been extra-disappointing because I used to hold it in such high regard :\"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s so interesting, these waves of CSS improvements.Before the flexbox/grid arrival, there were years of near-zero progress.The flexbox/grid release, uniquely coordinated across browsers (for once), was an excellent milestone, but not really a movement.These last 2 years though feel almost like a revolution in comparison to CSS&#39;s history. Somebody is pushing very hard.These are some very serious improvements that address core needs and gaps. In particular scaling CSS in large applications, with things like @layers, @scope and container queries.The second goal seems to be to make CSS preprocessors obsolete.Compliments to whoever is working on this. My favorite upcoming one has to be toggle, controversial or not, the idea that for simple interactions you don&#39;t even require JS anymore is a good development.The luxury problem this creates is the slow adoption rate. Something extraordinarily powerful as grid is still barely used. Old habits die hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great overview. I&#39;m always excited by newer features to CSS that make older JS-only methods obsolete. I&#39;ve also grown CSS-tooling fatigued after using SASS and PostCSS plugins for years. I&#39;ve recently gone back to only using vanilla CSS on personal projects and while there are niceties I do miss (nesting) it&#39;s refreshing not having to deal with config files or waiting for stuff to compile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">":has() basically removes the need for us to use JS to attach classes to parent elements as we can essentially look ahead now, e.g. &#34;.some-component:has(.input-select-all:checked) { background: blue }&#34; whereas we would have to use JS to query the input, then query the parent and attach some css class as a styling hook.Container queries will allow us to fine-tune the not-so-predictable gaps between our predictable breakpoints.  Breakpoints will probably still be used for larger-picture layout, but container queries will help with the smaller parts especially in UI that have many moving dynamic parts.The rest are just icing and honestly I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if it takes a while for many of them to become mainstream."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a confusing headline. The judgement here is in NY state court, and pertains to employees of and in the City of New York, which enacted a vaccine requirement for employees of the city and later private employers in the city. Months later, Eric Adams was elected mayor of NYC, and he issued an executive order exempting athletes, performers, and artists from the mandate.Petitioners sued, saying that the mandate with the exemptions was essentially arbitrary, and the courts agreed. So what happened here is that Eric Adams sabotaged NYC&#39;s vaccine mandate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because it&#39;s confusing: the NY Supreme Court is just a trial court, it&#39;s not at all like the US Supreme Court. The top appellate court is called the Court of Appeals. It&#39;s called &#34;supreme&#34; because it has general jurisdiction, as opposed to things like traffic court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I&#39;ve been wondering in recent cases where courts are overturning recent government action, whether unconstitutional bills passed into law, or unconstitutional executive actions that overstep authority, is where&#39;s the penalty for committing those actions in the first place?The state of New York famously responded to the outcome of NYSRPA v. Bruen, which overturned the defacto ban on concealed carry, by declaring nearly all public spaces &#34;sensitive areas&#34; in which licensed individuals may not carry for their protection. Regardless of one&#39;s opinion of said rights, how do courts blatantly ignore rulings and orders from higher courts with no repercussions?How do courts declare certain executive orders unconstitutional, and yet the perpetrators, who took an oath to uphold and defend said rights and values, face no consequences?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I came on board with the NeXT acquisition (or rather reverse acquisition as ex-NeXT often refer to)…So I do recall seeing a few times after we relocated to Infinite Loop, that Steve at first was just working as a consultant, and not as an employee. Thus at the time he didn’t have a badge to enter in IL1 (Infinite Loop 1: hold Apple HQ); many times when he was coming in the morning, he had to wait at the glass door to enter the campus, until some kind soul was letting him in (despite the policy only badged employees could enter or visitors with a printed tag). I saw it happening more than once while grabbing a coffee at the coffee booth in the IL1 building.Later on, after he came back officially as CEO (or iCEO), I remember clearly during a lunch with co-workers (at Café Mac, seating outside) watching at a distance Steve &amp; Jony walking inside the campus, then seating at a bench and Jony opening some carrying case/luggage, and let Steve pull the content out of it, so he could look at it in the sun: it looked like a piece of plastic… at the time, we had no clue what it was, except the color was orange. 
Many months later, Steve introduced the first iBook (which was the first Mac with Wifi): when I saw the orange color of the iBook I made the connection with what we saw back that day; Jony was most likely showing to Steve the first shell of the future iBook.Steve otherwise at work was truly laser focus at a time on different projects: I was working on backend web services development with public facing web site, so usually every 2 weeks our boss was presenting to Steve our progress (every week or even more while closer to ship): our boss usually was always coming back with clear feedback on what was good or terrible, which we obviously had to improve for the next presentation… stressful yes, but truly enjoyable.
More than once, Steve did cut some projects that were close to finish and you just had to go along since no one had a say in it, except Steve.Obviously I have a few more stories of that sort, since I spent close to 20 years at Apple (/NeXT).It was quite something to get the hard work you did for months presented on stage by Steve… I still miss the excitement from it even if it is more than 15 years ago.Edit: fixing a few typos"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was there in 1999 as OS X was being developed, and the beta was just about to be released. I was building another product that was released at MacWorld in 2000 (and still exists today)!I have a lot of funny stories.  Steve didn&#39;t like our data center rack mounts being silver, we had to pull them all out and spray paint them black, because silver just wasn&#39;t acceptable, in a datacenter. That was my first day at work. And no, I&#39;m not a datacenter employee, everyone on the team did everything, there were just very few of us.We had to work from about 10am to about 3 or 4 am every day to make the deadline, we sometimes got Sundays off. There was a lot of rage and anger at many management levels.Steve would get a question about a two button mouse at every company meeting, he was super pissed every time about the question. We enjoyed trolling him.Steve&#39;s attention to detail was unbelievable. I once witnessed him make a team work overnight just to move an icon 10 pixels to the left.The guy had a vision that seems unparalleled. He was able to figure out the concept of &#34;cloud&#34; well before its time, and make a shift towards that.Of course, he was an supernatural presenter. I witnessed him present through some really messed up errors in live demos and no one I asked in the audience afterwards even noticed the errors.It was an insane work environment, never seen anything like it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really thankful I had a chance to work at 1 Infinite Loop during that time. I worked with other Developer Relations folks in IL3, with near-daily trips to IL2 to either meet with folks on the QuickTime team or just hang out. Occasionally I&#39;d get early glimpses at things like QTi and HyperCard 3.I vividly recall the day Steve introduced the iMac in the Infinite Loop quad. If I had to pick a day that telegraphed Apple&#39;s future fortunes, it would be that day. Rhapsody&#39;s potential was compelling, but as Macintosh OS it was still pretty Crapsody at the time. The iMac was a Real Thing — as friendly as computers get, that only Apple could&#39;ve created and sold."</p>
