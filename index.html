								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HN represents a wellspring of deeper reading than is generally afforded by the current entertainment cruft portals of the web - reddit, FB, insta, USA today, financial times, etc etc down to the SEO hellholes of recipe sites, youtube product placement; you get the idea.  Let&#39;s appreciate HN for the quality of reading material and its curb on our drift to the rest of the &#39;popular&#39; web.  And I don&#39;t think I&#39;m alone in always keeping an eye out for the next serious hub of real reading material!That said I don&#39;t read nearly as many books as I did in high school.  Books are wonderful things and can be a portal to a novel frame of mind.  But then again my life is much busier these days and there are more demands on my time which are not responsibly ignored... So I cherish HN as a flourishing intellectual community, in easily digestible chunks.  A bit like the &#34;periodical&#34; era of newspapers a century or two ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way to cure this is to develop a habit that severely limits undirected online browsing and socializing. Part of it is just an education of your own aesthetic sentiments. I read James Clear&#39;s &#34;Atomic Habits&#34; (not that this is a special book, I was just on another kick in which I really needed to improve my productivity and picked up a suggestion to use a physical counter of some kind to make a habit stick.I bought a bunch of marbles, and for every bloc of time that I avoid undirected browsing or social media use, I move a marble from one container to the other. My goal every day is to get through an arbitrary number of marbles (160 right now), after which I can do whatever. If I slip up and open a social media page, HN, or start browsing newspapers, I dump all the marbles out of the container, which generally makes it impossible to meet the day&#39;s goal unless the slipup is very early in the day.This has been nothing short of amazing for my life. One issue that I had is I had a physical twitch that would start developing after a couple minutes doing one thing, like a work project, at which I would feel the urge to check the news or social media. This twinge would show up and I would type into a browser window to relieve the sensation. Instead I more or less replaced that twinge with moving the marble from one container to the other. It&#39;s made it a lot easier to focus. Over time, I stopped caring as much about the news and became more easily satisfied by very briefly reading summaries every few days.I think a lot of web addiction is less driven by thoughts or brain issues and more by physical habits akin to nail-biting or cuticle-picking. Most of the attempts that I&#39;ve made to stop addictive behavior have not worked: they were based on schedules, timers, articulated goals, and other things like that rather than recognizing the physical trigger for the habit, the result of that trigger, and just redirecting the stimulus with another physical action rather than trying to suppress it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Socrates famously hated the written form, not because it was technologically advanced for its time, but because it was &#34;dead&#34;: you can&#39;t have a conversation with a piece of writing, or ask the author to explain something that&#39;s on the page.I disagree (and agree, indirectly, with the OP): deadness is a feature, not a bug. The problem with Internet writing is not just its addictive nature, it&#39;s groupthink. It is too much alive. You have to either follow popular opinion, or oppose it vehemently; tangential or orthogonal thinking is almost impossible.Books, because they are not part of an immediate, global conversation where people share opinions and judgements and signal their virtue to one another, are something very different and allow for a very different experience than any written text found online.Maybe books will slowly fade; but I think it&#39;s unlikely they would ever completely disappear, as they offer something unique not found anywhere else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the study&#39;s FAQ[0]:&gt; Did an Institutional Review Board consider this study?&gt; We submitted an application detailing our research methods to the Princeton University Institutional Review Board, which determined that our study does not constitute human subjects research.From the social experiment[as reported by OP&#39;s link]:&gt; I look forward to your reply without undue delay and at most within 45 days of this email, as required by Section 1798.130 of the California Civil Code.I&#39;m pretty sure most people would find that to be a thinly veiled threat of a lawsuit. I&#39;d like to know if the review board considered the text of the email that the &#34;researchers&#34;[1] intended to send and the fact that they were likely to send it to individuals instead of solely publicly traded companies.[0] https://archive.md/cSDGT[1] Seems to fall more under experimental psychology to me https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experimental_psychology?wprov=..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is interesting in the study web page (https://privacystudy.cs.princeton.edu/) that they consistently mention contacting &#34;websites&#34; instead of &#34;people.&#34; As if a website is some autonomous thing that can communicate with a researcher.I wouldn&#39;t be sleeping well if I were involved in this study. There is no way an IRB could determine that this is not human subjects research if you&#39;re emailing people and asking them anything.If I want to ask random people about the weather and publish the results in a journal, that qualifies as human subjects research and IRB protocols must be followed. Emailing people asking about privacy policies is definitely human subjects research. Either they misrepresented the study in their IRB application, or the IRB didn&#39;t do due diligence reviewing the application."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here! A few updates since this was published two years ago:- The service mentioned (now called https://webapp.io ) eventually made it into YC (S20) and still uses postgres as its pub/sub implementation, doing hundreds of thousands of messages per day. The postgres instance now runs on 32 cores and 128gb of memory and has scaled well.- We bolstered Postgres&#39;s PUBLISH with Redis pub/sub for high traffic code paths, but it&#39;s been nice having ACID guarantees as the default for less popular paths (e.g., webhook handling)- This pattern only ever caused one operational incident, where a transaction held a lock which caused the notification queue to start growing, and eventually (silently) stop sending messages, starting postgres with statement_timeout=(a few days) was enough to solve thisPrevious discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21484215Happy to answer any questions!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the key concept here is atomicity. If some API is responsible for creating a job, storing it in the database AND publishing it can never be an atomic operation. Both the database and pub/sub servers are separate network connections from the application server. For example, if you save the record first and then publish, It&#39;s quite possibe that you save the record in the database and then lose the connection to the pub/sub server when publishing. If this happens, you can never know if the pub/sub server received the request and published it. In systems where it&#39;s critical to guarantee that a record was saved and guarantee that it was published as well, the only way to do that is by using a single external connection - in this case to a Postgres DB. We&#39;ve used the same setup on an AWS RDS t2.medium machine to process over 600 records/second."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had thought about using postgres as a job queue before, but I couldn&#39;t figure out in my head how to make sure two processes didn&#39;t both take the same job. The &#34;FOR UPDATE&#34; and &#34;SKIP LOCKED&#34; were the keys to make this work in the article. Essentially, as far as I can tell, &#34;SELECT FOR UPDATE&#34; locks the rows as they&#39;re selected (locks are apparently visible outside the transaction), and &#34;SKIP LOCKED&#34; skips over rows for the select that other transactions have locked. Cool stuff.The below article goes over some downsides to using postgres for a job queue: namely that the data model isn&#39;t optimized to find and send new jobs to large numbers of subscribers. Actual messaging systems like Kafka/NATS are better at this.https://www.2ndquadrant.com/en/blog/what-is-select-skip-lock...Also, there are things that the dedicated messaging systems give you that postgres won&#39;t, such as transparent error handling and retry logic. If your worker grabs a job from postgres and fails (in some kind of transient way such that the task should be retried), you&#39;ll have to implement the retry logic yourself. A streaming platform like Kafka or NATS will notice that you haven&#39;t acknowledged the message and deliver it to someone else.This is something you could pretty easily implement yourself with something like a process that just scans over the &#34;processing&#34; jobs and looks for timeouts, resetting them as it goes. But there are probably a few of these little papercuts that Kafka-like (…Kafkaesque?) systems would handle for you.So, I guess if you already have postgres set up in a reliable way, and there&#39;s no one around whose job it is to set up new production systems like Kafka, and you don&#39;t already have something like Kafka, and you only need basic job queue requirements or you&#39;re okay with implementing whatever you need on top of postgres yourself, and your incoming job rate is fewer than maybe a thousand per second, and you have fewer than maybe tens of consumers… postgres is probably a decent job queue.The above paragraph seems snide but it probably does describe many people&#39;s environments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There seem to be two camps here:- Bose is an evil megacorp who recklessly endangered its customers by selling dangerous and poorly designed products.- Accidents happen and when a device explodes on your head you should accept it as a fact of life and move on.  The chemical burns are nothing and OP is a pussy.I think the reality may be different.  My take on it is that Li batteries possess inherent dangers and it is incumbent upon manufacturers to take reasonable steps to mitigate the dangers while informing their consumers of the risk.  Unfortunately, even when presented with the risks, most folks are unable to comprehend the probabilities and consequences and will nearly always choose convenience, features and value over the avoidance of danger.  It seems we, as a society(not as individuals, as some will surely object) have chosen Li technology and deemed it safe enough to deploy ubiquitously.I hope a review of this incident will shed light on the safety practices followed by Bose and will inform future engineers of unforeseen risks, giving us all safer, convenient devices.Overall I find the discussions in this thread unbecoming of the types of folks I thought frequented HN.  I hope we can all strive to elevate the dialogue and treat each other with a moderate amount of respect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be good to see an autopsy, to find out if it&#39;s actually the battery that went into thermal runaway, or something else that shorted and dumped all of its energy.I have no idea how much heavy metals I&#39;ve been exposed to by inhaling the toxic smoke. I don&#39;t know how much smoke my pregnant wife inhaled. I worry how much chemical residue is on my desk, floor, walls, how much is getting recycled by my HVAC system, how much exposure my pets had.That sort of paranoia doesn&#39;t help. In fact it may cause psychosomatic symptoms (nocebo effect). You&#39;ve probably inhaled far worse if you&#39;ve ever been to a barbeque, gas station, or just took a walk in one of the more crowded areas of the city."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re up for it, I suggest:1) Find a lawyer. I&#39;d guess that personal injury lawyer is the right kind, and that you can easily find one who works on contingency.2) File a complaint with the consumer product safety commission, and any other applicable government agencies. The lawyer may be able to help with this.You deserve compensation for this, and I wish you all the best with extracting it. I hope you recover soon.Also: Take photos and document everything. A massive number of photos, of the damage to your house and your body and anything else you can think of. This will help with the lawyer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, I genuinely do not get the &#34;controversy&#34; over the Veritasium video. AFAIU, the entire point of the video was to show that electricity travels not through wires but via electric fields (&#34;through the air&#34; so to speak).To illustrate this, he sets up an experiment with parameters such that the conclusion can only mean that some electricity has traveled to the bulb before any could arrive through/around the wires.He sets up the parameters so that the bulb would turn on by that little electricity; but that is obviously just a visual sign, and his point is valid no matter how much electricity traveled to bulb under whatever different parameters.It kinda feels like most people are missing the actual point of the video."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first signal is a close RF transmission, billions of people rely on it everyday, a current disturbs the electromagnetic field and and an antenna, sometimes thousands of kilometers away, detects a very small variation in the field (-120dbm @ 50Ω = 0.2μV). This is how our cellphones, wifi, GPS, RFID works. So, even if you disconnect the bulb and the switch you can create  a current in the bulb by turning on and off the switch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why wouldn&#39;t a simpler explanation be that the wires produce a radio/electromagnetic wave and that wave gets picked up and induces a current, which is how radio transmitters receivers work?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I picked up a Kinesis a few month ago and it&#39;s been a life changer. I&#39;ve struggled with shoulder pain since as far back as I can remember. I&#39;d done PT, dry needling, massage, etc etc. I&#39;d even sprung for a personal ergonomic assessment. I&#39;m a cyclist and and keyboard jockey, so most of my waking life is spent in positions that seemed to make it worse. At times it prevented me from sleeping, doing things I enjoyed, etc.  I wear a 42 jacket, so I&#39;m not crazy wide or anything.I&#39;d never seen anything that suggested that split keyboards were a good solve for the shoulder pain but I&#39;d reached that point of just throwing shit at a wall because it was that, or find a new career and hobbies. Moving my keyboard so my forearms can sit slightly wider than perpendicular to my chest has almost completely resolved the shoulder pain and the impact was almost immediate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In addition to all the comments from Advantage fans here, I also wanted to add that Kinesis has been an awesome company. I tweeted about some mods I made to my Advantage keyboard a long time ago, and they invited me to their office and donated a bunch of keyboards to the nonprofit I work for, to give as prizes to students (even before they launched the gaming-focused brand)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been a Kinesis user for 8 years, starting with an Advantage USB, added a classic PS2(with a usb adapter) as a backup and then was a tester for the Advantage 2 which I ended up buying. A company I worked for gave me a choice for keyboards when I joined so I tried a Ergodox EZ with the RGB backlighting.General observations:1. Overall I prefer the Advantage over the Ergodox. The big reason is the contoured design and the fact that the Ergodox tends to walk around unless you have a solid desk pad underneath it. Also, the Ergodox never felt as comfortable as the Advantage. Yes the Advantage is not as easy to travel with but still....
2. I like the new design, but there are a few things that would have made the pro perfect. PBT backlit keycaps like they offer on the Ergodox-EZ and RGB backlighting...and maybe a set of f-keys (on the fence with the last one).One other thing... A mix of o-rings and QMX clips made a huge difference with the feel of the keyboard for me. I have been a cherry brown user from the beginning though and different people have different preferences with that.Kinesis is also really good about providing parts and service. I&#39;ve had them send me replacement switches and have seen them offer up in-expensive replacement boards to repair and keep older models going.I&#39;m going to buy one of these, but given that I already have 4 high quality mechanical keyboards and I have yet to have one die I am starting to feel guilty having all of these laying around. That said there is a side of me that is curious about the Keyboard.io :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks to all Log4j developers. As users of your free software since ~20 years, we&#39;re sure that, if this vuln disclosure had been better and there were no sign of widespread in-the-wild exploitation, you would have done a better job at patching it, and a single release would have been enough.We won&#39;t hold a grudge against you; open source means collaboration, and you don&#39;t blame hard-working people that give away their software for free for honest mistakes. Your software still did far more good than bad to the software world.Thanks!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If information security people would spend the same amount of time they are spending complaining about this vulnerability trying to educate their organisations on the importance of supporting open source solutions they depend on we wouldn’t be in this situation.
 I am sick of reading of very senior people complaining about the impact this vulnerability has had on their week when their companies don’t even contribute a penny to open source projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see plenty of comments about security teams that should be doing this or that.I do not know about your security teams, but my security teams are now sitting 9 days straight trying to stop that shitshow. With teams complaining that they have to patch instead of doing Great Things.After that these security teams will be back to invisible work and forgotten again. Until the next issue.If your company has a truly different approach to security, tell it here - you may get really talented people knocking in because they are fed up with the security theater at their current job."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A notable excerpt that I often see in quotation:(11) General Interference with Organizations and Production(a) Organizations and Conferences(1) Insist on doing everything through &#34;channels.&#34; Never permit short-cuts to be taken in order to expedite decisions.(2) Make &#34;speeches.&#34; Talk as frequently as possible and at great length. Illustrate your &#34;points&#34; by long anecdotes and accounts of personal experiences. Never hesitate to make a few appropriate &#34;patriotic&#34; comments.(3) When possible, refer all matters to committees, for &#34;further study and consideration.&#34; Attempt to make the committees as large as possible — never less than five.(4) Bring up irrelevant issues as frequently as possible.(5) Haggle over precise wordings of communications, minutes, resolutions.(6) Refer back to matters decided upon at the last meeting and attempt to re-open the question of the advisability of that decision.(7) Advocate &#34;caution.&#34; Be &#34;reasonable&#34; and urge your fellow-conferees to be &#34;reasonable&#34; and avoid haste which might result in embarrassments or difficulties later on.(8) Be worried about the propriety of any decision — raise the question of whether such action as is contemplated lies within the jurisdiction of the group or whether it might conflict with the policy of some higher echelon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Chatting with my gf, we came up with a new section (mostly her):=== General Inquiries ===- Answer a question other than the one being asked. Feign misunderstanding.- Give incomplete answers. Do anything you can to almost but not completely answer the inquiry
.- Delay answering as long as possible.- Answer with a question.- Request more information than required to answer an inquiry.- Attempt redirection to other people or resources.- Involve as many people as possible- Rebuke the inquirer when they follow up on a previous unanswered inquiry within an arbitrary time window (days, not hours).- When asked multiple questions, answer only only of them, ignoring all others. Wait to be prompted to answer each question individually.- When asked multiple questions, answer the least important or time sensitive question first.- Ignore all information provided besides the single question being answered.- Prefer slower or more onerous communication methods
  1. snail mail
  2. email
  3. text messaging
  4. audio call
  5. video call
  6. in-person meeting- Mix multiple communication methods- If contacted using a lower ranking method, upgrade."</p>
