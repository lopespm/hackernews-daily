								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like many people may have, my first though was why would you buy a smart oven. He explains in a follow up that it was the only one offered by his home builder. And this is an important and overlooked point.A lot of garbage that no reasonable person would ever buy ends up being weaseled in to new home sales because of deals the companies cut with the builders, knowing nobody buys a house based on whether they could have a user-scamming smart appliance as the default. This kind of thing is insidious- I have no idea what the solution is.Though as a afterthought, it reminds me a bit of the microsoft antitrust stuff from 20+ years ago where they bundled IE as part of destroying Netscape (im sure there is more subtlety than that, that&#39;s the gist of what I remember)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ha! I have a fun one.We recently had our first child. I finally opened a thermometer we were gifted from a shower and low and behold, the thing can not take a temperature without downloading an app. It has a digital screen and everything, but you when you first power it on you are greeted with it displaying &#34;APP&#34; and you HAVE to download the app &amp; set it up before it will work.When we finally took the temperature, the damn thing still didn&#39;t even display it on the screen, it sent the reading to the app. I don&#39;t even know what the point of the screen is.This thing also wants to &#34;anonymously&#34; share your temp readings and location with the community stating it will help and let you know if there are diseases spreading locally.It went against my dignity to download it and use the thing, but it was 10:00PM and checking our baby&#39;s temp at the time was more important.Still it was the most asinine smart-device experience I have had to date."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time I see a story like this I&#39;m reminded how close we are to unauthorized bread [0] and it saddens me each time.Humanity was given the greatest communication tool we could imagine and we use it to spy on people and steal their data, so companies can sell more shit. What a waste.[0] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41085118-unauthorized-br...On a side note, I&#39;m convinced Doctorow is the greatest cyberpunk writer there is, but I&#39;m also sure the reason for this is because earlier writers had to imagine a dystopian future. Doctorow, like the rest of us, is living that future (which is much more boring that fiction made out) and he&#39;s simply documenting what he sees."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From my perspective, the really exciting thing about this that it works equally well in mobile web browsers as well as desktop web - clicking on a link on Mobile Safari should Do The Right Thing without having to install anything.Moreover, because it&#39;s built on Matrix, MSC3401 (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/group-...) means that we&#39;ll finally have decentralised cascading video/voice conferences once the SFU (selective forwarding unit) component is added into the mix.  So, for instance, users on the same homeserver will get their video feeds relayed locally with minimal latency... and then users on another remote homeserver will also get mixed locally with minimal latency, trunking the two together.  If the link dies or one homeserver dies, the conference will keep going - i.e. precisely the same semantics as normal Matrix."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And, the big one drum roll, please... we will be integrating this into Element so you can have voice and video rooms, and hold group video calls inside the Element app natively over Matrix.I&#39;d love to replace my teamspeak server with this. Discord is tempting, but I&#39;d rather host it myself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool. I really feel like this ecosystem is hitting its stride.The list of upcoming features is long and sometimes I don&#39;t understand how they can have so many things going on at once.Features tend to take a few years to mature, but that is not a bad thing.I will be setting up my own server shortly, something that I have been thinking about for a while and maybe try to develop something.Congrats to the team.Question:The OpenID part, would it not be cool if Matrx would offer something like a federated SSO experience? So that on other webpages you could use your matrix login instead of Github/Google and co. Hosting that server yourself would be fantastic.There are of course some issues with Attribute retrieval if user can host these servers themselves."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello! Original author (original tweeter?) here.This particular design is from the iPhone 7 (or, more precisely, my guess is that it&#39;s from the iPhone 7 due to both the date of the patent [1] and due to the elements matching up with marketing images of the iPhone 7), which is 6 years old now, but I think it&#39;s broadly still representative of modern smartphone lenses. In the past 5 years or so, advancements in phone cameras have come mostly in better sensors, far better image processing, and adding more cameras, but the basic principles of the compact ultra-aspherical lens design seem to still be in place.As an example, here [2] is an exploded view of the iPhone 6&#39;s lens setup, and here [3] is an exploded view of the more recent iPhone 12&#39;s lens setup. The iPhone 12 gained an extra element, but they both use similarly weird ripply elements and you can see the clear lineage between the two phones.Also, as mentioned in the tweet thread and elsewhere in the comments here, Kats Ikeda has an excellent, incredibly detailed and thorough explainer on mobile phone lens design [4]. I don&#39;t actually know a whole lot about the optics field; I&#39;m just dabbling as a hobbyist from a computer graphics perspective. Kats Ikeda&#39;s site is a much better resource than my Twitter posts for learning about this stuff.[1] https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/7e/4e/3f/4e88d65...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Complicated, but simply an incremental evolution of a very old solution.  These complicated lens arrangements to counteract chromatic aberration got started in the 18th century.  The game is all about getting three distinct wavelengths to focus despite each reacting differently at each lens.  The lens in the iPhone looks complex but it isn&#39;t any more complicated than others.  The most complex I&#39;ve ever read about was for a satellite which had to maintain focus despite temperature changes.  Iirc that employed a stack of over a dozen lenses.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achromatic_lenshttps://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/61074908

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I managed to escape the country yesterday, had to flight to Egypt of all places, because ALL (even business) tickets were sold out.
The recent news is that starting March 6 all international flights are suspended, the trap has closed.The disheartening thing is that even if you never supported Putin, other countries treat you as enemy.I am at Georgia now and banks refuse to open bank accounts to Russians, and I need one to continue working as a remote dev for US companies. Older generation (who are pro-Russian) suggested being careful around young people as they may be hostile to Russians, even those who are running away from Putin.A lot of my IT friends have fled the country, almost everyone who could. My heart is bleeding thinking of friends who wanted to leave on March 9, not sure what they can do now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No one thinks that a regular Ivan from some russian city (on his own) is responsible for the war and should suffer. And I see how you could (and probably should, at some level) feel sorry for russians fleeing the country.But this is the only way to tell them that they -- collective Ivans, Russian society as a whole -- should stand up and act: they should articulate their content, they should protest against putin&#39;s policy, and they should stop the war (an alternative would be to accept Ukraine to NATO and finish this war is a day, but that won&#39;t happen).While they&#39;re suffering economically, the suffering of Ukrainians is just on another level -- it&#39;s not about restrictions (e.g. no ikea or facebook or apple products) or money (inflation), it&#39;s about flattened cities and destroyed lives.I woke up as I heard bombs falling on my city, and I definitely haven&#39;t felt any sympathy for russians since then.If they feel they don&#39;t support their country&#39;s aggression towards Ukraine, they should go protest and stop it -- even at risk of being fined or imprisoned. Otherwise they should just embrace all sanctions and become North Korea imho."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We are actively trying to help Russian IT specialists to flee. We had over 300 resumes submitted by different people in our Telegram community in just two days. Most of these are senior people, many with experience in Yandex, local branches of Google and other international companies.I wrote about the situation here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30552091If anyone can help us get these people out — please step forward, all information is in the post. 30+ recruiters are already working with us, but that is not enough."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I left Apple after years of lack of any flexibility on the remote work process. They wouldn&#39;t allow transferring to any alternative office for most teams. From what I understood, VPs could protect a small minority of some of their employees if a senior leader made a case to them.Unfortunately, this just seemed to lead to the most politically connected folks going remote and directors friends and favorite hires getting the perk.At three trillion market cap, I guess they just realized it doesn&#39;t really matter if attrition shoots up and they&#39;ll always have enough people to fill the trenches. Lots and lots of people left around the same time.Having left, I forgot what it was like to be able to focus on something other than Apple. Incredibly toxic atmosphere on the inside. I work at a fast-paced startup and still work on average 10/hours a week less than at Apple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it&#39;s me, but I have yet to experience &#39;innovation&#39; result from a conversation held over coffee or a chance encounter. I&#39;ve had better luck creating connections with other parts of the business and exchanging ideas over the infrequent cocktail party where it&#39;s a mission of the night. Say all you want about open floorplans and irrelevant quiet encounters.Having said that, every situation is unique."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I suspect we are going to see some turmoil in the tech hiring space with stock prices taking a beating in recent months. Large companies have gotten away with paying under market price for talent because employees have seen massive gains from stock appreciation over the last decade. If total comp starts going down year over year, suddenly the more traditional, no-frills system at places like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon isn&#39;t going to look nearly as attractive, especially compared to companies one tier below that are already offering higher comp and more flexible work options."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can only really judge a font when its loaded in my system, running in my setup. I wish font makers targeting developers would release trial fonts (with some essential chars missing or similar), so that we could test them properly before paying.I am always looking for a better font, and this one looks like it may be an improvement over my current one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks nice in principle, but being suitable for the actual daily use (for coding) will depend on how it renders in a specific IDE at a specific size on a specific OS. There&#39;s LOTS of mono fonts that look great in larger sizes or on Macs, but that all but unbearable to look at in smaller sizes on Windows.There&#39;s no mention of this font having a manually hinted TTF version, which is pretty much required for rendering under these conditions. This gives me a very big pause. As others have said - at $75 a pop this font absolutely needs a downloadable, installable and usable trial. How it looks in PDF and rendered to a bitmap may showcase its design well, but not its real-world usage. That&#39;s assuming that the author means to position it also as a coding font (which seems to be the case judging by the samples)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What is the best type of radio, or best type of radios, to have in the event of a protracted, possibly nuclear conflict?Ready.gov suggests a hand crank or NOAA weather radio. Specifically, I suppose some good goals would be:1. Receive instructions from any functioning local or state government. This would require that the local government know which type of radio the populace is likely to be listening on, which gives an advantage to FM or weather radios.2. Communicate with other regional survivors.3. Global news, for which shortwave would be indispensable.Maybe multiple radios that can receive on different frequencies would be best? I really know very little about this topic other than basic physical signal characteristics.Edit: I don&#39;t &#34;prep,&#34; but I occasionally browse this website when doomscrolling, which has a few suggestions: https://theprepared.com/gear/reviews/emergency-radio/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I posted this comment on a less popular thread a few days ago:I had the luck of seeing this plane on approach to IAH airport while driving in Houston.For the first few minutes, it looked like a normal size plane, but felt too low and too slow. Then for the next few minutes, it kept getting bigger and bigger. Then I saw it had 6 engines. And a tail wing that seemed as large as a normal plane’s wingspan. I was lucky that it crossed right in front of me as I was near the airport (about 2.5 miles from the runway). It looked so low, so slow, and just massive. I went home and figured out what it was by googling it. That time it was transporting part of an oil rig.
I tried to find it to go see again ever since, but I could never get a clear schedule and it didn’t line up with where I was in the world. I was telling my wife the other week that this was something I’d like to seek out. It’s something that anyone on this site, aviation enthusiast or not, would have appreciated seeing."</p>

It was originally developed as an enlargement of the Antonov An-124 to transport Buran-class orbiters, and only one example was ever completed.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonov_An-225_Mriya"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Weird that the author mentions international support and the importance of inaccessible bases to Mao, but doesn&#39;t mention the ability of the Taliban or Viet Cong to hide in neighboring countries where conventional military force can&#39;t be applied. I expect that will also be crucial in Ukraine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d wished they would have gone into some of the differences between a protracted was with the U.S. and Russia looks like.It&#39;s seems like it is easier to point out how Afghanistan and Vietnam were able to draw out a long-term protracted war and out-will a democracy that (to a degree) follows the changing will of the people.  It&#39;s especially easier given the lack of threat to the mainland that can be manufactured.But what about against a neighboring oligarchy like Russia?  How do you out-will the singular authoritarian leader and/or his small group of oligarchs?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Protracted wars (i.e. long slow wars via hit-and-run and guerilla warfare) have been very successful in past to topal the mighty powers by far weaker forces. However, in recent times, I feel they are becoming much less effective. The electronic surveylence and automated targetting makes such warfare much difficult. This is especially the case because, (1) the ruling power will eventually control all communication and remove any free speech, (2) they will constantly find and kill leaders through electronic means which are now amazingly effective.A much better defensive route is probably mandatory militery training of all able citizens. Eventually, most professional armies are in the size of million at most and only 100,000 or so get deployed. If you have a million citizens with militery training, you are way harder to beat."</p>
