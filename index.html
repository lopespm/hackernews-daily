								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven&#39;t read or listened to this book yet, I highly recommend it: Daily Rituals: How Artists Work[1]It&#39;s a collection of daily routines of many famous and prolific artists. The surprising thing about so many of the artists is that they only work 2 or 3 hours per day, then spend the rest of the day walking around, socializing, etc. But they consistently show up and put in the work and it adds up to some amazing things over time.This reminds me of another great book about beating procrastination: The Now Habit: A Strategic Program for Overcoming Procrastination and Enjoying Guilt-Free Play[2]In that book, the author talks about his extensive work helping graduate students complete their dissertations. I can&#39;t cover all the great points here, but when working with these students he has them create an &#34;unschedule&#34; where they have to schedule guilt-free play activities as the top priority. Then he actually limits the amount of work they are allowed to do on their dissertation to only a couple of hours per day. The effect is quite amazing at turning students around from dreading and avoiding their dissertation to really trying to maximize the limited time they have to work on it. And having guilt-free play lets them really disconnect from the work and have true recovery so that they have the motivation and energy to hit the project again and again every day. Seems counter-intuitive at first, but as I&#39;ve applied this to different projects, it&#39;s amazing how much more I&#39;m able to accomplish.[1] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15799151-daily-rituals[2] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/95708.The_Now_Habit"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This worked wonderfully for me when prepping for interviews the last time I searched for a job. I just committed to 3 months of doing the Leetcode monthly challenge at a minimum. Some days I did more, yes, but only when I felt like it.By the end of the experiment, I&#39;d seen the majority of algorithms and data structures problem classes that I&#39;d likely ever see in an actual interview. Just doing the daily practice was enough to keep my muscle memory sharp, and in an interview setting, being quick to bang out an algorithm almost always gives you good marks.To test it out further, after I did my first interview (and felt I aced it), I did not do any daily practice for about 3 weeks between that and my next one. The difference was shocking. I was noticeably slower at answering very similar questions, and occasionally got stuck on things I knew I should know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Effectiveness of just showing up works wonderfully for fitness as well.How much ever unfit one is, just showing up for a long period of time changes oneself. All one has to do drag oneself to the class, day in and day out, and then universe takes over.."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I found this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r-A78RgMhZU &#34;A Talk Near the Future of Python (a.k.a., Dave live-codes a WebAssembly Interpreter)&#34; to be a brilliant introduction to WASM as well as writing interpreters in general. I&#39;m a relative novice in the subject and it was pitched right at my level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very nice. I like these tutorials showing the nuts and bolts of wasm and C without just throwing it at  emscripten toolchain.I&#39;m curious if there&#39;s perf differences between canvas and webgl canvas. This project uses just canvas, but iirc passing frames to be rendered by webgl is faster. Perhaps I&#39;m wrong in this context.I also don&#39;t see threading in here. Makes sense for a demo, but if this were to be used performantly you&#39;d have to throw it all in a webworker so it doesn&#39;t block the main thread. This is one point of contention with wasm because it&#39;s not straightforward to render to a canvas/webgl on the main thread from a worker thread. OffscreenCanvas is one workaround but not supported by FF or safari."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly the kind of tutorial I&#39;ve been waiting for for years. The way blocks and breaks work is especially non-intuitive if you are used to either assembly or regular languages, and you START with it. Good work, really loving this tutorial!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The German court held that YouTube failed to make its enforcement authority clear in its contract with the account operator who posted the video.Does YouTube&#39;s TOS really not contain statements giving them the ability to stop hosting any video, at any time, for any reason?Edit: I guess not: the only content removal clause I see is this one, which is definitely not &#34;we can remove your video for any reason, as long as we feel like it.&#34;  I&#39;m a little surprised they don&#39;t seem to have included anything like that.&gt; If we reasonably believe that any Content is in breach of this Agreement or may cause harm to YouTube, our users, or third parties, we may remove or take down that Content in our discretion. (from https://www.youtube.com/static?template=terms)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A good move.
Everything so big as YouTube should follow national laws.
Otherwise private terms of policies become more part of society than national ones. Then the hundreds of years of fighting becomes nothing and we are back in a modern kingdom based society."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve tried to find the actual court decision, best match seems to be 4 W 118/21 (enter on https://www.justiz.sachsen.de/esamosplus/pages/index.aspx under &#34;Aktenzeichen&#34; &amp; click &#34;suchen&#34;, can&#39;t see any obvious way to link the PDF...)However, that document does not actually order a fine.  It warns about imposing one (&#34;up to 250&#39;000€&#34;) if Youtube doesn&#39;t remedy the problem.  Considering it&#39;s now exactly 3 months later (decision dates April 13th), that lines up.From what I understand (not a lawyer, yadda yadda) this is a purely civil matter and doesn&#39;t really go as far as some statement on free speech.  The issue discussed mostly seems to revolve around which terms of service are valid and how they can be changed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was around twenty my Mom used to call me every other day or so just to have a chat. One day, after she asked me how my day was, I shot back something along the lines of: &#34;I don&#39;t have anything to tell you, really. You&#39;re calling so often that nothing new manages to happen in between the calls.&#34; So, she stopped calling. I would go home every other week as usual and everything seemed fine. It was only much later that I found out that she basically cried for three days straight after that call.Some time later there was a period when I would contact my parents every few months or so. Not really on purpose. Simply because other things simply took more of my time and attention, and calling my parents wasn&#39;t really high on my list of priorities.Only when my son was born I started to realize what someone goes through as an individual and as a couple once a child comes into their lives. How it changes things. That not being thrown out of the window at 2 a.m. as an infant is already a blessing. I&#39;m sure that thought has crossed the mind of many a young parent with a screeching infant on their hands in the middle of night. So, I felt ashamed of myself, and grateful to my parents for being there in the first place, and being decent at being parents as well.Now I&#39;ve made a point to myself to call them up at least once a week. As in, I have set up a reminder for that. I now know how much they value this. But it&#39;s not only for them. I realize very well that one day I will wake up and wish to call my parents to have a chat about something. But there simply won&#39;t be anyone to call anymore.I&#39;m not passing any judgement at all on people who have abusive parents. I have no idea how that feels like. I&#39;m just happy that I didn&#39;t end up accidentally getting estranged to the decent parents that I have. At some point it really was going that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re all living that Asian family joke.Parents spend their whole lives waiting for their kids to thank you.  Kids spend their whole lives waiting for their parent to say &#34;I&#39;m sorry.&#34;That said I&#39;ve never felt that way about my Mom and Dad.  I&#39;ve faults and problems a plenty but I wouldn&#39;t ascribe any of that on them; indeed the best things about me seem to clearly come from them and the worst are just as clearly things they suggested I not do.  What are you going to do though, even if all that wasn&#39;t true they&#39;d still love me and I&#39;d still love them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wonder how much of this is driven by social media and the internet today. The word &#39;Toxic&#39; is just thrown around now and everything is &#39;Toxic&#39;. Its a word that has ceased to have any real meaning but virtually every behavior that used to just be normal every day activity is Toxic. Everyone has flaws and no one has all the answers. Parents are just people doing the best they can and for the most part making what they think are the best decisions in the moment while struggling with everything that everyone else struggles with. Children want to put their parents on a pedestal and assume that all decisions; and any harm caused was intentional. There are of course bad parents and bad people and I don&#39;t mean to discount the effect that those people have on their kids. Social media is quick these days to tell you that your parents are narcissists when in reality they are just distracted trying to figure out what happened to their lives and trying to get by. At the end of every day I look back and see choices I made that were probably not great or see where I ignored my kid as I was trying to get something done for work. These things pile up and then are focused through the lens of the internet and suddenly you are a bad parent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to be of the mind that ad tech et. al. weren’t really hurting anyone, and that the more extreme examples of privacy offenses were simple edge cases.That is until I switched to iOS and was given the option to hide my true email address, tell an app not to track me, and otherwise get visibility into just how much my data is getting sniffed for stupid reasons that have nothing to do with the service I’m using."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s easy to mock the pettiness of all parties described here, and it&#39;s common for people on this forum to take absolutist stances with regards to privacy/advertising, but it&#39;s also important to recognize that these arguments will actually define the future of the internet for the average user.There are trillion dollar companies on both sides of the argument, and their eventual compromise will establish the defaults for billions of users.There are also two fundamental components of the Big Tech debate at odds with each other here - privacy and competition. Increasing privacy decreases competition by strengthening the Big Tech companies that engage with users at the platform/browser/OS/hardware level. See: Google&#39;s removal of third-party cookies from Chrome in the name of privacy was just blocked by EU competition regulators, because it would cripple competing advertising companies[1].[1] https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/eu-antitrust-reg..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funny how there is no (meaningful) user representation at W3C.  Perhaps Wendy Seltzer is the closest to a user representative.  A lawyer who is a Perl programmer, according to her Wikipedia profile.The arguments against Big Tech the smaller ad tech folks are raising sound legit, but obviously they are not being made in good faith.  Big Tech has no more respect for user privacy than companies like Rosewell&#39;s.  They are all a threat to user privacy.  Companies that make browsers should not also be taking in online ad services revenue.  It is a clear conflict of interest.51degrees provides the public with a CSV list of user-agents, e.g., for use in browser fingerprinting (or perhaps user defence against browser fingerprinting).  What does Google provide.  We know they are fingerpringing on a mass scale.  There is zero transparency.https://raw.githubusercontent.com/51Degrees/Device-Detection...Just for fun, I periodically compile w3c-libwww.  It still compiles and it still works today. I use it through a TLS-enabled proxy.  It reminds me of all the potential for experimetation the www once had.  Today the web just looks like a Big Tech-led surveillance dystopia slowly coming together.  Unless someone stops it.  Lina Khan, godspeed.The disputes described in the article with lawyers from W3C and IAPP looking on reminds me a little of the formation of ICANN back in the 1990&#39;s and the disputes over domain names versus trademarks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is open source software and it can reverse engineer programs from a lot of different systems.Some people may be worried about installing a piece of software on their computer that comes from the NSA. I don&#39;t think that there are real reasons to worry. One of the tasks of the NSA is defending against cyber attacks. Having more people with good tools helps the defense. Also, you can be pretty certain that some security people have been closely looking at the sources to see if it contains any suspicious features. Besides, if the NSA really wants to install some software on your computer, they can probably do it themselves without your involvement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want to harness the power of Ghidra decompiler but without the need of installing Java - Rizin[1][2] and Cutter[3][4] (Rizin&#39;s Qt GUI) integrate Ghidra&#39;s decompiler part that is written in C++ (libdecomp) as plugin - rz-ghidra[5]. We work currently on improving the integration and the quality of output.[1] https://rizin.re[2] https://github.com/rizinorg/rizin[3] https://cutter.re[4] https://github.com/rizinorg/cutter[5] https://github.com/rizinorg/rz-ghidra"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used this again just the other day with the cantor.dust plugin. My rev.eng skills are dull and were never great to begin with, but for anything below a real APT with obfuscation, runtime decoding and unpacking, Ghidra is an equalizer.  Between this and Chef from gchq, someone with devops skills can probably skill up to an entry level threat analyst level in a few weeks or months. The tooling available today is really good.If people are worried about running systems backdoored by NSA, they probably shouldn&#39;t use things like electricity either. It&#39;s a threat actor you can&#39;t really do anything about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kudos to Twitter for pulling the plug on a high profile feature that wasn&#39;t working out.I saw some reasonably interesting Fleets at first, but it quickly devolved into a low-effort self promotion feature as they noted:&gt; Although we built Fleets to address some of the anxieties that hold people back from Tweeting, Fleets are mostly used by people who are already Tweeting to amplify their own TweetsEventually I stopped clicking on them because I knew I&#39;d see the Tweets during my normal scrolling anyway. I suppose this problem is inherent to Twitter, where Tweets are already low effort enough that they didn&#39;t need another feature for rapid-fire, low-effort content. Contrast with Instagram where people&#39;s posts are generally well thought out, but their stories are made for rapid-fire content.Twitter didn&#39;t have the same divergence, so Fleets and Tweets became the same content in different formats. And of course, the Twitter self-promoters took full advantage of a feature that let them bubble their content to the literal top of people&#39;s feeds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Although we built Fleets to address some of the anxieties that hold people back from Tweeting, Fleets are mostly used by people who are already Tweeting to amplify their own Tweetsthis is exactly my problem with Twitter. It&#39;s an even bigger echo chamber than FB. As much as I try, I can&#39;t seem to escape the oversaturated bubble of a handful of extremely loud mouthed tweeters and their ardent followers. Mix in the toxic conversations, and it&#39;s definitely not a place I feel comfortable discussing anything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The infancy period of this technology is fascinating.Think about computer graphics 15 years ago. Beowulf came out in 2007, and was developed in the preceding years- let&#39;s call it 15+ years old. And it was right there in the uncanny valley where it didn&#39;t look real, but it looks realistic. It was interesting visually, but my brain told me &#34;this isn&#39;t correct&#34;.And now some modern game engines are doing more realistic rendering than that in real-time.Now look at these generative models. Some state of the art ones with humans helping are pretty convincing, but it&#39;s slow work. The more general ones like these are making these wonderfully interesting images that our brains immediately say &#34;That&#39;s not correct&#34;.But where will this technology be in another 15 years? I think the possibilities for entertainment are really interesting. Imagine a D&amp;D game where the GM is vocally telling the AI what to generate, then making small tweaks, and the players are seeing the results."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Long-time user here.  Laying out newsletters, flow charts, diagrams, and figlets.  It has very few issues these days, and only a couple minor points of frustration in the UI.  For my purposes, it&#39;s the best thing out there.A couple of workflow tips for using Monodraw:* Open a few docs in Monodraw at a time and leave them open for your different needs: text boxes, figlets, diagrams.  Each with a few elements already waiting to be filled, cut &amp; pasted, etc.* For larger docs (e.g. newsletters) finish the writing in your text editor and bring it into Monodraw.  Think Publisher or InDesign.  Yeah, you can edit in here, but it&#39;s weird.  Best for layout.* Browse the sample file that opens by default when you load Monodraw.  Good fodder in there.* Snippets!* Yes, it is just text but there is FILL to give order (front to back) of elements.  This is really handy for making slides that expose a list one item at a time.* Cut and Paste chunks in and out of your Monodraw file with your main document or take a clipped screen capture for dropping into a graphic or fancy format document (e.g. Illustrator).  No need to export and paste."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While Monodraw seems to have business related features I feel the need to mention &#34;Mœbius ANSI Art Editor&#34;[0] a cross platform open source alternative.Moebius is a new ANSI and ASCII Editor for MacOS, Windows, and Linux.With a neat Moebius Server feature that allows collaboration by multiple users on the same canvas through a server instance.[0]: https://blocktronics.github.io/moebius/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned about Monodraw from Thorsten Ball’s interpreter / compiler books. The book has really beautiful illustrations and ASCII drawings, when I asked the author they directed me to MonodrawHere is a sample chapter from the book (in PDF) - https://compilerbook.com/sample.pdf"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When one government/party (implicitly or explicitly) gets twitter to put content favorable to it to the detriment of its opponents, right there, twitter lost the script, and the moral standing.the talk of legality is nonsense, because there are jurisdictions where anything can be made legal.The vast majority of the world will be better off with a twitter/fb etc cut down to size, and the current massive power of social media networks being reduced."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thought experiment: a US government-hosted social network.Because the government is the host, they can&#39;t censor anything on the platform, unlike private social networks. The moderation policy would effectively be the content of the first amendment, barring actual illegal content.Call it publicsquare.gov"</p>
