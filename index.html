								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh this is great. When we taught SHA-256 last semester, we linked to this YouTube video: https://youtu.be/f9EbD6iY9zI. Next time we do it, we&#39;ll probably link to both. Having several different ways to visualize the same thing is very helpful, and I like that this one moves quickly.A couple of details missing from this visualization are how you pad a message to be a multiple of the block size, and how you chain blocks together to form a longer message. In the pseudocode at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2#Pseudocode, that&#39;s the &#34;Pre-processing (Padding)&#34; part and the &#34;for each chunk&#34; loop just below it. I get why you&#39;d want to leave those things out, since they&#39;re not really the interesting part, and the screen is already pretty packed as it is.If anyone&#39;s feeling curious about implementing this yourself, take a look at these project notes: https://github.com/oconnor663/applied_crypto_2021_fall/tree/.... At some point I&#39;ll clean that up for public consumption, but for now just ignore the parts about grades and cheating :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, how do people come up with these things? I assume every aspect of the design is carefully considered to defend it against various attacks. For example, why &#34;right rotate 7 XOR right rotate 18 XOR right shift 3&#34; and not &#34;right rotate 2 XOR right rotate 3 XOR right shift 4&#34;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s really cool. I made a terrible one for SHA1 years ago, yours is 1000x better.https://lock.cmpxchg8b.com/sha1/visualize.htmlI read a paper at the time where someone described a tool they made to find a near-collision, they explained they were just flipping bits and visually observing the affects. That sounded kinda fun, but they didn&#39;t release it, so I tried to replicate it from their description!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Indeed. Valve established DRM to a degree many previously hoped it would get rejected. But they offered a decent service and proved that piracy is a service problem. What they did for Linux as a gaming platform is spectacular. Not many people use it yet, but Windows does look less and less like a dependable long term solution, especially with Microsofts other ambitions in that industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To add on this: Valve works with upstream developers on upstream code, so their work benefits the whole FOSS ecosystem. They are funding a lot of kernel, Mesa, Wayland, Wine and KDE developers.(Disclaimer: I&#39;m a Valve contractor.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like I am in a &#34;late-game&#34; stage of gaming. I have sort of an overview of what is going on, but a major percentage of games simply look not interesting (anymore) to me.The collection of games I end up playing is somewhere between special and weird, I&#39;d say.And, to get back to the topic, for people in a comparable situation like me, Linux is a great alternative. So if hear or read other people comparing pros and cons of Win vs. Linux (or Apple vs. Linux), and gaming was the major drawback, think carefully if that applies to you as well.Having a pile of shame on Linux is as easy to do as on Windows, just it&#39;s smaller (which is good, right?). But having one at all means that you don&#39;t have a lack of games, but quite the opposite.Of course, when you deeply into AAA and big franchises, and need to play a game when it&#39;s published and everyone talks about it - then probably not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel that I made the transition from jr to mid level developer when I was able to come into some new code and judge it, instantly pointing out what was wrong and how it could be improved, and how it should&#39;ve been built. I feel that I went from mid to senior when I would enter that same situation and try to understand the why behind the code (even though I probably still thought it was poorly architected) before passing judgement or trying to &#34;fix&#34; it with a refactor."</p>

But what if a lot of &#34;stupid&#34; design decisions are actually Type 2?And the reasons may or may not be good - somewhere on a scale from real budget and/or time constraints, lack of insight, indifference, penny pinching economics, to passive aggressive user hostility.When Apple removed Magsafe no doubt there were perfectly good internal justifications for that decision. But ultimately the people outside the company who said it was a poor move from a user POV turned out to be right."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked with Nick a few times in a previous job and he was a reviewer on a paper I wrote; he was really nice and professional, and his feedback was constructive and incisive.The movement he&#39;s part of is fundamentally disagreeable (in the &#39;big five&#39; sense [0]), and some of its prominent characters, as you might expect, have reputations for being interpersonally difficult [1]. Collectively they&#39;ve been labeled &#34;data thugs&#34; [2] and accused of &#34;methodological terrorism&#34; [3], which is why I think Nick&#39;s fundamental goodness is an especially valuable asset. We&#39;d gain a ton of social value from certain reforms to the scientific research apparatus, and, IMO, being kind when delivering pointed critiques helps a difficult pill go down. That&#39;s different than pulling your punches; it just means staying focused on the thing you actually want to change.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Five_personality_traits[1] https://medium.com/@OmnesRes/the-dumbest-fucking-thing-ive-e...[2] https://www.science.org/content/article/meet-data-thugs-out-...[3] https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2016/09/21/what-has-h..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is a fantastic example of how a) anyone can call bullshit on science if it doesn&#39;t make sense and b) there are more and less correct ways of calling bullshit on established science.You don&#39;t need to hop on a podcast or radio show in order to question the orthodoxy of a scientific claim, and in fact you shouldn&#39;t if you want to be taken seriously.  Nick Brown would have hurt his case had he done that, and instead found a path that actually knocked down a faulty concept in a way that has lasting effects.This is the process working.  This is all okay, and welcome, IMO, though possibly not by everyone involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Taking equations from physics out of context to bolster social science claims isn&#39;t unique to psychology, other social sciences like economics have done the same thing with little more justification.  The rationale behind this approach is simple marketing, in that &#39;using more mathy stuff&#39; will sell better to the general public than non-mathy hand-waving claims will.However, the practioners of this approach don&#39;t seem to understand that physical equations are constructed by analysis of empirical experimental and observational data on one hand, and theoretical mathematical development on the other, within limited scopes of applicability.  Copying equations from one area of science to another willy-nilly like the article describes is just ridiculous - would cosmologists studying general relatively just plug in quantum mechanical equations in the hope of getting a &#39;mathy explanation&#39;?Here&#39;s another example from &#39;mathematically sound neoclassical economics&#39;, which does the same with 19th century physical science equations:&gt; &#34;The strategy the economists used was as simple as it was absurd—they substituted economic variables for physical ones. Utility (a measure of economic well-being) took the place of energy; the sum of utility and expenditure replaced potential and kinetic energy. A number of well-known mathematicians and physicists told the economists that there was absolutely no basis for making these substitutions. But the economists ignored such criticisms and proceeded to claim that they had transformed their field of study into a rigorously mathematical scientific discipline.&#34;https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-economist-has..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;While the investors listed above can take care of themselves, unfortunately, invitations to invest were also extended to small-time individual angel investors. Thousands of AngelList members were invited to invest personal checks ranging from $2,000 to $20,000+ via the mailing lists of multiple syndicates.&#34;It&#39;s worth noting that any US person investing this way is required to be an accredited investor, which is another way of saying they&#39;ve proven they can afford to lose that $20k (or whatever they&#39;re putting in).The accredited investor rules in USA seem draconian, but if it weren&#39;t for them, we&#39;d be absolutely drowning in fake tech companies taking money from retail investors. (Today those fakes are in crypto, where you can pretend your investment offering is a utility token or maybe a donation to a revolutionary DAO that just happens to issue tradeable crypto-tokens in return, and hide behind pseudonyms to make it harder for SEC to find you eventually.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazingly, my startup (KubeSail.com YCS19) has similar revenue, has raised 500x less, and we&#39;ve been told point blank that &#34;nobody wants to invest in a hardware company&#34;, or &#34;yes, but what&#39;s the path to 100B&#34;.Hey maybe we don&#39;t have any path to 100B (is 1B just for chumps?), and maybe our margins aren&#39;t B2E-style 99%, but I&#39;d much rather be making something people want rather than...And then I hear my wifes voice in my head: &#34;You can&#39;t pay yourself that little forever...&#34;. Maybe I&#39;m the fool.Strange world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any evidence that Kagan took money off the table or paid himself an outsized salary, or hired his friends on exaggerated salaries, or used the startup&#39;s funds as his piggybank?Similarly, the article conflates A16Z leading the seed round but not the follow on round as being some kind of smell. A16Z certainly do lead follow-on rounds, but it isn&#39;t the norm. (It would be interesting to know if they exercised pro-rata or not, but even that isn&#39;t necessarily indicative of anything.)I don&#39;t know if there is or isn&#39;t fraud here, but the only evidence seems to be that Kagan was good at fundraising, raise a lot in a frothy market on little traction, and did not succeed at building the product or a successful business.One of the best things about the tech ecosystem is the lack of stigma around failure. I hope people don&#39;t lose sight of that as round sizes and valuations spike."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; My X13 AMD, for example, has a powerful 32-core AMD APU, 32GiB of RAM, and a superfast 1TiB NVMe SSD.The X13 does not have a 32-core APU. The highest spec available is the 4750U with 8C/16T.&gt; By the way, the latest MacBook Pro comes with an Ethernet port. We loved the jokes about iDongle; how about ThinkDongle?The latest MacBook Pro does not come with an Ethernet port. It is however very annoying that Lenovo requires a proprietary dongle to use the built-in Ethernet controller.&gt; The removal of the SD cards slot and Ethernet port has made recent ThinkPads a suboptimal choice for traveling photographers and some IT professionals.The removal of the SD card reader on the X13 AMD Gen 2 is bizarre, but they can and do still offer Ethernet via a dongle.&gt; would you read about the update procedure after you’ve done multiple BIOS updates for the same machine already? Even if you would, would you pay much attention to the Notes section?Yes, but I&#39;m probably weird because I like to know what the vendor fixed and whether the firmware update might remove features that I use (shakes fist at Dell).I own an X13 AMD Gen 2 (20XH), and I think it&#39;s a great laptop with some small caveats.Pro:- 1600p matte display looks amazing- proper support for S3, very low S3 power consumption- super quiet, I never hear the fan and the laptop is never uncomfortably hot (even doing heavy things like compiling buildroot)- amazing performance for a laptop (5850U)Con:- no SD card reader (seriously, why?)- proprietary dongle for Ethernet- Ethernet is only GigE- Came with MediaTek 7961 WiFi, which while supported by mainline Linux, the performance is trash (~30MBit on 802.11ac). Luckily it&#39;s only M.2 so you can replace it with something like the AX201"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A T420 was my daily driver through undergrad, and then collected dust during grad school when I was issued a Macbook. When I returned my Macbook I dusted it off and was surprised by how usable it was (and how usable and well-supported it was running Arch compared to debian in the early 2010s). I finally gave in and upgraded the memory (DDR3!) to 16 GiB recently, and am considering getting a third-party 9-cell battery, as my 9+ year old one has gotten long in the tooth (i3&#39;s battery &#34;widget&#34; reports ~70% fully charged).I dare say it&#39;s my most usable travel laptop outside of my work-issued Yoga, which it still trounces in terms of keyboard ergonomics. It absolutely dunks on the bargin-bin laptops I&#39;ve tried out over the past few years, I think in part because of ergonomics but also because Arch on old (but well-supported) hardware feels snappier than Windows 10 on new (but low-cost) hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Didn&#39;t read it all, but regarding the battery and sleep issue: I can totally relate to such issues with my Dell XPS 15 9550 (2015) and 9510 (2021).Windows has this setting &#34;When I close the lid&#34; which is set to &#34;Sleep&#34;. In fact it should be renamed as &#34;Drain the battery and heat the bag&#34;.Being a happy MacBook user since they were called PowerBook, I never ever had any such issue with an Apple laptop. Not even, when they were using the same Intel CPUs.Worse, some months ago I even found a Dell support forum post where they said, to not use sleep mode when putting your laptop away."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a foreign wife and it really drives home one truth: America is a very nuanced place. We have this idea of almost unlimited free speech. Which sounds great, but in practice, it is not really true. Because ultimately, Americans do not have equal rights. We see this over and over in different aspects of society. The Frederick Douglas example from Boston in the article is a great example of why free speech is good. But the truth is it is the same kind of people who are always preventing free speech in meaningful ways. If your takeaway from the speech is that &#34;all kinds of speech need to be heard&#34;, you might be philosophically correct. But, again, in practice, the people in power do not allow free speech. And this is fundamentally different from most examples of cancel culture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The application of censorship itself, not what is being censored, is the main symptom of the declining cultural health. The mentality that there are so universally wrong and right things that the right ones must be forced upon any mind, no matter the context, and the wrong ones must be extinguished no matter the context."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One major distinction this glosses over is the difference between making it so you can&#39;t read something (e.g., banning it), and making it so you aren&#39;t required to read something (e.g., removing it from the curriculum). Only the former is censorship."</p>

Apparently, Amazon scale is so large and their attrition rates are so bad that in some markets, every potentially qualified candidate has already applied and failed an interview, or previously worked at Amazon and quit. As the adage goes, necessity is the mother of invention and Amazon seems to be at a point where it really needs to try everything under the sun to try to attract talent, given their extremely poor reputation.With this said, from reading the article, this move seems reminiscent of Netflix&#39;s pay structure, in the sense of offering a higher cash portion but lower equity. Some people here already mentioned that this was already sort of the case with a sign on bonus compensating for the backloaded vesting structure. From my experience interacting w/ professionals outside the FANG bubble, equity tends to be a bit confusing, so I wonder if a move towards bigger cash portions is a way to try to lure people who wouldn&#39;t otherwise be looking at big tech as a prospective career choice.What&#39;s also curious to me is that bumping up cash comp is in direct opposition to the trends from some other tech giants, where they are frontloading equity vesting. My sample size might just be small, but it feels like cash comp seems to correlate somewhat with bearish stock feeling and that frontloaded equity tends to correlate w/ bullish stock feeling. Would love to hear whether I&#39;m off the mark here or not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We had an office near an Amazon office. I interviewed a lot of people trying to leave Amazon. I don’t ask candidate’s compensation, but a lot of them volunteered it anyway. I was always surprised at how effectively low their comp was in the first few years due to the vesting schedule. The internet is adamant that everyone with FAANG jobs is rolling in TC, but there are a lot of people out there who are getting into FAANG companies (especially Amazon) at lower compensations with the hopes of moving up to those higher levels.OTOH, the backloaded vesting system works. It was easy to hire people out of their first year at Amazon, but almost impossible to hire someone after a few years when the bulk of their vesting was right around the corner. I talked to a lot of people who admitted being miserable but felt they couldn’t leave until they got the equity that they had been toiling over for the past few years.Weird situation all around. We eventually reduced our recruiting out of that particular Amazon office because so many of the people coming out of it were deeply disgruntled with the tech industry in general. Really changed my view of Amazon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been talking to close to a dozen current and former Amazon employees since the end of 2021, and reached out to people publicly sharing attrition observations. Amazon attrition is really bad, even in AWS (Amazon employees all agree that AWS is a much better place to work in tech than Amazon retail).At the same time, Amazon has had to pay very high for new hires. Hiring managers used to need to get L10 approval to go out of bands on offers outside bands, but starting late 2021, they could go out of bands up to ~20% higher with no approvals.To top all of this, Amazon has a 6% internal URA (non-regretted attrition) target: something that has been in place for close to a decade. The Amazon Music group revolted late 2021 as reported by the Big Technology publication in-depth [1] as they didn&#39;t have 6% of people to fire, at the very time when they could not hire. Yet they were forced to hit this URA target, just like all other orgs in Amazon. Apparently this “rebellion email” leaked across the company and is sparking Amazon-wide outrage, and adds fuel to the fire.Amazon has been extremely frugal for the skillset they hire for, very demanding and have created a stressful workplace. They still force 6% of engineers to be fired, even when their own leadership opposes this (Amazon Music).I wonder why they can’t hire. Also, why is Amazon still part of the FANG abbreviation when they have this culture across many of their organisations?[1] https://bigtechnology.substack.com/?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember that when I worked at Google about a decade ago, there was this common saying:&#34;If the first version of your shell script is more than five lines long, you should have written it in Python.&#34;I think there&#39;s a lot of truth in that. None of the examples presented in the article look better than had they been written in some existing scripting/programming language. In fact, had they been written in Python or Javascript, it would have been far more obvious what the resulting output would have been, considering that those languages already use {} for objects and [] for lists.For example, take this example:    jo -p name=JP object=$(jo fruit=Orange point=$(jo x=10 y=20) number=17) sunday=false

In Python you would write it like this:    json.dumps({&#34;name&#34;: &#34;JP&#34;, &#34;object&#34;: {&#34;fruit&#34;: &#34;Orange&#34;, &#34;point&#34;: {&#34;x&#34;: 10, &#34;y&#34;: 20}, &#34;number&#34;: 17}, &#34;sunday&#34;: False})

Only a bit more code, but at least it won&#39;t suffer from the Norway problem. Even though Python isn&#39;t the fastest language out there, it&#39;s likely still faster than the shell command above. There is no need to construct a fork bomb just to generate some JSON."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some time ago I wrote zsh helper [1] that uses jo to quickly construct complex JSON requests, mainly for testing and quering services from console.Paired with httpie [2] aliases [3] it produces concise APL-like syntax:  POST https://httpbin.org/post test:=j`a=b c=`e=3` l=`*1 2 3``

Which translates to:  http POST https://httpbin.org/post test:=&#34;$(jo a=b c=&#34;$(jo e=3)&#34; l=&#34;$(jo -a 1 2 3)&#34;)&#34;

Or, in other words, sending POST with the following body:  {&#34;a&#34;:&#34;b&#34;,&#34;c&#34;:{&#34;e&#34;:3},&#34;l&#34;:[1,2,3]}

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like it, very concise but retains all the features you need.`jq` can construct JSON &#34;safely&#34; from shell constructs, but is rather more verbose - e.g. with the same examples:        $ jq -n --arg name Jane &#39;{&#34;name&#34;:$name}&#39;
        
        $ jq -n \
        --argjson time $(date +%s) \
        --arg dir $HOME \
        &#39;{&#34;time&#34;:$time,&#34;dir&#34;:$dir}&#39;
        
        $ jq -n &#39;$ARGS.positional&#39; --args spring summer winter
        
        $ jq -n \
        --arg name JP \
        --argjson object &#34;$(
          jq -n \
          --arg fruit Orange \
          --argjson point &#34;$(
            jq -n \
            --argjson x 10 \
            --argjson y 20 \
            &#39;{&#34;x&#34;:$x,&#34;y&#34;:$y}&#39; \
          )&#34; \
          --argjson number 17 \
          &#39;{&#34;fruit&#34;:$fruit,&#34;point&#34;:$point,&#34;number&#34;:$number}&#39; \
        )&#34; \
        --argjson sunday false \
        &#39;{&#34;name&#34;:$name,&#34;object&#34;:$object,&#34;sunday&#34;:$sunday}&#39;"</p>
