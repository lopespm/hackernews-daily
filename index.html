								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"  * Severance pay. We will pay 14 weeks of severance for all departing employees, and more for those with longer tenure. That is, those departing will be paid until at least February 21st 2023.
  * Bonus. We will pay our 2022 annual bonus for all departing employees, regardless of their departure date. (It will be prorated for people hired in 2022.)
  * PTO. We’ll pay for all unused PTO time (including in regions where that’s not legally required).
  * Healthcare. We’ll pay the cash equivalent of 6 months of existing healthcare premiums or healthcare continuation.
  * RSU vesting. We’ll accelerate everyone who has already reached their one-year vesting cliff to the February 2023 vesting date (or longer, depending on departure date). For those who haven’t reached their vesting cliffs, we&#39;ll waive the cliff.

While layoffs in general suck, the terms of this one are quite substantially better than many other companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work for Stripe and got laid off this morning. Sucks because my manager was only told this morning, and didn&#39;t have a chance to talk about how well I was doing or take any part in the decision making. We&#39;ll at least I&#39;ll get a break. I worked nights and weekends all of October."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know this isn&#39;t new or unique to Stripe, but the language used in these announcements to distance leadership from their choices is always so slimy. &#34;We&#39;re not &#39;firing&#39; or &#39;terminating&#39; anyone; some people are just &#39;impacted&#39; by our announcement that we have to &#39;say goodbye&#39;.&#34; It makes repeated mentions of those who are &#34;leaving&#34; (the subject is the former employee) and avoids active verbs where the founders are the subjects. Not &#34;we&#39;re terminating&#34;, &#34;we&#39;re laying off&#34;, etc. Even the first statement taking responsibility covers the &#34;decisions leading up to [this step]&#34;, rather than the step/mass layoff itself."</p>

I know it can be annoying, but so is having the same offtopic complaints upvoted to the top of every such thread. This is why we added the site guideline: &#34;Please don&#39;t complain about tangential annoyances—e.g. article or website formats&#34; (and yes, this comment is also doing this. Sorry.)Similarly, please resist being baited by the sales interludes in the OP.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the US,  where Twitter &amp; Facebook are dominant, the current consensus in the public mind is that political polarization and radicalization are driven by the social media algorithms. However, I have always felt that this explanation was lacking. Here in Brazil we have many of the same problems but the dominant social media are Whatsapp group chats, which have no algorithms whatsoever (other than invisible spam filters). I think Yishan is hitting the nail on the head by focusing the discussion on user behavior instead of on the content itself."</p>

They believe that they just have to remove or block the bad actors and bad content and that will make the platform good.The reality is everyone, myself included, can be and will be a bad actor.How do you build and run a &#34;social media&#34; product when the very act of letting anyone respond to anyone with anything is itself the fundamental problem?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not a lawyer, but here is why I believe a class action lawsuit is correct;“AI” is just fancy speak for “complex math program”. If I make a program that’s simply given an arbitrary input then, thought math operations, outputs Microsoft copyright code, am I in the clear just because it’s “AI”? I think they would sue the heck out of me if I did that, and I believe the opposite should be true as well.I’m sure my own open source code is in that thing. I did not see any attributions, thus they break the fundamentals of open source.In the spirit of Rick Sanchez; It’s just compression with extra steps."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I never really appreciated the relationship and importance of bandwidth, latency and packet loss until I had to move a small office from all on-prem infrastructure to completely cloud based at a regional data centre, about 10 years ago. And I mean completely. locally we had firewall, router, riverbed, UPS that&#39;s it for max 40 people. No data at rest (besides riverbed cache) due to security.We had ridiculous bandwidth for the time, which users knew, and they would often come and ask &#34;why can I stream youtube in HD but accessing my document/file takes ages&#34; (ages being anything more than 2-3 seconds). A perfectly valid question. The answer was usually &#34;illegal fishing&#34;, or &#34;sharks&#34;. If the primary sub-sea cable was cut, we&#39;d have to route through another which would add at least 400ms round trip extra.Luckily this was a well known risk/issue for our parent company who had a team dedicated to negotiating peering and routing between office locations and their nearest regional DCs (these were not azure, aws, etc. usually local IX or Teclco). But they couldn&#39;t do anything about the sharks :(."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like this doesn&#39;t work with HTTPS because the pings are done with HTTP requests. You have to disable HTTPS-only mode and load it over plain HTTP: http://gfblip.appspot.com/Requests get blocked for mixed content if the site is loaded with HTTPS. That&#39;s what causes the constant stream of red blips after a few seconds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great tool. Just one thing: please make an option to distinguish blips by something else than color. Like many people, I can not see the difference between red and black/grey/whatever especially for very thin, small elements on screen. Thanks!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Folks ITT will talk about watches that are similar in hardware, but what was magic about Pebble was the software and ecosystem. The OS was just a delight to use, fast, wonderfully animated, and let you sideload whatever you want.I&#39;ve tried a couple of Garmin watches (Vivoactive 3 and Forerunner 55) and the Amazfit Bip, and this is where they all fall completely flat. The UX is just horrible by comparison. It&#39;s like these companies have no regard for designing the OS UX and are just trying to cram features in.And the fact that companies want to make touchscreen watches is just with few/no buttons is baffling to me. Tapping tiny buttons on a tiny screen is a horrible experience. And there&#39;s tons of moving targets because of the tiny amount of real-estate.Pebble _just got it_ with the 2.0 OS and beyond. They were a joy to use.I begrudgingly have gone back to using an Apple Watch, because despite being subpar, the UX is somewhat together these days, just enough to be tolerable. When I move away from iOS again, I&#39;ll probably either pull out an old Pebble that still has some battery life, or a Casio GBD200, which isn&#39;t really a smartwatch but ticks some major boxes for me (always-on-display, silent vibration alarm, and timers, chief among them). The GBD200 runs on a coin cell too, so I never have to worry about charging or a replacement being difficult to find!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got a friend who still uses a Palm Pilot (circa 1998) as a daily calendar manager/notepad.  Works at Google and delights in telling younger colleagues it&#39;s a Pixel 8 prototype."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a big Pebble fan, I was really sad to see the company go without any similar alternatives in the market (at the time). My watches ended up having various hardware issues over the years, so I switched to something else. The efforts Rebble has put in to keep these devices alive is amazing. If they grow bigger, I&#39;d love to see them do hardware.In the meantime, I&#39;m wearing a Withings ScanWatch [0]. Not as extendable as a Pebble, but it has some features I care about and doesn&#39;t distract me.[0] https://www.withings.com/ch/en/scanwatch"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context for those who don&#39;t follow Rust development closely:This release stabilises Generic Associated Types (GATs), a limited form of Higher Kinded Types. This is only an MVP release, but it already includes enough to be useful, and has been a huge multi-year effort (the RFC for the feature dates to April 2016).Novice users of Rust probably won&#39;t use this feature directly, but it gives a lot more power to library authors to write more flexible APIs while still keeping all of Rust&#39;s strict correctness guardrails (i.e. exposing a safe API). It will also form the basis of the upcoming &#34;async functions in traits&#34; feature.This is probably the most significant Rust release in the last couple of years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know GAT is a &#34;bigger feature&#34; for the language but personally I&#39;m most excited about `let else`. It is very common to write code such as:  let foo = match do_something() {
    Ok(f) =&gt; f,
    Err(e) =&gt; {
      // Do some error handling, maybe log a warning, maybe skip this item and continue...
    }
  };

This small change makes that so much more clear, removes the silly first row and removes a level of indentation.  let Ok(foo) = do_something() else {
    // Do some error handling, maybe log a warning, maybe skip this item and continue...
  };"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"`let else` looks strange to my eyes on first glance, but I can remember many cases when it would have been nice to have. (Not to mention, all Rust syntax used to look strange to my eyes so that&#39;s not a very useful criterion).Break from labeled blocks is a pretty niche thing. I can remember a few cases it would have been useful, but I&#39;m not sure I&#39;ll remember the feature exists next time it comes up.I&#39;m glad that GATs are finally here. I tend to be wary of complex type-system things. I can remember being a new rust programmer around 1.0, dealing with some library with a perhaps-overly-clever API with complex traits and lifetimes and being very frustrated randomly changing code trying to get it to compile. It didn&#39;t help that rustc error messages and rustdoc weren&#39;t as good and we didn&#39;t have any sort of language server back then. Perhaps I&#39;m just not very smart. But even with my focus on simply-typed APIs I&#39;ve run into several cases where I couldn&#39;t do something the obvious way because it needed GATs.I used to be a lot more involved with Rust, reading a lot of /r/rust and blog posts and issue trackers. I get a warm wistful feeling seeing things like GATs, rust-analyzer, and MIR inlining get stabilized after all these years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The holy grail of sugar substitution is ironically sugar. The left-handed isomer of glucose still hits our taste buds but doesn&#39;t get metabolized in the body. It just goes straight through. We&#39;ve tried it before and it worked absolutely perfectly but to synthesize and then separate the isomers was prohibitively expensive.Whoever finds a way to make left-handed glucose economically is going to be fucking rich."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I suspected this some time ago when I tried to learn more about all the potential problems related to gut bacteria.When you ingest something that you can&#39;t digest directly, there is a good chance that some bacteria in your guy can.
And when they do, they multiply, this process is often faster than most people realize.The problem rarely are the bacteria themselves, but the byproducts of their own metabolism, that can be benign is trace quantities and harmful in larger quantities.The immune system also constantly monitors and reacts to those byproducts and bacteria population.What we usually call Lactose intolerance or Gluten sensitivity is in practice an indirect effect of some species of bacteria digesting those, and then the reaction of your immune system.Overall, the gut microbiome is a fascinating and complex subject, unfortunately often oversimplified or misunderstood.As an example, we&#39;ve often been told to eat more fibers to increase &#34;flow&#34;, the flow increase is because the fibers are digested by bacteria and the mild toxicity of the process forces the digestive system to flush everything.Same with Sorbitol (contained in dried prunes and often used as a soft laxative) but even more toxic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Exposure to saccharin and sucralose significantly impaired glycemic response, but this was not seen with the aspartame or stevia groups. None of the blood markers show real changes in any group except for insulin levels going up in the glucose and stevia groups (and since everyone was getting glucose as part of the dosing, that suggests a lowering of the glucose-driven insulin response overall).What does impairing glycemic response mean, exactly?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is happening more and more frequently in my locale. Several of my friends and many of my neighbors have had their catalytic converters stolen.It&#39;s good to see something is done. Let&#39;s hope this steamrolls into a nationwide manhunt for these criminals. They should also consider targeting and auditing shops that buy used car parts. Making it extremely difficult to fence these things will be practical and useful because they aren&#39;t sold and reused as is - the rare earth metals are extracted. Something your average criminal won&#39;t be capable of doing in their garage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I may be misreading this but the margins look insane. DG Auto paid like 38 million USD for stolen converters, performed a simple extraction process, then sold the precious metals for 550 million USD. Wow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think taking down the buyers is a the best tool we have right now for this issue.And there are things we could do to make that easier, like putting a serial number on the converter on new cars and replacement parts. Requiring the make, model, and serial number of the car it was removed from, and a web site with a DB that has the ID number of cars they&#39;ve been stolen from so buyers could check it.Make those who buy and sell and steal them pay for it. For new car buyers all they be paying for is the addition of the serial number. Can&#39;t add much cost to engrave those during production."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Signal Snap Maintainer here, this is because of a DMCA takedown request from lawyers representing Signal. Canonical is currently working with them to clear things up.Canonical&#39;s communication to me was initially lacking due to issues in their process, the process has been amended and I&#39;m back in the loop again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is not a good look. The snap has been gone for almost a month, with seemingly no information given to the maintainer or users about why, except a belated &#34;we removed it for policy reasons&#34; 21 days ago. And if this happens to maintainers associated with Snapcrafters, imagine how you&#39;re treated if you&#39;re just some random person or company who maintains your own snap.This is the sort of reason why people are concerned about an ecosystem where Canonical has 100% of the control of the only distribution mechanism. I suppose this is just a confirmation of the legitimacy of those fears."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After reading the thread, I still have no idea why it got removed, so: why did it get removed? What part(s) of the snap policies did they violate, and how is it possible that even something doesn&#39;t charge $100 a year before you can even publish a snap doesn&#39;t even notify the maintainers that their app got removed? Just because you run an app store doesn&#39;t mean Apple and Google&#39;s opaque refusal system is the part you should take inspiration from, too."</p>
