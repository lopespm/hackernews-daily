Drew yourself into a corner didn&#39;t you.&gt; ...Gopher? I guess?I feel like the author must know this.. HTTP/1.0 supported but didn&#39;t require the Host header and thus HTTP/1.1 allowed consistent name-based virtual hosting on web servers.I did appreciate the simple natures of the early protocols, although it is hard to argue against the many improvements in newer protocols. It was so easy to use nc to test SMTP and HTTP in particular.I did enjoy the article&#39;s notes on the protocols however the huge sections of code snippets lost my attention midway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cool project! A true, open source alternative to Postman will be valuable. It seems like you’ve got the major elements in place.Unsolicited UX notes…I read Hacker News on mobile, so tried the app on mobile and ran into some challenges. In order to save space, eliminate the right click, and work on mobile please consider changing:    You can right click here to create a new request or a new folder

To the following (illustrated using pseudo markdown):    [Create request] or [Create a folder]

It would also be helpful to replace the GitHub star link with a link to your README. GitHub star links are problematic because they require a login that adds friction that prevents people from getting to your README page. People will login if they decide to star the project, but they might never get to your GitHub if they don’t have time to login or can’t easily login on the device where they’re reading."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Last time I posted this it didn&#39;t garner much interest.Looks good.  I use Postman daily and it sucks, so always open to alternatives.I don&#39;t recall what it looked like the last time you posted, but I wonder if part of the low interest is because upon arrival it doesn&#39;t instantly jump out to the visitor that this is something you can host/run locally.
It&#39;s very easy to miss the Github links top right.  And if you don&#39;t realise that, then what you see is a third party website expecting you to send your development requests through their UI, which is off-putting.As I say, I don&#39;t remember, but that may be why I skipped it last time.  I&#39;ll pay more attention this time!(Edit: split paragraphs for clarity)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the whole point of people still use postman today is a easy way the sync between users or manage user that have access to the workspace. There are a lot of alternatives without such features. But with such feature? Not too much."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The European Commission and von der Leyen are at it again. I presume that her conversations with Katrin Suder and Mc Kinsey have not been scanned. Unlike the plebs, perhaps they have their own mail servers like Hilary Clinton:https://www.dw.com/en/german-opposition-to-probe-defense-min...&#34;The investigative committee will examine irregularities in a contract awarded to McKinsey and a €390 million ($442 million) IT contract given to another company that failed to pass through the company&#39;s supervisory board as required.It will also investigate whether von der Leyen committed nepotism by hiring Katrin Suder, a former McKinsey consultant, as her deputy to oversee the ministry&#39;s arms procurement section.&#34;I think the presentation in stopscanningme.eu is too kind. We should not have to beg for our constitutional rights."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honest question. Are these laws being put forward by groups who only want a plausible excuse to violate people&#39;s privacy, or is it misguided people who genuinely care about stoping child exploitation and don&#39;t care about the profound effects of privacy?I&#39;m guessing the answer is &#39;both&#39; but I was hoping someone might have insight if it leans one way or the other."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always the same story. To me, it reads something like this:&gt; Child sexual abuse often happens in bathrooms. Therefore, all bathrooms should have cameras. The video feeds should be stored and analyzed for illegal behavior, and law enforcement should have access, ideally in real time and without a court order. The risk of leaks, hacking, or abuse by law enforcement or system administrators is negligible, so citizens need not worry.Historically, law enforcement has been chronically understaffed and generally ineffective enforcing these heinous crimes. Even credible and actionable reports that could lead to arrests often end up on a pile. When this system is deployed, the amount of flagged behavior will be 100x more than the reports of today, most of which will be false positives. This is ultimately what makes it obvious that these are bad faith arguments, and that the ulterior motive is good old mass surveillance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is pretty impressive!I play piano accordion (but not particularly well). I started watching the video first and was a little troubled that the bellows appeared to be home-made, crappy looking, and not nearly as effective as they could be. Aftermarket bellows are not hard to find and are not even that expensive if you get them from China. But then I saw that he made them out of _floppy disks_ and decided that was pure genius.This also made me realize that a computer keyboard pretty closely resembles the right hand of a chromatic button accordion, so I assume that&#39;s how it&#39;s laid out.Anyway, he certainly plays this cobbled-together instrument far better than I&#39;ll ever play my analog accordion. There are MIDI and other &#34;digital&#34; accordions out there but they are either extremely expensive or limiting in terms of what you can do with them, or both. This gives me hope that one day I could possibly build my own programmable digital accordion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While this is cool I&#39;ve had luck just purchasing a domain (not that expensive), and manually setting up DNS through that.Some advantages that this doesn&#39;t look like this would replicate, (1) I can have multiple domains for the same device, say gitea.mytsnetwork.com and netxcloud.mytsnetwork.com can go to the same device (2) I can get real HTTPS certificates for those domains which I consider necessary nowadays if only just to prevent errors (3) it&#39;s &#34;real&#34; DNS so when my browser decides to ignore my system settings and use DNS-over-HTTPS instead everything still works.EDIT: It looks like (2) is solved by the tailscale cert command. I&#39;d replace that point by saying owning the domain is important to controlling the certificate for me. All that said, the more I read into this, this looks like a really well thought-out feature."</p>

My server would receive millions of requests, weird reflection attacks like [1], probes, the whole nine, it made the dashboarding useless for personal tracking.But now my pi-hole only listens on my LAN network and its tailnet address, and any machine connected to the tailnet including my phone will use the pi-hole without configuration on any network via MagicDNS.[1]: https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/linux-newbie-8/ther..."</p>

And there are no incentives to question validity of methods or results (unless these  are &#39;sponsored&#39;).Formalized methodology underpinning scientific skepticism, should be taught as part of first 4 years of college (or even specialized vocational schools).There are should magazines in every field, dedicated to skepticism, the recent discoveries, methods of analysis, etc.
There are should be commercial and tax-payer funded sponsorships available to do just that.May be, there should be advanced degrees in statistical claim validation methods, and so on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think you&#39;re forgetting the main reason: the group of people using it to communicate is really small and shrinking every year.The only large group of people who still primarily use SMS to communicate person-to-person is Android users in the USA.Every other country has settled on either Telegram, WeChat, WhatsApp or FB Messenger, or other niche apps. These apps work on both iOS and Android and often also Windows. I haven&#39;t sent an SMS in probably 12 years. I don&#39;t know anyone who has.It&#39;s only in the US that iMessage is so prevalent that Android users have to use SMS, the only other way of messaging iOS devices. And the US is quickly becoming a de-facto iOS only country. It already has more than 50% market share, even 80% among young people.With the US going (almost) full iMessage and the rest of the world having already settled on another app there simply no point to supporting SMS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SMS was, in my opinion, the killer feature for Signal. Telling people to install yet-another-inbox which was only going to be used by their one privacy-weirdo friend was a non-starter.Saying &#34;this is a better SMS app&#34; got people on-board and let them &#34;upgrade&#34; to secure messaging.  That&#39;s why I started using it in the &#34;TextSecure&#34; days.But, sadly, I agree with Signal&#39;s reasoning here. Mixing the two protocols was annoyingly complex. If someone stopped using Signal, messages you sent to them would never arrive - with no notification.  And there&#39;s no obvious way to &#34;downgrade&#34; to SMS.I was working on RCS a decade ago. I&#39;m glad to see it is finally getting somewhere - but I&#39;m sad it is at the expense of better and more secure protocols."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once spend several euros sms-ing instead of what I thought was Signal-ing with someone in another country. Since then I keep the two strictly in 2 different apps.I certainly wont mourn for this. Sms gets super expensive to other countries (outside the EU), it also gets super expensive when you don&#39;t pre-pay for a bundle (it&#39;s 2 eur for 1000 messages, then 25ct per message after that, ridiculous). Imho dutch carriers did everything they could to kill sms, and now I&#39;m happy for it. The only bad thing is that my society at large seems to have chosen Whatsapp as it&#39;s replacement..."</p>

They&#39;re not particularly motivated to close this loophole either, for reasons which should be obvious.This should be a much bigger issue, IMO.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; That same day, while the stock market remained lofty, Dr. Auchincloss reported selling $15,001 to $50,000 of a stock mutual fund. Days later he sold two more mutual funds and a stock&gt; Dr. Auchincloss disclosed six sales of mutual funds that day, totaling between $111,006 and $315,000 in value.And&gt; The rate cuts hadn’t immediately calmed investors. Stock trading was halted for 15 minutes on the morning of March 16 when the S&amp;P 500 fell 7%, triggering a so-called circuit breaker. The index staggered to the closing bell, down 12%.&gt; That same day, Ms. Chao, the transportation secretary, made three purchases in stock funds that track the S&amp;P 500 and the U.S. stock market broadly, totaling between $600,003 and $1.2 million, according to her financial disclosures.Every time I click on one of these articles, I expect to find some individual stock trading related to specific companies on the receiving end of government action. However, when it ends up being vague examples of officials buying and selling broad-market or S&amp;P index funds, it&#39;s much harder to see where the &#34;insider trading&#34; angle comes from. Especially when we have examples of officials trading in March, a full month after the viral panic had already spread through even public forums like Twitter.The line needs to be drawn somewhere, and I&#39;m not convinced that forbidding public officials from buying and selling generic index and mutual funds is really that big of a concern, IMO.Now if someone can find evidence of government officials buying something like Moderna stock ahead of the FDA approval, then by all means let&#39;s prosecute with stiff consequences."</p>
