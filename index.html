								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unpopular opinion: Social media is a great scapegoat, but it is not the source of the problem. It is where they go to communicate and cope. My sole qualification to post this: I have four kids that are either teens or in their early 20s, and one who will be a teen next year. Here is what I see out there:1. Kids have little or no slack in their schedule. This means very little freedom, and very little time to work things out mentally. School, practice, volunteer, homework, bed, do it all again. This builds up to a very difficult to unwind ball of stress, anger, fear and despair.2. Everything is conflicted and unclear. Schools teach cultural tolerance while enforcing zero-tolerance policies. Diversity is good, but being ____ is bad. So many areas where what we teach and preach are the opposite of what policies and actions actually do.3. The stakes are too high. View the wrong website on your chromebook and get referred to law enforcement. Have a kid send you the wrong selfie and get charged with a sex crime. Get a bad grade and you are off the volleyball team, and you won&#39;t make the team next year - so done forever. Misbehave and you&#39;ll be arrested by the resource officer and face time at juvi, and potentially a conviction that will be held against you for a very long time (in some states juvi convictions count against three strikes laws).3. Kids are targeted. Sexual predators, gangs, fringe and mainstream ideologues looking to recruit followers, sports agents and talent scouts all have one thing in common: they want to exploit kids or sell them something.It&#39;s really hard to be a kid right now, and that needs to change. We need to lower the stakes, the stress and have something that resembles consistency."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Social media definitely amplifies it, but consider the economic and social environment that teenagers have lived through their entire lives. Multiple major recessions, a global pandemic, rising inflation, housing and education getting more expensive by the day, prospect of a mountain of debt right after graduation, climate that will be unlivable in a few decades, political extremism becoming the norm, and massive government gridlock that has made fixing any of this impossible. Can&#39;t really shield kids from this reality anymore when all of it is one click away. Teens are aware that they are going to inherit a pretty terrible world, and are powerless to do anything about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ofc it is plummeting. We are letting them install apps that have people behind them with the sole job of making them more addictive. We are handing them drugs, multiple variants if I may say so. I had to fight with my daughter for TikTok and whatnot, she is only allowed with YouTube due to school/tutorials/classes etc and I still find myself pretty often having to snap her out of shorts and other bs with an algorithm behind it designed to keep you on and ...consuming.These are modern drugs my friends and we are not doing anything about it. Our kids are being milked of their time, attention, imagination, focus and money. The majority of them can&#39;t even cross the streets properly any more. They don&#39;t even look if the drivers saw them, they all have a phone in hand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the temperature converter one because it immediately introduces some of the more fuzzy design questions and annoying details that pop up when you implement data binding.Such as: when exactly should the other side update? When the user switches focus (where to?) or on every keystroke? Does it make sense to a user that they temporarily see the Fahrenheit value for 2°C if they really want to type in 20°C? What happens if they type an invalid value (or clear the box, which they often have to do)? What happens if they type an incorrect value and then type something into the other field? 
Etc etc.I think there are a lot of interesting tensions between a &#34;formally correct&#34; system and one that feels usable and intuitive to use. Especially with bidirectional data flow, they show up quickly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My pet theory: I&#39;m pretty sure this is because when HTML5 became a thing, some major tech blog showed us what an HTML5 page would look like (simplified doctype, meta charset) and they included the viewport settings that disabled zoom.Then pretty much everyone copied from these guides, and here we are. I remember I had used HTML5 skeleton templates for a while before I learned that the &#34;maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no&#34; they came with is not a good idea."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;a Heroku database&#34; was what was known as core-db internally for the longest time. I&#39;m not sure if still the case or not today.But at one point was the source of everything for Heroku.Over time things were moved out, so this isn&#39;t an everything that exists has been leaked, but it is not a guarantee that attacker didn&#39;t move from one area to another.As someone with some apps on Heroku, having worked there, but no knowledge of the details of the incident more than others... I would:1. Rotate all creds2. Ensure logging all connections to the DB (I can&#39;t recall how much you can do this on Heroku)3. Extra heavily audit Github commits and Heroku releases4. Maybe keep rotating all creds?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s going to be a question about the expected probability of this across cloud service providers.I&#39;ve done security work for multiple cloud service providers and know a lot of people in the industry. I&#39;m not really privy to give details.I can say: dev teams face limits on what they can build securely, platform teams face limits on what secure by default and monitoring features they have time to implement, security operations teams have a lot of data points to look at, and in theory even changes in personnel in a couple of teams can have an impact on the threat posture for a given set of a company.People are trying. But if you do the math for introduction of attack surface over time versus risk mitigation effort over time for that attack surface you can derive some estimates for likelihood of attack.If your cloud provider isn&#39;t providing you that data as a customer, it&#39;s not simple to make a determination about likelihood of risk introduction and breach of your cloud provider.This hasn&#39;t really been something people talk about because there was a tacit assumption that the biggest companies are mostly getting this right.I&#39;m not trying to say the cloud is inherently broken, I run a lot of workloads in the cloud and trust sensitive data to the cloud. But I do wish there were better ways for customers to have data points with which they could evaluate platforms besides extrapolating the history of public breach reports."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On April 7, 2022, a threat actor obtained access...GitHub identified the activity on April 12, 2022, and notified Salesforce on April 13, 2022, at which time we began our investigation.Can some experienced security professionals weigh in on the cultural and organizational factors that allow this kind of major breach to go unnoticed for a week, that too in a reputed company like Heroku?I&#39;m not asking this rhetorically or in bad faith. It&#39;s a genuine question I have based on a project I did. I researched cybersec tech like SOAR, XDR, security logging, and SIEM in depth. On paper, the marketing for such tech gives the impression that by using them, such breaches can be detected and prevented in real-time. But there seems to be a mismatch between the claims and ground realities. If so, why?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s breathtaking to see the pendulum swing so obviously and definitively back in favor towards HTML-first and SSG/SSR-first solutions—to the degree that even the JS-framework-hotness-du-jour braintrust is going all-in on SSG/SSR.I&#39;m still a bit steamed from being gaslit all throughout the mid-2010s years when we were told &lt;div id=&#34;root&#34;&gt;&lt;/div&gt; + SPA was The One True Way of building web applications. Even now, I run into this mindset _in the Rails community_ of all places. But thankfully we know now how this story will end, because the advantages of wildly simpler stacks which work better with modern web specs AND offer improved performance in many cases are undeniable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was anti-SPAs until I started living permanently on a 2G connection. Now I love the few that I use.They cache a lot of data, lazy load almost everything, and renders are much faster. Also, best of all, the experience when my internet goes down—which is often—is at least a partially functional page, instead of a total blank screen which is what HN and other sites that deliver full HTML or nothing gives me.I cannot count the number of times I have lost a long well-typed comment on HN, because my internet went down while sending it and my browser apparently considers that to not be situation that it can reload the page on using the data it was going to send.I think SPA&#39;s work better on low-data lines because they are apps and work just like other phone apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; For starters: a lot can be done natively nowadaysI learned this recently on my personal site when I was going through and de-javascripting stuff.  I more and more frequently run without scripting enabled, and it felt very wrong that my personal site had some JS requirements.  The worst being that it wouldn&#39;t render without JS due to a slick little fade-in effect in the template...One of the things I do quite like (living on a low bandwidth connection a lot of the time) is lazy loading - and it turns out that you can do that without JS too, now, at least in modern browsers.img loading=&#34;{lazy,eager}&#34; will do this without needing JS.  Combine it with picturesets for smaller images (you let the browser pick an image it supports and a size relevant to the display), and life is good without any JS.At this point, as far as I know, the only things on my site that require JS are the &#34;Make the image bigger when you click on it&#34; feature, and then a JS based search function (which sucks down an awful lot of JSON, but it&#39;s fine, and beats an active server backend for a personal blog).It&#39;s also impressive just how responsive a browser on a gutless wonder ARM SBC is when all it&#39;s having to do is render content, not run a bunch of JS!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The way I look at it is: there are more tools in the toolbox than ever before. Which makes our judgement (the thing they really pay us for) even more important. Kubernetes, for example, is a specific solution to a specific problem. The solution is complex but so is the problem. If k8s give you the right trade-offs for your situation, then it’s not busy work.Of course, there are plenty of project where judgement Is thrown out the window in favor of adding a buzzword to everyone’s resume. I’ve heard it called “promotion-based architecture”, as in you pick the technology most likely to get you promoted. (If that works, it says all sorts of not great things about your organization).Regardless, I don’t think the availability of tools is the root problem. It’s and industry-wide lack of emphasis on identifying and understanding the problem first."</p>

You can&#39;t use it as flour, or as salt.With software, the problem is even greater. You can use react, for example, but you will probably start with create-react-app, which adds a lot of things. Or you could start with Next.js, which adds a lot of things. You could use Java, but you will probably start with Spring Boot, or Dropwizard, which adds a LOT of things. Plus all of these starting points imply the use of new languages, configurations, and programs, in particular, builds.In my view, all of these &#34;Bisquicks&#34; represent experiments-in-progress, with the ultimate goal of the systematic characterization of &#34;software application&#34;, in general. In other words, they are systems of alchemy, pushing toward being a system of chemistry, which we don&#39;t have yet. So it is bound to be a confusing time, just as it was surely confusing to play with chemicals before Lavoisier systematized the practice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I generally agree, but two things I&#39;d like to point out.If you&#39;re using python for the web you&#39;re already part of the complexity problem, atleast from the perspective of someone deploying php 15 years ago.  I use python for web development, and I love it, but deploying webpages used to be copy an apache config and  ftp/scp your files to some location.   Now we need app servers and reverse proxies, and static files are served differently, and even though I&#39;ve gotten used to it over the last decade it does&#39;t mean it&#39;s good.The other thing is that MonoRepos are pushing back against complexity for the sake of complexity. Why create a new repo when a directory will work just fine?  I think a ton of people got repo crazy because their coporate jenkins server only allowed one project per repo,  but it is trivial to check the latest git hash for a directory and base your deployment on that. ...I have a project I inherited that has 14 repos for a webpage with maybe 5 forms on it.   I&#39;ve mostly handed it off at this point, but everytime I have to look at it I end up preaching about monorepos for weeks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If Stripe can leverage their banking relationships to leapfrog Plaid by integrating directly with bank&#39;s APIs instead of doing screen scraping... that would be massive! It seems like Plaid&#39;s biggest weakness is the flakiness of their connections, which creates so much frustration/churn downstream.Plaid&#39;s other weakness is their opaque, enterprise-style pricing, which is seems like Stripe is doing away with. Hopefully they can bring the price down, because lots of consumer-facing use cases aren&#39;t viable due to the high monthly price per connection.I hope they add support for investment account holdings—it seems like Plaid is the only one that does this well.—Edit: digging deeper, it looks like Stripe proxies to Plaid-like &#34;service providers&#34; under the covers—at least for institutions without OAuth flows. [1][2][3] Presumably they&#39;ll build in-house connections over time, but it dents my hope that their connectivity will be better than Plaid&#39;s. Either way, transparent pricing and more competition in the space is still welcome![1]: https://support.stripe.com/questions/what-is-the-relationshi...[2]: https://support.stripe.com/questions/how-does-stripe-limit-d...[3]: https://support.stripe.com/questions/who-will-obtain-my-fina..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how this compares to Column, since the founder of Column also cofounded Plaid. I see both founders&#39; comments in this thread it looks like but the Column founder doesn&#39;t seem too happy about it [0].There also seems to be some vindication by the Bolt founder, based on his Twitter thread about how Stripe handles corporate development [1][2], it really reminds me of Paul Graham&#39;s essay not to talk to them, lest the same thing happen to you [3].[0] https://twitter.com/pitdesi/status/1521915016668090368[1] https://twitter.com/theryanking/status/1485784823641755648[2] https://twitter.com/pitdesi/status/1521906115914526721[3] http://www.paulgraham.com/corpdev.html"</p>
