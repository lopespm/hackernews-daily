								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reuters doesn&#39;t report this, but the government officials threatened the companies (Apple and Google) with jail time for their employees yesterday. After that the companies finally conceded. There&#39;s a short video fragment from the meeting of the government officials and the companies representatives. It&#39;s worth watching, especially if you come from a democratic nation.Letting your Russian employees be persecuted don&#39;t amount to &#34;doing the right thing&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple’s acquiescence to the Russian government’s demand to remove this app was predicted when it first came to light.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m grateful to GitLab for providing an alternative to GitHub, and an open source one. It&#39;s an open core product with the community edition providing a lot of value. Here are some community hosted instances: https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/List_of_Community-Hosted_GitL...The CI system is quite powerful, and Travis CI&#39;s struggles before and after acquisition has shown that it&#39;s hard to host a major CI platform.I hope the company and the open source product will continue to thrive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t personally had a compelling enough reason to move from GitHub to GitLab, so I mostly just use it to mirror a couple of my repos there in case people prefer to browse various open source projects via GitLab. Regardless, I think competition in the space is a great thing.GitLab has come a long way and there are certain things I really like about the company. For example, I love how they tend to do everything &#34;in the open&#34; and have most of their development work and business documents public. It&#39;s a great resource for aspiring entrepreneurs. I have been a bit concerned about some of the architecture of GitLab lately, with quite a few security fixes resulting in unusual edge-case bugs. My only other complaint is that they tend have a very wide but shallow pool of products. They have ambitious goals with their platform, but I hope they are able to build real value and add features to the existing core products.Congrats to everyone on the GitLab team. Keep doing good work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at MailChimp for a few years. I most recently worked at a company that went through an IPO that I had equity in. When deciding to join my recent company, equity was the largest factor in my move.MC’s benefits are great and at the time were top-tier in Atlanta. They are cash/401k heavy and offer great profit sharing incentives. They also make it abundantly clear that they don’t offer equity and when I negotiated my non-MC offer that I ended up accepting, they were clear that they could not match my equity. They even acknowledged that if I was willing to take a risk with the equity it would likely be the advantageous move to make.Nonetheless, during my time at MC Ben/Dan repeatedly boasted about turning down offers to sell and repeated they were never intending to go that (or the publicly traded) route. This ultimately factored into my decision to leave, as it never appeared I would have a personal stake in the company. I hope other employees interpreted this in a similar manner and I do believe everyone had abundant opportunities to do so.In the end and in hindsight, I’m happy with my decision to leave and it did pay out. Nonetheless, I do still believe MC is a great company and despite the founders somewhat selling an incorrect vision, are still acting in good faith. I don’t believe they “withheld equity” as they made it explicitly clear it was never offered, or was ever going to be, but I do see how the boasting of never selling out could be interpreted poorly now in hindsight."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly it could be worse, I worked at a company that gave equity and years later it came out that the founders never intended to sell or take VC money.  In that case employees “took below market salaries” thinking the stock is worth something but in reality it’s worthless.  At least in this Mailchimp situation if you’re not getting equity I assume you’re happy with your cash comp, I’d you’re not, that doesn’t make sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Maximise the video and watch the left hand HUD pane from 0:10 to 0:11.The dotted black line coming from the front of the car (which I am assuming is the intended route) quickly snaps from straight ahead, to a hair pin right, to a normal right turn.Ignoring the fact that the right turn happened to be into a pedestrian crossing with people on it - what was the car even trying to do? The sat-nav shows it should have just continued forwards.I am astounded that software capable of these outputs is allowed on the roads. When could crossing a junction then taking a hairpin right back across it, ever be the correct thing to do?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly, the original creator of the video has since made it private. FSD beta testers are carefully handpicked — a lot of the Tesla “influencers” are given access for some free marketing. I wonder how many FSD bad driving videos are not uploaded to YouTube at all because they don’t want to say anything negative about Tesla and possibly lose influence/ad revenue.This is on top of Tesla classifying FSD as level 2 system (while promoting as “level 5 soon”) so they don’t have to share data with CA DMV. Only reason not to be transparent like the others is if you’re not confident in your system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is near the infamous monorail where previous versions of FSD would kamikaze into the giant concrete pillars. Presumably in response to the monorail failure Tesla updated their obstacle avoidance to handle unclassified objects.https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1437322712339423237?s=21From the nav you can see the car is trying to go straight but swerves around some invisible obstacle. I wouldn’t be surprised if this was a failure in their new “voxel based” collision avoidance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let me share a small fun story (of making an application in an hour, not months).At one large insurance company in my role as an architect I have tried to convince people we need Elasticsearch to speed up free-form queries to our database containing information about hundreds of millions of people and their contracts. That database was Oracle and so not really amenable to completely arbitrary queries.I was immediately shot down that the project will take huge amount of time and effort to complete and so is completely off the table.So I came up with fun plan. I set up an hour-long meeting which was supposed to be my last chance to pitch the project.Rather than present slides and extol virtues of Elasticsearch, I decided to WRITE THE APPLICATION DURING THE MEETING, FROM SCRATCH.And that&#39;s what I did. I came to the meeting, set my laptop, connected projector, put some music on, and I wrote the entire service from scratch and had time to spare to present how it works.I cheated a little bit, of course. That 1h meeting was well rehearsed. I spent entire week preparing, finding better ways to do stuff and retrying entire process dozens of times.I used JHipster to generate 90% of the service and the rest was just tiny bit of well thought glue code.Unfortunately, this did not sit well with couple of people whom I made complete mockery of. I had to leave soon after."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s an excellent talk by Rich Hickey (I believe it&#39;s this one[1]) where he points out an obsession with how quick something is to understand immediately and be productive in—he gives the example of building websites in a single day, and contrasts it to musicians learning and mastering instruments over much longer periods of time.While it&#39;s very intuitive to see the appeal in low barrier to entry, there&#39;s something to be said about tools that optimize for the long-term. Instruments aren&#39;t made for beginners, they&#39;re made for people who know how to play them.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MCZ3YgeEUPg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a UI prototyping tool, and a potentially good one at that. It does not develop what a HN audience would call production ready applications. That being said, &#34;Production Ready&#34; as used by this author is very different than what &#34;production ready&#34; as used by the HN audience means, a look at the end of the linked video where he claims a checklist with drag and drop support and cookie-derived sessions next to is &#34;Production Ready&#34; should sufficiently demonstrate that.And that&#39;s okay! It doesn&#39;t need to have replaced the entire Web Developer career field, it can just be a cool UI prototyping tool. But I might suggest to the author to reduce the scope of their claims a touch, as it would engender more positive discussion."</p>

All the other times I get a message that they reviewed my complaint, that it does not go against their standards/tos/bla bla, and that I can block the video/post/channel for myself.And taking into account how many random stuff they ban proactively, it just does not compute in my logic board in the brain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"i live in the american south, where everybody owns guns. i own a gun for hunting. but for self defense, i have pepper spray and bear spray instead of guns because i don&#39;t want to kill somebody regardless of their intentions. i&#39;d be curious to see the stats of self-defense/firearms, because it seems like self-defense gun owners are LARPing over imagined intruder situations. they&#39;re definitely not about to take up arms against the state, and if they think they would do that, then they&#39;re certainly LARPing and live in a fantasy world.exceptions to this rule, especially in the american south, are civil rights leaders and similar political activists. Martin Luther King preached non-violent protest but owned guns for protecting his home against the very real threat of violent racists. (there&#39;s some interesting writing about this if you look it up. google something like &#34;martin luther king guns malcolm x&#34;)the bigger risk is accidentally killing somebody with a gun, like an &#34;intruder&#34; that is actually somebody you know. or a kid accidentally firing the gun and killing themselves or somebody else, or somebody intentionally killing themselves.edit: added &#34;but&#34; in front of dependent clause &#34;for self defense&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excellent.  There&#39;s no reason defensive gun buyers should be demographically different from the general population.  It&#39;s understandable that gun sales for hunting or other activities might show differences, but we all have the same personal security needs.Side note: I&#39;m one of the people here with a large collection of firearms.  One thing to realize when you see the statistic that the US has more firearms than people is that only a percentage of them are really combat worthy/capable.  Most of my collection, for example, are collectable historic pieces, or dedicated target/sporting firearms.  Some of these could feasibly be pressed into service if you had absolutely nothing else, but they would be extremely sub-optimal for the task."</p>
