								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many eons ago...Around 10 to 15 years ago...Seen a similar serialization and date processing bug with a Java based Enterprise Integration Platform used by some of the largest companies in the world.Several European Central Banks were unable to process transactions ;-). Can&#39;t provide more details, to protect the innocent. Since then, it has been a standard within the Testing group of that vendor to always have a running platform setup with a date 6 months ahead ( clock sync from a different source ). Something I added to my own Software Engineering and Testing standard practices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We shouldn&#39;t blame Microsoft for this; I once worked in the veterinary industry, and one Practice Management System allowed you to register a pet including their real or approximate birth date, or by entering an approximate age.If you entered a birth date, the software would calculate the pet&#39;s age, and we noticed we had the odd quirk, like a 400 year-old cat etc. I couldn&#39;t see an obvious pattern to the anomaly, and it didn&#39;t occur often, so I created a support ticket.After a couple of days, I received a response that &#39;dates were hard&#39; and we should correct the ages manually as needed.So there you have it: Dates are hard.(No, the bug wasn&#39;t ever fixed.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As far as I can tell, there&#39;s currently no official acknowledgement of this issue.It has affected 100% of the Exchange servers I&#39;m overseeing. In every case, a complete halt to mail was corrected by a fix only escribed on Reddit and Twitter."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The memo from Emirates about not setting altitude in system to airport altitude is so weird. I really hope that&#39;s not the actual message Emirates is putting out there.It doesn&#39;t matter was in system. You run your checklists and configure for your own flight / your own departure etc. Memo should be to training / recruitment - where did you find these pilots to fly a 777?So they obviously didn&#39;t pre-flight the flight. And they don&#39;t seem to have used their takeoff checklist either? That should get them through flap retract and 2,000 feet or so.Takeoff checklist might have rotate at 160 or so. Then you get to positive climb and V2. You then clean up the plane (flaps / gear etc), maybe hit 2,000 feet / 210kts?This is all checklist stuff. I&#39;ve no idea what&#39;s Emirates has as checklists, but this is like 101 entry level flying stuff. What was pilot monitoring doing during all this?They still on ground at 215 kts? 262 kts at 175 feet?!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pilot (piston engine, with only around 20 hours of light jet dual). As a pax on this flight, I might not have noticed much unless I was looking out the window.This seems like a fault of the crew (obviously), but probably more on the PNF (pilot not flying) than the PF (pilot flying). Article says 4 pilots were on board, but fails to mention that 2 of them (relief pilots) were likely not in the cockpit on the departure.It’s hard for me to imagine that a qualified crew would fly such a non-standard departure with “we were following the flight director” as an excuse. There’s nothing above you to hit on departure; get away from terrain! Fly the calculated airspeeds. Where was the Vr callout?! That rotation to a pitch angle is what takes you off the runway, not the FD command bars.Once they made the mistake and corrected it, I don’t have much concern with the continuation. 262 knots indicated isn’t that big of a deal that I’d worry about shedding parts from departure flaps and leading edge devices or stressing the gear (they likely pulled the gear up well before breaking 250 KIAS anyway). I’d be more concerned with the safety of an overweight landing than continuing. (A 777 can dump fuel, but the crew that just moments ago couldn’t fly an entirely routine departure isn’t the crew that I want to be calling an audible and figuring out how to safely dump fuel at night and return for a max weight landing. How would they program the FD for that?! ;) )My prediction is that almost every pax had no idea how close to dying they came until they read about it later.I catch heat every time I mention that air crew training and certification standards are not uniform across the globe and that I am reluctant to fly on many foreign-flag carriers. (However, Emirates and most EU-flag carriers are ones that I would not hesitate to fly on.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The thing that stands out here the most is the complete lack of control that the crew had over the plane. The crew was managing the computers rather than flying the aircraft.&#34;Perhaps they are &#34;Children of the Magenta&#34;:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5ESJH1NLMLs... and I cannot recommend this video enough.I am not a pilot and I have no interest in flying nor any particular interest in aviation, generally ... and I find this talk to be fascinating.EDIT:  you can jump to 3:35 where he gives a specific example of a situation where pilots need to choose between automation dependency and dropping down a level of automation.  He&#39;s a really good speaker and you can tell the audience is very engaged."</p>

Besides that, I don’t think that I would make polls here, I value the good story links posted and the insightful replies, and often when I see polls in other places it just seems to ignite flame wars and low value discussions.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;How accurate are online polls?&#34;[M]ost online polls that use participants who volunteer to take part do not have a proven record of accuracy. There are at least two reasons for this. One is that not everyone in the U.S. uses the internet, and those who do not are demographically different from the rest of the public. Another reason is that people who volunteer for polls may be different from other people in ways that could make the poll unrepresentative. At worst, online polls can be seriously biased if people who hold a particular point of view are more motivated to participate than those with a different point of view.https://www.pewresearch.org/2010/12/29/how-accurate-are-onli...Rather than serve as accurate assessments of public opinion or beliefs, online polls at best surface sentiments and potential areas of interest.  Some are mere amusements.  Many serve a darker purpose of advocating for a specific cause or ideology (a &#34;push poll&#34; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Push_poll), fishing for either insights on how audiences might be manipulated through advertising or propaganda, or outright soliciting personal information that is of use in hacking into accounts by guessing passwords or so-called &#34;security questions&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HTTP Basic Auth could be so much better with a little help from browsers. If it was a bit better, most websites wouldn&#39;t need to implement login pages over and over again. Plus it would be more secure since the popup is in its own security context.* Add a button to log out. Logout never really worked across browsers with basic auth.* Allow to inject a logo or a tiny bit of customization for branding. The default popup looks too ugly.* Improve the Digest auth to modern crypto standards. Stop passing plain passwords over the wire.That&#39;s it. It&#39;s not a massive amount of work and it could enable to simplify a lot of the Internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Caddy comes with basic auth support because it&#39;s still useful for a lot of use cases.IMO the biggest weakness of basicauth (when deployed over TLS) is the fact that most server configurations store the passwords in plaintext, usually in a config file. This is like storing passwords in plaintext in a database. Caddy does not allow this. You have to use a secure hash on the password before adding it to your config: https://caddyserver.com/docs/modules/http.authentication.pro...Of course, password hashes are slow, so KDF&#39;ing a plaintext string at every HTTP request can grind even powerful servers to a halt. So Caddy can optionally cache hash results in memory (we do expect memory to be safer than a config file -- and Go is a memory-safe language in this regard). And while this can introduce nuanced timing variances (fast if recently hashed), they do not necessarily correspond to correct passwords.If you think this stuff is interesting and want to help make Caddy&#39;s basic auth even better, feel free to contribute or sponsor: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The primary flaw isn&#39;t BASIC AUTH. It&#39;s the password itself. Brute force attacks are easy. The only good way of securing anything is through an Authenticator app."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m quitting my full-time job this month (already gave my notice) to start a startup with my brother. We&#39;re trying to make cheap-but-performant prosthetic hands using 3D printers and Arduino, focusing on the north-west of Syria. To shed some light, it&#39;s estimated that around *50 THOUSAND* people suffer from minor or major imputations due to the ongoing war, and most of them need some form of prosthetics. Some estimates even upwards *80 THOUSAND*![1]Now, I know most of the technical stuff we need, and my brother knows all the medical details (he&#39;s a physical therapist), but neither of us have built a startup before.We have a plan on mind, but I would love to chat with anyone with experience building similar startups (a mix of software and hardware), or really anyone who&#39;s interested in this project.We also plan on starting a crowdfunding campaign soon this month.[1](https://www.ri.org/providing-life-changing-prosthetics-for-s...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a former principal software engineer at a MAMAA company turned independent educational researcher. My primary interest is in deliberate practice and how to use spaced repetition (i.e., Anki) to develop expertise.I have three primary areas that I am working on and would love to find serious collaborators:1) I am building high-quality content for math, English language arts, chess, etc. (see [0] for a good explanation of what this looks like). This is primarily for my  2nd grade child, but I have also written hundreds of cards for high school level math, undergraduate level math, and programming languages.For example, I used this approach to build an Anki deck that decomposed the NNAT test (i.e., a gifted program test) into atomic chunks and then demonstrated how sample NNAT questions were composed of those primitives.2) I am eventually looking to leverage this content and knowledge to build turn-key resources for others. This is surprisingly challenging for reasons I won’t touch on, but it could profoundly improve learning outcomes for many people.3). I am pondering how to enable richer sharing and collaboration between people. I have a number of patents in this space and can envision a few business opportunities.----[0] https://andymatuschak.org/prompts/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s far more likely that the OP is lacking in social skills. People are not two dimensional, and people who are who you find at most parties. Conversations in a social setting have a certain protocol to them. They start out with small talk, that’s how you learn someone’s mannerisms, personality, flow, etc. without having to actually concentrate on the details of what you’re talking about. You read their subtle cues to learn how to interact with them.Not everyone is matched appropriately and I find it takes a lot of effort, especially emotional effort to connect with someone you don’t know for the first time, at a party where there are a lot of distractions. Have you ever noticed people who glide effortlessly from person to person, and who are able to talk to anyone? Seek those people out and study how they interact with other humans.Having good social skills is just as important as being well read, maybe even more so. A good book can be entertaining but it only takes a chance encounter to meet a life long friend, form a beneficial relationship, or meet a romantic partner. Part of me wonders if the OP were to meet one of the authors of the books he reads at a party, would he be able to interact with them? Probably not, and that’s my point exactly.You’re going to go to a lot of parties in life, if you give up on them you are depriving yourself of valuable life experience. It has nothing to do with books or how smart you are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"from this thread and the far-too-many-hours I&#39;ve spent on Reddit - obviously these feeling are not uncommon, but the tone in which this stuff is presented always reeks of unearned superioritylike I think its great that people like OP have enjoyment and passion for &#34;intellectual pursuits&#34;, but most other people don&#39;t. you have an interest, and like most other interests, people aren&#39;t going to share your interest because they have their own, different interests. so don&#39;t be surprised when you try to pivot the conversation, people don&#39;t want to talk aboutlike it sucks you can&#39;t share your interest with those close to you, that&#39;s a problem most everyone has, but when it&#39;s on the topic of &#34;intellectual pursuits&#34; or whatever 
 - articles like this it always read as &#34;I&#39;m smart, everyone else is dumb, woe is me&#34;that may not be what people like OP are intending - but the problem is others just have different passions and priorities than you and are turned off when you want to discuss only what interests you. I&#39;m certain most could have such a conversation with someone like OP, but why would they when their tone smells like &#34;smarter than tho&#34; because they want to talk about esoteric philosophy or abstract ideas at a college partyif one want to get rid of this &#34;loneliness&#34; you either need to find a community of like-minded others (see the internet) or introduce conversation topics in a more mutually interesting manner instead of wishing for others to meet you where you areI write this as someone who has been on both sides of the conversation"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a few years out of grad school, working at a tech company, and single.  I came from an academic background where talking about interesting ideas and concepts was the norm.  I had a pretty uncommon career path into tech and I&#39;m not some coder.My experience is that when you&#39;re in my position, it&#39;s getting harder and harder (with age) to find people who are interested in talking about ideas, entertaining the curiosities in life without some agenda/getting offended by the controversial ones, talking about possibilities and concepts (rather than objects).  Like having conversations on advanced mode with people who are similar.Often times at parties, when I get bored, I think of a quote, &#34;Great minds discuss ideas. Average minds discuss events/things. Small minds discuss wine.&#34;It&#39;s getting more and more common that I find people just wanting to talk about wine.  Or the equivalent.  Stuff that&#39;s completely forgettable after you leave the party.  I mean that stuff is fine, and there&#39;s nothing wrong with talking about good food you&#39;ve had, some articles you&#39;ve read, movies seen, etc. too.   And to be funny and engaging while talking about it.  It just feels like... after you&#39;re done talking about that, what then?Or if I do meet people who are intellectually interesting, how to get more connected or where to take it after a chance meeting and pleasant chat?That said, what do I have to offer at this stage of my life either, to a stranger?  I&#39;m unmarried, so I don&#39;t have kids or the mortgage to talk about.  I&#39;m not a CEO or someone powerful.  Also I&#39;m single -- what are people supposed do with that?   Don&#39;t have a lot of great reasons for anyone to want to go out of their way to spend more time with me after even an interesting 30 min conversation, without some other excuse.We&#39;re not all living close together in shared housing to make intellectually stimulating conversations natural and prolonged.  People have their lives to lead, not sit around talking about theoretical ideas.  To contact the few people I&#39;ve found who are interesting would be... how?  &#34;Would you like to schedule a get-together again for a conversation date?&#34;It&#39;s not going to get easier either.   Probably in a few years I&#39;ll be the really odd guy.  Eh, it&#39;s a life choice I&#39;ve made, I realize that too -- to be more interested in ideas and experiences than say... people.I figure I&#39;d better find some interesting hobbies to make up for the lack of intellectual stimulation.   But deeper, what am I working towards?  For whom?  So, sometimes I think of changing jobs just to see more of the world and gather experiences to be able to have more intellectually stimulating conversations.  Learn about VC?  Hear about more companies?  Where/how?Yeah, it&#39;s a bit of a problem sometimes to ponder."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key points:&#34;Thus Beijing prefers that the best talent in the country work in manufacturing sectors rather than consumer internet and finance. Personally, I think it has been a tragedy for the US that so many physics PhDs have gone to work in hedge funds and Silicon Valley.&#34;&#34;The US focus on efficiency has revealed the brittleness of its economy, which has neither the manufacturing capability to scale up domestic production of goods nor the logistics capacity to handle greater imports. Decades of American deindustrialization as well as an aversion against idle capacity has eroded domestic manufacturing.&#34;&#34;In the face of this challenge against a new peer competitor, the US has demonstrated a superb capacity for self-harm.&#34;&#34;For someone in the middle class, there has never been a better year to live in China. That comes down to the entrepreneurs, who are creating businesses to please people.&#34;All, absolutely true as I&#39;ve commented previously in other posts. The decline of America is primarily a story about misallocation of talent and the demise of the American middle class as a result."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Manhattan meets MauiI think that is a stretch beyond snapping point for Hong Kong. Most days in Hong Kong I could see the air pollution obscuring buildings in the distance. It&#39;s AQI is terrible https://aqicn.org/city/hongkong/ . There are nice mountain walks and nearby islands but it is extremely dense and urban. It&#39;s one of the places Ghost in the Shell used for reference!Also the narrative here feels mostly from the mainland China point of view; having to go and deal with &#34;problematic&#34; Hong Kong. But problems between Hong Kong and the mainland began when Beijing used its influence to restrict Hong Kong&#39;s traditional democracy, so only &#34;approved&#34; candidates could be voted into office. And since then it&#39;s increasingly clamped down on the freedoms Hong Kong previously enjoyed, most recently doing things such as removing the Tiananmen Square memorials (https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-59764029). At this point the writing is on the wall and bit by bit Hong Kong will brought in step with the rest of mainland China.Unlike the author I found the Hong Kong bureaucracy fast and effective. Enforcers &#34;sometimes able to look the other way&#34; sounds like corruption to me and people with better guanxi being able to bend the rules. I&#39;d rather have the laws fair, clear and applied to all equally (though that&#39;s always going to be a gradient).Despite all that, it&#39;s undeniable China is on the rise and that&#39;s going to be the dominant story of this century. There&#39;s potential for that to be a great boon to the world and I hope that&#39;s the reality that comes to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m a mechanical engineer - smartbolts are cool but rarely used in my experience. Much more commonly used are DTI washers: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_tension_indicatorDue to the washer style can be used with a wide range of fasteners. The most common type, in my experience, due to the ease of use, has a little bit of colored goo inside the arched cells. The goo squirts out when the specified torque is reached.That being said, there are a lot of approaches to this same problem. Another common technique is breakaway bolts that are driven with a piece that snaps away when a certain torque is reached: https://youtu.be/lrCoi3gaLfU"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At Boeing, I learned that bolts should be lubricated before torquing them in order to ensure an accurate torque. I initially thought wouldn&#39;t the lubrication allow the bolt to unwind itself? Surprisingly, no.Since then, on my car, I always put a bit of grease on a bolt beforehand. It keeps the water out, preventing the bolt from rusting itself together. It makes for an accurate torque. I&#39;ve never had one unscrew itself, and I can always get the lug nuts off!Of course, you still need to use lock washers. For critical bolts, use a cotter pin or a safety wire."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was one of the folks who put together the steel for a waterslide in a certain amusement park in California. Our method consisting of putting a mark across the bolt and nut after tightening it all the way down with a spud wrench, and then using a breaker bar until the mark on the nut was at the 4 o&#39;clock position( or maybe it was 8, I don&#39;t recall ).The inspectors would then use a telescope to check every mark. Completely blew my mind that they relied on this method, rather than something that measured the force directly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Summary: the tests were conducted on guinea pigs because they can develop immune reactions to repeated tick bites like humans do. Mice do not seem to be suited for that for once.The vaccine was administered intradermally. It consists of nucleoside-modified mRNA encapsulated in lipid nanoparticles like we know them from Covid vaccines already. The contained mRNA sequences encode 19 different proteins that are usually found in the saliva of a particular kind of tick in the US. These proteins were selected because of prior research it was known that they seemed to cause inflammatory reactions in the host. The inflammatory reaction that occured at the site of the tick bite hampered feeding of the ticks and reduced risk of disease transmission. The vaccine mostly seems to buy more time to remove the ticks before an infection can take place because the disease causing bacteria was not directly targeted by the vaccine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly, there was a Lyme vaccine in the late 90s that was pulled from the market:https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2870557/I think it’s a shame it was withdrawn, with a low effectiveness of 80% and even requiring annual boosters I’d view that as a great option if I lived somewhere with deer ticks. Lyme disease is scary."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Postgres&#39;s dominance is well deserved, of course. My only concerns with it, both are actively worked on, are bloat management (significant for update heavy workloads and programmers used to the MySQL model of rollback segments) and the scaling of concurrency (going over 500 connections). Bloat was taken over by Cybertec[1] after stalling for a bit and is funded (yay), while concurrency was also enhanced out of Microsoft [2]. All in all, an excellent future for our beloved Postgres.[1] https://github.com/cybertec-postgresql/zheap

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is a professor at CMU who specializes in databases: https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~pavlo/Not completely related, but his lectures on databases on YouTube are really good. Much better than the DB class I had at college."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really excited by all the database love in the last few years. I moved to PG from MySQL in 2014 and don&#39;t regret it since.Timescaledb looks very exciting, as it&#39;s &#34;just&#34; a PG extension, but their compression work looks great. [0]I&#39;m also really loving clickhouse, but haven&#39;t deployed that to production yet (haven&#39;t had the need to yet, almost did for an apache arrow reading thing, but didn&#39;t end up using arrow). They do some amazing things there, and the work they do is crazy impressive and fast. Reading their changelog they power through things.[0] https://docs.timescale.com/timescaledb/latest/how-to-guides/..."</p>
