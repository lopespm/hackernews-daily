								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this is an important part:&#34;Fortunately in western countries the suppression of heresies is nothing like as bad as it used to be. Though the window of opinions you can express publicly has narrowed in the last decade, it&#39;s still much wider than it was a few hundred years ago. The problem is the derivative. Up till about 1985 the window had been growing ever wider. Anyone looking into the future in 1985 would have expected freedom of expression to continue to increase. Instead it has decreased.&#34;Many people proclaim that &#34;free speech is dead&#34; and all of that, but it&#39;s still at an all-time high if you zoom out a bit. You don&#39;t even need to go back a few hundred years; look at the number of people persecuted by the government (both through the courts and outside of it) for things like blasphemy, subversion, civil rights, sexual deviancy (homosexuality, among other things), etc. just a few decades ago. In the US burning the flag was illegal in many states until the late 80s when the SCOTUS declared it was legal under the 1st (and only by a 5-4 majority).Yes, there are some developments I am not especially pleased with either, but it&#39;s also important to remember the historical context.Anyway, I liked this piece of nuance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The reason the current wave of intolerance comes from the left is simply because the new unifying ideology happened to come from the left.This is an (aggressively?) conventional idea that I have an (I guess) heretical opinion about. I&#39;m somewhat persuaded that there is a recent outbreak of intolerance for differing ideas and ideals (though I suspect every generation expresses a version of this opinion as they get older and become out of step with cultural evolution), but I don&#39;t think it has any particular political valence. I have to watch my tongue just as much around &#34;aggressive conventionalists&#34; on either side, they just have different conventions. It&#39;s just as disqualifying as the x-isms from the left, if you care about staying in the good graces of convention on the right, to express opinions like &#34;immigrants are good&#34;, &#34;the 2020 US presidential election ran smoothly and had a clear victor who was duly inaugurated&#34;, &#34;gender is a social construct&#34;, &#34;people who are attracted to others of the same sex are normal and should have the same rights as anyone else&#34;, etc. etc.Honestly I think this whole thing is as simple as, people just have different views and lots of people of all stripes don&#39;t want to agree to disagree with the people they spend most of their time with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of a Popehat article I finally got around to reading yesterday: https://popehat.substack.com/p/our-fundamental-right-to-sham...In that article, Popehat talks about the need to define cancel culture and understand how the free speech rights of the first speaker intersect with the free speech and association rights of people that respond.I think the most useful aspect of PG&#39;s article is that he does actually define what he means by heresy:&gt; Structurally there are two distinctive things about heresy: (1) that it takes priority over the question of truth or falsity, and (2) that it outweighs everything else the speaker has donePG doesn&#39;t give any examples, but I do think that trying to be clear around definitions in order to be able to say &#34;is this an example of heresy at work?&#34; or &#34;has this person been unfairly cancelled?&#34; is a valuable exercise.FWIW, my main reason for commenting is that I find Popehat&#39;s article to be a valuable addition to the conversation because it&#39;s specifically addressing the &#34;cancel culture&#34; terminology rather than trying to swirl a new term (heresy) into the mix."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a unique email address for every single service that I sign up for, similar to this, though selfhosted. I&#39;ve been doing this for years and it works wonderfully. If someone misuses my email address, or gets annoying, I can simply turn off the address. Bam!It&#39;s the easiest Postfix config in the universe, essentially just:  virtual_alias_domains = domain1.com domain2.com
  virtual_alias_maps = hash:/etc/postfix/virtual

And then /etc/postfix/virtual looks like this:  phil.equifax@domain1.com firstname.lastname@gmail.com
  phil.experian@domain1.com firstname.lastname@gmail.com
  ... (hundreds of these)

I also made a super simple web UI for myself to edit this file quickly.Gmail seems to be fine with this, emails do not usually end up in spam. Every full moon maybe, but usually it&#39;s alright.It&#39;s not as shiny as Apple&#39;s thing, but it&#39;s 100% selfhosted and I own the domain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I signed up for Comcast Xfinity using a brand new “hide my email” address and three months later I started receiving phishing emails at that address. (I’ve gotten over half a dozen so far). Made me realize that either Comcast was hacked (without disclosing it) or they’re selling people’s emails."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hang on, though: doesn&#39;t this essentially hand Apple a big list of which domains you communicate with and how frequently? There&#39;s also nothing stopping them reading the emails on the way through. I know a lot of people trust Apple more than Google, but you&#39;re essentially signing up for a vendor-locked product that you&#39;re hoping Apple will continue to support, with no guarantee they won&#39;t collect - even at an aggregate level - your communication preferences.They&#39;re even slightly pre-filtered for Apple&#39;s convenience, as the times you&#39;re likely to use Hide My Email are for shopping and social media - nice, ripe marketing targets."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Update - Restoration work to restore sites is underway and will continue into the weekend. We are taking a controlled and hands-on approach as we gather feedback from customers to ensure the integrity of these site restorations.I’ve seen failing Kickstarter updates with more information than this.Anyway the title isn’t wrong per se but it might be more informative to say a subset of tenants using Atlassian’s SaaS products are down.If you use any of their products on prem … they are not down. And if you’re not one of the affected tenants then your Atlassian products are fine. At work we have Confluence hosted by Atlassian and it’s up.According to The Register:&gt; We were also told that the incident affects a relatively small number of Atlassian customers: about 400. That&#39;s only 0.18 per cent of the company&#39;s 226,000 customers, which isn&#39;t much consolation to the several hundred who still can&#39;t access their data."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in the middle of an apartment search. I was reflecting the other day on how much searching for an apartment has changed over the last 10 years.Conclusion: it hasn&#39;t changed much at all.It&#39;s still necessary to search on a myriad of sites. Most of the time, by the time you inquire, a place is gone. Or the ad was misleading and that &#34;$2000 2BR&#34; is actually &#34;$2000 for the cheapest Studio we have, but we also have 2BR for $3.5K&#34;.Finding places that match my criteria still requires careful inspection of the description. Checking a filter box for &#34;Parking&#34; excludes places that only mention parking in the description.With all of the modernization and streamlining that has happened in other parts of our lives, apartment hunting remains unstructured, messy, frustrating, stressful.Aggregators like Padmapper helped for awhile, but these days, it seems like most listings are posted by scammy middlemen just trying to make a commission on the listing, and now the site actively makes the process even harder.Is hunting for an apartment doomed to be this messy forever? It seems like an area that is ripe for disruption or a better option, but what would it take to actually solve this?---With all of that said, this post is exactly what I needed right now. I&#39;ve been toying with a very similar idea to improve the efficiency of my search process and this is good inspiration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m currently searching in Berlin and the market has become insane. Here&#39;s a response I got yesterday:&#34;With more than 1200 prospective tenants, it was really difficult for the landlord to make a decision.Unfortunately, we have to inform you that the landlord has decided on other prospective tenants.Thank you for your understanding!

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting article: I did something similar but for Zürich (finding a low-price, but good apartment there is almost impossible).I did follow a different approach though, and reverse engineered the APIs of the most common rental listing websites here.I didn&#39;t publish the code (or better said, I didn&#39;t make it public), but it&#39;s similar to yours. Instead of SQLite I used a PostGis database where I stored the apartments with their point to point public transport distance from my office (pre-covid search). I did it in Rust.Whilst the application is not available to the public (yet), all of the libraries I&#39;ve created are now available.I should have both a Rust and a Golang version for most / all of them.On a side note, I did a similar project (scraper + visualizer / search) for finding a job for my girlfriend by scraping LinkedIn, Xing and a couple of other local job posting websites.[0]: https://github.com/denysvitali/sbb-api-rs[1]: https://github.com/denysvitali/homegate-rs[2]: https://github.com/denysvitali/flatfox-rs[3]: https://github.com/denysvitali/go-sbb-api"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The linked tweet doesn&#39;t provide a citation or context for the &#34;helped prevent ~2M deaths&#34; claim. But there is work in this area which suggests that &#34;~2M lives saved&#34; in the last 50 years underestimates the benefits of nuclear power by a lot.One commenter here writes&gt; What is the actual claim here? Nuclear power didn&#39;t prevent any deaths, after all everyone will eventually die for one reason or another. So it must be something like two million people would have died earlier without nuclear power, but by how much?That&#39;s a better way to think about the problem: not &#34;lives saved,&#34; but life-years saved. Calculations of life-years saved are necessarily sketchy, but there is at least one promising preliminary effort [1]. See especially page 22.[1] https://storage.googleapis.com/production-sitebuilder-v1-0-1..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If nukes prevented that many deaths, imagine how many solar + wind will prevent.The point here is that each $10B spent on new generating capacity displaces some amount of coal generation. If you spend your $10B building nukes, it displaces A million tons / year of coal output, if you spend $10B building renewables, it instead displaces B million tons.And B is much larger than A, because a GW of solar + storage is much cheaper than a GW of nuke.The corollary is that each $ diverted from renewables to nukes is not just harmful, but brings climate disaster nearer. Best, of course, would be to stop diverting money to fossils, but all we can do about that is build out renewables + storage as fast as we can. Renewables will be running at 100% at all times, and each kWh produced displaces a kWh of fossil generation.Displaced fossil generation in most markets is methane gas, because methane gas is cheaper and therefore preferred. But! anywhere coal is being used at all, they will prefer to cut coal output because cutting coal saves more money than cutting gas.A particularly good example is Germany, where they cannot get enough natural gas to meet their needs, and are burning coal like nobody&#39;s business. Every last kWh of renewables + storage that can be put on the German grid, provided it is steady-enough output, displaces exactly that much coal.The cost of storage is plummeting even faster than of solar or wind ever did, so there is some short-term sense in delaying storage build-out until it is cheaper, so you can buy more of it. But in the big picture, building out storage at any price is much, much better than waiting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s the main tragedy of the human race is not staying with nuclear and going all in.  Unfortunately the fad of being afraid of nuclear will probably be the downfall of the human race.  We would have had energy solved by the 80&#39;s.  Almost sickening to think about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my youth I once worked for a small local airport near where I grew up. I did a lot of small stuff like mowing lawn between runways and cleaning.One day it was my job to switch out burned out light bulbs from the approach light installations. It was before anyone was risk averse so I only had a ladder to climb up, keep as still as possible while wrangling the cases open, getting the old bulb out and installing the new one.The most terrifying thing was bursts of wind when the whole construction, me included started to wobble.I had quite a bit of an adrenaline rush this day.Good times, but now I feel a bit old.Edit:
German local online newspaper article containing a photo of the approach lighting [0].IATA designation: HOQ[0]: https://www.frankenpost.de/inhalt.hof-stadtrat-beraet-ueber-...Reading about it I learned that it is nowadays also used as a test area for BMW&#39;s autonomous driving.

I have no ability to tell the FAA, &#34;sorry, it&#39;s been delayed, I&#39;ll have an update for you in a few months.&#34;Edit to add: Lest this come off as generic complaining, here&#39;s an example of people dying because the FAA failed to do in a timely manner what Congress repeatedly told them to do:Ten years ago, Section 203 of the Airline Safety and Federal Aviation Administration Extension Act of 2010 mandated that the FAA create an electronic pilot records database (PRD), which was intended to improve the timeliness and efficiency of the PRIA records retrieval process by providing hiring operators and DAs with direct access to pilots’ FAA, NDR, and former employer records in a single database. By 2016, the FAA had not yet implemented the PRD, and Congress imposed an April 30, 2017, deadline, which the FAA also missed. Although the FAA has begun phasing in the use of the PRD, the PRD is not yet fully functional; it contains only pilots’ FAA records and is available to hiring operators for use on a voluntary basis.On March 30, 2020, the FAA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) that outlined PRD functions.https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/AccidentReports/Reports/...

Let me know if you want help."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From a quick look at the article, I can see a few subtle &#34;omissions&#34; or &#34;rants that have easy fixes&#34;. I can&#39;t tell how long the author has spent on Windows (it&#39;s not in the article) so it&#39;s hard to know how much effort they have put in getting adjusted. It takes a really long time to switch platforms and feel comfortable in them, and without spending a long time adjusting, it&#39;s too easy to complain and quite hard to provide a fair review...For a more positive spin, I&#39;ll leave here my own review of Windows after being off the platform for 25 years, spending 15 of those on macOS, and then spending the last year primarily on Windows. TL;DR: I&#39;m quite happy with the switch, but obviously there are many things that could be different/better and some of the issues that the OP highlights are valid.The intro and index: https://jmmv.dev/2022/03/a-year-on-windows-intro.html[edit: wording]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can see where OP is coming from but it sounds like he hasn&#39;t allowed him/herself to learn to do things the windows way.You maybe used to coreutils/binutils and piecing together things in bash like a lego but Powershell in many ways allows you to build powerful scripts or compose one liners like with bash except you have access to .NET and any .NET assembly you can load! Don&#39;t even get me started on WMI or GPO.&#34;Windows wasn&#39;t made for me&#34; right... it isn&#39;t made for anyone that wants to use it like a unix system, it is an entirely different OS. Just like you shouldn&#39;t expect Linux to work like windows.It really isn&#39;t a competition. Windows is messy in its own way and that affects its performance as well. If you want to feel like you are in control, windows isn&#39;t for you. If you want to get things done, windows is a mediocre but acceptable platform.The very things that make Linux powerful and controllable like shared library all over the place, package managers, and more make it more fragile and time consuming to administer.I spent at least 8-10 hours a week getting things to work on Linux when I had it as my daily driver for over a decade. The weeks I didn&#39;t do this, it was because I did nothing outside of browsing the web. Don&#39;t get me wrong, I enjoyed  most of that time, and I did feel like I was in control up until distro maintainers decide things for me and my only choice is to beg and plead and be told to fork it if I disagreed.All I am saying is every platform exists for a reason and has issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve actually done kind of the opposite recently.I&#39;ve used Linux a lot in the past, and especially on servers pretty much exclusively - but I&#39;ve always had a Windows PC for gaming and a Mac for everything else for personal use.In the last few months I put together a tiny low power AMD PC (the 35W 8 core 5750GE!) - and I am massively impressed by how well everything works.Proton/Wine and the OSS AMD graphics stack run older Windows games better than Windows 10 or 11 does. The DP MST setup I have just works (unlike on Windows + NVIDIA where it loves to break). Using KDE as a desktop is more consistent as a UI than Windows 11 is.It&#39;s come a long way, and the user experience (as someone who was expecting to dislike it) is seriously improved &amp; seriously impressive.edit: a lot of the niggles I used to hit have just gone away - I don&#39;t get tearing, multimonitor just worked. I haven&#39;t tried disparate DPIs and I expect that would be an issue, but even so... I&#39;m impressed."</p>
