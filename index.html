								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am considering whether to have a CT scan done of my heart. I am 35 yo and healthy, but have bad history of heart disease in my family. No current issues for me though. My doctor recommended I do the scan just to see if I have any plaque buildup, but is this not a lot of unnecessary radiation at a fairly young age? I hear it is like getting 1,000 x-rays done. Can anyone qualified chime in?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To anyone who thinks &#34;it is easy&#34;, try this experiment: recreate a popular song (+100M views on YT for example) in some DAW. (the songs are produced in similar DAWs.) You won&#39;t be able to recreate the vocals, but you should be able to recreate the backing track almost identically. Put the original in right ear, your version in the left ear, and iterate until switching between versions sounds identical.Over 100s of hours, this will train you ears, and you will appreciate the production quality of today&#39;s pop music.This just covers the production and mixing, not the writing. Catchy pop songs sound deceivingly simple, which is the point and why they are so difficult to write."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to make music as a teenager. Spending many hours in the &#34;studio&#34; certainly shapes your aesthetics and how you approach new music. Even understanding just the basics and tiny bits of underlying techniques makes you listen differently, makes it easy to become a snob to be honest. Overall though, and generally, making things of any sort lets you appreciate the creative process as an overarching art in itself, an appreciation you can often transport to other fields, even those not conventionally regarded as artistic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whether you like Ableton Live or not relative to other options is a matter of preference, but regardless, the folks who run Ableton are pretty cool:- run by real musicians who play shows, it came out of a scratched personal itch- so far, good new owners of Cycling 74, the bug squash numbers in the last couple of releases were stellar- totally hacker friendly, they know people release disassembled Python code for control surfaces, and basically said &#34;we can&#39;t support individual users doing this, but we know it&#39;s out there and won&#39;t do anything to stop it&#34; (this was what actually got me on the bus!)- really good educational outreach initiatives, and they give away a very capable light version for peanuts (or free with many controllers)I find their prices high, all things considered, but am happy to be a long time customer, and as a serious musician musician (university educated, etc.), I think it&#39;s great that it has become such a gateway to appreciation of instrumental music by making music creation a more accessible hobby.And the fact that I can script the heck out of such a full featured commercial product in Scheme by writing a Max/MSP external is fantastic (plug, I wrote Scheme For Max, which allows you to run lisp in your Ableton...)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I need to make a general remark to people who are evaluating (and/or) planning to introduce anti-bot software on their websites. Anti-bot software is nonsense. Its snake oil sold to people without technical knowledge for heavy bucks.If this guy got to experience how systemically bad the credential stuffing problem is, he&#39;d probably take down the whole repository.None of these anti-bot providers give a shit about invading your privacy, tracking your every movements, or whatever other power fantasy that can be imagined. Nobody pays those vendors $10m/year to frustrate web crawler enthusiasts, they do it to stop credential stuffing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I really enjoy about this thread is all of the completely different perspectives. Lots of people doing anti-abuse research bemoaning that this stuff exists, and lots of people working against what are from their perspective ham-handed anti-abuse tech blocking legitimate useful automation trading tips on how to do it better. I guess the other sides of those we don&#39;t see much. People doing actual black-hat work probably don&#39;t post about it on public forums, and most of the over-broad anti-abuse is probably a side effect of taking some anti-abuse tech and blindly applying it to the whole site just because that&#39;s simpler, often no tech people may be really involved at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am always amazed when otherwise intelligent people assert without data that the marginal cost of serving web traffic to scrapers/bots is zero. It is kind of like people who say &#34;Why don&#39;t they put more fuel in the rocket so it can get all the way into orbit with just one stage?&#34;It sounds great but it is a completely ignorant thing to say."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Getting anything out of a subshell that isn&#39;t from STDOUT is impossible. So you can&#39;t define an array in a subshell and then use it outside the subshell, and you can&#39;t return an array (or anything that isn&#39;t a string) from a subshell. If you only use subshells and want to use any kind of data structure that isn&#39;t a string passed from STDOUT, you have to do it globally. And subshells are slow. So nobody uses subshells.If you use Bash for programming, you have to stop thinking in terms of the holier-than-thou software engineer, whose ego believes that a superior, &#34;clean&#34; design makes a superior program. You should embrace globals. You should switch between using or not using the enforcement of set variables or program exit status. You should stop using Bashisms and subtle, obscure language features unless you absolutely have to.Bash is not a &#34;real&#34; programming language, so do not treat it as one. Do not look for hidden features, or try to do things in cute ways that nobody else uses. There is no superior method or hidden knowledge. Just write extremely simple code and understand the quirks of the shell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Well, because it simply doesn&#39;t work for them: returning from a function does not trigger the EXIT signal.It doesn&#39;t trigger EXIT, but it does trigger RETURN. Just trap both:    #!/bin/bash

    foo() {
        trap &#34;echo &#39;Cleanup!&#39;&#34; RETURN EXIT

        #return
        #exit

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s an interesting bit of...abuse :) Since Bash is effectively stringly-typed, it can be used as a functional programming language, with pipes similar to function composition.e.g.: wtfp.sh    #!/usr/bin/env bash

    map() {
      local fn=&#34;$1&#34;

      local input
      while read -r input; do

      echo &#34;${output}&#34;

    filter() {

      local input
      while read -r input; do
        &#34;${fn}&#34; &#34;${input}&#34; &amp;&amp; echo &#34;${input}&#34;
      done

    add() {
      echo $(( $1 + $2 ))
    }

    increment() {
      echo $(( $1 + 1 ))
    }

    square() {
      echo $(( $1 * $1 ))
    }

    even() {
      return $(( $1 % 2 ))
    }

    sum() {
      reduce add 0
    }

    map increment | map square | filter even | sum

...then:    $ printf &#34;%s\n&#34; 1 2 3 4 5 | ./wtfp.sh

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Have to chime-in here as a piano player since age 7 (so been going for ~28 now), who about 2 years ago got very serious about Jazz.I have stumbled across this book many times, I have read it. It&#39;s the single most controversial book that I&#39;ve read about piano technique and playing that I&#39;ve found.The author, is not even a player himself (!!!). There&#39;s a great summary of reviews about the book here (https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=38247.0), if you&#39;re starting into piano, stay away, get a decent teacher."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the last section in Chapter One, titled &#34;Jazz, Fake Books, and Improvisation&#34;:&gt; In summary, the process of learning this genre consists of practicing the chords and scales sufficiently so that, given a melody, you can “feel” the right and wrong chords that go along with it.That&#39;s only scratching the surface and will not get you playing jazz. Listening to and copying the greats - Bird, Monk, Evans, Coltrane, Rollins, et al. That&#39;s how you learn to play jazz.&gt;It is clear that this genre is here to stay, has great educational and practical value, is relatively easy to learn, and can be a lot of fun.Relatively easy to learn??? Clearly the author hasn&#39;t or isn&#39;t playing jazz."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s sad that this book is written in such a self-validating tone (the very first sentence is &#34;This is the best book ever written on how to practice at the piano!&#34; for crying out loud), because the content is excellent.I read it a couple years ago and it completely changed how I approach practicing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It would be a scam, except academics could easily disrupt it and they (mostly) choose not to.It&#39;s more that the taxpayer is fleeced by academia in general (the whole research-funding-publishing complex) for many billions because there&#39;s no incentive for academics to save the taxpayer money by handling publishing themselves. (As Doctorow notes, they already review the manuscripts, so all that&#39;s left for an existing journal&#39;s editorial team to do is vote for a chief editor and switch to any one of many open, free research publication services.)Public domain publishing should be a condition of government funding for research."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As much as I hate the copyright model used by the scientific journals, they do have a valid raison-d-etre. It&#39;s about prioritization due to limited capacity. If you artificially limit the number of published articles to X per month, you are forced to pick X best ones (according to whichever metric you choose). If you just publish anything that gets a decent peer review score, you&#39;ll get voting rings, generated articles, and all sorts of junk.Has anybody noticed how the quality of journalism plummeted with the transition from physical copies (that had an implied limit on the number of articles) to the online &#34;portals&#34; (that are incentivized to churn out as much clickbait as possible)?That said, the financial streams should go the other way. Pay a non-refundable fee to get considered for publishing, but otherwise if it&#39;s a tax-funded research, it must be public domain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I reviewed a submission (review paper) to a top journal recently. It took a lot of time, and I responded with seven pages of recommendations, comments, and corrections. My recommendation was to transfer it to a more specialist journal from the same publisher. Afterwards I was wondering &#34;why the hell am I doing this for free when my friends are getting rich?&#34;"</p>

I remember the Monarchs being easy to catch with my hands, as if they weren&#39;t afraid.Now that I know how much their population has depleted, these memories feel extremely idyllic to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went to Mexico January past and lucked out that it was butterfly season. Ever since raising them with my own milkweed plants I had wanted to see this sight.I can only encourage tourism for this event, a million butterflys flapping their wings definitely makes a sound and hopefully the more tourists that go to see them, the more value is placed on protecting their forestry reserves."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I own a farm, this summer we produced and sold about 1500 bales of hay. Had no idea hay exchange existed, the vast majority of our sales were via craigslist and Facebook marketplace, with most being small-scale (50 bales or fewer). The rest came from word of mouth and our local 4-H group.Producing hay at this scale is extremely difficult. The start-up costs are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and you&#39;re typically barely breaking even. This year is unusual in that supply was way down, so prices were a lot higher than normal. The only reason we can do it is that we have a relationship with someone who cuts &amp; bales a number of small fields for a per-ton fee.I could see a tool like this being useful for large-scale operations that are doing the big round bales yet don&#39;t have an established relationship with a buyer. For an operation like ours, where we are producing small ~60lb traditional square bales, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to find anyone local enough who wants to buy at the quantity and size we have. For instance, only two entries in the entire state of Oregon.That said, I&#39;ll post on here next season, I&#39;d be really interested to see if anyone reaches out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is freaking beautiful.  The internet could have been like this.I’m going to show my Mom, she is always wanting to find good hay.Perhaps a bit more info though like pics would be good haha.  Some indication of the quality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a city slicker who understands nothing of modern agriculture, can I get an explanation of what is going on here?"</p>
