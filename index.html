								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why do giant companies do so many hilariously dumb things?As organizational complexity increases, design debt and responsibility becomes diffused among larger and larger groups of people. Leading to the bizarre situation where no individual has power or responsibility over anything specifically.Any individual interface element might have taken input from as many as 100+ different people over many years, each with competing interests and goals (no, I&#39;m not joking). Combine this with the precedents and decisions made on projects in the past (design debt), and you end up with stupid outcomes like this.As a multiple FAANG alumni, I&#39;ve seen this firsthand hundreds of times.I think it&#39;s cute that people think IC designers or engineers have the power to make any real decisions inside large organizations.What&#39;s more likely, is these stupid icons were part of some design system somebody created 7 years ago (have to stay consistent of course!). The circular floating buttons were a precedent somebody set 5 years ago on a completely different product (god forbid it feels &#34;off-brand&#34;). The colors were set 6 years ago on some project where this kind of application was never thought of.And finally, the order &amp; placement of the icons was changed 15 times by some PM, then the PM&#39;s boss, then the accessibility guys, then the brand team, the brand team&#39;s boss, then the director of marketing, etc. etc. The tie breaking vote going to whoever is perceived as having more soft power inside the org at the time.Hence, the inevitable outcome of big company stupidity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just had an idea that might explain why this happens.Firstly, I&#39;ve observed a phenomenon when I talk to a programmer about a problem I want to solve. They might get excited, learn a bit of the problem domain and then go off and build something that kind of solves part of my problem. But then I&#39;m stuck in a endless cycle of explaining the rest of the problem, to someone who isn&#39;t really interested, then waiting for a new iteration and then evaluating how it doesn&#39;t completely the solve the problem until the programmer gets bored and goes off to find something new and exciting to do with computers. Programming the computerwas always the end for them. They don&#39;t actually care about the problem. I care about the problem. So for me computers are a tool to solve my problem. I might as well write the program myself because it&#39;s less work to become a mediocre programmer than to intimately understand the problem.My theory is that something like this happens in interface design. There are  designers who love to create beautiful designs, and we love that, but beauty is the end of it for them. They don&#39;t actually care about the problem that the program (website, app, whatever) is supposed to solve. If they were stuck in a job filling out forms all day they would quickly learn the lesson to put the reset button out of the way. If they were intimately familiar with the problem, the better design would be obvious. And so it is that people with no &#34;design skills&#34; can point out the obvious mistakes of the designers.It&#39;s also true that good design is hard. Starting with a blank sheet and creating something, let alone something good, is daunting. Perhaps the hardest part is having the humility to admit, &#34;I don&#39;t understand the problem sufficiently&#34; and the empathy to care about the problem enough to learn it well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Phoenix is practically built with this idea in mind.My startup is built out of a single phoenix monolith. Only external dependency is postgres.Despite this, I&#39;ve managed to completely avoid all the typical scaling issues of a monolith. Need a service or background worker? I juts make a Genserver or Oban worker and mount it in the supervision tree. The Beam takes care of maintaining the process, pubsub to said service and error handling in the event of a crash.I&#39;m basicly getting all the best advantages of a monolith* one codebase to navigate, our team is TINY
* all functionality is in librariesAnd all the advantages of microservices without the associated costs. (orchestration, management etc)* bottleneck use cases can live on their own nodes* publish subscribe to dispatch background jobs* services that each focus on doing one thing really wellWe&#39;ve accomplished this all through just libraries and a little bit of configuration. At no point so far have we had to..* setup a message broker (phoenix pubsub has been fine for us. we can send messages between different processes on the server and to the clients themselves over channels)* setup external clusters for background workers. (Oban was drop in and jsut works. I&#39;m able to add a new worker without having to tell devops anything. the supervision tree allocates the memory for the process and takes care of fault tolerance for me. That leaves me to focus on solving the business problems)* setup a second github repo. Its a monorepo and at out scale, its fine. We have one library for communicating to the database that every system just uses.Eventually we&#39;ll probably have to start rethinking and building out separate services. But I&#39;m happy that we&#39;re already able to get some of teh benefits of a microservice architecture while sticking to what makes monoliths great for mvps. It will be awhile before we need to think about scaling out web service. It just works. Leaves me more time to work on tuning out database to keep up!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Write libraries AND services, where it makes sense.I wrote a Python library to scrape google news [0]We also have it as a service [1]Want to know why? Because devs who can&#39;t pay won&#39;t pay. Businesses who can pay will rather pay for a service (API in our case), and not care about maintaining it.[0] https://github.com/kotartemiy/pygooglenews[1] https://newscatcherapi.com/google-news-api"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a bad take and a false dichotomy. The reasons for choosing a library or a service are so myriad and context-dependent that any generalization about which is &#34;better&#34; is just silliness. It&#39;s like saying, &#34;If you have to get somewhere, running is better than walking.&#34; Sure, in the case of a race or escaping a predator, running is probably the best option. But what if you want to take in the sights or you can&#39;t sweat in your clothes? Running would be a bad choice, even though it&#39;s faster. There are just too many variables in the real world to make any sort of blanket statement about which approach is &#34;better.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I felt the article undersold an important technical detail about this work. Many randomized algorithms have a &#34;with high probability&#34; guarantee, which for linear systems might look like:    for any ε &gt; 0 and 0 &lt; δ &lt; 1, using poly(dimension, #nonzeros, condition, 1/ε, 1/δ) floating-point operations, our algorithm finds a solution having less than ε error with probability 1 - δ.

However, that is not the kind of guarantee stated in Theorem 1.1 in the paper. Even though the algorithm uses randomness, the analysis yields a classic big-O complexity guarantee that does not involve probabilities.This is a big difference, and it makes the result stronger."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a great opportunity to not just reimplement the GNU coreutils but to actually rethink them. The way I install a Linux system these days and then immediately download ripgrep or fd reminds me of how the first thing I used to do on a Solaris system was install bash and the GNU coreutils. There&#39;s a rich history of doing this - BSD Unix started as a bunch of utilities and patches to the AT&amp;T version, it only became a freestanding distro with its own kernel later on. And the GNU coreutils go way back before the Linux kernel - you just installed them on a commercial Unix to make it more usable. In both cases they went beyond just drop-in replacements and started adding lots of new features and flags. Things have been pretty static for a long time so it&#39;s good to see some innovations coming."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The goal of modernizing coreutils is great, and doing it in rust is even better. However, it makes me very sad that this is licensed under the MIT licence.Being licensed under the GPL is an essential part of the GNU project and their philosophy. Of course everyone is free to do as they please. However, IMHO, if one appreciates the GNU project and the ideals it stands for, then, maybe, it could be preferable not to rewrite parts of it under weaker licences that go directly against their mission!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People are all talking about how it&#39;s useful for quick stuff with datasets, but it goes far beyond that. It&#39;s useful for quick anything you might want a small database for. Imagination is the limit.For example, if any of you play D&amp;D online, you might be familiar with dndbeyond&#39;s character sheets. They&#39;re a fantastic way to onboard new players who might not have the inclination to spend hours with the rule books before they even start playing. It does all the calculations for you and gives you some buttons like &#34;roll athletics&#34; and doesn&#39;t let you add more spells than your character can have with their stats.I recently persuaded some friends to give FATE a try and built analogous push-button character sheets with google sheets [0]. It was quick and simple. With conditional formatting, you highlight bad states (rules say you can&#39;t have more of X than Y!). With the script editor, you can add full on buttons for dice rolls and other state changes with whatever logic you want (anything you can code up!). Checkboxes are obvious but super useful. And the transparency of the calculations is helpful for teaching people the system (this stat is &#34;min(A4, B1+C5)&#34;).Without google sheets, it would be a serious endeavor to build a stateful, database backed, live collaborative GUI that can be added to and customized on the fly by my users. With google sheets, it was a quick fun afternoon hack. Excel/google sheets is an amazing piece of technology.[0] Screenshot of the &#34;app&#34;: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/imh/public_images/main/Scr..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hadn&#39;t used Excel in years and now that I do, there&#39;s some things about it that drive me nuts:- It forgets what you&#39;ve copied to clipboard. Copy something. Insert another row so that there&#39;s space for it. Paste. Nothing happens. Huh? It lost my copy. It does this for a large number of operations and it drives me crazy. I&#39;ve never seen any other program do this.- You can&#39;t open two spreadsheets of the same name. This is because spreadsheet formulas can refer to cells in other tables. But I don&#39;t use that feature - can&#39;t I just open the second spreadsheet with a warning that this feature won&#39;t apply to it?- (This one applies to too many pieces of Microsoft technology.) You can&#39;t use common keyboard shortcuts properly. Ctrl-backspace deletes a word in any useful text box. Not in formula editing in excel. And ctrl+delete deletes the rest of the line instead of just the next word. Why?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excel, and more importantly, the spreadsheet is the best way to build intuition for a dataset, hands down. The alternatives, especially when it comes to Python and the default pandas output in a Jupyter Notebook are horrendous.Where Excel falls short, is data size limitations + auditability. Putting more than 1M rows of data into Excel is not possible, and once you get into the low 100K&#39;s, it becomes almost unbearable. And handing off an Excel workbooks to a colleague is handing them hours of cell dependency tracing. On the other hand, data size + auditability are the super powers of Python data analysis.I&#39;ve been building a Python package, Mito (https://trymito.io/), its an interactive spreadsheet that automatically converts your spreadsheet analysis to the equivalent pandas code. You can write spreadsheet formulas, merge datasets, create pivot tables, etc. And because its implemented in Python, you can manipulate datasets with 10M rows of data with no problem. Our goal is to bring the intuitiveness of Excel data manipulation to Pandas."</p>

And that&#39;s why Google won&#39;t succeed in this space.Apple uniquely seems to have maintained the ability to tackle these problems. I remember when Apple Pay launched and was derided (here and elsewhere) but every few weeks there&#39;d be another announcement where another group of financial institutions were brought in to the ecosystem. You keep plugging away at that, customers will start using it and after years of schlep you&#39;ll have mature payments infrastructure.Google chat apps were a meme internally even when I was still there (2017). Deprecating Hangouts features, copying Slack, creating new orgs to make the same mistakes all over again (but hey, lots of people got promoted). It was a joke and still is.And all they had to do was copy iMessage. That&#39;s it. Apple had the foresight, market power and wherewithal to push iMessage onto resistant network operators (who were all too happy to continue nickel-and-diming customers with massively profitable SMS charges long after any cost arguments had disappeared)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well I knew this, but it shouldn’t surprise most of the people here either. How many factories, data centers, companies, and products have you seen that are ISO-something certified?It’s an entire industry, of course part of that process is paying to get the specification that you’re already paying for someone to verify you’re abiding by.The last time I went through an audit the consulting firm that was auditing us only very begrudgingly gave us the requirements for a couple of sections because we kept insisting that we were providing proof that we met them and they kept disagreeing. I still think it was just to shut us up...As they mention in the tweet, you can possibly get them from the standards body in your country. For my current country (Estonia) they don’t seem to give it out freely, but you can buy the version they approved as the country’s standard for like €20, compared with the €200 for the official ISO version. So there are options..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This work (I think) worked with the mosquitos 30cm away with a servo scanning Pi Camera (1080p) and a 1W laser.To work in the real world - cover a whole room or terrace - presumably a much higher resolution camera (or much faster scanning system) would be required.  Even a 1W laser is dangerous to eyesight, if it was being fired at targets mingling with people.The system could be mounted on small drones that would patrol larger areas - but the idea of robotic drones armed with lasers roaming around is beginning to sound worse than the mosquitos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a nice little firestarter.I&#39;ve had this idea many years ago and my solution to that problem was to use two or more lasers of lower power that all shoot at the same point in 3 dimensional space. If you guess wrong then at least you won&#39;t set your house on fire (or blind someone)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can do this with sound.   A hybrid system even better.I built tech ~10 years ago to track quiet, sound emitting objects in real time to sub CM resolution using microphone arrays.  And in one demo I even had a laser pointer mounted on a 2 axis.... &#34;swinging thingie&#34; (sorry, I&#39;m not a mech-E) which would constantly stay pointed on the loudest object in the room, as it moved.  Fun stuff.  Creepy even.Shame I never found a use or a buyer for the tech. :/EDIT:  I bet an improved hybrid one would use sound to get within the right 1-2cm, with a zoom camera mounted on the pan/tilt apparatus to get it even more accurate."</p>
