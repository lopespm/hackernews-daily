								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At a high level, I really like this. Some UX concerns are all that stop it from being amazing:- The mouse should be a pointer, not a hand. Not only is that the expectation when an element is interactive, but it helps with precision clicking.- The map almost made me sick when it starting moving. It needs to be slower and smoother. You already let people speed it up, but start slower.- Dragging the map should be possible. I wanted to scroll back to something that had moved off-screen, and the map dragged a few pixels, then snapped back. If it is supposed to be draggable, let it drag. If not, don&#39;t let a drag start  and then snap it back.But really, those concerns aside, this is a nice tool."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think about this whenever someone posts about yet another new immediate mode UI library, or a custom layout engine they’ve built on top of HTML canvas. Generally all these kind of approaches make your app invisible to screen readers.The amount of work Apple, Google and others have put into making all this work is staggering, and life changing for people who are blind. Please don’t throw all that work away in your apps just because you think some UI toolkit is shiny."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having several friends on the Apple a11y team, they really do work tirelessly to make the accessibility experience amazing. A lot of the engineers on that team have visual, audiotory, or other physical impairment as well, which is really cool to see and as a result they’re all really invested in making the product accessibility awesome.Personal favorite “Easter egg” in their accessibility utilities is the baroque voiceover descriptions for the built-in wallpapers. A current colleague of mine shared it last week as part of Global Accessibility Awareness Day - https://twitter.com/mattt/status/1395439320652148736?s=21"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There will come a day when Apple will lean in heavily on Accessibility just like they&#39;ve recently amped up Privacy in ads lately.I, for one, absolutely love this about Apple! Accessibility is a beautiful core value to strive for (Privacy and others too). But I particularly appreciate Accessibility.Good designs/affordances such as gestural trackpads or mouse cursor support on iPads are all accessibility features, except they cover a major swath of humanity rather than those traditionally considered &#34;less-abled&#34;.Disclaimer: I work at Apple so I&#39;m biased. More likely, my heroes at Apple such as Sue Booker are accessibility experts  -- so I&#39;m always fan-boying over these features!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years ago, I ordered the cheapest six-axis robotic arm from ebay for about $100 that came with basically no software or motor-driver boards, so I did it all from scratch with a PCA9685 board, a basic kernel driver and some very hacky scripts from user space.One day I had some friends over for a glass of wine, and wanted to show off my creation. I invited them into my &#34;lab&#34; and placed my wine glass down on the desk so I could type a few commands with both hands.My rudimentary software had some motion smoothing once it was up and running, but upon initialization, if the arm was significantly displaced from where it had been when it was turned off, the PWM board would instruct the motor to immediately &#34;be&#34; in a position that required the arm to travel clear across the desk in effectively as little time as possible.In this case, where it had been previously happened to be where my wine glass was now, and the flimsy aluminum at high speed was enough to shear the stem from the glass and explode the bulb. Luckily the wine didn&#39;t get in any sensitive electronics, but I learned a valuable lesson about the difference between messing around with hardware vs software."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote a layoff database for Nortel Networks from ~1998 to 2001.The way I got my notice of termination was while I was running some tests on the production database and needed a &#34;negative&#34; so I searched for a userid that was not present in the database: my own.When I saw my name in the list I called my manager and asked him what was going on.He said &#34;Alex, why don&#39;t you head on home for the day and I&#39;ll call you there&#34;I wouldn&#39;t say &#34;hurt&#34; though. Nortel went bankrupt and I got a great severance package."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About seven years ago I got a bright idea to build a quadcopter. I had experience with little $25-50 drones that bumped around the house with their fragile one-inch propellers, which obviously qualified me to build and pilot something significantly bigger.Off to Aliexpress and Banggood I went. I ordered a carbon-fiber chassis, big strong motors, ESCs, 3-inch propellers, a FrSky receiver, a Devention transmitter, an STM32-based controller, giant li-poly batteries, and all the cables and fasteners I needed. Over the coming weeks the parts trickled in. Finally once the whole kit had arrived, I assembled everything, connected the TTL serial, built the firmware, downloaded it to the controller, and like the brilliant software engineer I am, plugged in the batteries on my bench at home.Nothing happened. Those of you who have blown off fingers wondering why the firecracker under the Coke can hasn&#39;t exploded yet can guess what I did next.I examined the chassis closely and began fiddling with the cables and connectors. Again, like the brilliant software NOT HARDWARE engineer that I am.Evidently, I fixed the problem. Which caused four gigantic propellers to begin whirling around my hands and face. And four brushless electric motors to emit their usual high-pitched whine, which today I instinctively hear as them saying to me &#34;You god damned idiot. You are so ours.&#34;I was not injured. But that evening, I came close to slicing at least a couple things off my body. I hadn&#39;t appreciated the scale of the thing I was building, or the inherent risk in debugging it once I&#39;d slapped it all together. I shelved the project for years, eventually giving it to someone at work who claimed to know his stuff when it came to drones. I hear he&#39;s doing fine.Disclaimer: this story isn&#39;t about code or my own code. But I think it fits here because I approached dangerous hardware with the &#34;build, run, see what happens&#34; mindset of a software developer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few random thoughts here:* some better tools for searching, tagging, tracking my history, etc to allow me to better use and self organize their docs on &#39;mdn plus&#39; would be a useful service.  it may also give them some more insight on how people are using it and what areas are of bigger utilization.* tools to allow me to ask private questions in areas of their docs, with some prioritization for answers/responses.* IDE plugins - I think there&#39;s one for IntelliJ Ultimate, but not specifically from MDN.  Having more direct access to MDN info while inside my IDEs would be something probably worth paying for.  I suspect they may get some useful data on when/where people are having trouble.  I wouldn&#39;t even mind contributing some of my source code snippets back from within the IDE if it would help give more examples to MDN.* a couple years back, a friend started a podcast experiment of just reading MDN docs for javascript.  It was... a bit different, but trying out some other formats for their docs.  perhaps a Q&amp;A podcast where mdn folks answer some of the answers (taken from the paid-Q&amp;A bullet point above).  (but yeah, they fired a bunch of people last year, no?)$2-$3/month, if there were/are nicer tools to help me track what I&#39;ve seen, perhaps letting me add private annotations so when I come back I can jog my own memory... I would try that, at least for a while (I think I&#39;d get use out of that).  $10/month - for just some &#39;premium&#39; content?  Probably not.  $50/year would, for me, probably be an upper bound (unless/until I see more potential benefits).EDIT: had not seen &#39;down below&#39; - they have &#39;Bookmark and annotate free and paid content for reference across devices.&#39; as a feature - possibly along the lines of what I was thinking above.  Signed up for waitlist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish they’d clarify if the money is used to support MDN or not. I wouldn’t be opposed to supporting MDN patreon style, and if it comes with “perks” like articles, sure, why not. But I would do this to support MDNs core documentation, not because I’m dying for technical deep dives.That said $10/mo is a bit steep for me. And in any event, if they don’t make explicit that the money goes to support MDN upkeep and development then it’s a nonstarter. I’m not giving Mozilla money to fritter away on another rebrand or whatever else they want to use it for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obviously it would be nice if everything everywhere was always free, but docs and opensource suffer a lot from lack of sustainability when based on voluntary donations. Companies simply have no incentives to pay for anything.There are surely tens of thousands of companies worldwide, whose employees rely on MDN on a daily basis. There are poor startups among them, but many of those companies have pretty deep pockets. If just a small percentage of those employees ask their bosses for this $5/mo. sub, this can improve things considerably. For now everything is free, so no one has an incentive, or a way, to pay.As developers, we are collectively guilty for never asking our employees for anything which costs $$$. Many of us (me including) assume that asking for a few bucks sub is almost a crime. Or we don&#39;t want to deal with stupid bureaucracy and an arcane process to set up the sub.Personally I hope the experiment will work. Let&#39;s see in a few months.I think the best model would be something like: subscribers get the premium content immediately, other people with a few weeks/months delay. This would keep a healthy balance and keep the incentives in place for people to pay."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kinda off topic but I&#39;m curious, what&#39;s the proper strategy to adopt as a company when someone copies your product and distribute it legally for free? Do nothing (individuals &amp; small companies that are going to self host the product were never your market anyway)? Offer a self-hosted plan too? Obviously it depends for each company. I wonder if there are companies who famously changed their offer following the release of a free/self-hosted/open-source competing product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks more featured than Seatable I was looking into.
A few questions on features and plans:1. Are all the views mobile friendly,2. Any plan for a map view,3. Multiple views in a page? (aka dashboard)4. How does AGPL affect getting payed to create a solution based on this? I&#39;m not talking about offering it as a service as is  as happens with elastic, redis and the cloud providers.5. How do we create plugins?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At a large site I used to work for circa 2011, before everyone had gone fully HTTPS, we received similar panicked reports from users: &#34;I&#39;m logged in as someone else!&#34;  Turns out an ISP in the Philippines decided to just ignore `cache-control` and `vary` headers and forcibly started caching logged-in responses along with auth cookies. Bad times. Made it clear to me why the whole web would have to go HTTPS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Klarna is no stranger to criminally lax attitude towards data privacy and security. In Finland, they implemented a checkout flow based only on your SSN (personal ID number). By simply entering someone else&#39;s SSN (which is not hard to guess/pry) you can reveal anyone&#39;s official home address.Further, they enable a &#34;pay later by invoice&#34; checkout flow, again by just knowing someone&#39;s SSN. Scammers use this to order items from web stores to automated pick-up lockers with someone&#39;s else&#39;s SSN for payment info. The victim usually only becomes aware about this activity when they start getting debt collection notices for unpaid invoices from multiple stores for thousands and thousands of euros. The debt collection process in Finland is famously unfair and harsh towards the supposed &#34;debtor&#34; (here: victim of fraud).Unless the &#34;debtor&#34; (victim) actively opposes each and every individual collection, the cases will eventually end up in court with summary judgement. This will ruin the victim&#39;s credit rating, which has devastating results for just about all aspects of life. People are known to have collapsed under the burden of all this and ended up taking their own life.Klarna&#39;s response to all this is that they want convenient checkout experience and some fraud is unavoidable. Although there are excellent technical means available to strongly identify users in Finland, they add a minor layer of inconvenience compared to just typing in your SSN. This is OK for Klarna since they give exactly zero fucks about security as long as they can make a little buck from it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in a project over 10 years ago where something very similar happened!We had built and authentication service that, among other things, was used by a SyncML service that was used back in the day of feature phones to syncs contacts etc. You can imagine that getting someone else&#39;s contacts on your phone isn&#39;t exactly ideal. This was how we came to know about the problem, from customers getting other customers data!The error was caused by a CDN switch. Our instructions to the the CDN team responsible for the switch was &#34;Make sure the CDN honors our cache headers, if our HTTP responses say something can be cached do so, if they say that the response should not be cached then don&#39;t&#34;. We were in at least three meetings where we repeated this mantra.I believe that the CDN team thought that they had setup the CDN correctly but they had missed an edge case. The CDN was in fact setup to cache even uncacheable responses, and served those, _only_ when it could not reach our servers.So if there was a traffic spike and the CDN determined that our authentication servers were unreachable it would fall back to serving data that should never have been cached in the first place! Happily returning tokens to random users that had authenticated just before the traffic spike..."</p>

It was the first book I got as a kid due to my dad loving it, and Mum sewed me a little toy which was my favourite toy for many years.It the became a “thing” where it was the first book we got for every kid born in my extended family, and now that I have my own kids 40+ years later it was the first I got for them too. They both know it by rote, have the toys, had the bed sheets, everything. They’re now in the early years of school and still absolutely love the story and have the posters in their rooms despite them being “old” for it.RIP Eric. You’ve left an amazing mark on the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are very few justifications for the existence of Twitter but one is undoubtedly Eric Carle&#39;s feed.   He posted new drawings for every holiday.https://twitter.com/ericcarle?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcam..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not to downplay the cultural importance of The Very Hungry Caterpillar – but can I suggest another one of Eric Carle&#39;s books?It&#39;s called &#34;Pancakes, Pancakes!&#34; In it, the protagonist wants to eat some pancakes – but he discovers that in order to do so, he needs to harvest and mill some wheat, milk a cow and churn some butter, and so forth.I read this to my kids when they were little, and it struck me as actually a pretty good lesson about how much work goes on outside of our house, in order to make Saturday Pancakes possible. But it&#39;s not presented in a preachy way at all – more of an excited way, like &#34;isn&#39;t it interesting how much background work goes into Saturday Pancakes?&#34;.I credit that book with getting my kids interested in food/cooking and much more than that as well – the seed of thinking about what has to happen for an Amazon box to show up at your door with a particular gizmo.So I&#39;ll pour out some pancake batter for Eric Carle on Saturday morning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I look forward to USB 4.1a Type C.2 Phase iii.b Gen 3E and the 482646282 different cable capability combinations that all plug in and have no distinction of those capabilities whatsoever. I also look forward to all the necessary and helpful posts telling me how the identical ports on my laptop are in fact diffferent despite their identical appearance.But at least everything uses the same plug, so that’s nice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"USB-C bashing threads represent the &#39;HN echo chamber&#39; for me. :)I understand the problems of different cables, I&#39;ve run into them already. One cable can do Thunderbolt, the other cannot. One cable transmits 4K video signal, the others doesn&#39;t transmit anything. And so on.However, it is sooooo much better than anything before because at least _most of the time_ stuff works. Chargers charge. Sometimes slower, sometimes faster, but things mostly work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I genuinely don’t understand how I’ve managed to be so lucky. That is, I absolutely do not disbelieve the many tales of woe I hear on HN (like the many in this thread) - but I’ve literally never put any thought into what cable I plug in to what device, and had no trouble that I can recall. It really had lived up to its hype for me so far.My USB-C devices are: a wireless charger, two MacBooks (one intel, one m1), a Pixelbook, Nintendo Switch, Oculus Quest and Quest 2, iPad Pro, and the charging case of some earphones… I think that’s everything. Oh, and my partner’s phone and headphones too.Anyway - I’ve cables and chargers dotted around the house, plus some A-C ones for use with power bricks - and never had any grief powering/charging any device from any of them. What am I doing right? I’m definitely not only plugging Apple devices into Apple cables and so on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting tidbit: the hash they have for the infringed work it&#39;s the correct hash for ubuntu-20.04.2.0-desktop-amd64.iso [0] - this removes any good faith argument on their part.There is an infinitely small chance of collisions - but I would like them to produce a DMCA notice with the actual name of the infringed upon protected media, not just the hash.I believe Canonical should step in, since this is someone claiming to act to protect their interests.[0] https://torrent.ubuntu.com/tracker_indexEdit: searching for the hash returns two odd links; the first one is indexed by Google as a link to a software - Rebirth - that comes under the same hash as Ubuntu [1]; the other is the usual Lumen link for removed content [2] -- a DMCA notice from Disney.Could this be a case of &#34;automated DMCA notice&#34; gone wrong?[1] https://kat.rip/torrent/4ba4fbf7231a3a660e86892707d25c135533...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One doesn&#39;t know how stressful and infuriating these copyright notices are until one lived in a country with internet hijacked by copyright predators. From the moment of receiving such notice there is only stress, misinformation, and verbal abuse. Thanks Americans.PS. It doesn&#39;t matter you downloaded free software, every person you&#39;ll contact in the process of straightening this out will be equally clueless and abusive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If companies which send copyright notices had to pay a hefty fine for each mistake they make, online world would be a bit of better place.Also the victim should receive a reasonable indemnization, as a way to encourage sharing of content."</p>
