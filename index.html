								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d love to use ClearURLs, though last I checked it had a major flaw: it allows arbitrary code execution by the provider of the filter list. Among other things, it can redirect script URLs to arbitrary sources, and the filter list is periodically updated from a GitLab page, which enables the filter list provider to perform a targeted attack by serving a malicious filter list to a specific device.The only filter list provider is the extension maintainer, so this information should be safe to share. I have not had the time to set up a PoC, but I&#39;m confident that the filter rules are way too powerful.At the very minimum, the current filter list should be included in the extension package rather than periodically updated from a remote URL. That way the filter list can be audited and must pass a review, without having a negative impact on the effectiveness of the extension, since the filter list does not appear to frequently change.https://github.com/ClearURLs/Addon/wiki/Ruleshttps://gitlab.com/anti-tracking/ClearURLs/ruleshttps://kevinroebert.gitlab.io/ClearUrls/data/data.minify.js..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminded me of a library I released in January 2005.  Part of the embedded docs from the 2011 release:    ;;; The @b{urlskip} Racket library provides a function that translates some of
    ;;; the Web URLs that might be used to track a user across sites, by removing
    ;;; intermediate HTTP redirectors or information that might identify the user.
    ;;; Such a function might be used as part of a privacy-enhancing Web browser,
    ;;; or to canonicalize or un-obfuscate URLs for Web analysis projects.
    ;;;
    ;;; Note that @b{urlskip} is not intended to remove information used by
    ;;; ``affiliate&#39;&#39; referral programs to identify site operators that have sent
    ;;; users to a site.  However, in some cases this affiliate ID information
    ;;; might be lost in the process of removing a intermediary URL that is used by
    ;;; a third party to track and profile users.

It had special-case handlers for various URL server authorities and the paths under them.  So, for    http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=AAA&amp;creative=111&amp;camp=222\
    &amp;link_code=bn1&amp;path=asin/b333

it was coded to preserve only certain query parameters, like:     http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?tag=AAA&amp;path=asin/b333

A lot of the cases it handled were redirectors, which usually meant only the target URL, which was usually in a query parameter, but might be in the path, and might or might not be URL-escaped.  So, for example,    http://www.google.com/url?sa=l&amp;q=http://www.shopping.com/xGS-AAA_BBB~NS\
    -1~linkin_id-111&amp;ai=REALLYLONGNONSENSESTRING&amp;num=3

would skip the redirector, to be simply:     http://www.shopping.com/xGS-AAA_BBB~NS-1~linkin_id-111

I was going to link here to the code of `urlskip`, but it&#39;s no longer in the package repository where it used to be.  (I added a lot of libraries to that repository, and don&#39;t recall whether there was some reason to remove this particular library.)  It was a pretty niche library, and in a fringe language, so its impact might&#39;ve only been as an example, pointing out that this could be done, and some rules for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like the developer may be in the EU. If they offer the add-on as a business, it may be worth looking at if any of the internet rights legal groups will help take the case up under the 2019 EU platform rules.https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32...These make various requirements around how Google act, and include requirements around removing products from platforms.As an aside, it seems crazy that we allow platforms to take action when in positions of such clear conflict of interest, but that seems to be the way of the tech sector."</p>

Apparently, a basic google search is too difficult for HR.Second, it says this:
&#34;On March 9th, we added extra protections for this employee, including actioning content that mentioned the employee’s name or shared personal information on third-party sites, which we reserve for serious cases of harassment and doxxing.&#34;OK, and they _still_ didn&#39;t check why people were opposed to this person? Still no Internet search or, oh, reading the comments people were posting?Notice that this &#34;protection&#34; was two weeks ago, not recently."</p>

It&#39;s baffling how they&#39;re doubling down on defending her after her previous actions.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The whole point of &#34;not splitting&#34; is a lesson learned in 2014, to continue showing support for the goals no matter the methods seen in protest. Nobody knew whether another in the group is an agent provocateur or a genuine radical. Nobody knew who were throwing the molotovs. Nobody even thought that the protest was likely achieve any its goals. The only thing that could not be faked is the sheer volume of people showing up; nobody could pay that many people to show up at a protest.Therefore the only thing they could do is to keep showing up in support of the demands for as long as they could personally afford to do so, and try not to pay attention to the methods of others when they already knew that all methods were probably going to fail."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great solution to a problem that seems to becoming more prevalent. Reminder to devs that bolted on third party scripts should not be in the critical path. Meaning, if you are doing something like capturing a click event in a Google analytics handler and blocking the redirect until you’ve tracked the click - you’re going to have a bad time. Many tracking scripts are designed for this and will gracefully/silently fail via something like an array push mechanism but I’ve encountered the opposite as well.Being an indie dev with a pihole setup has been tough - I’ve gotta turn it off a lot for various client projects - but it’s also helped me build more resilient applications that work just as well for people who don’t have trackers enabled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The SmartBlock stand-ins are bundled with Firefox: no actual third-party content from the trackers are loaded at all, so there is no chance for them to track you this way.Those third party scripts may not be able to track, but I wonder if the act of loading the stand-in scripts quickly (?) from within Firefox would lead to other issues.&gt; We also want to acknowledge the NoScript and uBlock Origin teams for helping to pioneer this approach.Not to belittle the effort by others and other projects, but these two extensions, along with some others (like Privacy Badger), have helped users immensely in protecting themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Next step (please): block all 1x1 sized images.The transparent pixel tracking trick is common enough now that it should be blocked by default in all &#39;Private&#39; modes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"AMP exists not because it&#39;s impossible to build fast web sites without it, but because it&#39;s possible to build slow web sites without it. Which means most big sites not using AMP are slow because most places don&#39;t have direct incentives for keeping their stuff fast. Against all odds, AMP convinced these sites to build an alternative experience that&#39;s reasonably fast. It&#39;s good that AMP is no longer required to get good rankings for fast pages. That was always a silly requirement. But from a user&#39;s point of view, I&#39;m grateful for AMP, despite that being an unpopular opinion around here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Usually the answer is &#34;no&#34; to any question in a headline. My answer is &#34;I sure hope so&#34;.AMP launched in 2015. At that time, Larry Page was CEO, Eric Schmidt was Chairman and David Drummond was the Chief Legal Officer. I don&#39;t know how any of them signed off on AMP.Giving advantageous ranking (including, but not limited to, showing AMP content in Top Stories) is the very definition of using your market power in one area (search) to force publishers to adopt something else you created.For a company that is (or should be) very careful about attracting antitrust attention from the US/EU, this seems completely reckless.And what is the upside for Google here? Fast pages? That seems like one hell of a gamble.And on the user side? I, as a user, absolutely hate AMP and wish I could opt out.I have poor vision so use larger fonts on iOS. AMP pages routinely render with the edge of pages cropped off and you can&#39;t scroll so here so this happens to me way too often:1. Click on a link2. Get an AMP page3. Can&#39;t read the page, click back4. Force touch the link to bring up the preview of the page, which is the non-AMP version5. Click on that preview to get the non-AMP page.Why is this still an issue? Why can&#39;t I just get this version of the page always? It&#39;s ludicrous.But I honestly don&#39;t know why Google pushed so hard on AMP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sure hope it is the end of AMP (even though it was launched by a close friend of mine at Google).Quite honestly, the concept never really made any sense to me, and often the load speeds were just as poor as the original website itself.One thing that really bugged me was how disorientating it was for the user; on some AMP pages, you literally could not tell if you were on a legitimate website or some spoofed version. The AMP bar at the top was about as trashy a UI design as I&#39;ve seen since 1997. And, God help you if you wanted to share the link - it was hard to know if the AMP link would be &#34;persistent&#34; or &#34;sticky&#34; enough to share, or whether you should go to the actual underlying web page (which the AMP bar did a great job of hiding) and share that.But what is most annoying of all is that smart people at Google were kidding themselves that their botched up implementation of AMP was a great thing to have launched upon the world. It really was not. I bet it didn&#39;t really do much for their bottom line either."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These secret scanning integrations have been very helpful. We had a client ask to take a project open source recently that had started a few years ago as closed source. We of course checked over the current version of the code and have had linters in place to look for secrets for a while but not in the very early days of the project. In that one codebase we had:- AWS IAM token for S3 upload access to a throwaway dev bucket. The bucket had already been deleted but still... Got an email about it informing me the IAM token had been revoked by AWS within 5 minutes- A Slack webhook notification URL/secret. Committed as a example on a working branch and then git rm&#39;ed but still active. Got an email about it and token revoked by Slack automatically within 5 minutes.- A Mapbox API token. This one was funny. The token was indeed in there and functional but was in the docs/sample code for a dependency. Still, we got an email within the hour about it and were able to investigate.Edit: In this case we intentionally kept the commit history. A safer alternative (and one we normally practice) is to start a fresh repo for the open source variant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI pypi tokens look like pypi-9NX39cdNn0AH1cCl1bMT48eKzf4Rhvw1mipk1FZTPrpR9The integration means that GitHub knows to recognize this format, and calls some API of pypi.org when it finds one so PyPI can revoke it.As always, please allow me to lament that we don&#39;t have a standard for this, such as secret-token:pypi.org/9NX39cdNn0AH1cCl1bMT48eKzf4Rhvw1mipk1FZTPrpR9, which would let any system know that this string is a secret and that pypi.org should be notified (for example via POST pypi.org/.well-know/compromised-secret).

There are even some things that Gnome does better than  Mac OS.Now, you might not like Gnome and that&#39;s perfectly fine. Fortunately, Linux is the land of choice and there is an alternative for every person. It baffles me to come here and read so much negativity! Come on! this is a big milestone for a community that has been working a lot to bring you something of quality for free! They have been doing this for decades already and they have put a lot of effort and love into this. How many open source projects fail to abandonment after just a few months?Why is it that so many people in internet communities such as HN can&#39;t take a minute to appreciate the effort and instead the only thing that they are motivated to do is to nit-pick something and trash. Criticism is always welcome, there are even some appropriate channels to do it, but seriously why is this the only thing that you are able to say about a community driven product? Why is there only space for negativity? Why not a small &#34;thanks&#34; or &#34;I liked that feature&#34; before your criticism? They are bringing this thing for you for free, why can&#39;t you at least say something nice?"</p>

This should save the file, not filter the directory listing.Also, I don’t want it to default to overwriting some file I saved last week."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can somebody please just make a NUC-type device that I can purchase as a unit with the following included:  Rasberry PI 8GB + WiFi + Bluetooth
  NVMe &gt;= 128gb
  Power supply appropriate for PI+NVMe (3.5A perhaps?)
  Case with appropriate cooling
  Ubuntu &gt;= 20.04

I would pay up to $200 USD for such a product. Why not an intel NUC? Because I want to leave this on 24/7 and run various cron jobs etc, so I want the low-power ARM chip.Yes I can build it myself, but shopping for, gathering all the parts etc is time consuming and I&#39;d rather be writing my apps etc to run on the device instead...EDIT: formatting"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, the increased perf is nice, but what I really want is increased longevity.  IME, microSD is a poor fit for hosting a R/W filesystem.  Every time my Pi based systems have gone down, it&#39;s due to a faulty microSD.  I was using well rated microSD cards and they still died relatively quickly(months, not years).I suspect they&#39;d be fine if I was running a read-only rootfs, but with a lot of the applications I run(i.e. HomeAssistant) you need R/W capability."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been following all of these jeffgeerling.com posts - very interesting and informative and I appreciate all of this work he is doing.However, I continue to be frustrated in actually procuring a compute module 4 of my own.All of the suppliers are either out of stock or require an order of 200+.  I recently placed an order for 2x CM4008032 from Digi-Key but it is on back order and who knows when it will actually ship.Am I the only one having these problems procuring CM4 ?"</p>
