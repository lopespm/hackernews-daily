								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Robin Hobb is one of my favorite authors. Her masterwork is a series of series (four trilogies and a quadrology) known as The Realm of the Elderlings.She published the first trilogy, which begins with Assassin&#39;s Apprentice, starting in 1995. I saw the books when they first came out and I assumed from the title and the cover that it would be a cheesy fantasy by the numbers, so I never bought it. But I kept hearing about these books from other people who liked SFF, so I finally picked up the first trilogy.I was completely wrong. It&#39;s not at all by the numbers. While it&#39;s not trope-free (nothing is), there are all sorts of interesting ideas, from the political to ecological. As you read the later series, the world opens up quite a bit, and it gets even more interesting. The final trilogy brings so many elements together, and the ending is shatteringly powerful.While this is epic fantasy, it&#39;s _not_ at all grimdark. Bad things definitely happen, but it&#39;s more hopeful and humane than something like Malazan or Song of Ice and Fire.I can&#39;t recommend these books highly enough. Even if her writing is slowing down, I hope that she&#39;s satisfied with what she&#39;s done. This series alone is an enormous accomplishment. To build a world across so many books, across so many years, and have it come together so well in the end is massively impressive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"70?  My animal is only 33 and is very tired.  Writing this as it lays in bed, 3 in the afternoon, because even a standard chair sounds more exhausting to it.It seems to have no motivation or energy to do much besides lay here.If I force it, it will get stuff done but at a huge cost.  It will yearn the entire time to just lay back down.It&#39;s interest in things seems to be fading quickly.  What desire it used to have to work hard and succeed, has slipped away.  It seems these days it has only enough energy to lay in bed and scroll through the internet.  Not sure what is wrong with my animal, but this is no way for it to live.I was hard on the animal in its early 20s, but no harder than the average animal.  The past 7 years or so have actually been pretty calm, good food, semi regular exercise,  stable job, etc.It&#39;s scary to imagine how the animal would feel at 70 if this is how it feels at 33.  Maybe the pandemic was a straw to its back, and the isolation has worn it down more than anything else possibly could."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Better food, more exercise, more relaxation... but I also wonder if it would have made any difference.Yes. I&#39;m only half OP&#39;s age but working out and eating well (well for me means much more) has made all the little aches I started to have in my 20s go away and made me much calmer, I can also sleep pretty much anywhere and at any time.More interestingly though,Me, and the animal I live inside.there is no animal you live inside, this is not a meat vehicle for something else, your body is you, it&#39;s not some machine you merely inhabit. Its/your gut will affect your mood, its limitations are your limitations, being physically strong will make you feel strong and keep anxieties at bay."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interestingly, there is an embedded video in that article that explains the issue specific to the automotive shortage - it&#39;s because the automotive industry cancelled a lot of chip orders in anticipation of low vehicle demand and that caused chip makers to reduce their production for the kinds of chips that go into cars, and now it takes time to ramp back up:https://www.cnbc.com/video/2021/03/02/how-the-global-compute...It&#39;s at the 4m15s part of the videoI think a facepalm is in order."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding cars:&#34;Some carmakers are now leaving out high-end features as a result of the chip shortage, according to a Bloomberg report on Thursday.Nissan is reportedly leaving navigation systems out of cars that would normally have them, while Ram Trucks has stopped equipping its 1500 pickups with a standard “intelligent” rearview mirror that monitors for blind spots&#34;I have an unpopular opinion, especially when we start to look at the increase of safety features and increase in pedestrian injuries, that we may be better off going back to smaller trucks designed for good visibility and less reliance on features.
(bias: I drive a 16 year old wagon, and feel panicked around bicycling with what feels like more trucks in the US)---&#34;Hertz said it is “supplementing” its fleet “by purchasing low-mileage, preowned vehicles” from auctions and dealerships.&#34;I find it wild that just a year ago Hertz filed for bankruptcy [0] and was selling vehicles by end of year [1].[0]: https://www.cnn.com/2020/05/22/business/hertz-bankruptcy/ind...[1]: https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/companies/hertz-must-offload..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you have a taste for irony, my company makes critical components for semiconductor equipment. If we can&#39;t ship, they can&#39;t ship. If they can&#39;t ship, semiconductor fabs can&#39;t increase capacity to meet the demand and solve the shortage.We went line down last week due to shortage of a critical chip for our component.In reality, the shortage is likely self-inflicted, like toilet paper a year ago, but for whatever combination of real demand + hoarding, we can&#39;t get them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Classically trained pianist here (since 7 years old), I like the article&#39;s advice.&gt; Use the correct fingering, dynamics, articulation, etc. from the very beginning; you are never going to get around to “fixing” it later.When I was an impatient kid my piano teachers would keep insisting I play sections slow on a first pass, which annoyed me (it was like reading a book out loud slowly), but it was only until many years later when I played pieces like Un Sospiro[0] which are intractable if you do not start practicing at something like 16 times slower than performance tempo.  If you start out correctly, the rest will follow, and IME, sight reading greatly improves as well.&gt; [...] you may reach a point where you can’t play any faster, no matter how hard you try. What is likely happening is that the hand motions you are using—which come naturally at the slower tempo you started with—simply will not work at such high speeds.This is completely true, for instance, in ragtime, the left hand makes big, quick jumps and there is often no time to look at where it will land (which one likely does when playing slowly), so repeating a bar over and over again to incrementally refine your distance estimate is crucial.This applies to things like typing on a keyboard as well, if you focus on correct finger placement (and correct use of the 4th and 5th fingers), your WPM might take a hit for a few days or a week, but in the long term it really helps.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po_a1SmZKLs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Indian classical dancer here.&gt; Do not work on this section for more than twenty minutes.This is not something I&#39;ve heard often in my field but I had to learn this over the years. Performers want to present a piece as if it was never practiced and was all made up on the spot, and yet we do have to practice a piece day after day. Losing vitality and &#34;becoming rehearsed&#34; through over-practice is a real problem.The book &#34;A Soprano on Her Head&#34; by Eloise Ristad, who was a piano teacher, really helped me with my dance &amp; acting practice. I restructured a lot based on that book (added improvisational elements, reduced forceful drill-like elements, more self-observation, less verbal cues), and my technique and enjoyment both improved a lot during covid lockdown. She also wrote a book called &#34;Bold Beginnings&#34; for teaching piano using a new method that she made up, but I&#39;ve not been able to find a copy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been learning guitar and ive been amazed at how bad lessons and education is for adult students. The apps i have used barely work and are extremely unambitious.Classes are so disorganized and i am constantly wading through material that is a mile wide but a foot deep.Yes i have seen Justin Guitar I&#39;m not a huge fan. I dont want to have to wade through content to find the exercises that are relevant to me. I think Duolingo has an interesting approach to this, where has you re-visit concepts every day and it tells you what to practice to reduce decision fatigue.I want a dashboard that is keeping track of my goals and progress akd has an opinionated way for me to measure my skill, and to direct my effort."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve wondered what the effect our modern digital economy has had on consumer price inflation.Normally, an increase in money supply would cause consumer goods to increase in price, since more people are able to buy them and there is a limit on how much of any particular physical good is available.This isn&#39;t the case, however, for digital goods. If there are suddenly 100 million new people who want to buy a Netflix subscription, it isn&#39;t like we are going to see the price of a Netflix subscription go up because there isn&#39;t enough Netflix to go around. The marginal cost for a new subscriber is practically zero, so there should be no price increase caused by a shortage.It would be easy to see that inflation would be essentially zero if ALL goods people wanted to buy were digital ones... no amount of demand can eat up the supply, since supply is practically infinite.Of course, in the real world, some goods are digital and some are physical. If you gave everyone $5000, some of that would go to Netflix subscriptions, which wouldn&#39;t effect consumer prices, and some would go to buying TVs to play Netflix on, which WOULD cause inflation.I am curious how much of our current &#34;low inflation even with an increasing money supply&#34; is caused by our increasing spending on non-exclusionary goods."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This chart in the expense share of a typical income illustrates a number of issues well, but healthcare stands out like crazy: https://mobile.twitter.com/_cingraham/status/123195012984367...College, transportation and housing are all pretty high overall, but the healthcare share is just stunning. If we were looking at dramatically better outcomes or services, fine. Unfortunately, doctors get to see patients for less and less time, billing is going up and you don’t really see anything in return. Most other developed nations put a stop to this a long time ago…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get the argument from the fed about hedonic adjustments and increased quality of life, but that&#39;s not how people measure their happiness. Subjective happiness is how you&#39;re doing relative to those around you. The hedonic adjustments are all about objective quality of life. Sure, my resources in my working class midwest neighborhood would be the envy of Louis XVI&#39;s court, but that doesn&#39;t matter to me when my neighbor gets a new car.I wonder how difficult it would be to build a &#34;Subjective Inflation&#34; measure that was useful. Based on category consumption by income quintile you can figure out rough price inflation experienced. With the understanding that happiness is mostly about keeping up with the Joneses you can just assume away the hedonic quality boost and call it &#34;subjective inflation&#34;.The point from the inflation link about not being to eat ipads is critical. Increased resources are definitely nice, but the happiness derived from them is zero-sum, and at the end of the day they&#39;re taking more of my income.This, coupled with the stagnation of median wages, means that:    We&#39;re not getting any happier as a cohort, and

    The things we consume cost a bigger chunk of our earnings every year

I buy the link&#39;s argument that we should expect price inflation. Interestingly, this analysis is done with mostly pre-COVID data. COVID has amplified all these trends leading to price-inflation, and narrowed our demand into fewer goods and services. That further amplifies the inflationary forces that were already gearing up to make the 20&#39;s crazy.Buckle up. There&#39;s going to be a lot of people who feel like their quality of life is crashing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something like this is so sorely needed.I&#39;ve been doing some work in ag-tech for the past few years (having previously worked in ISP/telco, general SME web/mobile development, then consumer travel tech).The tools available to farmers/growers for what should be quite basic things - i.e., web-connected weather stations and monitoring systems for soil moisture, frost alarms and irrigation control are terrible.The industry is full of small players who take a look and think &#34;I know how to build stuff with [Arduino/Raspberry Pi/Zigbee etc], I can build an ag-tech monitoring/control product easily&#34;.So everyone builds a hardware product from scratch, then as a quick afterthought, a web app with an SQL database and Highcharts to show data graphs. You have an MVP within a few months, then a few paying customers in your local community, then suddenly your customers start asking for features you&#39;d never thought of, like sensor inputs you didn&#39;t know existed, or combined displays of different kinds of data you&#39;d never considered anyone would want, or needing it to be faster (SQL turns out to be really slow for this kind of data) or more reliable (bugfixing is hard when your devices are hundreds of miles away and connected via weak 3G/4G data links), and you realise your hardware and software architecture doesn&#39;t support any of this, and you&#39;d have to completely start over to actually deliver something that customers really need, but you&#39;re out of money and energy.The result is a lot of farmers/growers dissatisfied/frustrated at never being able to get the monitoring systems they need (some of them having tried 3+ different vendors), and a lot of new companies trying to build new solutions and going bust.I&#39;ve been thinking there needs to be some widely accepted open standards in the industry for hardware and software platforms, so solutions providers can avoid trying to re-invent everything and instead focus on integration of tried-and-true building blocks.If this initiative brings that about, it would be a big win for everyone in the industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of interest to me because I have been doing agricultural process monitoring and production control systems for about 30 years. And most of my clients&#39; systems are at least semi-custom and re-invent wheels for no other purpose other than to do it their way; that is, silos (pun not intended). But where NDAs and IP agreements allow, I have attempted to standardize some architectures.But was disappointing to see the way the LF is organizing this - no representation from the ag industry&#39;s heavy hitters and no specific and attainable goals.Should this be done by an Operating Systems organization? Other than centralized control and logistical systems, ag engineering is not the realm of microprocessors and operating systems, and code monkeys. Ag engineering is a world of hardware, micro-controllers, FSMs, and scheduler stacks.But then, if not the LF, whom has the organization to do this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is a ridiculous feature of modern C that you have to write the super verbose &#34;mask and shift&#34; code, which then gets compiled to a simple `mov` and maybe a `bswap`. Wheras, the direct equivalent in C, an assignment with a (type changing) cast, is illegal. There is a huge mismatch between the assumptions of the C spec and actual machine code.One of the few reasons I ever even reached to C is the ability to slurp in data and reinterpret it as a struct, or the ability to reason in which registers things will show up and mix in some `asm` with my C.I think there should really be a dialect of C(++) where the machine model is exactly the physical machine. That doesn&#39;t mean the compiler can&#39;t do optimizations, but it shouldn&#39;t do things like prove code as UB and fold everything to a no-op. (Like when you defensively compare a pointer to NULL that according to spec must not be NULL, but practically could be...)`-fno-strict-overflow -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks` gets you halfway there, but it would really only be viable if you had a blessed `-std=high-level-assembler` or `-std=friendly-c` flag."</p>

This was very useful to me recently as I had to write the marshaling and un-marshaling for a game networking format with hundreds of messages. With primitives like this, you can see what&#39;s going on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why, in 2021, the mantra that C is a good language for these low level byte twiddling tasks needs to die. Dealing with alignment and endianness properly requires a language that allows you to build abstractions.The following is perfectly well defined in C++, despite looking like almost the same as the original unsafe C:    #include &lt;boost/endian.hpp&gt;
    #include &lt;cstdio&gt;
    using namespace boost::endian;

    unsigned char b[5] = {0x80,0x01,0x02,0x03,0x04};

    int main() {
        uint32_t x = *((big_uint32_t*)(b+1));
        printf(&#34;%08x\n&#34;, x);
    }

Note that I deliberately misaligned the pointer by adding 1.https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/5416oefjx[Edit] Fun twist: the above code doesn&#39;t work where the intermediate variable x is removed because printf itself is not type safe, so no type conversion (which is when the bswap is deferred to) happens. In pure C++ when using a type safe formatting function (like fmt or iostreams) this wouldn&#39;t happen. printf will let you throw any garbage in to it. tl;dr outside embedded use cases writing C in 2021 is fucking nuts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, this is a really cool concept and I look forward to the determination if it is true or testable.I find the &#34;double copy of other forces&#34; verbiage to be difficult to follow. Walking through a formula example would be helpful, and formaluae exist to communicate exactly this kind of clumpy-wumpy-lumpy-timey-wimey awkwardness language clods through in its quest to communicate mathematical structures."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This probably isn&#39;t the right place for this question. But the right kind of people will be reading this thread so I will ask it.In college physics my teacher insisted that, despite gravity being popularly referred to as a force, it is not a force. Weight is indeed a force, but gravity is more like a field. I understood it like this: Say you have a point mass in an isolated system. There is certainly gravity all around that mass, but there are no forces anywhere in the system. Not until another mass is introduced into the system do you have any forces. It is apparent from the formula for force since then you have that new mass times the acceleration of gravity.Or is this just being pedantic and does it even matter?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone needs to do a better visual explanation of these particle interactions. If you can describe it mathematically then surely you can create a computer simulation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For data center operators the choice between AMD and Intel in this space comes down to power efficiency.Ignoring the performance improvements for real workloads, the #1 driving factor is performance per watt. By going with AMD that metric improves ~2x over comparable Intel offerings.There are facilities where physical space to expand is available but the building has effectively run out of additional power that can be provided by the utility company.Scaling up on performance per watt is the last frontier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And, in my opinion, its only going to get worse if Intel doesnt sober up and address the elephant in the room:  Hyperthreading.Without serious reform to the design of the Intel X86 chip to eliminate and refactor what basically amounts to a performance-before-safety feature, Intel is going to see the lions share of performance hits.  Eventually people will tire of writing backflip code to sidestep pitfalls in the Intel HT design and simply return the responsibility to Intel, where its existed since day one.It could be argued Intels mouthpiece has already lost its ability to convince major datacenter and cloud customers that HT is even remotely safe as a continued investment.  Intel needs a new X86."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s stopping more people from moving cloud workloads to AMD? Unless you&#39;re running a rickety legacy application using Intel features you&#39;ll instantly save money by moving to AMD.Both my work and all my side projects have moved to AMD instances where available, except for some legacy on-prem stuff."</p>
