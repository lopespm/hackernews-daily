								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used the JIT version recently on a new landing page with code completion for class names in my IDE and found it great. The distance between what I&#39;m picturing in my head and what I have to type to see that on the screen felt so much shorter and less fatiguing than the standard CSS approach.With the regular way, to style something that&#39;s probably not going to appear elsewhere, I&#39;m having to: come up with class names, annotate the HTML with them, repeat some of this annotating in a CSS file, jump back and forth between files to tweak the styles, use the web inspector to figure out which CSS class is overriding another then jump to the right CSS file to fix it etc.Tailwind classes are also faster to type and flip between when you&#39;re experimenting (e.g. editing &#34;mt-5&#34; to &#34;pb-3&#34; vs &#34;margin-top: 4.25em&#34; to &#34;padding-bottom: 2.75em&#34;) and you get less distracted because it has sensible defaults and helpful guardrails (you rarely need all the possible attributes and range of parameter values CSS has available).I also rarely had the super irritating and common CSS scenario where you edit a style and it doesn&#39;t change and you have to go investigate to find out why e.g. something is overriding something, your selector is wrong, and even after all that maybe you undo the edit because it doesn&#39;t look good. Plus you no longer have the fear that tweaking a shared class to going to break some completely different page.I feel that beyond some building blocks, trying to create reusable CSS classes with cascading styles has similarities to using excessive abstraction and deep OOP class hierarchies in regular programming languages to avoid a little duplication.I also don&#39;t have a problem with styling stuff appearing in my HTML files either as long as the right HTML tags are used around the data. HTML files are already full of class annotations and divs that are only there for styling yet this doesn&#39;t cause a problem to e.g. browsers, screen readers or crawlers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure I get Tailwind still. Doing everything with utility classes and OOCSS / BEM are things we stopped doing literally decades ago. CSS modules still seem to solve every problem Tailwind solves, and better. CSS modules combine the power of global utility classes with locally styled components/locally scoped classes, and compile to static stylesheets, a requirement for performance. I&#39;m not sure how Tailwind works, but any CSS that&#39;s built at runtime and JS and inserted into the DOM dynamically should be avoided, and is an example of favoring developer experience over end user experience. It&#39;s always surprising to me when the build process isn&#39;t front and center of any CSS framework, since that&#39;s the most important performance aspect. I&#39;m not concerned about Tailwinds verbose CSS use since that&#39;s gzipped away, but the static stylesheet compilation aspect worries me if it&#39;s not front and center of the framework.CSS modules let you use the full power and control of vanilla CSS, without having to worry about styles bleeding across components. Sprinkle in your global utility classes for your design system and you&#39;re good to go. Or sometimes even better, abstract design into components like `&lt;grid&gt;` `&lt;column&gt;` etc and not even worry about the classname implementation.I know I&#39;m missing part of the picture, because of the hype and joy that people report from Tailwind. What part(s) am I missing that move folks from the power, beauty, and simplicity of CSS modules, to all-utility-classes-all-the-time Tailwind?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried Tailwind (and a similar project Windi) on a few projects now and have some findings.Tailwind aggressively speeds up development time of components by allowing me to stay in the same cobtext when styling things. The brevity of class names also dramatically shortens the time spent writing styles. While working on the projects I&#39;d setup with Tailwind, I felt far more productive.However, those were new projects. After completing them and needing to go back and modify or maintain them, the experience has been horrible. The resulting style declarations (as class names) are completely unreadable and unmaintainable. I&#39;ve tried organizing them and splitting class names onto multiple lines, but it has only cluttered things.In my experience, Tailwind (and similar projects) produce styles that are effectively read only. They are superb when writing a new component and styling things from scratch, but maintenance is nonexistent.Because of this, I&#39;ve now switched to using a CSS-in-JS solution to gain the benefits of in-context styling and still have the ability to write CSS declarations in a structured and maintainable way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s hard to take EFF seriously when they write so hyperbolically. What&#39;s clearly also the case is that Chrome extensions are one of the great modern security and privacy challenges --- to the point where multiple tech company security teams have people whose job it is just to screen them. Another detail that EFF doesn&#39;t want to share is that ad blockers are some of the worst offenders --- they demand maximal access to user data (think about how they work), and there are lots of them, not all of them, uh, implemented scrupulously.EFF doesn&#39;t want to give you the other side of this story, because they&#39;re not an honest interlocutor.If you had the other side of the story, you might still think Manifest v3 was a bad deal. Random ad blockers are very dangerous, but there are ad blockers that everyone trusts, and you might not want to make it harder for them to maintain their projects.But EFF doesn&#39;t trust you to make that decision on your own."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because of this, sometime in 2022 I will shut down Sitetruth, my fifteen year old ad blocking and site evaluation system. That offers add-ons for Chrome and Firefox, and puts a tag with company background info on each search result. Some search ads are removed, and some are de-emphasized. Some time next year, Google will probably force that add-on out of Chrome, as they tighten their grip over what browsers are allowed to do.I did this as a technology demo, to demonstrate automated site background checking. The concept that you have to have a business address to sell online is almost archaic now, even though it&#39;s the law in the EU and California. So, today often the system often can&#39;t tie a web site to business records.The concept of &#34;legitimate business&#34; is dead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While a good message that does have actual merit if you know what&#39;s happening already, I don&#39;t see how this is a legitimate consideration of MV3.The entire argument regarding security doesn&#39;t mention any of the reasons Chrome developers cite its security improvement, instead it brings up that Firefox &#34;does good enough already&#34; and that malicious extensions can still get past the review process. the review process is by itself improved with V3 as extensions that pull in code remotely can no longer get past the review process[0], especially with how many current extensions implement RCE C&amp;C intentionally. They also say extensions are &#34;usually interested in simply observing the conversation between your browser and whatever websites you visit&#34; - that&#39;s &#39;usually&#39;, though; malicious extensions intercepting and modifying requests for their own benefit isn&#39;t unheard of.Instead of only stating &#39;this is bad&#39;, it would be beneficial to include both (A) what they say (B) their basis for the decision, if any (C) why that line of reason is incorrect/deceiving.0: https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/mv3/intro/mv3-o..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A group will never admit they were wrong. A group will never admit, “We made a mistake,” because a group that tries to change its mind falls apart. I’m hard pressed to find examples in history of large groups that said, “We thought A, but the answer’s actually B.”Now that is a useful insight.It&#39;s a big problem for voluntary associations. Companies can sometimes change their culture, but it usually requires replacing the CEO.This has come up a few times in military history. &#34;L&#39;audace, toujours l&#39;audace&#34; was a WWI French slogan. It took a huge number of casualties before high command got it that charging into machine guns does not work. Courage does not help. In WWII, a big change was discovering that battleships are not useful once the enemy has torpedo bombers. The resistance of the battleship admirals was overcome by Congress, not the Navy. Congress ordered that the captains of aircraft carriers must be qualified to fly aircraft. Sidelining the &#34;Gun Club&#34; took major political effort.Now, the US military is struggling with the &#34;Fighter Mafia&#34;, which tends to run the USAF despite the ascendancy of drones and the usefulness of the A-10."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was on the board of a foundation that was charged with giving out money for a cause, and I found it very disillusioning because what I learned was that no matter what the foundation did, they would declare victory.

There were a lot of high-sounding mission statements and vision statements, a lot of congratulations, a lot of nice dinners—but nothing ever got done.This is what most nonprofits, and a surprisingly large number of businesses, are like: https://seliger.com/2012/03/25/why-fund-organizations-throug....

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From Bloomberg:&gt; Bondholders of $19.2 billion in Evergrande dollar notes face deep haircuts as the company overhauls its mammoth balance sheet without a government bailout -- a process that promises to be long, contentious and potentially risky for Asia’s largest economy.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-12-09/evergrand...It might seem odd that a Chinese company would have taken out dollar loans, but the practice is common around the world. One reason is that the borrower can get lower interest rates because they assume the exchange rate risk themselves. If that bet goes sour, though, the borrower faces higher costs to service the debt.Of course the thing about dollar bonds is that even if the national government were to intervene, those dollars can&#39;t be printed by Beijing.The only way to service a dollar debt is to raise dollars. One path to doing that is to sell dollar-denominated assets. US Stocks and bonds in other words. So the pressures in China can spill over into the US economy through forced asset sales of dollar-denominated assets.This is another angle to the contagion idea. Organizations around the world have taken big short position on the US dollar. As those loans come due, dollar assets are sold. Which drives the dollar higher. Which makes the dollar loans even more unsustainable. And so on.It has been called the global dollar short squeeze:https://www.lynalden.com/global-dollar-short-squeeze/And if you&#39;re really adventurous, there&#39;s something called the &#34;dollar milkshake theory&#34; which predicts the uncontrollable rise of the dollar as (maybe counterintuitively) a wrecking ball for the world economy:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2qTOWuL7Zco"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use Dracula for pretty much everything. Code editors, terminals, browsers, Slack, and even CSS skins for Tailwind, Wordpress, and more, if I&#39;m installing an application, there&#39;s a pretty good chance there&#39;s already a theme for it.But there&#39;s an interesting side effect of having a theme repository with over 200 applications: app discovery! Whether it&#39;s learning about interesting projects (BetterDiscord, MatterMost, Obsidian) or blasts from the past (I hadn&#39;t thought about BBEdit in a long time! And does anyone remember Brackets?), it&#39;s kind of a cool spot to find and remember things.Good work and thank you to everyone who has worked on these themes, I use them every day for a lot of apps :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a hard time seeing why this is such a popular theme.. maybe it&#39;s just because it is available for so many different editors. On the other hand, would be cool to have an application / database that could convert any theme to another editor.Although that would take a lot of work to figure out the compatibilities, if somebody would do that well enough so that other people can configure input output configs for that, I bet that program could become very popular among developers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dracula is a fine theme, however, I feel like it&#39;s more convenient than it is pretty. I admire Dracula, Nord, and Gruvbox and how committed they are to their own aesthetics - my personal favorite, similar to Gruvbox, is Alduin[0] but sadly it&#39;s for Vim only.I only wish popular themes didn&#39;t feel like they had to use every primary color for the text. I wish we took the popular themes and made them even more opinionated, fewer colors with greater emphasis. At the end of the day most themes nowadays are just different shades of all rainbow text over your choice of a light or dark background. Dark or light... It reminds me of that theory about how early humans, before having words for different colors, only had light and dark to describe things.Does anyone have any recommendations for opinionated color schemes with limited palettes with emphasis on particular colors instead of just dark/light?0. https://github.com/AlessandroYorba/Alduin"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PACER should have been free from the beginning. Gatekeeping legal information for profit (even if only used to supplement appropriations) isn&#39;t only a problem at the federal level. In many states you need a commercial subscription to even read court opinions and statutes, let alone search. Localities in most places rely on commercial publishers to archive the text of ordinances, which only those with ridiculously expensive subscriptions can access. The digitization of everything had just begun when I retired, but the handwriting was already on the wall. The contrast with the widespread availability of technical doc is staggering: and reminds me of why I changed careers."</p>

This means that if a malicious user can control log lines, they can also hide stuff if you&#39;re looking at the logs in a terminal.  Something to be aware of!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The deployment sequence that takes approx 30 days is terrifying but also probably one of the most complex things we would ever achieve if successful.Have been waiting for this since I was a teenager. Can&#39;t believe we are almost there (launch on Dec 22).Here&#39;s a short 2 min video of that deployment sequence if anyone wants to be fascinated: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzGLKQ7_KZQAlso a short interview with Dr. John Mather (could listen to him all day) if anyone wants to know how the telescope works: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4P8fKd0IVOs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those complaining about the spending: some countries spent TRILLIONS on war and and nation building. It&#39;s developments like these we should be focusing our energy and intelect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here’s hoping that “incident” a couple weeks ago will be the only one and everything will work out just fine.This launch and perspective for science has me anxious and excited since its inception - and it’s been a while.I will open a bottle of champagne when the first data will be sent from L2 with something along the “fully operational” lines.Godspeed."</p>
