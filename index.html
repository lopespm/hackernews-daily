								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Living in Shenzhen, it’s shocking how easy it is to go out and repair stuff. Living in Palo Alto, it’s frustrating how hard it is.I’m thinking maybe, just maybe, introducing repairability laws won’t solve the problem.I am perfectly happy upgrading the memory on my MacBook Air with a reflow air station rather than swapping out some dims if it means my laptop is half as thick and twice as rugged. I’m also just as happy dropping my phone off at a corner shop to replace the glass (while preserving the same electronics) using an industrial laminating machine.My problem today is not that repairability laws impede my progress here (they certainly don’t exist in China either).My problem is I can only get the chips and schematics I need to effect the repair on the Chinese Internet (WeChat/Taobao) or find someone to do the repair for me for $40 on the Chinese street markets (Huaqiangnan in Shenzhen). When I go to a corner store in the US the “solution” to swap the whole sub-assembly (glass+electronics) not just glass in case of a screen repair for $100+"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple&#39;s fight against right to repair while pushing materials to the public that state they are trying to reduce their carbon footprint is the absolute peak of hypocrisy. I understand the closed off design of their products is a result of the Steve Jobs era, but why can&#39;t the current leadership make a change?Why can&#39;t Apple make their products easily repairable while making them aesthetically pleasing? The typical &#34;private companies must satisfy the shareholders&#34; answer is just a scapegoat. Truly innovative companies (and companies of Apple&#39;s size and worth) should be able to solve these problems. Doing anything else is just fucking laziness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How much of this, I&#39;m curious, is changing now that Jony Ive is gone?Think about it. Since he left, Apple is bringing color back to their designs, bringing back ports other than Thunderbolt, abandoned the Butterfly keyboard, made the MacBook Pro 16&#34; thicker to improve battery life and cooling, added the discounted business rate to the App Store...Now, this doesn&#39;t mean Apple will continue improving or will make Right to Repair happen. However, I think that with Jony&#39;s departure, something may have, just may have, snapped within the company, and they seem to be looking at changing their ways just a little bit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Noted elsewhere:The Belarus plane hijack is a small reminder why it&#39;s generally not a good idea to let governments know who is going to where. I&#39;m not sure why governments that like to think of themselves as democratic don&#39;t see the risks.-- Alexander Bochmann https://mastodon.infra.de/@galaxis/106285985254850170I&#39;d made a similar point following the assassination of Kim Jung-nam in 2017:Travel and hospitality databases are widely accessible and shared amongst a tremendous number of organisations. State intelligence organisations might readily have access through their own state-run airline, or through private operations or plants within same. Similarly for terrorist, narco-criminal, money-laundering, or other organisations. Financial, banking, and payment-processing systems, only slightly less so. A P.I. license or position on a fraud or abuse desk at a major online retailer, or any skip-tracing agency, can have access to such information.https://old.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/5ud243/data_ar...What is your threat model?Note that your own threat model may not include possibilities which put others at risk.(In fairness, it appear that Protasevich was followed onto the plane itself, suggesting that in-flight availability of manifests played little role.  The question of what pre-flight intelligence methods were employed remains open.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just a story from the history. Plane of Bolivian president was forced to land in Viena in July 2013 in order to search for Snowden after France and Portugal forbid it flying through their air space. I strongly belive that Russian propaganda will use that incident as a leverage.To be clear, I highly despise the Belarusian regime and I&#39;m in full support of opposition. I could only hope that EU will do something in return but it looks like it&#39;s a standard way of handling the people politically considered to be terrorists. It&#39;s not the way it should be done neither by Belarus nor especially by US/NATO if they want to hold the peacekeepers flag. Otherwise it&#39;s just double standards and politics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I definitely identify with the author. A big mistake I made in the past was to assume that other software engineers are equally enthusiastic about these kind of projects, or the least bit impressed by them. I was asked for a job interview to prepare presentations on two projects I was particularly proud of. I chose a hobby Operating System kernel I&#39;d developed from the ground up, and a fully-functional MIPS assembler I had written. The interviewers (senior developers within the company) really just did not get it. Responding with questions such as: &#34;Is this going to make you any money?&#34;, and &#34;When do you expect this to be complete?&#34;. They really couldn&#39;t understand my motivations. I did these projects for no other reason than that I love programming, and I have never stopped loving learning about it. I have never needed to consider, or justify to myself why I did these things. I do them because I enjoy what I do.I ended up pivoting to discuss some comparatively banal professional project migrating a mid-sized financial product to a new tech-stack, which managed to captivate their attention. I found this experience extremely disheartening, however important a lesson it was to learn. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s changed my outlook in any way though, admittedly. I still work on the same kinds of projects, and I still think the best developers are the ones who do work on toy projects for their own enjoyment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since a little less than two years, I live from a website I built, and I have a lot more control over my schedule.Since then, I built a lot more useless stuff. I&#39;m the only user. I can hardcode things, introduce breaking changes, manually migrate data and so on. I can cut corners, or over-engineer everything. Other people can use it, but I don&#39;t care about what they think of my variable names, or which features they want.The turning point for me was the concept of apps as home-cooked meals [0]. If a gardener can grow flowers only he will see, I can write code only I will run.[0] https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all! I&#39;m David, CEO @ Retool. I&#39;m looking in to this right now and will update my comment here with a response in the next two hours.Edit: just did a bit of digging.It looks like we have a Retool template that has some fake data in it (https://retool.com/api-generator/). This is an app built in Retool, and has a few thousand rows of hard-coded data.Most of this fake data is self-generated, but we used the faker.js library (https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) to generate three datatypes: IP address, avatar, and industry. This MIT licensed library, when used, creates data that links directly to fakercloud (https://cdn.fakercloud.com/avatars/). Here is the code itself: https://github.com/Marak/faker.js/blob/master/lib/internet.j..., and here is a demo that shows the library generating those links: https://rawgit.com/Marak/faker.js/master/examples/browser/in....I just spoke to the engineers who worked on this project, and we are sorry for including links to fakercloud. This wasn’t intentional, and we just pushed a commit removing all avatars from the template. This is already deployed. I hope you all can understand why we trusted the data generated by the MIT licensed project, and didn’t think it would link to anything proprietary.I myself am an engineer (and avid HN reader, as evinced by how I found this while reading HN on a Sat night), understand Marak’s frustration, and agree that monetizing OSS is hard. While we’ve already contributed around $10k to various libraries we use (https://opencollective.com/retool), including faker.js, Babel, ESLint, and JSON Schema, I’m going to see if there is more we can do. We’ll be writing a blog post about it this week and I will follow up with more next steps. I wonder whether there is a better way of sponsoring OSS, other than just donating dollars every month?  (Maybe we could commit one engineering-day per month for contributing back to OSS libraries we use heavily?) In the meantime, we&#39;ll certainly continue sponsoring all the libraries we’re sponsoring already, including faker.js.(Also: I’m sorry to Marak for not responding to his email re. acquiring Faker. More in this child thread: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27252420)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate to be that guy, but idealism in software needs to die.Don&#39;t use a license that&#39;s more permissive than you&#39;re willing to tolerate.It&#39;s absurd to me for a project to publish something with a 100% open source license and then complain when somebody tries to profit off of it.Doesn&#39;t really matter how egregious or large the perpetrator is. If you want exceptions, write it into the license. People want the goodwill that comes with open source, without accepting the consequences.That being said, I do empathize with the plight of the author. Perhaps they were naive to this possibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Random bits of semi-related advice:1. If you wanted Retool to stop using your service, you should have said it up front instead of beating around the bush. From what I can gather from your emails, you sent their CEO a random sales pitch and he ignored it. Hard to fault him for that.2. I love faker.js. I have used it in the past, and I&#39;m sure several teams in my company use it today. I would, however, never ever pay for your cloud service, simply because taking a dependency on a third party hosted website to run unit tests is madness. The old school corporate software licensing model might be losing favor, but that does not mean it isn&#39;t apt for any use case. If faker.js was still downloadable but needed a license key to run I&#39;m sure people would pay for it. It would probably be the easiest thing in the world to bypass, but the same Fortune 500 companies you mention would gladly break our their checkbooks rather than risk getting sued."</p>

It makes it super easy yo just get something on screen, and you&#39;re not screwing around with configuration, build systems and package managers etc (the death of productivity IMO, especially for a beginner).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The only aspect of the Apple App Store that strikes me as truly anticompetitive is their prohibition on adjusting prices to include Apple’s fees, or even to tell the user what they are.I can accept that Apple can demand a 30% fee for billing customers on their devices. And I can accept that they would prohibit installation/sales of software any other way. But I should be allowed to mark up the price by 30% and then call it out as a line item.The fact that Apple can control what prices I set on other platforms and prohibit me from disclosing what’s happening to my users...That is the part of this that strikes me as dystopian, and that’s the area where I think antitrust and free speech laws perhaps ought to step in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Cook used more privacy and safety claims to defend that system, saying it would be both insecure and inconvenient to let apps process payments separatelyThis one is always funny to me, because sellers of physical goods are of course totally exempt from IAP rules, because it would be untenable otherwise.I can type my card number directly into the Amazon app and buy a paperback without any intervention from Apple.And yet it’s apparently insecure for me to buy a Kindle book with the exact same mechanism in the exact same app?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will not buy any device that does not give me control of the device. If I can&#39;t sideload apps, can&#39;t install a 3rd party store, do not have the ability to root my own device, I won&#39;t buy it. Apple has decided that&#39;s not allowed, fine, I won&#39;t buy their product. That&#39;s between Apple and their customers.But it is certifiably insane that Apple thinks they have the right to dictate to Epic what Epic charges for its apps on their store. If Epic thinks Fortnite is worth $30, and Epic charges Android users $30 for the binary to sideload onto their Android devices, and because Apple charges a 30% surcharge, Epic sells the same app on iOS for $42.86, and Apple says, &#34;no, you&#39;re not allowed to do that, you have to charge $30 just like you do on Android&#34; -- no. Absolutely not. Apple does not have the moral/ethical right to do that."</p>
