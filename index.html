								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve already stated this many times, I&#39;ll state it again.Get your shit out of YouTube and any other Google product.Google is a dumb, faceless, fully automated company only interested in extracting as much data as possible from its users, force them to swallow as many ads as possible, all without caring about listening to them (both consumers and creators), under the faulty assumption that they&#39;re too big for users and consumers to live without them. They simply don&#39;t deserve anybody using their shitty products anymore.The error in this case is quite obvious. YouTube&#39;s scanner incorrectly identified the teacher&#39;s recording of Moonlight Sonata as a copyrighted reinterpretation of the same piece of music originally written by a guy who actually died 200 years ago. And I can&#39;t completely put the blame on Google&#39;s AI: the notes are technically the same, the beat might also be the same, if you calculate an FFT of the audio you&#39;ll probably also come up with similar spectral signatures. But a human listener will IMMEDIATELY notice that was played by the teacher IS NOT the the same as the copyrighted piece of music.The problem is: who is accountable for these mistakes? Who shall I reach out to if Google&#39;s foggy algorithms make a mistake? And, in the case of educators and creators who actually do that for a job, who will compensate them for the revenue they have lost because of algorithmic errors?Until Google can provide an answer to these questions, I repeat: keep your ass away from anything that has their name on it. They are not reliable, the risk of losing your data, your account or your followers because of random automated decision is very high, and the probability of getting a real human to assist you is very low."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Summary for those that don’t want to watch the video :- Pianist creates YouTube video demonstrating how to play Beethoven’s Moonlight Sonata- part of this video includes her playing Moonlight Sonata (of course)- YouTube has a new ‘feature’ that scans submitted videos prior to publication to identify potentially copyrighted material- her video is found to include copyrighted material. She is certain this is a mistake that will be rectified by disputing the copyright claim- she agrees the only person who’s content she is reproducing is Beethoven himself- her copyright dispute is rejected. She is found to be violating the copyright of a piece called “Wicca Moonlight”- she can appeal the dispute but the appeal process is limited, and she risks getting a feared “copyright strike” on her account, wherein three such strikes would mean permanent closure of the account- she says nearly anyone can file copyright claims against published YouTube videos, including bots, and is worried about all the time she’s putting in to create content being usurped by a few bad actors"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Along the same lines, I was publishing church services each Sunday between May and December of last year, with three English hymns in each, mostly old ones well-known across denominations. In total, I got 23 Content ID claims (about 20% of the hymns), claiming ownership of the melody. Every single one was for a work in the public domain. I disputed each, providing the name and date of death of the composer.Two were released (one after three days, the other after 27), the rest were allowed to lapse in my favour (which happens after 30 days).A few of these claims were duplicates (same claimer, same hymn). This showed that even though I had successfully disputed their claim in the past in the grounds of the work being in the public domain, YouTube had not revoked their ability to claim the melody in question.If any of the liars claiming they owned these works had rejected my dispute, it could have become a strike, &amp;c. and there would of course be no recourse, because Google generally refuses to arbitrate.Also, an insidious aspect of the claims system was that YouTube basically didn’t tell you about the copyright claim at all when publishing; you had to close the edit page for the video and return to the list, and see if the Restrictions column for the video said “Copyright claim”. If you didn’t do that, the video would probably be being monetised by the claimer in at least some of the world (and if you disputed it, I guess Google would happily take the lot for the period while they had monetised it—though now that they’re putting ads on everything, this lot isn’t so different from the usual situation; depends on whether you hate the balance of the ad money going to the copyright liars or Google more).(There was also one amusing case where some music being played at a nearby temple was audible during a quiet time in the service, and so I found out the name of the music being played. I claimed fair use on that one, because I didn’t even want that music in it, and it was quiet. That claim was released after ten days.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As Linus points out, the utility of shared libraries depends on the situation. Widely used libraries like libxcb, libGL, and zlib that tend to have reasonably stable ABIs are good candidates for sharing, while the &#34;couple of libraries that nobody else used. Literally nobody&#34; should obviously be statically linked. Software engineering is mostly about learning how to choose which method is appropriate for the current project.However, there important advantage of using .so files instead of building into a big statically linked binary is NOT that a library can be shared between different programs! The important benefit is dynamic linking. The ability to change which library is being used without needing to rebuild the main program is really important. Maybe rebuilding the program isn&#39;t practical. Maybe rebuilding the program isn&#39;t possible because it&#39;s closed/proprietary or the source no longer exists. If the program is statically linked, then nothing can happen - either it works or it doesn&#39;t. With dynamic linking, changes are possible by changing which library is loaded. I needed to use this ability last week to work around a problem in a closed, proprietary program that is no longer supported. While the workaround was an ugly LD_LIBRARY_PATH hack, at least it got the program to run."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note to 1-bit people: saying that &#34;X is not a good thing in general&#34;, is not the same as saying that &#34;X is a bad thing in general&#34;. All that&#39;s being said here is &#34;tradeoffs exist&#34; and highlighting some issues some people apparently like to ignore.One of my favorite libraries is SDL. Of course, when SDL2 came out, they moved away from the LGPL license to a more liberal zlib license, which allows static linking without infecting the license of your project. Great, except now as years go by and games are abandoned, they stop working in new environments, or at least don&#39;t work as well, and you can&#39;t just force in a new dynamic version of SDL to save things like you used to be able to.The solution they came up with: even if the program is static linked, the user can define an environmental variable to point to a dynamic lib and that will be used instead. Best of both worlds, at least going forward for programs that use a version of SDL2 that incorporates the feature. (Some more details: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux_gaming/comments/1upn39/sdl2_a...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The main supposed benefit is not disk or memory economy, but central patching.The theory is as follows: If a security flaw (or other serious bug) is found, then you can fix it centrally if you use shared libraries, as opposed to finding every application that uses the library and updating each separately.In practice this doesn&#39;t work because each application has to be tested against the new version of the library."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So a while ago a i remembered one post from HN, it was some guy crawling google play store and keeping apps that were paid and people used them but had a low rating. He was selling this list, not sure if it was successful but i made something similar and updatedSo far checking only 3 marketplaces, my crawlers found so far about 100k apps, the default filters show only the more interesting once (paid and low rating)Its free.I will add more and more marketplaces eventually. I will also try to add some social features, like &#34;working as a team on some idea&#34; and posting own ideas, but will see how it goes.Feedback welcomeEDIT: i just see it on mobile, it does not look ideal. Will need to work on that hm.EDIT2: just added pagination :), hope it works for you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good luck tring to do a better job replacing these on Android where every device x android version permutation out there = something breaks for a different user.Like the &#34;Automatic Call Recorder Pro&#34; (highest number of ratings on the list) has &#34;try the free version first to see if this will work on your phone&#34; ... I feel sorry for Android developers. As much as I dislike the &#34;Apple way&#34; of designing products (walled gardens and super opinionated instead of open and providing choices), every time I need to develop something for Android I&#39;m flabergasted at how shit the platform is under the hood. Soo many APIs to do the same thing, depricated system APIs all over the place, but the only way to do things on devices X, but only from manufacturer Y, on Z the API functionality isn&#39;t even supported, on W you need to use newer APIs, on Q you need to use a custom solution - nobody really uses Q but your client got 3 complaints and can&#39;t determine priorities (understandable given the ecosystem fragmentation)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do ratings actually matter? The only time I look at them is when it’s an Indie game and I want to see people’s impressions of it. Even still, I’ll go on Reddit and find the reviews there.I say this because I have seen excellent but popular apps have very low ratings just because they are popular. Also, when someone gives it a low rating because of a bug that’s fixed 2 days later, is there a mechanism to take that into account?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Does anyone remember that Reddit post where a guy thought his landlord was sneaking into his apartment and leaving him notes? He insisted the handwriting was completely different. Then a poster suggested he get tested for CO poisoning, which it was, and the “different handwriting” was actually a part of his delusion.“Burning out all of the glucose and dopamine in your brain” isn’t a thing. “Functional Neurological Disorder” is another name for Conversion Disorder - a condition of apparently neurological symptoms  inconsistent with neurological anatomy or mechanisms, triggered (most often) by significant stressors, often suffering a longer duration in patients who strongly believe “this is definitely a physical disease!”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reads out exactly how a manic or hypomanic person would experience things and rationalize past events and feelings. The idea that it has to be something complex and in a sense grandiose compared to &#34;just being burned out&#34; is often a very telling sign.Perhaps it&#39;s Twitter forcing the format a little, but I could see myself thinking like this during a hypomanic episode. I&#39;m diagnosed with bipolar disorder (type 2, rapid cycling). I could see a lot of people with undiagnosed behavioral disorders being thrown into a complete mess of a situation with any resemblance of a functional system being thrown out of the door when Covid-19 hit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Same exact symptoms (the bass guitar string he heard is a thing that gave me ptsd like symptoms/crippling anxiety for a long time after) I had from a TIA when I was overworked. He waited getting a scan so they could&#39;ve missed it later; my office was next to the hospital: nothing showed on the CT one hour after but on the RMI a couple of hours after they found a tiny lesion in one of the regions involved in forming speech (which, like him, I had issues with for a bit). Sounds more likely than glucose to me but that is because this looks too familiar to me.Edit: with symptoms like this, treat it as an emergency, do not wait. I do not even understand how you go to sleep and not the hospital if you actually suspect a stroke? Within 3 hours they can do a lot even for far more serious strokes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been saying this from the start: the well of issues is infinitely deep as soon as you decide that multiple tenants running on the same physical hardware inferring something about another is a vulnerability. I assert, but cannot rigorously prove, that it is not possible to design a CPU such that execution of arbitrary instructions has no observable side-effects, especially if the CPU is speculating.I don&#39;t know what that spells for cloud hosting providers - maybe they have to buy a lot more CPUs so every client can have their own, or commission a special &#34;shared&#34; SKU of CPU that doesn&#39;t have any speculative execution - but I know for me, if I have untrusted code running on my CPU, I&#39;ve already lost. I could then care less about information leakage between threads.We&#39;re going to wind up undoing the last 20 years of performance gains in the name of &#39;security&#39;, and it scares me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This may sound stupid, but the commonality in all these side channel attacks is that high precision time keeping is a non privileged operation.Maybe it’s time to make clocks a privileged op as a mitigation. Even making execution time non predictable on untrusted code, such as JavaScript?If precise time keeping is unavailable these become harder to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&#34;Intel&#39;s suggested defense against Spectre, which is called LFENCE, places sensitive code in a waiting area until the security checks are executed, and only then is the sensitive code allowed to execute,&#34; Venkat said. &#34;But it turns out the walls of this waiting area have ears, which our attack exploits. We show how an attacker can smuggle secrets through the micro-op cache by using it as a covert channel.&#34;&gt;&#34;In the case of the previous Spectre attacks, developers have come up with a relatively easy way to prevent any sort of attack without a major performance penalty&#34; for computing, Moody said. &#34;The difference with this attack is you take a much greater performance penalty than those previous attacks.&#34;&gt;&#34;Patches that disable the micro-op cache or halt speculative execution on legacy hardware would effectively roll back critical performance innovations in most modern Intel and AMD processors, and this just isn&#39;t feasible,&#34; Ren, the lead student author, said."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m currently building a distributed mmo emulator using elixir, and it&#39;s going well (performance/bug/effort wise). Distributed via horde/libcluster libraries, ranch as acceptor pool, using livebooks for debugging and performance testing.I couldn&#39;t really ask for anything better, as solo dev in less than 100h basic distribution solved(one process per map, one per player. Maps are spread around the erlang cluster using horde, if a map crashes players seeemlesly reconnect in less than a second, and the map may actually be on a whole different system, especially when the node becomes non viable)
Basic monster ai, fighting logic. Respawn/monster  drops, extensive ddbuggability using observer (gui tool included in erlang, allows me to send messages to processes/see their status/ what they do, maybe kill them in the whole erlang cluster )
Can just use livebooks to do more extensive programming (just connect to cluster, execute a mark down files code blocks, see results live ingame and in the livebook)It&#39;s a very great and easy language for this. I may consider moving couple of things to rust using rustler tho for the fun of learning about nifs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t overstate how good Elixir + LiveView is, especially for prototyping. I have been experimenting with it ever since it first came out, mostly games, and I have to say that building even simple multiplayer games is a lot of fun.An example:https://dev.voppe.it/chess(FYI there is no actual game here, just pick emojis, place them in the arena and watch them fight to the death via a poorly designed combat system. Yes, those placing emojis other than you are other players.)This was a prototype that I built to see if real-time multiplayer games were feasible. Apparently LiveView manages high tickrates decently enough to be a valid solution for (quasi) real-time games. This game for example runs at a whopping 8 ticks/s! It can handle more, as I&#39;ve tried developing with faster tickrates, I think as high as 24 t/s, but I want to avoid server strain. With enough HTML/CSS/SVG wizardry you can get away with quite a lot. But the most amazing thing was the fact that there was no need to fiddle around with state syncing. Everything just works! I have nothing but praise for it.Try LiveView if you have the chance!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious about how race conditions would be handled when multiple users, on different regional LiveView servers, take conflicting actions.In the &#34;Let&#39;s walk it through&#34; section, it seems like the Player-to-LiveView connection will process user input (e.g. a Tic-Tac-Toe move) and update the UI to acknowledge this, at which point the user can be assured that the LiveView server accepted their input. But it seems like this happens before the GameServer has also accepted the input. What if Player 2 made a conflicting play and their change was accepted by the GameServer before Player 1&#39;s change reached the GameServer?Given, in Tic-Tac-Toe, the game is simple enough that this is neatly avoided: each regional LiveView server has enough information to only allow the current player to make a play. But in more complex applications, how might you (anyone; curious for discussion) handle this?One answer is something like: The LiveView server is effectively producing optimistic updates, and the GameServer would need to produce an authoritative ordering of events and tell the various LiveServers which of the optimistic updates lost a race and should be backed out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Inferior endurance is the &#34;dirty secret&#34; of the consumer-level SSD industry.  You and I know better, but the average consumer doesn&#39;t pay attention to write endurance or under-provisioning.While I&#39;m no proponent of storage mining, I do feel a little empathy.  First they sell products that don&#39;t stand up as well to wear, then they wash their hands of it when you actually want to use the thing.  Feels a bit like when stainless steel appliances gave way to plastic ones.That&#39;s why I stopped buying entry-level, and prefer enterprise SSD&#39;s or at least good brands that publish endurance figures and have held up to third-party testing proving them out.Here are some fun experiments writing to SSD&#39;s for days/months/years on end to see how long they&#39;d last:[1] https://techreport.com/review/27909/the-ssd-endurance-experi...[2] https://forums.whirlpool.net.au/thread/9rl1lp19?p=9#r179[3] http://www.xtremesystems.org/forums/showthread.php?271063-SS...I have no problem with a manufacturer publishing a lifetime write rating and denying the warranty once you&#39;ve exceeded it.  But unless they were up-front about it, amending the terms afterward by saying &#34;well, we never intended you to use it like that&#34; seems a cop-out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of the Paperclip Maximizer thought experiment. An AI which destroys the universe by turning it into paperclips, as its goal is to make more paperclips.First crypto took marginal GPU and energy capacity. Now it is taking SSDs.It has so far produced nothing except higher values measured in fiat. And the higher the values go the more resources needed for the computer networks.Of course crypto is not an AI so it can only get fed more resources if it converts believers to feed it more. More GPUs, more SSDs, more coal, to run calculations.So this should be self limiting at some point. Or maybe I’m wrong and some practical use will come of it but it’s been 12 years without any so far."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"as long as you&#39;re within the endurance limits the warranty should apply.  writes are writes as far as the drive is concerned, it could be movies, it could be porn, it could be crypto, it doesn&#39;t matter, the warranty was advertised with a specific wear life and if you&#39;re within that the workload is irrelevant.(writes when very full / etc will cause write amplification, but that still shows up on the endurance counter.  if you want to do a bunch of writes with 10x amplification cause your drive is full then that&#39;s on you, it still counts 10x towards the endurance... but the endurance counter is what they specify in the warranty.)if the drive fails when it&#39;s past its advertised endurance... they can tell you to pound sand and that&#39;s fine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"the first reports on this already appeared in august 2020, but somehow all mainstream outlets weren&#39;t too interested. They still weren&#39;t interested in October when the DOJ sent an inquiry about nursing homes or in January when the NY AG issued a report finding New York under counted deaths of nursing home and long-term care facility residents.Meanwhile, CNN put him on the air, to be heralded as a great and inspiring leader by his own brother, a CNN mouth piece, that got state funded special treatment when he had covid. Now CNN simply refuses to report on it.The media landscape is beyond broken in this country."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At this point, do a little introspection. Did you hear about this last year? From who? Did you find it credible? Why or why not? Is there any way you can grow in your consumption of information based on your findings?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"33% of all US Covid deaths have happened in nursing homes. Those 180,000+ deaths happened across the country. Some of the earliest US deaths happened in a Seattle nursing home. Some other early death clusters happened in VA hospitals. This is a public and private national disgrace, not just a Cuomo one.Cuomo didn&#39;t create our &#39;standards&#39; for warehousing the elderly. We did that as a society."</p>
