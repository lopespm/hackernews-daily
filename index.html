								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bartosz&#39; blog posts are in a league of their own.They way he is able to explain complex subjects by starting from first principles, gently adding more and more layers, with beautiful, custom-made figures and animations is truly, literally, awesome.I strongly recommend supporting the author via his Patreon if you enjoy his blog posts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"+1 for the recommendation for &#34;The Scientist and Engineer&#39;s Guide to
Digital Signal Processing&#34; by Steven W. Smith. I spoke to Steven many
years ago about his putting all of the book PDFs online for free and
since then have recommended at least 5 university libraries to buy it
because the students could get free copies of a great book that can be
referenced in the library.FWIW the The Scientist and Engineer&#39;s Guide doesn&#39;t actually cover a
lot on sound. It starts in a particular DSP way with frequency domain
definitions and convolution - and I actually think Steven&#39;s background
is in medial imaging, though I could be mistaken."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Instagram&#39;s tagging system was actually really effective at categorizing content and discovery because each hashtag was treated as a node in a (giant) graph, where each node has multiple properties, including post count (number of posts using a tag), &#39;velocity&#39; (number of posts using a particular tag per unit time), etc. I could write up a big post about it as I made a study of it in when I created a web app for finding the most relevant tags a few years ago.All that to say there was a lot to their system and it worked because users became aware that they were rewarded for using the most relevant tags. Using irrelevant tags was punished. This guided users towards using a mix of relevant popular and niche tags to maximize their reach, which, in turn, further improved the tagging system.Instagram&#39;s tagging system isn&#39;t as important anymore as their algorithm has deemphasized it, in favor of other methods for classification and discovery, but there were a couple of golden years where it worked very well. Most users still look back on those years as the &#39;good times&#39; even if they don&#39;t know exactly why. I&#39;d go so far as to say they ruined the app after they deemphasized tags (and added way too many ads)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I adore tagging systems and have worked on them in several different applications and implementations, but there are always pitfalls and trade offs, and it’s possible to bury yourselfNowadays I nearly always store the assigned tags as an integer array column in Postgres, then use the intarray extension to handle the arbitrary boolean expression searches like “((1|2)&amp;(3)&amp;(！5))”. I still have a tags table that stores all the metadata / hierarchy / rules, but for performance I don’t use a join table. This has solved most of my problems. Supertags just expand to OR statements when I generate the expression. Performance has been excellent even with large tables thanks to pg indexing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked with the Wikipedia category system a few years ago, and you could see the problems with hierarchical tagging systems right in action back then. (Though it may have gotten better in the meantime)The system appeared simple: There were just two relations, &#34;Article A is a member of category B&#34; and &#34;Category X is a subcategory of category Y&#34;.However, in practice, the community was using this system to represent a whole host of wildly different relationships between items, often with different implications what a category actually applied to.E.g., if A has a subcategory B, this could mean one of several things: B might be an additional constraint on the items in A (&#34;American writers&#34; -&gt; &#34;19th century American writers&#34;), the things in B might be more specific than the things in A: (&#34;Writers&#34; -&gt; &#34;Novelists&#34;), A might apply to the concept B, not the things in B (&#34;Occupations&#34; -&gt; &#34;Writers&#34;) or A might refer to the category B (&#34;Categories with more than 100 entries&#34; -&gt; &#34;Writers&#34;) and on and on...Of course those different aspects could even be combined. E.g. &#34;Categories with more than 100 entries&#34; might have a child &#34;Categories with more than 100 entries in need of review&#34;, which represents a constraint but might itself contain less than 100 entries...The basic question &#34;Is item X in category Y&#34; becomes impossible to answer generally, because there is no clear indication if a category only applies to its direct children or to all of its descendants or only to the subcategories itself.I&#39;m sure there are sophisticated ontological systems which would allow users to specify all those different relationships separately. I&#39;m also pretty sure that users would become sloppy after a short time or would disagree which particular relationship to use in a particular situation..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; - Rounding of corners. Religion at this point&gt; - Homogenization. JetBrains wants to be like VSCode&gt; - Animations. Haven&#39;t seen them but it will be filledSeriously, HN? This is the quality that you reward with hundreds of points? Unlike the author, I happen to have used this UI for the past five months and it solves many of my longstanding gripes with IntelliJ:- Gutters are now much better at highlighting local changes, while also being less visually obtrusive.- The shaded tool window background nicely separates them from the editor- Showing the git branch next to the title makes it so much easier to understand where I am, when I work with multiple projects and branches.- Breadcrumbs in the Statusbar save some space and look much cleaner---Also, many of the complaints that I&#39;ve seen in this thread are either wrong or exaggerated:- &#34;Monochrome icons&#34; - Only the toolbar icons are monochrome, everything else still uses coloured icons.- &#34;The toolbar has less icons now&#34; - It&#39;s customisable, you can put whatever you want in there. Yes, with colourful icons.- &#34;More Whitespace&#34; - The vertical space from the top of the screen to the editor is the exact same. The Project view actually looses some vertical space, but only because the font size is bigger (Which you can change obviously). The spacing between the list items is the same according to a designer on Slack.- &#34;This is just some incompetent designer pushing their agenda on us, breaking my workflow because something something trends&#34; - go touch grass.And finally, just to be clear: no, there are no animations - everything is instant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eh, I have used vim, spacemacs, sublime, vscode, atom, eclipse and netbeans. Jetbrains IDEs have superior functionality out of the box across languages and don’t require me to mess with and debug a million plugins. I don’t mind a UI refresh, it’s going to be just like the gmail refresh everyone hated it and now we’re all fine with it.I just wish they would invest more money into things that are actually a problem currently like how slow indexing is and how disruptive it is when you do a clean re-install and it indexes all your dependencies again.I have tried spacemacs which gives a lot of functionality out the box with less configuration needed than DIY vim or emacs but it still just doesn’t compare to the ease of use of Jetbrains IDEs across languages (I use Java, Python, Ruby and Typescript every week)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seriously! Their slick, compact, and beautifully well laid out UI is one of the primary reasons I use I Intellij Idea.If they force this update, I&#39;ll just not update it. Not to mention, since I now will not be updating it, I can cancel my yearly, recurring subscription too.Hey Jetbrains: You just have to do one thing. And that is: to NOT mess up existing thing.Even if you stop launching new features into your product for next few years, I&#39;ll still happily pay you folks just because your product is so damn perfect as of now.Please don&#39;t ruin it. Forget what VSCode is doing. They are far far far behind you folks. Don&#39;t let THEM ruin your product."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had a situation once where we had a minor re-org and I ended up with a new manager. Literally day one, he made an attempt to change everyone&#39;s role. We were a team of developers and business analysts. He decided that everyone would become both and spend 50% of their time on each activity. Not sure why he thought this was a good idea, but he did.After he announced it, I had a 1x1 with him and clearly let him know that he was the boss and I&#39;d do my best to accomplish anything he assigned me. I also let him know that the business analyst duties didn&#39;t fit well with my skillset and that I would very likely struggle to produce output. We had a good, honest conversation about the situation and I ended up staying 100% as a developer. In the end he was happy and I was happy.Why am I telling you? It&#39;s that I&#39;ve learned it better to communicate and hopefully work things out then just pack up and head to another place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally I think the concept of growth is a scam to get people to work harder for less. You can certainly grow your skill set, but intelligent people can rise to the occasion in most jobs. Including CEO/Director/High level decision making jobs.Everytime I have received some insultingly low offer from a startup, they start talking about &#34;growth&#34;, &#34;what I can own&#34;, &#34;wearing many hats&#34;. Meanwhile, the founder is sitting on some 40% equity grant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a leadership book called &#34;First Break all the Rules - What the World&#39;s Greatest Managers Do Differently&#34;.  It&#39;s data driven by a large meta-survey and research project.One of the conclusions was that, essentially, the normal instinct with Performance Management to focus on improving weaknesses is wrong and leads to sub-optimal outcomes.  The best managers actually doubled down on each individuals strengths, and simply accepted weaknesses as something to be smoothed out to the minimally acceptable level. (e.g. someone may not be &#34;good with people&#34;, but they can&#39;t be openly hostile with co-workers.)  Instead the manager would look for another employee which had that weakness as a strength, and manage responsibilities appropriately.It speaks exactly to what was wrong in OP&#39;s experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is the essential similarity of the key trick in Godel&#39;s incompleteness theorem and the Y combinator well known?  I finally &#34;got&#34; the incompleteness theorem when that relationship dawned on me.  As a cute entry point, consider the standard lambda term with no normal form, &#34;(lambda x. (x x)) (lambda x. (x x))&#34;.  Now consider the Godel formula &#34;Substitute(F, n)&#34;, which takes a number F, the Godel number of a formula with a single free variable, and another number n.  It simplifies to a number M which is the Godel number of the formula F with n replacing all instances of its free variable.  One might interpret F as function-like, in the sense that for any number n, F [free_var := n] simplifies to some other number m.  So now consider &#34;Substitute(F, F)&#34;, which is suggestive of &#34;(x x)&#34; in lambda notation.  Let M be the Godel number of this formula, which has one free variable.  Finally, use an analogy to the above self-referential lambda term to create the formula G, defined as &#34;Substitute(M, M)&#34;.  To what number does this arithmetic formula with no free variables simplify?  The delightful answer is that it simplifies to its own Godel number!  Just as it is a short step from the above simple self-referential lambda term to the Y combinator, so it is a short step from the above fact to the standard Godel formula for which neither it nor its negation has a proof."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool page, though the Halting Problem brings with it a lot of stuff, so using it to prove Godel&#39;s first incompleteness theorem is (imo) a bit like cheating. I&#39;ve proven it before using diagonalization on my blog (but also using concepts like computability for free). At the end of the day, using these ideas, you get the Curry–Howard correspondence for free (which, again, is a bit like cheating).&gt; Gödel’s original proof was slightly strongerTechnically speaking, a lot stronger. Proving Godel&#39;s first incompleteness theorem (don&#39;t even get me started on the second) from first principles is actually much more involved; and certainly more difficult to make it intelligible for non-logicians."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the things I have a hard time conveying to non-parents is that the most time-intensive parts of parenting don&#39;t last forever.I&#39;ve talked to a lot of young people who say they don&#39;t want kids because they think their personal lives will permanently halt the moment they have kids. I spend a lot of time trying to explain that:1) I still spend a lot of time with friends and can do most of my personal hobbies/activities on weekends. My wife and I are good at sharing the load. You don&#39;t need 2 parents watching kids 100% of the time.2) The sleepless nights and diaper changes are a mere blip on the scale of a lifetime with kids. You deal with it, then the kids grow up quicker than you think. Don&#39;t let the idea of the first few months/years define your entire decision for how you want to structure your family for the rest of your life.3) You actually like hanging out with your own kids. I talk to a lot of people who are anchored to some negative experience they had 10 years ago babysitting for someone else&#39;s kids, as if that was representative of parenting life. It&#39;s not at all. At the end of the day, I actually rush to finish up my work so I can have more kid time. It&#39;s fun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A huge asterisk here is that this varies greatly by culture. For better or worse* certain cultures value strong family bonds and time spent with the parents, as well as bilateral support well into adulthood. Many cultures also encourage multigenerational living within a single household (or in extremely close proximity like my parents did).For example, my parents were happy to have me live at home as long as I wanted, and in fact encouraged me to stay so I could save up. Ideally in their eyes I wouldn&#39;t even move out until I was married. In my parent&#39;s culture, I&#39;m not seen as a loser or a burden because I&#39;m living with them as an adult, only if I wasn&#39;t contributing to the family&#39;s prosperity. Of course I wanted to live my own life sooner than that, but that doesn&#39;t mean I left as soon as I was 18.Because of these strong family ties I live within minutes of my parents, and still make sure to visit often, even if it&#39;s just for dinner.*Where this can breakdown is if one does not fit neatly within the boundaries and expectations set by cultural norms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed the comments section much more than the article itself (even though it&#39;s a great article)There is something magical to me about seeing other people&#39;s experiences (especially positive ones)P.S. I&#39;ve noticed we&#39;re in a need for more streamlined info on being a parent in the world we live in so I created a weekly newsletter for remote-working parents - https://thursdaydigest.com/Most of my subscribers are coming from comments just like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Liz Rice&#39;s presentation on re-creating Docker in Go is also quite eye-opening: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Utf-A4rODH8"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really this is more interesting as a great tutorial on the way Linux container tools work (and especially their fundamental simplicity -- the docs make them seem scary when they really aren&#39;t) more than it is as a docker replacement (docker is obviously much larger than this one script, but not really &#34;large&#34; as a software stack).But reading this makes clear that, yes, containers are just filesystem trees, network namespaces are just like internal networks maintained by straightforward commands underneath an &#34;ip netns&#34; command, etc...Great stuff."</p>
