								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve recently heard about this YouTube account named Roel Van De Paar. If you&#39;ve looked up any error message on YouTube recently, you&#39;ve probably run into him. Because of the &#34;no dislikes&#34; change, he&#39;s everywhere now.And by everywhere, I mean EVERYWHERE. The account has over 2 million videos. Approximately 0.2% of ALL videos on the ENTIRE platform of YouTube can be attributed to this account, and if you check now they&#39;ve probably uploaded a few videos in the past couple minutes. The videos are generated crap, ripped from tech forums. Normally you wouldn&#39;t see it anywhere due to dislikes being easy to spot, but now they pop up all the time in search results due to dislikes becoming a sort of &#34;hidden feature&#34;.Hiding dislikes = less people press dislike (no feedback) = low quality videos are much harder to get rid of in search results. It&#39;s really, really bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t personally think the dislike button is the explanation. But something seems to have changed in the Youtube recommendations algo in the last few weeks.In my experience, the algo has gotten very noticeably worse recently:- Recommending lots of 6 - 12 year old videos on topics I&#39;m interested in (who cares about a 12 year old product review?)- Recommending tons of videos I&#39;ve already seen or recommending really, really old videos from people I normally watch. It&#39;s always done this, but it seems worse recently.- Trying to push &#34;streamer bro&#34; meme videos on me, which seem aimed at 12 year old kids- The algo seems to be really clinging to recommending only videos about the last few topics I searched and totally forgetting my main interests. Look up a video on a new car you just bought? Congratulations, Youtube will now recommend you every video ever produced about that car forever to the exclusion of whatever it is you are actually interested in even if you have never shown an interest in cars.Maybe someone who works at Youtube knows if a new recommendation system was pushed out recently or something? It&#39;s miserable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only explanation for getting rid of dislike count that makes sense to me is to make big brands happy as their videos can&#39;t be made to look bad with a high dislike count and they can&#39;t be &#34;dislike bombed&#34; for things that may be unrelated to the content (eg the recent Activision-Blizzard scandals).Why? Because in every other way (and every way for the viewer), this makes Youtube worse. So it&#39;s a hell of a price to pay to appease big corporate interests. That&#39;s why I have such a hard time comprehending this move.It definitely changes how people use the dislike button since there&#39;s no feedback for it. Maybe that too was by design? It&#39;s true that people are generally terrible at using dislikes and downvote buttons. Ieally it would be a quality indicator but really it&#39;s just used for &#34;I don&#39;t like what you&#39;re saying&#34;, &#34;I don&#39;t like you&#34; or &#34;I don&#39;t like something about you&#34;. And that&#39;s probably not a great signal.Side note: for anyone with such functionality, it would probably greatly improve the overall user experience to identify these low-indicator downvoters and shadowban them. Don&#39;t take away the downvote UI. Just make it do absolutely nothing as in it shows them they downvoted / disliked but just don&#39;t count it for anything. These people are toxic.Anyway, I actually hope to see more low-quality generated content on Youtube as it&#39;s probably going to be the only thing that causes this decision to be reversed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Totally agree with this article. It&#39;s not just about funding methods, but also playbooks for these types of businesses, and best practices.I&#39;ve bootstrapped IPinfo.io to millions in revenue and a team of over 20 - so we&#39;re squarely in the &#34;Middle class&#34;, and there&#39;s a tension between the &#34;bootsrapper advice&#34; (which mostly applies to optimizing for lifestyle and eliminating any risk) and &#34;VC backed advice&#34; (which mostly seems to optimize for scale and speed) - and a lack of advice for anything that balances those 2 (let&#39;s be ambitious and serve a large market and create the best products with great people, but let&#39;s run this as a marathon and not a sprint, and let&#39;s not risk everything on a big outcome)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Businesses that are shooting for the &#34;middle class&#34; (say, less than $50M in earnings at their peak) are of course possible and healthy and good for the economy. What&#39;s missing in this analysis is that those businesses are not going to be &#34;founder-friendly&#34; the way that the prototypical YC-seed-stage startup is. To use the article&#39;s definitions:* &#34;Bootstrapped from zero&#34; is, of course, founder-friendly - no investors and no board means you get to do what you want!* &#34;Raised $100M+ from VCs&#34; is also pretty founder-friendly, at least in the early days, because you&#39;re selling those VCs on the lottery-ticket dream that they could earn 3-5 orders of magnitude ROI. With such an incredibly high upside, VCs and angels are willing to take risks with zero due diligence on unproven founders and small dilution.If you remove the long tail of upside from the possible outcomes and tell your early investors &#34;the best case for you is 100x return, but zero is still just as possible&#34; then the market will compensate in these ways:* Less availability of capital* More dilution* Less faith in &#34;visionary founder&#34; CEOs and more desire by investors to bring in professional management* Long and protracted due diligence processes before the check even landsAll of that is fine! There&#39;s nothing wrong with building a business this way. But there&#39;s no free lunch here - companies that don&#39;t chase astronomical outcomes will have a harder path to getting those first few dollars in funding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post is describing a structural issue on the funding side of new ventures: -- bootstrapping is very hard- traditional credit/loans aren&#39;t structured well for the &#34;mid&#34; type risks of starting software businesses (not much collateral)- and on the VC side there is much less opportunity for the Unicorn 1 in 10 exits.Tackling this problem are two funds that I didn&#39;t see mentioned in either the article or the comments so far: TinySeed and Calm Fund.https://tinyseed.com/thesishttps://calmfund.com/shared-earnings-agreementBroadly both invest much less than a traditional VC would and are compensated differently. The details are different (and matter) between the two but it&#39;s more along the lines of profit sharing than looking for big exits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Progressive causes are near and dear to my heart. I am a feminist and staunch Democrat. As a federal public defender turned law professor, I have spent my career trying to make change in a criminal legal system that is riven with racism and fundamentally unfair to those without status and financial resources. Yet, as someone who understands firsthand that the fundamental rights to free speech and due process exist only as long as competent lawyers are willing to vigorously defend extreme positions and people, I view the ACLU’s hard-left turn with alarm. It smacks of intolerance and choosing sides, precisely what a civil-liberties organization designed to defend the Bill of Rights is meant to oppose.What an incredibly level headed take. It&#39;s so level headed that it seems fake when projected onto the landscape of modern political discourse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ACLU membership and staff have always been fairly left, but they were impressively focused on (IMO) the most important civil rights as rights through their work at ACLU, and largely kept their personal politics out of that.  A &#34;mission driven organization&#34;, as it were.  Pretty sad to see what&#39;s happened over the past few decades (accelerating; not sure when it started, but it got really bad around 2012-2016, and then far worse).  They always believed in &#34;all civil rights except 2A&#34;, but I could overlook that since there are other 2A-specific organizations.I still support them on specific issues, but they&#39;re often on the anti-liberty side on other issues, or just actually crazy. Sad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I consider myself socially liberal, am a non religious jew, and vote democrat.
I used to donate to the aclu monthly for ~2 years. The ACLU has absolutely lost its way. It should defend freedom of speech and the Bill of Rights regardless of the message its clients are attempting to spread. I donated to it specifically for that reason as I believe the Bill of Rights to be amongst the most perfect set of laws in existence. I stopped donating once the ACLU started openly choosing sides. Did not know about the Heard / Depp thing but if true that is absolutely outrageous and representative of an organization that is a shell of its former self."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a part of me that wants to abandon streaming services and just buy a couple of albums per month based on what I think might be cool. I find myself enjoying music significantly less now I have unlimited access to everything I could ever want. It’s become disposable; just background noise rather than something I’m actively experiencing.There is also a part of me that wants to take those albums and keep them on an old click-wheel iPod. I always thought the early iPod nanos were among the best consumer hardware devices ever made. Just the right mix of boxy and round; small enough to be novel (at least at the time), but large enough to still be perfectly usable. Unfortunately, finding one that both holds a charge and isn’t battered to all hell is quite difficult these days, and even so, it’s much harder to justify a single use device for music when I literally always have my phone with me.As someone who was a teen when the iPod really started taking off, it was a constant presence during the time music was starting to become an important part of my life. Sad to see it go, even though really it’s been gone since the iPhone launched."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a 6th gen iPod Classic that I used for almost 15 years before it finally died on me a few months back. Dedicated music players nowadays are a niche market, so it was really hard to find a replacement. I ended up getting a FiiO M5, and while it&#39;s definitely got some pros -- much better sound quality, can pop in a 512GB/1TB SD card for effectively infinite space for compressed songs, can play FLAC/WAV/OGG -- the ergonomics of the iPod were just so much better. It&#39;s funny how seemingly little things can be so frustrating: there&#39;s only enough space on the screen for 4 names at a time, the scrolling isn&#39;t adaptive so it takes forever to get to the bottom, the play order isn&#39;t consistent with the song display order within a folder... I used to love just browsing my music collection on my iPod on the train to work, but with the M5 I&#39;ll just pick an album or playlist and press play. It&#39;s just not as fun to flip through music.I don&#39;t consider myself an Apple fanboy, but the iPod was a rock solid product that got all of the little things right. Given that the market for standalone DAPs is tiny because most people today just use their phones and music streaming apps, it&#39;s unlikely that we&#39;ll ever see a music player that compares to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a press release: the actual main message -- iPod touch is being discontinued -- has been weasel-worded out of the entire text, to the point that a non-native reader of English wouldn&#39;t even be able to decipher what it&#39;s trying to say.I get that it&#39;s second nature for corporate marketing to try to dampen the message when they&#39;re taking something away, but this is on a whole new level."</p>

They always choose the most egregious crime to push through a cecession of rights. If you oppose this, you are supporting pedophiles. But fuck them. Don&#39;t let them gaslight you.There are countless broken laws that could be caught if only they could see our data.How long until they force Google or Apple to report someone to the authorities if their GPS says they are travelling 100mph on a road.How long until there is AI that can use your biometrics to determine if you are too impaired to drive?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I watch a lot of YouTube and a fair amount of Twitch. Sooner or later every creator talks a bit about their anxiety working in that content creator grind.On Twitch, taking a day off may mean losing hundreds of subscribers. Streamers are cautious about taking bathroom breaks since they can lose thousands of viewers during a short break. YouTube ruthlessly punishes creators that don&#39;t upload on a consistent schedule. I imagine TikTok and Instagram are similar.My guess is that Kottke has been living under a similar stress for 24 years. That has got to wear a person down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I took a 6 month sabbatical and am just now interviewing for work again. It&#39;s been one of the best decisions of my career and I would highly recommend everyone who can to save up and make it happen for themselves. I worked for over a decade before feeling burnt out and realizing I needed to make a change. Fortunately I&#39;d been saving for this for quite a while, knowing I&#39;d want to do it eventually. It&#39;s been amazing to have time to myself to ponder what I want out of the rest of my work life, enjoy hikes in the middle of the week, work on a side project, level up my cooking game, and spend time with friends and family without regard for having to return to work at the end of several week long vacations. I&#39;m eager to get back to work and am already looking forward to my next sabbatical and how it will affect my future self. Live a little leaner, save up, and take some time for yourself. We don&#39;t have much of it.Here&#39;s a relevant TED talk I found to be inspiring: https://www.ted.com/talks/stefan_sagmeister_the_power_of_tim..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly I prefer Apple Maps over Google these days. This is mostly opinion and feel, but it &#34;feels&#34; like:* Google is becoming less correct- ex: &#34;use the right 3 lanes&#34; when only the right 2 lanes work* Google is taking me on routes that are much less safe and more challenging- ex: taking small side roads to a left turn onto a busy road with poor visibility and no light rather than right turns to the main road and signaled lefts* Google is hammering me with unimportant details- ex: I don&#39;t care that I&#39;m on the fastest route- ex: I don&#39;t care that something 4 hours away has a traffic jam- ex: I don&#39;t need to be told to stay on just because an exit ramp has a disappearing lane* Google tries to send me on wild boondoggles literally all the time. It sends me off highway in an attempt to avoid traffic, along with several other poor lost souls who are aimlessly listening to the same computer as me while we drive through some rural thru street.So I stopped using google. Apple isn&#39;t perfect but it&#39;s unsurprising for long road trips and provides reliable instruction that follows major road paths."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, so I guess Apple Maps is the new DDG. By this I mean, every DDG related thread immediately descends into anecdotes about &#34;Google Search is terrible, DDG is much better&#34; that always leaves me wondering &#34;Are you using the same Google Search I am? Because it doesn&#39;t appear you are&#34;.Google Maps&#39; integration with, say, various forms of public transit APIs (in paritcular) is second to none. Like, it&#39;s not even close. It&#39;s true Apple Maps is a lot better than it was but most of those improvements, in my experience, have been very US-centric, meaning the gap is much, much wider in other countries. Google Maps listings are still way better.What I suepect is that the same people who have decided they hate Google have now let that define their opinions on Apple vs Google Maps just like they have with DDG vs Google Search.I can only recall two current complaints I have with Google Maps:1. I&#39;ve come across a listing that claims to be a supermarket chain. It&#39;s not. It&#39;s a local market. I&#39;ve filed corrections about this. A year later it still shows the wrong supermarket chain. No idea why. You can see it on street view; and2. Maps decided to hijack the Menu tab on restaurants to use an ML pipeline from someone who really wanted to get promoted by classifying photos tagged at that location into menu items instead of, you know, just showing me the menu PDF on the website.Oh and while I&#39;m airing complaints, there&#39;s a standard for showing exchange rates. Google &#34;GBP to USD&#34; and you&#39;l get an answer of 1.23 (as of this writing). By the standard the entire finance industry uses this should be shown to 4 decimal places. It used to up until about 6 years ago. Someone changed it. It&#39;s clearly wrong. It&#39;s annoying. And if anyone from Google reads this, please fix this for God&#39;s sake.Unrelated to Maps but you have to try."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I prefer Apple Maps in absolutely every way except their business info. Many businesses are missing, listed but no longer operating, or have incorrect/outdated business hours and other metadata. I do my best to add or correct info via the in-app crowdsourcing interface, but it often takes a long time for the information to be reflected if at all.That being said, it’s hard to compete with Google on data munging. Besides, if I’m actually looking for info on a business besides it’s location, I’d just Google it or visit its website anyways—especially post-pandemic as businesses close, open, and change hours so frequently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Microservices was always a solution to the organisational problem of getting more developers working on a system at once. A lot of people working on one code base over the top of each other often causes problems and issues with ownership. The solution was services independently developed with the trade off cost being increased complexity on a range of things.There is an essay in the mythical man month about Conways law and microservices are very much about a way to use Conways law to achieve scale of development. You likely don&#39;t need microservice until you hit a scale where the monolith is a real pain point. You can probably cope with a monolith especially with some reasonable design effort up to the 100 developers maybe more with a lot of separation but at some point in the &gt;25 developers range it becomes cheaper and easier to switch to multiple deployed units of software and deal with the increased system complexity and interface designs and the inherent versioning issues it causes.It is easier to start with a monolith, find the right design and then split on the boundaries than it is to make the correct microservices to begin with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Come to Erlang/Elixir (and OTP), you get the best of both worlds:  - a mono repository
  - a single codebase for a single system
  - your micro services are supervisors and gen servers (and a few other processes) in a supervision tree
  - you decide which erlang node run which apps
  - your monolith can scale easily thanks to libcluster and horde
  - ...

Also, there is the midpoint between monolith and micro service, and this is called Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), you could have:  - a DAL (Data Abstraction Layer) service
  - a Business Logic service (talking to the DAL)
  - an API (talking to the Business Logic service)
  - a Frontend (talking to the API)

Your API (or gateway, or whatever you want to call it) can serve as glue for third-party services (like Stripe, or anything unrelated to your business).Microservices are a solution for an organizational problem, not a tech one. You need multiple teams to work on the same system without blocking each others. This is a solution for huge corporations, not your 2 pizzas team startup."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The monolith vs microservice debate always seemed so misguided to me. It seems exactly like vim vs emacs. Or ruby vs python. The arguments are always the same.* &#34;In vim I can do this in 3 keystrokes, in emacs it takes 5!&#34; (where &#34;this&#34; is some vim-idiomatic thing you&#39;d never do in emacs).* &#34;Ruby leads to bad programs, I have inherited a legacy ruby codebase and you wouldn&#39;t believe what they did...&#34; / &#34;Python leads to bad programs, I have inherited a legacy python codebase and you wouldn&#39;t believe what they did...&#34;* My team took a python/ruby app and rewrote it ruby/python, and now it&#39;s 99% faster and our productivity is way higher!What I&#39;m hinting at is this: You can write a bad or good microservice or monolith. The rules are different. You&#39;ll have different frustrations and tradeoffs. You&#39;ll have to play to the architecture&#39;s strengths and avoid it&#39;s weaknesses. You&#39;ll NEED institutional standards to keep people from doing the wrong thing for the architecture model and making a mess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Last years, using MVC framework was not an option as soon as you wanted a dynamic front-end. Having to reload a full page for every user action leads to a bad user experience and is indeed, not acceptable in 2022.When it&#39;s needed, fine.But there are so many SPAs that just don&#39;t need to be. Rendering HTML server-side is just nice. It&#39;s simple and easy to work with. Weird states are unusual. The user gets a really normalized, predictable experience. And done well/quickly, there&#39;s little actual difference.Maybe I&#39;m just showing my age. This falls really close to my &#34;I miss the old web&#34; type sentiments. The last thing I built, and the next thing I will build, are purposely doing full page renders for any actions (no jQuery or React/SPA stuff). I don&#39;t think I&#39;m going to have any javascript at all. It&#39;s really fun and lean. I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just got me going lately--reminds me of when I was starting out.My last project is 300 lines of python, 270 lines of php, html/css of course, postgresql, and cron. Some scrapers run, ingest data, and the php sorts and displays it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The big MVC frameworks are in a great position to take advantage of the move back to hypermedia as a major network model for web development.  We are seeing a swing back to this model with modern hypermedia-oriented libraries like unpoly, hotwire and my own htmx, where javascript is used to augment the hypermedia model rather than replace it with a client-server RPC-style network model as with most SPAs.These older frameworks have been honed to a razors edge for producing hypermedia (HTML) server side and delivering it to clients efficiently.  As people begin to realize just how much you can achieve with this approach (and the simplicity it brings back to web development) I expect interest in these frameworks to soar.Bullish on 2005 tech books!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its funny how most languages have this whole separating between microservices and monoliths. Having worked with elixir for the last 5 years, One of its biggest benefits is the ability to have a microservice deployment while having a monolithic codebase.It comes with a reasonably good internal pubsub system and vm linking right out of the box. And the built in application supervisor makes it trivial to spawn thousands of threads on one machine, each with their own independently allocated heap, that can be mounted under a supervision tree.Want to create a microservice? just make a file, inherit the GenServer and add it to your application tree in your application.ex. Add a library like horde and you can create singletons in your codebase that are microservices. they run as a thread somewhere in your cluster. Just send it a message by nmae and the vm will know where to deliver it.The end result is the overhead of creating and maintaining a microservice in elixir is about the same as the overhead for adding a new controller."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This website has claims falsely that oxygen tanks need co2 scrubbers and candles don’t. That is not true and can get people hurt!You need co2 scrubbers for any oxygen producing solution, since co2 kills faster than o2 scarcity.Having a candle, and just a candle alone in a hermetically sealed room  will result in suffocation as fast as without it.I reported the post as it contains false and dangerous info."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Smarter Every Day did an interesting series of videos about nuclear submarines.They use these candles to help replenish the oxygen in them: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g3Ud6mHdhlQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hollywood has always perpetuated the myth that when you are in an air tight room you&#39;ll die as you run out of oxygen. The CO2 poisoning will kill you before you run out of oxygen.So, if you&#39;re sitting in a nuclear shelter, remember to get the CO2 scrubbers working first, then worry about the low oxygen."</p>
