								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have to wonder how much releasing these models will &#34;poison the well&#34; and fill the internet with AI generated images that make training an improved model difficult. After all if every 9/10 &#34;oil painted&#34; image online starts being from these generative models it&#39;ll become increasingly difficult to scrape the web and to learn from real world data in a variety of domains. Essentially once these things are widely available the internet will become harder to scrape for good data and models will start training on their own output. The internet will also probably get worse for humans since search results will be completely polluted with these &#34;sort of realistic&#34; images which can ultimately be spit out at breakneck speed by smashing words from a dictionary together..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seeing the artificial restrictions to this model as well as to DALL-E 2, I can&#39;t help but ask myself why the porn industry isn&#39;t driving its own research. Given the size of that industry and the sheer abundance of training material, it seems just a matter of time until you can create photo realistic images of yourself with your favourite celebrity for a small fee. Is there anything I am missing? Can you only do this kind of research at google or openai scale?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing that no one predicted in AI development was how good it would become at some completely unexpected tasks while being not so great at the ones we supposed/hoped it would be good.AI was expected to grow like a child. Somehow blurting out things that would show some increasing understanding on a deep level but poor syntax.In fact we get the exact opposite. AI is creating texts that are syntaxically correct and very decently articulated and pictures that are insanely good.And these texts and images are created from a text prompt?! There is no way to interface with the model other than by freeform text. That is so weird to me.Yet it doesn’t feel intelligent at all at first. You can’t ask it to draw “a chess game with a puzzle where white mates in 4 moves”.Yet sometimes GPT makes very surprising inferences. And it starts to feel like there is something going on a deeper level.DeepMind’s AlphaXxx models are more in line with how I expected things to go. Software that gets good at expert tasks that we as humans are too limited to handle.Where it’s headed, we don’t know. But I bet it’s going to be difficult to tell the “intelligence” from the “varnish”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t really see which bits of web3 are meant to threaten the existing web, or are more dangerous to it than the existing threats.The balkanization of the web seems like a threat that gets bigger every year. Surveillance gets worse every year. Regulatory attempts to combat certain kinds of surveillance do so by shifting the burden of &#34;consent&#34; on to users who don&#39;t understand what they&#39;re consenting to. Fewer and fewer people have any kind of &#34;ownership&#34; of the web in the form of personal servers, privately-hosted websites, independent self-managed communities, and so on.Perhaps web3 could be a danger if it proposes unworkable solutions to those problems. Token economies and blockchains do give a kind of &#34;ownership&#34; and &#34;participation&#34;, but the sheer volatility of the pricing of the goods, services and induced-scarcity &#34;land&#34; on offer makes it impractically risky or expensive for anyone who isn&#39;t running some kind of trading strategy.There are lots of good critiques of web3, and good arguments against specific projects, features, or consequences it produces. &#34;Keep the web free&#34; is a fine idea, but I&#39;m not sure that web3 is where the real danger comes from."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Random thought - is Web3 a real danger to the currently existing web, where &#34;real&#34; means &#34;plausible&#34; rather than just &#34;possible&#34;?I&#39;m asking because every Web3 project I have seen so far has collapsed after getting just enough speculators (and therefore money) to make a nice rug pull/attack, but well before gaining any significant traction of non-paying users that are there to use the platform rather than speculate. It seems to me that it&#39;s completely unsustainable to keep a Web3 project running long enough to even gain these users in any way.It seems to me that Web3 is, so far, only providing us with three things: the first is a way to speculate, the second is a way to waste our electricity, the third is laughing stock via https://web3isgoinggreat.com/ which only sorta sweetens points number one and two.Are there any notable exceptions to my above observation? Am I wrong in some more fundamental way?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; My mother is amazing to watch because she doesn&#39;t do anything efficiently, really: She puts about three times as much energy as necessary into everything she does. But she never spends any time wondering what to do next or how to optimize anything; she just keeps working. Her strategy, slightly simplified, is, &#34;See something that needs to be done and do it.&#34; All day long. And at the end of the day, she&#39;s accomplished a huge amount.This strategy is remarkably powerful and I&#39;ve used it to great effect in my career. Committing yourself to pushing forward every single day, even if just a little bit, and always just peeling off one single thing you can do next (even if it&#39;s tiny yet takes you all day) has a dizzying compounding effect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Recently, I came across a few old and new interviews of Donald KnuthI have developed the conclusion that reading digestive summary from original source materials is ultimately ineffective for me at this stage of the life.Unfortunately, the author did not provide links to these interviews.For anyone who is writing a summary from other source material, please do provide references. That&#39;s one of the things I learned churning out low quality academic papers in PhD study."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; ...it turns up in Philippians 3:16, where the writer says that:&gt; &#34;You don&#39;t race to get to the goal; the process of racing itself, of keeping the pace, is the real goal.
When I go on vacation, I like to enjoy the drive.&#34;&gt; In Christian churches I am least impressed by a sermon that talks about how marvelous heaven is going to be at the end. To me that&#39;s not the message of Christianity. The message is about how to live now, not that we should live in some particular way because there&#39;s going to be pie in the sky some day. The end means almost nothing to me. I am glad it&#39;s there, but I don&#39;t see it as much of a motivating force, if any. I mean, it&#39;s the journey that&#39;s important.---This is Philippians 3:16: &#34;Only let us live up to what we have already attained.&#34;It&#39;s hard for me to connect that to the paraphrase given above. Furthermore, the previous few verses (12-14) of that same chapter seem to be more goal-oriented, than process-oriented:&#34;Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me. Brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do: Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus.&#34;Also see 1 Corinthians 15:19:&#34;If only for this life we have hope in Christ, we are of all people most to be pitied.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some context: The Green Party had long been diametrically opposed to nuclear, to the extent that they have twice exited a coalition government in protest of granting additional reactor permits. Over the past ten years their position has gradually shifted though, thanks to STEM-oriented Greens in particular, as it has become obvious that AGW is a bigger threat than nuclear. This in spite of several setbacks:– Obviously, the Fukushima disaster of 2011.– The fact that the Olkiluoto 3 reactor project [1], a 1600MW PWR unit, was plagued by chronic delays and cost overruns – it is only now being connected to the grid, over ten years behind schedule. OL3&#39;s fundamental problem was that the European nuclear industry simply was not up to the task of delivering a first-of-its-kind, ambitious third-gen reactor after a fifteen-year hiatus during which no new nuclear power plants were built in Europe.– Another planned nuclear plant, Hanhikivi [2], had problems finding a Western reactor supplier; after some arguably rather shady dealings, a contract was made with Rosatom, the state nuclear corporation of Russia. This received some well-earned criticism, but Finnish decisionmakers (perhaps naively) wanted to think there was no political dimension to such an agreement. After February 24, the project is now almost certainly dead in the water, never having left the planning and design phase.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olkiluoto_Nuclear_Power_Plant#...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanhikivi_Nuclear_Power_Plant"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great, and hopefully it will stop the premature shutdown of existing nuclear reactors.But it&#39;s pretty tiny climate news overall. Nuclear reactors are aging out and nobody in Western Europe or the US seems to know how to build in a cost competitive way anymore.Deploying 5GW of solar and storage, or 3-4GW of wind, is far easier, faster, and cheaper than trying to build a new reactor, which won&#39;t come on line for a bare minimum of 10 years, best case. We don&#39;t have that long to wait to start replacing nearly all of our fossil fuel infrastructure, and replace the nuclear reactors that are reaching end of life.If nuclear was going to be a climate solution, then all the nuclear reactors started in the 2000s needed to complete on time and on schedule to encourage the building of more. Instead it&#39;s 2022 and we are still waiting to see how bad the financial disaster will be for them. That&#39;s not the route towards building more nuclear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funding for the source is interesting:&gt; &#34;The Alliance for Science is a global communications initiative based at the Boyce Thompson Institute, an independent nonprofit research institute affiliated with Cornell University. Our primary source of support is the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation.&#34;The article does gloss over where Finland would source its uranium from.  A GW-scale nuclear power plant burns through ~200 tons of fuel rods per year, and Finland&#39;s supplier seems to have been the Russian state-owned uranium outfit Rosatom:https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/rosatoms-unit-seeks-...Finland does have plans to start mining and refining uranium ore, but it looks like they&#39;ll produce only enough for one reactor:&gt; &#34;Last year, 35% of Finnish electricity production came from the country’s four nuclear reactors, whose owners Fortum and TVO buy their nuclear fuel from other countries including Russia, France and Canada.&#34;Anyone holding ownership in Canada&#39;s high-grade uranium ores is likely going to do well by this move.  About that...https://www.cnbc.com/2021/02/25/bill-gates-nuclear-power-wil...Regardless, countries like Finland which are solar-limited for much of the year are the obvious place for nuclear.  Whether they can make their domestic uranium mining operations &#39;clean and fossil-fuel free&#39;, and secure reasonably priced contracts for importing the rest of their required reactor fuel, remains to be seen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;What if it changes?&#34; is a reasonable question to ask. But every time you do you are walking a tightrope. My rule of thumb is that we look at what is in use TODAY, and then write a decent abstraction around that. If something is used once, ignore any abstractions. If it&#39;s used twice, just copy it, it&#39;s better. If it&#39;s used 3 or more times, look at writing an abstraction that suits us TODAY not for the future. Bonus points if the abstraction allows us to extend easily in the future, but nothing should be justified with a &#34;what if&#34;.The reason a lot of Java or C# code is written with all these abstractions is because it aids unit testing. But I&#39;ve come to love just doing integration testing. I still use unit testing to test complex logic, but things like &#34;does this struct mapper work correctly&#34; are ignored, we&#39;ll find out from our integration tests. If our integration tests work, we&#39;ve fulfilled our part of the contract, that&#39;s all we care about. Focus on writing them and making them fast and easy to run. It&#39;s virtually no different to unit tests but just 10x easier to maintain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition . https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpris...You never know when you might need to change the implementation of how the &#34;Fuzz&#34; string is returned, so you need a FuzzStringReturner.And you never know when you might need multiple different ways of returning &#34;Fuzz&#34;, so you need a FuzzStringReturnerFactory.And for SOLID it&#39;s important to separate concerns, so you want your FuzzStringReturnerFactory separate from your FuzzStringPrinterFactory.And that barely scratches the surface of what you need!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t seen anyone else point out: One of the ways you can often identify really experienced programmers is by them being able to pretty accurately separate thing-that-probably-will-change from things-that-probably-won&#39;t.Finding a good way to balance YAGNI with this-will-definitely-change-in-a-few-months-because-it-always-does is incredibly hard, and I&#39;ve really appreciated working with engineers who make that prediction correctly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the bad old Linux days, if you read a huge amount of data off the disk (like if you were doing a backup) Linux would try to take all that data and jam it in the page cache. This would push out all the useful stuff in your cache, and sometimes even cause swapping as Linux helpfully swaps out stuff to make room for more useless page cache.One of the great things about `dd` is that you have a lot of control how the input and output files are opened. You can bypass the page cache when reading data by using iflag=direct, which would stop this from happening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Useful uses of dd(1).There remain some useful applications of dd.  These may of course be achieved by other mechanisms, but typically less conveniently.1. Read a specific number of blocks or bytes from a source:  dd if=/dev/hda of=/root/mbr bs=512 count=1

This will make a copy of, say, your master boot record (first 512 bytes of your first disk drive) and stash it in your /root directory.2. Read from specific bytes of a file  dd if=mydata skip=1k bs=32 count=1

Reads 32 bytes after the first 1024 (1k) bytes of &#34;mydata&#34;.3. Write to specific bytes of a file  dd if=source of=target seek=10k bs=512 count=1 conv=notrunc

That should write 512 bytes from &#34;source&#34; beginning 10k into &#34;target&#34;.  (I&#39;ve not tested this, you should verify.)4. Create a sparse file.  Sparse files appear to have a nonzero size, but take up no space on disk, until data is actually written to them.  These are often used as &#34;inflating&#34; dynamic filesystem images for virtual machines.  dd if=/dev/zero of=sparsefile bs=1 count=0 seek=20000M # Create 20 GB sparse file

5. Case conversions.  Sure, you could use tr(1), but where&#39;s the sport?  dd if=MixEdCaSE of=lcase conv=lcase   # Convert to lower case
  dd if=MixEdCaSE of=ucase conv=ucase   # Convert to upper case

6. ASCII / EBCDIC conversions  dd if=ebcdic of=ascii conv=ascii   # ebcdic -&gt; ascii
  dd if=ascii of=ebcdic conv=ebcdic  # ascii -&gt; ebcdic


When reading to or from IBM data tapes, you might find blocking / unblocking conversions useful.  I&#39;ve done this, but it&#39;s so long ago that I don&#39;t trust my memory on that any more.  Odds are good you&#39;ll not have to worry about this.There are other useful applications as well, though these are not typically encountered very often.  Do feel free to explore and attempt these on safe media."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While there’s a lot of truth here, there are times when you can do much better than cat. A while back I tweeted:Today I found the magical dd command that causes an NVMe drive to run at almost full speed:  # dd if=/dev/nvme3n1 bs=4096k iflag=direct of=/dev/null status=progress
  959090524160 bytes (959 GB, 893 GiB) copied, 178 s, 5.4 GB/s

The trick to getting this throughput is telling Linux to do an insanely large IO (4 MiB). The drive can&#39;t do 4 MiB reads - the largest IO it can handle is 2 MiB.  # nvme id-ctrl /dev/nvme3 | grep mdts
  mdts      : 9
  # echo &#39;4 \* 2^9&#39; | bc -l

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As incremental construction goes, my grandma&#39;s house in North Dakota is a pretty good example.  It went from a one story small home to a two story home with a wrap-around deck.  I&#39;m sure it was some ordered house put on a basement.  It had an outhouse in the 70&#39;s but indoor plumbing was added.  I remember sometime in the 80&#39;s putting in a support beam so they could remove some of the walls and support the second story.  It was an all-hands task of the relatives with most of my uncle and aunts.  I remember Dad&#39;s reaction when Grandma announced she had bought a wood stove to put in the house.  That was a fun install requiring the removal of a wall, brick base, and running venting.There was a bit of danger in all this expansion.  The look of utter horror on my Dad&#39;s and Uncle&#39;s face when we turned off all the breakers and the stove was still on makes me laugh but was deadly serious at the time.  Fixing that was a bit of an adventure.  Dad and Uncle traced every wire in the damn house and I learned some new insults."</p>

Is that more common in water-restricted municipalities? (I live in midwestern US, where backyard gardens are very common.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like that the author gave some context at the top. So many times I struggle to read or realize the importance of a concept because there just isn&#39;t enough context for me to follow along.And certainly not all blogs have to, but it&#39;s nice when it is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So ARM64 has dedicated instructions for CRC32, but implementing it by hand using SIMD is still faster. Score another point for RISC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Could you combine both techniques to run both the SIMD version on some chunks and the crc32 instruction on other chunks, in parallel? Of course this would only work if they execute on different ports."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The only way you could possibly measure this is just to look at the distribution of coins among wallets. This is obviously going to count crypto exchanges as single entities, which is absurd.It&#39;d be like counting JPMorgan as a single person when computing wealth inequality in the US. Analyses like these are a total joke."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Several issues with using this metric to measure wealth inequality for crypto currencies, especially those with smart contracts like Ethereum.- A single address might be a contract like WETH, which can hold tens of billions of dollars worth of tokens despite all users in the network having access to it. Similar with centralized exchanges holding many tokens. Addresses are not users.- This metric often confuses “inequality of interest” with “inequality of wealth.” A user holding $10,000 of ETH and another user holding $100 of ETH may be in similar fiat-wealth brackets, but one is more interested &amp; invested in crypto than the other.- It is very easy to spin up a new wallet as it’s effectively just a random unique number. A single user might have 10-20 wallets with almost-zero tokens leftover, and all of their assets concentrated on one or two accounts, which further skews this stat.- A number of tokens in the network are inaccessible due to being locked in a contract or sent to a burn address. The standard ETH burn address has $250M worth of tokens.There is a lot of crypto disparity and inequality but this stat at face value is fairly meaningless."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to see the methodology. I guarantee you they can&#39;t actually determine the claim.Beyond that, bitcoin wasn&#39;t designed to &#34;decentralize wealth and power&#34;, it is a disingenuous claim made by an agenda poster. Bitcoin was created to take a step towards a future where economic power is not synonymous with political power. The natural distribution of wealth is not at issue, so long as it&#39;s just that: natural."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s funny about this is that I can recall discussions here and elsewhere from only a few months ago questioning the &#34;guaranteed&#34; super-high returns. I forget who said this but someone awhile ago said in finance said that if someone is promising you consistent above-market returns it&#39;s either a scam or there is unknown or undisclosed risk.And the Crypto Andys were all like &#34;you just don&#39;t understand DeFi!&#34; to which the retort is &#34;No, you just don&#39;t understand finance&#34;.Finance is the way it is for many reasons. There are thousands of years of lessons that have made the system the way it is. I get the innovator mentality of sweeping away the old but there seems to be a fine line between innovation and ignorance.I&#39;m just sitting on the sidelines watching people relearn all the lessons of finance the hard way, some because they think they understand finance because because they understand merkle trees and consensus protocols but really most just want to get rich quick."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; While we have informed users that there are no absolute guarantees against risksI&#39;m... uh.... fairly certain this was not the crux of their marketing which severly downplayed the underlying risk. There is also a huge spectrum between &#34;we cannot guarantee that there is 0 risk&#34; (which seems to be what the above sentence is saying), and &#34;there exists a risk that all of your funds disappears in 24 hours&#34;.It seems like there is some serious rewriting of history going on here.Question though, do the founders here have any potential criminal liability from this whole situation (including apparently lying about what they were doing with their customers funds)?"</p>
