								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the movie The War Lover, Steve McQueen (well, the actual pilot) pilots a B17 bomber &#34;cutting the grass&#34;, i.e. flying low with the gear up. The stunt was to be done with models because it was too dangerous.My dad was in the AF at the time, and was assigned to the movie as a consultant on AF trivia. He convinced them that the stunt could be done safely, and explained how to do it.And so it was done. My dad got in trouble, because if the B17 had crashed doing the stunt, the AF would have looked bad. But it didn&#39;t crash, and the stunt was a big deal to the movie crowds, so he was forgiven.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TGGynxYbA48It&#39;s still freakin&#39; impressive today.His other contribution to the movie was the mission briefing wall maps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most fascinating non-CGI effect from Terminator 2 is a cut scene which can be seen in the director&#39;s cut, where they use Linda Hamilton twin sister in a surprising way: to fake a &#34;mirror&#34; scene where Sarah is operating on the Terminator&#39;s head.They are in front of a mirror. They wanted to actually use Arnie in the reflection to show his face; they wanted a dummy for the head closest to the camera, to show the surgery inside the head. So they used a window in the wall instead of a mirror! Linda Hamilton and her twin sister are mimicking each other&#39;s movements to make it seem it&#39;s a mirror image.(The other use of Linda&#39;s twin sister, the scene where the T-1000 fakes being Sarah, is better known)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As more data comes out about Google, Apple, Amazon, one simple underlying thing becomes clear: a single company cannot be trusted to operate a marketplace while also being a participant.Apple&#39;s App Store insider knowledge lets them discover popular apps, then boot them off the platform when they decide to compete. Amazon sees what products are successful and profitable, then makes knock-offs which they promote over the originals. And now, reading into this, Google is manipulating their ad markets using inside knowledge.It&#39;s all very profitable.If we cannot trust large companies to not abuse this kind of power, then they should be prevented by law from playing both sides. This may result in the breakup of some very large companies, akin to the 1934 Air Mail Act that broke up Boeing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The lawsuit also highlights Google&#39;s use of a secret program dubbed &#34;Project Bernanke&#34; in 2013 that used bidding data to give its own ad-buying an advantage. For example, in a 2015 iteration of the program, Google allegedly dropped the second-highest bids from publishers&#39; auctions, accumulated money into a pool and then spent that money to inflate only the bids belonging advertisers who used the company&#39;s Google Ads. They otherwise would have likely lost the auctions, the states alleged.Can someone rephrase this and possibly explain like I&#39;m five? I&#39;m not following the mechanics..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Still waiting for investigators to look into Chrome.In 2009 we were finally getting rid of IE and the web browser market was a healthy ecosystem with lots and lots of innovation happening.Today we are soon back on a browser monoculture with the owner of the most popular product being a company that has enormous interest in killing certain parts of the ecosystem and also has a long history of killing of their own products.How did it happen? In my opinion: massive abuse of power in two other markets (search and ads) to push their way into browsers as well. (Well, I&#39;m feeling I might have been too generous above: I could add 2 more - video and office tools - by pointing how they selectively make Google Docs and YouTube perform worse in Firefox, being so brazen about it that just changing the headers so that Firefox identifies itself as Chrome makes the problems go away.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When another thread pushes a socket to be processed by the socket polling thread, the socket polling thread calls select() on that function. Since select() is a blocking call, when another socket is pushed to the socket polling thread queue it has to somehow interrupt select() so the new socket gets processed ASAP. How does one interrupt select() function? Apparently, we used QueueUserAPC() to execute asynchronous procedure while select() was blocked… and threw an exception out of it!Not taking anything away from the great debugging, but that is just incredibly bad design and reeks of bugs from a mile away. System calls block for a reason. If you can&#39;t handle the blocking, how about a non-blocking architecture? But in this case, the engineer thought &#34;hey, I don&#39;t want to block on my precious main thread, so let&#39;s just give this blocking thing to another thread, that&#39;ll surely solve it!&#34;. Except it doesn&#39;t when you use that same thread as a worker to execute all other thread&#39;s blocking crap ... but then write the queue push() function to be blocking as well!Keep it simple folks. Bad design always breeds more bad design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read this and couldn&#39;t shake the feeling that it&#39;s a fantasy tale because it mentions the mystical Unity support engineer who actually fixes bugs - the one I haven&#39;t been able to get a hold on for the past 5 years, despite having critical bugs escalated by support... But then I noticed this is from 2016, so before they started kicking out experienced people to polish their profit margin for the IPO.Still an amazing debugging story, though :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article: &#34;Surprisingly, setting up kernel debugging is extremely easy on Windows.&#34;Microsoft (at least used to) take developers very seriously. The OS actually plays along when you&#39;re trying to debug things, and Windows error reporting actually sends you data that you can work with.Say what you want about their business practices, but I&#39;d deal with Microsoft&#39;s developer support over Apple&#39;s anytime.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"RTings, a site that reviews (amongst other things) televisions, maintains a list of fully ad-free models:https://www.rtings.com/tv/tests/ads-in-smart-tv(They are the ones with &#34;10&#34; in the ad-free column)The dominant brand for ad-free models is in fact... Vizio."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had my Vizio TV (P55-F1, 2019 model; a mid range model) for about 2.5 years now. Image/sound quality is great. But the annoyances and overall mediocrity of the OS and its updates [0] made me just disconnect the TV from the internet and fully switch over to using an Apple TV for all consumption rather than using the native Vizio OS.[0]: The OS is terrible and the remote randomly stops working sometimes. Sometimes the TV would take tens of seconds to turn on, but then other times it was near instant.Every single update since I&#39;ve gotten the TV seems to make the TV even slower/more laggy. There was even an update about two years back where the Youtube app&#39;s volume was inexplicably an order of magnitude lower than every other input&#39;s volume (e.g. a volume of 100/100 on the Youtube app ended up being equivalent to a volume of 10/100 for all other apps/inputs). It took Vizio 1-3 months to fix it.Unblockable ads on the home screen and genuinely multi-hundred millisecond response times on the app launcher infuriated me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is likely incorrect.The $57.3 million is for the &#34;Platform+&#34; division. It includes profit from homescreen ads, selling of buttons on remotes, and cuts of streaming revenue. It&#39;s likely that only a small fraction of the division&#39;s $83 million in revenue comes from tracking and then selling viewing habits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On a similar theme, I remember reading a story about a server that would crash mysteriously every couple of weeks. They eventually worked out that this happened whenever there was a new moon or a full moon, and the resulting high tide caused a battleship moored in a nearby harbour to rise just high enough that its powerful radar would interfere with the server."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;When did this start?  A
few days ago, you said, but did anything change in your systems at that time?&#34;&gt; &#34;Well, the consultant came in and patched our server and rebooted it.&gt; Having established that--unbelievably--the problem as reported was true,
and repeatableAs far as problems go, this is an easy one to solve. Accurate description of the problem. Accurate reporting of what changed. Problem is consistently repeatable.Compared to a problem that doesn’t reliably reproduce and for which the person reporting it claims nothing changed, this one is child’s play.But it’s still amusing to read every time.I had something similar occur in the early 2000s on a patch release of Solaris 2.6 (I think) where the sleep call was broken and would always return almost instantly. This caused all sorts of weird behaviors on the running system.I also recall the first time I ran into an issue with MTU on a dedicated frame relay link we had to admin our web farm in the late nineties. One day a developer reported they could login to our bastion but when they ran “ls -l” in a big enough directory their ssh connection would hang. It turned out the connection would hang whenever a packet was generated near the MTU and we eventually tracked it down to an issue with the frame relay connection. We played with MTUs until we found out what worked. It then took a while to convince our provider what was going on but they eventually replaced a line card on the far end of the connection which allowed us to re-raise the MTU to 1500.Another fun problem I had was an email to SMS gateway I wrote for myself that worked by posting to a Verizon web form. I developed it on a Mac (probably 2002 or so) where it worked fine but when I deployed it to my Linux box on my same home network, the script couldn’t connect to Verizon’s site. It turned out the Linux box was a setting a flag on the TCP connection (ECN I think) that was tripping up Verizon’s web firewall. The work-around was disabling ECN on the Linux box."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me a problem I&#39;m currently having.  My iPhone freezes completely sometimes when I ride BART, requiring a hard reboot.  I notice it happens when passing the Daly City station.  It seems there&#39;s a strong signal tower nearby that the strong signal causes the problem.  It&#39;s probably the strength level read by the hardware causing an out of bound error somewhere and corrupting the phone&#39;s memory."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This brings back great memories. Windows 2000 sparked my interest in computing.I was in elementary school and was obsessed with the &#39;Log on to&#39; 
dropdown box on Windows login screens, and how you could use the same credentials on any PC.Somehow I managed to salvage an old computer and source myself a copy of the ISO and managed to setup an ADDS domain controller and join my mother&#39;s laptop to the domain.I went and asked the IT guy for advice on doing a multi forest configuration and I think it blew his mind.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually cut my sysadmin teeth on Windows 2000, and found myself wondering how on earth they could `docker exec` a shell. These were, comparatively, the dark ages of Windows administration, and almost all tasks were done through a GUI.The implementation is nothing short of genius: they use a Windows version of `netcat` (the common UNIX tool, but compiled for Windows from the Windows 2000 Resource Kit), then use `srvany` (also from the Windows 2000 Resource Kit) to start `netcat` as a system service, but with `cmd.exe` piped to its standard in and out.Kudos on this solution!"</p>

In particular, number theory and data structures are two fields that I have come to love almost entirely because of this website. I did a random selection of the first 200 problems on my own about a decade ago but ran out of steam as the problems got harder.Recently, however, I introduced it at work as a way of encouraging the team I manage to work collaboratively. We have a fortnightly catch up where we talk through solutions, pick new problems (we have a script that randomly picks an easy, medium and hard problem, which has become an exciting ritual), and then we have an initial discussion about each of the new problems.It&#39;s a good way to foster group work. It&#39;s also a great way to introduce people to using version control and pull-requests in a non-scary way!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; When people buy access to a service via a subscription in an iOS app, they are essentially Apple’s customers. For privacy reasons Apple does not provide much information about them to the apps or businesses that run the apps. That means it’s hard to do customer service, address issues, or solve any problems.&gt; “The user experience is much worse,” a marketing executive from one company told me. “When you buy with the developer, they have a relationship with you ... when you buy from Apple: sorry, you’re Apple’s customer, not ours, and if you have a problem with a subscription … we can’t really help them.”Now interview a real user of subscriptions instead of a brand marketing executive and ask them if the user experience is worse.PS. Even when not confronted with such a piece, remember that Forbes is no longer the business journalism folks may have grown up with.  For the past decade, it’s a blogging platform for independent contributors:&gt; Each contributor flies solo with his own blog. He is responsible for conceiving and creating the content, ensuring its accuracy and building an engaged, loyal readership.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That Apple would do this is interesting, but more interesting to me is Google&#39;s position, and obligation, here. There was a throw-away line in the article about Google &#34;not doing anything about it&#34;. What could or should Google do about it? Has Google mediated between competitive ad-buyers in the past? I am not sympathetic to goog in general but it seems like that line puts them in a no-win situation: either they err for not doing anything, or they err for doing something (but not the right thing). Indeed, in this case it would seem the corrective action would better come from Apple than from Google. (Also note this whole play feels like Apple trying to get creative with ways to productively bleed off ridiculously huge capital reserves in a low risk way.

I posted this in our company slack room as an example of how not to act for bizdevGoogle benefits too much from this sort of arrangement to have any incentive to stop it, even though these are unauthorized advertisements that are specifically against Google&#39;s AdWords TOS (side note, I wonder if there is a legal avenue to follow when a vendor doesn&#39;t follow their own TOS? An interesting thought...).This is also a recurring issue with all of Google&#39;s advertising revenue -- malicious behavior such as fraudulent clicks, unauthorized ads, etc., are a decent portion of the revenue stream, and Google is financially incentivized to keep these sorts of abuse going until the ruse is up and the accuracy of their system is called into question publicly in a way that scares away advertisers, but with NDAs and corporate secrecy, it is far too easy to keep things unbalanced, and keep abuse like this in the dark.Business models like this demonstrate just how dire the need for regulation is in some areas of the tech world, particularly among FANG."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The beginning of this article is a fairy tale that ignores what used to be one of the biggest drivers of revenue for banks: overdraft fees. Maybe the HN crowd has never been in a situation where they were auto-billed into a negative balance, which then caused an overdraft fee that then further drove their balance into negative territory, but this was a weekly/monthly fiasco for millions of Americans.I was once in a meeting with one of the senior executives at JPMorgan, where the guy smugly told me he felt they were “doing a service for the community” by charging people overdraft fees. After leaving the meeting, my very senior colleague said, “I had to hold myself back from throwing that guy out of his window.”These sorts of articles — half PR, half history lesson — tend to leave out these sorts of politically inconvenient but important bits of history. It’s so much work to unpack the bias..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Typically, the apps offer their users a choice: payouts at the speed of banking, for free, or payouts at the speed of the Internet, for a small convenience fee. Cash App charges 1.5% with a minimum of a quarter.This is just another way the financial system (including fintech startups) preys on the poor. If you are well off, you wouldn&#39;t want to pay any convenience fee for the privilege of receiving money from a business a few days earlier. In fact, you can think of it as interest: from first principles if someone delays a payment to you, theoretically they should pay more because of interest; now if you opt for waiting 3 days and saving the 1.5% convenience fee, you would effectively earn an interest of 1/(1-0.015)-1 = 1.5% in 3 days. That&#39;s not even an annualized figure. If annualized it would be 1.5%/3*365=122% implied annual interest rate. No one in their right mind who does not have cash flow issues would opt for receiving debit card payments with such a fee.&gt; Many report that it transforms the nature of their interaction with the underlying application; delivery driving for casual drivers becomes something that you can burst up to fill an immediate cash need or mentally allocate against a particular desired expenditure (e.g. “Drive for 3 hours to afford a night out starting immediately after you log off.”)If your cash flow is not an issue and have credit, this is how you would handle it: let&#39;s drive for 3 hours, receive the full payment amount in a few days instead of immediately, and put all the charges from the night out on a credit card, whose bill will become due in a month or two, with no interest. But the poor doesn&#39;t have a bank account or a credit card, so they suffer. They pay more in fees. That&#39;s the injustice of the system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I took a look through glassdoor reviews of stripe as a result of his pitch at the end - lots of complaints about work-life balance / being overworked. Any stripe engineers want to weigh in on that? Are there areas of the company that are better than others?"</p>
