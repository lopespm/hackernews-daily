								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every Node.js dev should be thanking the Deno creators. It has forced them off of their &#34;this is how Node does it&#34; complacency. Most improvements I notice and care about on Node these days are all things that Deno already supports (fetch, ES modules, async std lib uses promises, etc).The Web Platform APIs aren&#39;t perfect, but they are better, and more thoroughly thought out than Node&#39;s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My biggest issue with node when I was working on it briefly was I couldn&#39;t do the &#39;import&#39; statements like wepback. Are they supported too now?I&#39;m not a web developer so I had a very hard time understanding why there are so many different type of imports in JavaScript like require, import, umd, amd, etc and which one works in browser and which one works in node?Also why do so many libraries have this strange 5 line header code for this umd, amd, business. Is that to make their packages work with nodejs?Does anyone who knows enough JavaScript point me in the right direction about it. I find all this very confusing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Strong disagree. I&#39;ve made it my policy to never work with a recruiter that isn&#39;t affiliated with the company they&#39;re hiring for. Recruiting farms like Cyber Recruiters (yuck) will do everything in their power to waste your time out of sheer incompetence and disinterest.I&#39;ve &#34;doubled&#34; my salary plenty of times through this policy.But the real secret sauce is referrals. Companies always prioritize a strong referral, ignoring mediocre interview performance, and will even skip the reference checks so I don&#39;t have to bug my network."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Alternate approach: build a relationship with the 99th percentile super-recruiter that basically all the startups that know what they are doing in your area use to hire, and go to him for a job.In NYC, this is that dude: https://www.linkedin.com/in/johnkeenan/I send all my friends to him when looking for jobs. He also doesn&#39;t lie to you and since he has a technical background, will rarely place anyone in a bad fit. He&#39;s literally sent 2nd tier candidates to other recruiters.It&#39;s a rich get richer game and the super-connectors have way more candidates and companies to match, effectively creating their own market. I believe John makes mid 7 digits a year from placements, plus companies love him and candidates keep going back to him for their next job.Once you have that reputation, it looks like art next to the other 99% of hustling recruiters that are trying to place poor fit candidates into the 3 roles they are &#34;working on&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also recommend a response to every recruiter, but you don&#39;t need to explain your privilege, you don&#39;t need to suck up to them, and you don&#39;t need to justify your actions.&#34;Hey ____. Before we move forward, can you provide me with the company name, a job description, and the expected compensation. Regards&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m concerned about the timing  of this.  Former CEO Dan Ammann, fired in December, was a big champion of the robotaxi business model.  It is speculated he was fired because GM CEO Mary Barra disagrees with this strategy and wants them to focus more on integration with existing GM vehicles.I am afraid that the robotaxi timeline was pulled in so that the rest of the believers inside Cruise can get supporting data to prove it’s a viable model and to make it harder for Mary to change its course.  This may come at the expense of safety."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Refusing service when the user does not consent to non-essential data sharing is illegal in the EU, and it also breaches Google Play&#39;s developer agreement. WiFi scanning is not essential to navigate with an app, and the least they could do to follow the law is to gracefully degrade the service if the user does not consent to share data about nearby devices, such as disabling traffic predictions.Of course Google&#39;s lawyers will argue that this data is in fact required for navigation, the same way some banks in the EU now claim &#34;legitimate interest&#34; when they send you a message about their credit card promotions with winnable prizes, after you&#39;ve explicitly opted out from all marketing communications."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not related to Google maps, but just today I got tired of the Amazon app sending me &#34;you might like this deal&#34; notifications and dug into whether it&#39;s possible to disable them.You can, but if you do, Amazon will no longer send Amazon &#34;Smile&#34; micro-donations to whatever charity you&#39;ve selected: https://i.imgur.com/wNAkUAT.jpeg .I can&#39;t say that this is underhanded, but it does cast into sharp relief the fact that Amazon is a $1.5 trillion dollar company that generates upwards of $3B in yearly profit, and they&#39;re jerking you around, dangling the pennies they would otherwise send to a charity, unless you let them feed you product recommendations in OS notifications.  (If you just disallow the entire Amazon app from sending notifications, as far as I can tell they still give the charity whatever 0.5% cut.)So I have to choose between 1) allowing them to send me product recommendations, 2) a poor UX because I don&#39;t get any notifications at all, or 3) just not sending the charity any of the scraps of my Amazon transactions.  I chose 3 and cut the charity a larger check than usual."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I&#39;m not sure if this change to Google Maps has been or will be widely rolled out, you may want to look into what GrapheneOS is working on with their Google Play compatibility layer [1]. It basically lets people use Google&#39;s services inside Android&#39;s standard app sandbox. That means they don&#39;t get access to privileged system APIs and can only access what the user chooses. It can also be used without a Google account.GrapheneOS is working on a way to redirect the Play services location APIs to an open source implementation of those APIs which uses standard Android location APIs [2]. 
It&#39;s expected to be available in an upcoming release [3].[1] https://grapheneos.org/usage#sandboxed-google-play[2] https://developer.android.com/reference/android/location/Loc...[3] https://twitter.com/GrapheneOS/status/1486182874567122945"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those who don&#39;t know, &#34;Riddim is the Jamaican Patois pronunciation of the English word &#39;rhythm&#39;. In the context of reggae and dancehall it refers to the instrumental accompaniment to a song and is synonymous with the rhythm section... A given riddim, if popular, may be used in dozens—or even hundreds—of songs, not only in recordings but also in live performances.&#34;The actual riddim sounds completely uninteresting to my American ears. But the novelty and catchiness obviously connected to millions of people at the time.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riddimhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjw7m-BKmQ8"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Love my Framework. Barring Apple&#39;s recent move away from the touchbar it&#39;s honestly the first machine I&#39;ve been excited about in 6 or so years. The build quality is great, love the simplicity and design of the expansion ports, and the repair/upgrade-ability is huge. It&#39;s gotten me back into using Linux as a daily driver.I really hope they stay true to their vision and that this means expanding it into other consumer product lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Frameworks are really good. However, the chips inside are disappointing, IMO.I was considering the i5 1135g7 Framework with 16gb of RAM. A friend of mine bought it, and it&#39;s idle power draw is of 8-9W with Gnome 3 and Firefox open.I decided to get a laptop with a 5800H and an RTX 3070 instead. My power consumption as I&#39;m typing this comment right now is of 7W with a dozen tabs and an IDE, messaging, etc... open. That is despite a 46% larger screen, and a much faster, unlocked TDP, 8 core CPU.That&#39;s a real shame, IMO. Combined with a 55Wh battery, it&#39;s quite problematic, and was a deal-breaker for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We’re not ready to share what the next products are just yet, but this funding unlocks categories even more ambitious than our first one. We have a detailed plan in place for the next two years and napkin sketch ideas going out a couple of decades.It&#39;ll be really interesting to see where they go next. Given that they&#39;re already in computer and custom board space, I&#39;d make a guess that it&#39;s going to be routers - similarly embedded devices and they&#39;d make a great option for replaceable parts (i.e. WiFi, connection options etc)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My Tesla will allow me to engage autopilot in a school zone, obeying the adjustment I’d set on speed limit - while using, not the correct school zone speed limit, but the non-school time speed limit. It would allow me to go 30 mph over the school zone speed.How can Tesla claim self driving if the car can’t read a sign that says - speed limit 25 mph during school hours, and properly adjust? Humans just look around to determine if school is likely in session by the number of cars in the parking lot during normal school hours, or they know the school calendar.How does a self driving car make that determination? Query the school district website for the school, identifying their bell schedule and tacking on a buffer ahead and behind? Assume a school schedule that’s M-F? What if it’s a religious school that operates Sun-Thursday? Now the car has to determine which religious sects obey which calendar? Is it different in each country?Just another example of a massive hurdle self driving cars have……And another recall that should be issued."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was rear-ended in Colorado when I didn&#39;t do a rolling stop. Had a road-rage incident when the other driving was livid that I would stop under thoose circumstances.My dad (when gowing up) was pulled over for a cop for doing a california stop in Colorado. The police officer let us off, because we had california plates.When I got my Tesla, it was immediately evident that _no one_ travels the speed limit. They travel 5-10mph over it on anything other then a local road. or they drive way under it.This is the problem with our mental model - FSD/Autopilot has to co-exist with human drivers - and human drivers don&#39;t follow the law. FSD/Autopilot has to exist in a world where roads do not follow standards, lines are not marked, deer jump in front of cars, people do California stops (it&#39;s called that for a reason), cars have accidents.Computers, today, change none of that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The actual implementation is a little more nuanced than always roll or never roll, with seven conditions required to avoid coming to a complete stop:  1. The functionality must be enabled within the FSD Beta Profile settings; and

  2. The vehicle must be approaching an all-way stop intersection; and

  3. The vehicle must be traveling below 5.6mph; and

  4. No relevant moving cars are detected near the intersection; and

  5. No relevant pedestrians or bicyclists are detected near the intersection; and

  6. There is sufficient visibility for the vehicle while approaching the intersection; and

  7. All roads entering the intersection have a speed limit of 30 mph or less.

  If all the above conditions are met, only then will the vehicle travel through the all-way-stop intersection at a speed from 0.1 mph up to 5.6 mph without first coming to a complete stop. If any of the above conditions are not met, the functionality will not activate and the vehicle will come to a complete stop

Then as long as they spent the money on payroll (which they had to pay for anyway), they didn&#39;t have to pay it back, even if their business didn&#39;t show any losses.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US lacks the state capacity to tell who was going to have trouble with COVID-19 closures, and who wouldn&#39;t, so a whole lot of money just had to go to people that had no need for it whatsoever.Regarding PPP, every local tech staff augmentation company got a few months worth of payroll out of it. For those of you not in the know, their model involves hiring developers at $x an hour, and then placing them at large enterprises for $x+y, often for years at a time, as those companies would rather have contractors than employees.So where does the money go? Straight to the owner&#39;s pockets, as lockdowns only changed staffing needs in a very small number of companies. So if your sole proprietorship staffing company employs 25 of those developer-contractors for, say, 180k and a couple of HR staff, you could get million dollar &#34;loan&#34;, that would be forgiven in a few months, as you didn&#39;t fire any of them.Needless to say, the people in charge of that kind of company were very happy about the PPP program."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a front-end developer / artist / father. I&#39;m trying to make a software application for families common in my situation.
I have an 8 year old daughter who is very autistic and there is a huge lack in tools I feel that a family and kid can communicate with. To that end - I am trying to make a communication board tool. In my mind think of Trello board but there&#39;s not much in the way of words only symbols. Right now I have mockups and am evaluating whether to do this in unity 2d or Web/JS. Throw everything you know of UX and common UI frameworks out the window this is for kids the world keeps turning it&#39;s back on to enable them to participate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m building an opensource GitHub for Flashcards. Basically Anki Online (though there&#39;s an offline first client). The idea is that it should be easier to collaboratively build flash cards. The project started out with F#/Blazor, but for various reasons I&#39;m (sadly) moving to Typescript/Electron.https://github.com/dharmaturtle/cardoverflow"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m in a volunteer role as CIO for a nonprofit focused on human trafficking, and we&#39;re building a new investigations and case-management platform using Svelte/TypeScript/SvelteStrap, Rust/Rocket, and Postgres (and likely Neo4j at some point) because the options out there are either poor or very expensive. Once we have something working and solid, we&#39;re going to open-source it and provide it to other groups in similar spaces.This project is a great opportunity to learn or expand your skills if any of the stack is interesting to you - a big part of our goal is to help build up the technical skills of anyone who wants to dive in somewhere.We&#39;ve got a number of investigators on staff and are starting to get a decent feedback loop with them to iterate on what we&#39;re building.We&#39;ve also got some unique and useful ideas that haven&#39;t been implemented before, and if things go well, we really think this could give a kick-in-the-pants to Maltego and Palantir&#39;s offerings, amongst others.If anyone is interested or wants to know more, please let me know!"</p>
