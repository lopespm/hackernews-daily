								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not really related to the article at hand, but I&#39;ve been on a bit of a Google Maps binge the past couple weeks. I learned a few interesting facts, blurry Israel being one of them.Another strange thing I found that might not be super well known (I didn&#39;t know about it) is that all GPS data in China is offset by a nonlinear psuedo-random amount. If you turn on the satellite view in Google Maps and look at various cities in China, you&#39;ll see that the road and business overlay is off by anywhere from 50m to 500m. And the strangest thing is that it&#39;s not a consistent offset from place to place.Turns out this is very intentional, and China uses a different geographic coordinate system than the rest of the world. WGS-84 is the most common coordinate system, but China uses GCJ-02, sometimes called Mars Coordinates. Part of GCJ-02 is an algorithm that obfuscates the results. So applying any GCJ-02 coordinate to a globe using WGS-84 coordinates gets distorted like a funhouse mirror.It&#39;s easy to find open source libraries to convert WGS-84 to GCJ-02 and vice versa. But Google Maps doesn&#39;t do it, for political reasons I suppose? I&#39;ve read that if you open Google Maps within China the mapping data is correct, but have no way to test that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This link title is extremely misleading to the point of being disingenuous and provocative. The title of the linked article is “Israel-Gaza: Why is the region blurry on Google Maps?”... because the entire Israel / Gaza / West Bank region is blurred in the exact same way. There is no preferential blurring of Palestinian areas. The clear answer is to prevent actors on both sides from using Google’s satellite imagery to plan attacks against one another. But please continue the breathless hot takes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangentially related but where does this come from and why is it so widely repeated (as in this article):&gt; ...Gaza, one of the most densely populated places in the worldI&#39;ve seen this claim (both in the &#34;one of the most...&#34; and &#34;the #1 most...&#34; forms) many times and I don&#39;t know where it comes from. What am I missing?Here[0] wikipedia says Gaza Strip has ~5,046/sqkm. I thought maybe Gaza City was meant, it&#39;s density is 13,000/sqkm[1]. Neither of these come close to ranking on wikipedias list of cities by population density[2], and I haven&#39;t been able to find any &#34;most populated places&#34; lists that list anything below 15,000 people per square kilometer, which Gaza city is well below.Is the BBC just plain wrong here or am I missing something? I hope it&#39;s me because if it&#39;s the former, that says something really bad about their fact checking and would suggest that BBC is not a reliable/trustworthy source, at least on this topic.    0: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaza_Strip

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the article:&gt; J Balvin said: [...] With Lossless, everything in the music is going to sound bigger and stronger but more importantly, it will be better quality. [...]There have been tests showing we cannot hear the difference between minimally lossy audio (e.g. mp3 320kbps) and lossless. But Balvin can. And it sounds &#34;bigger and stronger&#34;.The extra quality of lossless is nice when mixing/remixing the sound, as the inaudible loss of quality with minimally lossy audio (e.g. mp3 320kbps) is audible when the sound is sped up or slowed down.But, and this the article does not mention, is not what Apple Music wants you to do. The formats will be proprietary with DRM.I prefer FLAC/OggVorbis/etc when it comes to music. But then I like to be able to mix/remix."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple can add feature after feature, but if Music continues to split albums without warning, it&#39;s close to useless. I can&#39;t curate a music library when I can&#39;t rely on my music not being jumbled around. Dropping music for licensing issues is one thing, but messing with metadata is beyond frustrating.For arbitrary reasons, Apple Music will: remove songs from albums and re-add them to your library as the &#34;single&#34; or &#34;deluxe&#34; versions; split albums and intersperse tracks between both; and duplicate songs in albums.The albums usually still exist in Apple Music—I just have to go out of my way to remove the mangled music and re-add the album. Problem is, there is no warning or notification it happened.Examples:[1] https://pasteboard.co/K2kdUN3.png
This album is totally messed up. Multiple track 3 with different titles, one unavailable, missing tracks that were re-added to my library as singles.[2] https://pasteboard.co/K2keFBV.png
One song pulled out into a greatest hits compilation and duplicated[3] https://pasteboard.co/K2kfc0b.png
All tracks, except 1, removed. The album still exists in Apple Music.[4] https://pasteboard.co/K2kfBTR.png
Originally added the original version of Camp by Childish Gambino to my library—here it&#39;s split between deluxe and basic, with tracks arbitrarily mixed between both.[...and many more]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is included/no additional cost which is fantastic.I do wonder if in the longer term if Apple&#39;s Spatial Audio with &#34;dynamic head tracking&#34; isn&#39;t the next 3D TVs/3D Content i.e. a gimmick.Taking traditional multi-source audio (Dolby/Atmos/etc) and jamming it into stereo is old tech, it doesn&#39;t work particularly well but is cheap to make/consume, thus mostly harmless. The new Spatial Audio is using gyroscopes to measure head movements in order to adjust the audio accordingly, and new audio formats to make it work.This may sound interesting if you haven&#39;t tried it, but it results in: Either you keep your head stationary and get the non-Spatial Audio sound (i.e. what they optimized for 90%+ of their audience) or whipping your head around to &#34;enjoy&#34; the effect (which is largely a movement accurate degradation).It feels like cart-before-the-horse tech wherein they figured out they can do this thing, and now want to work backwards into what it may be useful for."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the 90s I used to make money off shareware, and every time I release a new version hackers would release &#34;cracks&#34; for the license key. Eventually I figured out that these cracks are coming from Russia.In the next version of my program, I added a check for system language, and if I detect Russian then I bypass the license key checks, and the program is free to use. This stopped hackers from releasing cracks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of one weird trick I use to avoid getting foreign language websites served to me while traveling. I remove en-US in my OS and broswers, and replace it with en-CA, as well as the other languages I speak. A lot of websites and software will see en-US and assume it&#39;s &#34;just a default&#34; and then try to serve content in a language determined by your IP or geographical region. But en-CA appears to be an explicit preference, so websites will serve English content instead of defaulting to geographic language detection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Our goal is to make money, and not creating problems for society,” the DarkSide criminals wrote last week&gt; In a message posted to its victim shaming blog, DarkSide tried to say it was “apolitical” and that it didn’t wish to participate in geopolitics.Yes but if destabilizing and disrupting a country&#39;s computer infra happens as a side-effect, you are still in the game of politics. Being &#39;apolitical&#39; is paradoxically still being political, since if you are involved with large groups of people, you can&#39;t help but be political."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While establishing  a &#34;cause &amp; effect&#34; here seems very hard, from my personal experience working in software field in Japan, I think the winning concept here is actually the combination of removing middleman and paying good salaries.Japan is very very behind in IT/digitalization compared to most western countries. This doesn&#39;t just mean it&#39;s behind in product portfolio and quality, but that perception of software engineer &amp; managers and still quite behind. The respect that a lot of software engineers enjoys in US/EU is not quite there yet in Japan(and salary often reflect this).The C-suite usually doesn&#39;t have a firm understanding of software/IT world, and instead ends-up hiring a lot of &#34;Scrum-experts/Agile coaches&#34; and hires software engineers from consultancy or recruitment companies for cheap.  There&#39;s ofc companies that doesn&#39;t fall in this category, but for middle-sized companies in Japan (which is the bulk of the economy), this is the true state of things. Middle-men in Japan have therefore been way more encroaching on this, and they have the incentive to not improve the respect/social standing the software engineers have.&#34;Removing managers&#34; in this article does not mean the same thing as it would in US/EU, conditions are different."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Tange, 46, says his business model is an attempt to remove inefficiencies in Japan’s software industry, where layers of subcontractors take cuts on orders before passing the work to another company below.This reminds me of a role I once had back in the late nighties.I was hired on contract by a multi-national consultancy firm to help out on one of their projects. The need someone to come in with good C programming skills.When I started I was amazed to find a 70 developers and testers workforce working on the project, most of whom were straight out of university.A nice earner for the consultancy firm; they were charging their development team out at $150.00 per hour, yet only paying graduate salaries.It must have been $100+ profit per hour per developer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hello everyone, this is my company and in the newly created dev department we are looking for Japanese speaking full-stack engineers, designers, Project managers etc based in Japan.
Japanese is almost definitely needed, but may make an exception for rockstar level engineers.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with some of the other comments here, that while this is a very impressive hack (and this is Hacker News!) the real world value seems dubious.It looks like a very clever way of packaging an x86 fat binary for multiple platforms, without actually duplicating the code. To support ARM I assume it’ll need to be an actual fat binary, with both x86 and ARM code. At that point, unless I actually test the code myself on both architectures, how can I be confident it’s going to work properly?If you’re using very simple C constructs and not doing anything fancy, it should work, but it’s not clear to me that this approach is preferable to e.g. a Python script. If you’re doing fancy stuff, it’s a bit more chancy as C isn’t memory-safe and has tons of undefined behavior and platform-specified weirdness.Java is “run anywhere” because they’ve specified the JVM in massive detail and tried to ensure it actually works the same on all platforms. I don’t see how you can have that same confidence if you’re running machine code everywhere.I guess I just don’t see the use case where this is compelling. If I write a handy Unix utility in C, I’ll just keep the source code around, and compile it as needed.It might be handy if you need to move such a utility quickly from Unix to Windows, if you don’t have any dev tools set up. But I can’t think of a situation when I’ve needed that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a bit worried about this:&gt; Please note that your APE binary will assimilate itself as a conventional resident of your platform after the first run, so it can be fast and efficient for subsequent executions.I understand there may be no real way out, but this defeats part of the promise/purpose of PAE: assume I use a pae binary, know it&#39;s pae, and implicitly share it or copy it to a different machine. But once I have copied it from ~/bin/ it&#39;s not pae any more, it&#39;s optimized for my OS/arch!Assuming the first-run optimization step is necessary, would it make sense to provide `--deoptimize` or `--paeize` flag to the same binary, so it&#39;s easy to return to the original, without recompiling it from source? Does it lose information when it optimizes? Can that information be tucked away (with an optional flag or env variable) for this step?What happens if the binary is read-only?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been working with Bazel in my personal monorepo (~6 months now), and the fact that Justine, someone I believe knows Bazel/Blaze well, uses GNU Make, makes me re-think my decision: perhaps I should re-consider it. I have quite a few issues with Bazel, which require significant engineering hours to overcome, whereas I could just use gnu make and solve it quickly.Let&#39;s see if I can get some inspiration of how things can be built from this repo?`o/$(MODE)/depend`, a makefile-looking file with the full dependency tree. It is compiled using tool/build/mkdeps.c. So we have a Makefile generator (Justine, you mentioned elsewhere in this thread you didn&#39;t want to invent a build system? :)) The Makefile generator is very specific to this project: parses C files and creates that tree.It is damn fast and, so far, beautifully documented (at least the build parts I looked). Hell, even documentation lines in file preambles are 72 characters wide, and justified. Crazy. Do you manually justify those?You are also vendoring statically-built GCC, and the folder with executables is &lt;10MB. LLVM C/C++ toolchain is hundreds of megs, compressed.I am certainly taking inspiration of being in tight control of the compiler toolchain, and beautiful documentation. Not sure I will write my Makefile generator, since my project is also not that big.Thanks. Cosmopolitan is giving me much more to look at than an αcτµαlly pδrταblε εxεcµταblε."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It does not just feel faster, in many cases it is faster.E.g. compiling Rust code is so much faster that it is not even funny. cargo install -f ripgrep takes 22 seconds on a Mac Book Air with M1, same on a hexacore 2020 Dell XPS 17 with 64GB RAM takes 34 seconds."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting, the article isn&#39;t clear how it&#39;s implemented and whether they dynamically adjust the QoS/Core, so I wonder if they solved the inversion problem. Basically you don&#39;t want a high-priority process to be dependent on a lower-priority process that&#39;s locked on a LITTLE core.Windows solves this by placing basically everything onto the LITTLE cores, and user interactions serve as a priority bump up to the big cores. The key (which is difficult to implement in practice) is that they pass that priority along to every other called thread in the critical path so that every path necessary to respond to the user can be placed on the big cores. This means that if you are waiting for a response from the computer, every thread necessary to provide that response, including any normally low-priority background services, is able to run on the big cores.I&#39;d expect all the other OS&#39;s do a similar optimization for the big.LITTLE architectures. It seems to be the natural solution if you&#39;ve worked in that space long enough."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What i find weird is the extreme and very unscientific agression among certain virologist:
&#34;If you think SARS-CoV-2 was engineered in a lab, please unfollow me.  &#34;
https://twitter.com/macroliter/status/1390720308265508871Then you have other academics in the comments saying nothing is certain yet, and other prominents labs like Gupta Labs at Cambridge and Bloom Lab from Seattle saying there could be multiple explanations.I know the issue is politicised and that&#39;s wrong as Ecohealth alliance from the US sponsored this research so there is no &#34;single country at fault&#34; - no need to avoid topics.It&#39;s not &#34;chinas fault&#34; it&#39;s more like, what on earth was the US based Ecohealth alliance doing with this research, why so many previous lab leaks with little attention, what is the history if the Wuhan lab, whats the actual facts about Gain of Function research etc. All topics that the press is not looking into for some reason.On Ecohealth alliance:“ It later turned out that the Lancet letter had been organized and drafted by Peter Daszak, president of the EcoHealth Alliance of New York. Daszak’s organization funded coronavirus research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. If the SARS2 virus had indeed escaped from research he funded, Daszak would be potentially culpable. This acute conflict of interest was not declared to the Lancet’s readers. To the contrary, the letter concluded, “We declare no competing interests.””https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27071432"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not surprising at all considering Wuhan Lab scientists admitted on video they were bitten by bats and they had lax to no safety standards. https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4102619&gt; A video released two years before the start of the Wuhan coronavirus pandemic shows Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) scientists being cavalier toward protective equipment and being bitten by bats that carry deadly viruses such as SARS, demonstrating a lax safety culture in the lab.&gt; On Dec. 29, 2017, Chinese state-run TV released a video designed to showcase Shi Zhengli, (石正麗), also known as &#34;Bat Woman,&#34; and her team of scientists at the WIV in their quest to find the origin of SARS. Despite the fact that the scientists work in a biosafety level 4 lab, they show a shocking disregard for safety when handling potentially infectious bats both in the wild and in the lab.&gt; From 4:45 to 4:56, a scientist can be seen holding a bat with his bare hands. Team members from 7:44 to 7:50 can be seen collecting potentially highly infectious bat feces while wearing short sleeves and shorts and with no noticeable personal protective equipment (PPE) other than gloves.&gt; Virus researcher Cui Jie (崔杰) relates his experiences of being bitten from 8:47 to 8:50. He said that the bat&#39;s fangs went right through his glove, which was likely nitrile. He described the feeling as &#34;like being jabbed with a needle.&#34; The video then cuts to a person&#39;s limb showing swelling after a bat bite.That provides a plausible origin scenario of the pandemic: In October 2019, a researcher at the Wuhan Lab was bitten by a bat, got infected (asymptomatically), went home and unknowingly infected other people in the community, and the virus spread from there.Sadly, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll ever know what happened. Those who were directly involved with the early stage of the outbreak will never speak up, because Beijing issued a complete gag order on what happened.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The trouble here is that a lot of institutions and public persons have more or less staked their credibility on dismissing the lab origin hypothesis. They had their reasons - if anything, over the last years their standing and the value of expert opinion was under constant pressure (notice I&#39;m talking about a reason, not a justification).But this makes any admission of an error and, by extension, any useful reflection on it very, very improbable. I think if the lab origin is true and at some point becomes common knowledge, it will be treated like the Iraq war. The people responsible for botching the response and the message will fail up and treat the pandemic as if it were a tsunami, rather then human error."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I actually like using systemd. I took the time to learn how to use it, and as a desktop Linux user, it&#39;s honestly quite nice.But the one thing that still really pisses me off about systemd-the-project was the fact that they ate udev-the-project. In my view, that decision was unnecessary and was done for purely anti-competitive reasons.If you&#39;re not familiar, udev is basically the user-facing device manager for Linux. It&#39;s what allows you to easily configure rules and permissions for all the USB devices that you plug into your computer. These devices still need kernel drivers, but udev is how you tell your system &#34;Please let user ohazi use this device, and also give it a convenient name like /dev/someDevice0&#34;By devouring the udev project, the systemd maintainers have guaranteed that dealing with USB devices on non-systemd systems was going to be a giant pain.Then came the forks -- Gentoo maintains eudev, which is a systemd-free fork of udev. But really, this shouldn&#39;t be a fork. Udev should be independent and available on all systems. If systemd wants to do something special with devices, they should use udev APIs like everybody else. In my view, this is what finally allowed systemd to win the init war, despite all the protest. Ideological arguments about how best to start daemons is one thing, but you simply can&#39;t use a modern system without a sane approach to USB.Edit: It seems that some of my concerns were overblown, e.g. you apparently can run udev without systemd as pid 1. Udev has a build-time dependency on systemd, but not a run-time dependency. The eudev fork removes that build-time dependency, and (maybe?) also papers over some other inconsistencies. I&#39;m pleased that this is the case. I&#39;m annoyed that the discourse around systemd/udev has been muddy enough to lead me to incorrect conclusions (and I&#39;m aware that the original version of this comment likely added fuel to this particular fire). Oh well... live and learn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a system where systemd decides, about half the times I boot it, to immediately unmount all of the filesystems listed in fstab literally right after having finished mounted them as part of the regular boot process. All of this with other daemons starting in parallel.It will fail to unmount most of the filesystems, since they are of course busy, but often it will succeed in unmounting /var, /tmp, /home and others. Then it will continue starting on further services as if nothing happened and even proceed to gdm. But of course without /home I can&#39;t even login.No idea how to even start debugging it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t agree with her sentiment that alpine should adopt something similar. The whole reason I use alpine is because it doesn&#39;t use systemd.I like alpine because it uses a simpler, lighter approach. It&#39;s not for everyone, and I&#39;m pretty sure alpine maintainers don&#39;t intend it to be for everyone. It serves its niche really well as it is. For those who like systemd there&#39;s many distro choices already.Edit: As detaro mentioned in another comment ( https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27176391 ) they are actually working on something, but they aim to solve the various issues around alpine that don&#39;t fit well with alpine&#39;s philosophy. It sounds like a good story and I&#39;m open to this idea. The main reasons I don&#39;t like systemd are its complexity and its dbus reliance, basically bringing too many desktop paradigms into all Linux systems, even servers and containers.So about my above point: I&#39;m open to it adopting a service manager but not too similar to systemd :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a Bitcoin miner (https://toom.im), while I appreciate the work put into it, this particular metric of &#34;transactions per kW&#34; might not work the way you expect.The main point that you should understand is that a PoW blockchain&#39;s energy usage is not proportional to its transactions.I&#39;ll say that a different way: the transactions themselves do not use any energy in mining.I&#39;ll say this in a third way: it takes exactly the same amount of energy to mine an empty block as it does a 1GB block of transactions, as it does a 1,000,000,000 PB block.In reality, transactions are all hashed together in a mining pool into a single numeric hash before miners ever see them.  It doesn&#39;t matter how many transactions are included in the hash.  The hashpower just has to find a magic number matching that hash.On the other hand, the #1 factor that increases a blockchain&#39;s energy usage is its price per coin.  The price of a coin is how much that coin is worth to be mined, which is the incentive for miners to dump energy into mining it.  In steady state, miners will dump energy into mining a coin until the cost of energy = the value of the coins coming out.This is why you can see Bitcoin SV at the top of the list -- it&#39;s worth the least of the Bitcoins.And it&#39;s also misleading to compute the second factor -- transactions per second -- by counting the actual transactions on the blockchain, rather than looking at the transaction capacity.  Because blockchains only cost something per transaction once they reach capacity.  This is misleading with Bitcoin SV, for instance, because that coin artificially creates bogus transactions on its blockchain in order to make it look popular and demonstrate the vision of large blockchains.  Bitcoin Cash, on the other hand, can handle a thousands of transactions per second (on testnet) but doesn&#39;t clog its live blockchain with them.So, in sum, if you send a transaction on Bitcoin Cash, it will cost 0 kW of electricity, even though it says 31.3 Txs/MWh (which equates to 31.9kW/Tx) in this chart.  This is because transactions do not cost anything in electricity.  Electricity only goes to preventing double-spends.  A better metric would be &#34;energy use per double-spend that was prevented.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t this basically 1 / popularity? I&#39;m presuming other coins have the Bitcoin feature of getting harder as more powerful miners appear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting but I’m not sure of the point. PoW by design is not energy efficient. The incentive is just not in the correct place. Interesting but if the goal is to show more energy efficient coins we need to be looking at different tech such as PoS. Although this might have just been a fun project someone put together in which case nice job."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Highlighting this part, which might otherwise go unnoticed:&gt; Instead of birthday cake and ice cream, she got jail food and a bill for hygiene suppliesTo spell it out, although she wasn&#39;t charged in the criminal sense, she was &#34;charged&#34; financially—for the privilege of experiencing false arrest.There are other states with extremely messed up legal processes, such as those where not only convicted persons receive a bill for their public defender (which at least makes some sense, logically) but states where you are on hook for thousands of dollars even in the event that you are never tried or you are tried and found not guilty."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is something any US citizen should be concerned about, if not outraged. There is no 4th amendment if a cop can just have a dog with him, or say &#34;I smelled weed&#34;, etc. The cops even joke about it, referring to the dogs as “probable cause on four legs”. The root problem is credulous or complicit judges who let this evidence be introduced. We need them to throw out these cases."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently had an experience with the system. Literally every person we encountered as a part of that system make mistakes, were incompetent, or committed misconduct. I&#39;m talking about 3 magistrates (who aren&#39;t even required to be lawyers!), court clerks, a trooper, the SGT that approved the citation, the ADA, the second ADA, the DA clerk, a judge, court reporter, president judge, and I&#39;m sure I&#39;m forgetting others.It&#39;s an absolute shit show that only cares about money. I was even told by a civil rights lawyer that we had a case, but that the judges don&#39;t care unless we sustained substantial monetary loss (more than the $2k plus of handling the case pro se)."</p>
