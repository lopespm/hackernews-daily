								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are two issues:1) Data collection and algorithmic manipulation. This has been discussed to death, but why you&#39;d let an adversary control the information flow to a huge portion of the population is beyond me. This is obviously a national security issue.2) Fairness in the marketplace. No, I&#39;m not talking about the U.S. marketplace. U.S. tech companies have had their IP stolen and unfair regulations placed on them in China. Why should the U.S. let Chinese tech companies compete in the U.S. marketplace when China doesn&#39;t let U.S tech companies compete in their marketplace?I&#39;m not going to feel pity for TikTok."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, the interesting question is why a foreign company is doing a better job of understanding what American teenagers wanted than domestic firms with seemingly infinite bankroll to work with.Nobody forced anyone to install TikTok at gunpoint.  Presumably, if there was a more compelling domestic product, the kids would go there instead.  Why has that product failed to materialize?I know, you can&#39;t really set out to manufacture &#34;cool&#34;, but maybe we need to get back the spark in this sector.  I don&#39;t think the existing players are capable of creating an appealing blank-slate social platform.  They might have the cash and technical chops, but they have negative social currency.  Facebook/Meta&#39;s brand is hopelessly tainted: if it&#39;s not creepy spying, it&#39;s still where Mom and Dad hang out to swap antivax memes.  Google might have a little more cool left-- not much-- but they&#39;re also attached to such teen favourites as &#34;crappy limited school-provided Chromebook&#34; and &#34;we have 92 chat apps on our phones and still can&#39;t reach each other&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m conflicted.TikTok collects data for an adversary at scale. Many complain that the US does the same but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that I live in the US. The Chinese government is an adversary of the West whether we like it or not.With that said- It&#39;s pretty telling that the FCC only needs to go to Apple and Google. It would be really nice to have some antitrust regulation so that the FCC doesn&#39;t have this power."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A security researcher wrote an article  while back and it was shocking to see how much data TikTok was collecting:- biometrics- what words are mentioned in the video, popularity- surrounding wifi, location data- your contacts (presumably to cross link to social media platforms)I just can&#39;t believe that a powerful country like America is letting a not-so-friendly military/civilian complex infiltrate it for somewhat unknown purpose."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s incredible that the US allowed TikTok (which is by all measures a chinese spy tool) to become such a dominant social network.India got it right from the beggining by banning TikTok. They saw the immense threat and didn’t hesitate.China, by principle, has always banned all foreign information technology companies. What seemed hostile for us, it’s a reasonable play if you understand the unmeasurable power of massive information products such as Google or Facebook.Meanwhile the US is just focused on attacking its own homegrown tech companies and diminishing their ability to compete in global contexts.We are on a declining trajectory and we willingly paved that road. It’s sad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will repeat my comment:Stop generalizing the &#34;country of origin&#34; as if it does not matter like the Chinese Comunist Party isn&#39;t a threat to the world.
- There will always be a ruler, and which ruler is killing, slaving, censoring and selling it&#39;s own people as meat tools for foreign companies?- China will kill, torture it&#39;s own people and their families if they think they are a thread (even if remote) to their government party (CCP).- China put on a HEAVY surveilance tool and actually forced people to behave like they want using social credit- China is actively removing ANY historical filosophies, tales, traditions, religions that could be a thread to the CCP&#39;s beliefs.- Have you ever seen a CCP convention? Their plan is to remove the worlds countries boundaries in order to rule over everything from culture to politics and economics. Australia is suffering a lot on their hands, they even sent spies to patronize elections."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a stellar example of a quite rare class of magic trick where the method is actually more amazing than the effect. The vast majority of magic tricks are the opposite. The effect is amazing but the method is actually quite mundane. This is one reason magicians don&#39;t reveal &#34;secrets&#34;. The reality is most magical methods are rather disappointing compared to the astonishing impact of the effect created.For any magical effect there are almost always many possible methods and, conversely, for each method there are multiple possible effects. This method provides a way to know the location (or absence) of each card in a shuffled deck without the performer handling the deck. For most of the effects which could be accomplished with this method there exist a wide variety of alternate, much simpler, methods. Using any of those easier and cheaper methods would likely appear identically amazing to audiences. And that&#39;s why I love this method. As a technologist and magician, I&#39;ve always had a special fondness for wildly complex methods - that rare kind of magic where the method actually IS as amazing as the effect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This tech could be a game changer for accessibility. Many card games are not or cannot be adapted to braille, so I haven&#39;t been able to play them with friends. If cards can be sold with invisible ink in an open format, then I would need only a scanner and a earphone to be able to check my cards without other help.I&#39;ve thought of doing with with QR codes, but I&#39;m not sure if it will look okay for the other players and if the qr codes won&#39;t be recognizable enough by a human to give someone unfair advantage in some situations."</p>

It is theorized that these magic trick could be used in private poker houses to cheat players."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The intro speaks truth and brings back a lot of frustrating experiences:&gt;We may have all heard the saying “use it or lose it”. We experience it when we feel rusty in a foreign language or sports that we have not practised in a while. Practice is important to maintain skills but it is also key when learning new ones. This is a reason why many textbooks and courses feature exercises. However, the solutions to the exercises feel often overly brief, or are sometimes not available at all. Rather than an opportunity to practice the new skills, the exercises then become a source of frustration and are ignored.Typical exercise soltion: How to draw an owl. 1. Draw some circles. 2. Draw the rest of the $@#% owl."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I expected some in that line: 
https://generalabstractnonsense.com/2017/03/A-quick-look-at-...That is - drawing things on paper, no formulae. I used to do similar exercises with the printed Iris dataset and giving people a transparent foil to draw the classifier. Then, giving them another sheet of paper with the validation dataset. The exercise was loved by people from high-school students to managers.I developed an interactive version, https://github.com/stared/which-ml-are-you. Unfinished as a game, but it works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always thought that textbooks never gave detailed solutions because of space limitations.Digital pdf is a great way to break free of these limits and this document is impressive indeed with the detailed solutions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Side-note on digital calendars: What I&#39;d really like is a continuously scrolling calendar to help with long-ish term planning (3-4 months). Most apps are stuck in the single-month page view analogy to physical calendars, which for me keeps breaking my mental flow of stringing activities across the boundary/long distances. And I get why (standard behavior/components and user expectations) but it just seems like a missed opportunity. Not sure how many want this but I suspect more would do if they were exposed to it.A few calendar apps allow a stretch of &gt;4 weeks and there&#39;s this POC web version: https://madebyevan.com/calendar/app/ but all I can do for now is constantly switch from a Gantt app to my calendar app (Thunderbird or Google Calendar)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, this is where design really falls flat.It looks nice, the idea is appealing, but the result is awful. This thing is totally unusable. You need to remember to slide the frame every month. It doesn&#39;t even tell you that you did or not. Sliding the frame requires checking the number of days there are in the month. When you&#39;re in the last week, having the 31 always there is a pain in the ass. Knowing the next month is kind of useful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat. Some limitations:- It doesn&#39;t tell you how many days there are in the month (31/30/28/29).- Working out how to move the frame at the end of the month isn&#39;t very difficult, but it&#39;s not trivial either (especially given the previous point)."</p>

We&#39;ve built an open-source version of taxsim called OpenFisca US [1] which we expose in our (also open-source) web app, PolicyEngine US [2]. We haven&#39;t yet implemented all of taxsim—we only have the most recent couple of years, and not all states—but we have some advantages like implementing means-tested benefits and being able to simulate custom tax and benefit reforms, both on individuals and the population (e.g. the budgetary and poverty impacts).I&#39;d love to get in touch.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Are all the dollar amounts in the simulated tax output at the top of the page inflation adjusted?For example, I inputted married, with no dependents with $500,000 salary and in 1977, the federal amount was $299,864 and in 2020 was $133,947. I assume these amounts can be compared without further adjusting for inflation?Tangentially, did federal taxes really come down that much?"</p>

All the articles are from there, verbatim, and you are exactly copying the list of articles - even the categorisation of them.I&#39;m not sure that a 10% donation to Wikipedia from subscription revenue is quite enough when you are doing quite a simple reformat of all the volunteer work that goes into the current events section of Wikipedia.You are effectively changing $9.99 for a weekly email digest of the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal:Current_events page and giving them $1. I think if you went 50/50 on it I would probably feel it was more fair, you are adding value but I assume thats all automated.I will give you credit for your 100 score, that page on wikipedia gets an 86 on page speed insights."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something not mentioned in the article: Middle Earth is depopulated. Without large market, it does not make sense to produce at scale, nor you will have the capital to do it.The main characters travel hundreds of kilometers down the biggest river around and they don&#39;t encounter other vessels or a populated settlement until they reach Minas Tirith. And I&#39;m not even mentioning the missing cities and villages in the inland part of the travel. We can say that this is due to lower birth rate in the numenorians who obviously have reproductive issues as mentioned in the books. Another reason is the brain, knowledge and capital drain caused by the large elvian immigration going for centuries. Dwarfs have the excuse of a long generation length to explain why they are not multiplying like rabbits for the thousands of years since the last world war, however, Tolkien does not provide a good reason for the other human nations, the orcs or even the hobbits.Possible explanation might be the unstable security situation on the continent, however, most of the societies are not described as being constantly under the risk of a raid from nearby orc. Aragorn is able to defend most of the north with a few hundred irregulars, while the east participated in only one war 60 years ago that was done in a few weeks time. The south is not described, but nothing unusual there as well as far as the books go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I highly recommend &#34;The Last Ring Bearer&#34; for people who like to have a bit of fun with Tokien.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_RingbearerEskov&#39;s version of the story describes Mordor as a peaceful constitutional monarchy on the verge of an industrial revolution, that poses a threat to the war-mongering and imperialistic faction represented by Gandalf (whose attitude has been described by Saruman as &#34;crafting the Final Solution to the Mordorian problem&#34;) and the racist elves.[2] For example, Barad-dûr, Sauron&#39;s citadel, appears in chapter 2 as...that amazing city of alchemists and poets, mechanics and astronomers, philosophers and physicians, the heart of the only civilization in Middle-earth to bet on rational knowledge and bravely pitch its barely adolescent technology against ancient magic. The shining tower of the Barad-dûr citadel rose over the plains of Mordor almost as high as Orodruin like a monument to Man – free Man who had politely but firmly declined the guardianship of the Dwellers on High and started living by his own reason. It was a challenge to the bone-headed aggressive West, which was still picking lice in its log ‘castles’ to the monotonous chanting of scalds extolling the wonders of never-existing Númenor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article presents an engineering answer to s sociological question.The reason technology did not advance in Middle Earth is because innovation was not rewarded. Innovation and experimentation were punished.Mine a little too deeply? You awaken a balrog that kills you an everyone you have ever known.Want to expand into that verdant area across the river? You didn&#39;t expect giant spiders, did you?Build a disruptive startup and bank $50B? You&#39;ll hear dragon wings a-flappen.Middle Earth was not filled with innovative disrupters because the risk and reward equation strongly discouraged innovation."</p>
