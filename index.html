								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On the Hotel California EffectIf it&#39;s expensive to move data out of AWS, it&#39;s not just about making it hard for customers to leave AWS. It means that any third-party service that wants to sell to AWS customers must also use AWS.For example, Snowflake can&#39;t really run its own data centers. They need to rent from AWS. If you&#39;re a company on AWS, you won&#39;t want to spend $0.08/GB sending things to Snowflake.The high egress cost gives Amazon a lot of power to keep the third-party ecosystem within AWS and without as much negotiating power on things like EC2 costs. Snowflake can&#39;t say to Amazon, &#34;if you don&#39;t give us a great discount, we&#39;re going to move our operations to DigitalOcean&#34; because Amazon would just say, &#34;no you&#39;re not. Your customers aren&#39;t going to pay $80/TB to load things into Snowflake when you&#39;re charging them $23-40/TB for storage. They&#39;d be paying 2-3.5x your storage costs just to load the data into your system!&#34; Yes, I&#39;m sure that Snowflake does get a discount from AWS, but having less negotiating power can make discounts smaller.There are other reasons to want a third party to use AWS if you&#39;re on AWS. Still, the egress pricing seems to make it very hard for third-party tech providers not to use AWS if their customers are using it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working in realtime games that require high bandwidth usage, AWS and basically every other public cloud is fundamentally unusable for us because of this exact problem. Our bare metal infrastructure for the Hypixel Minecraft network uses 3-4PB per month, so we simply lease a 100gbps transit link billed at 95th percentile.Last I checked, AWS wanted ~$200k per MONTH, for just bandwidth (no compute, memory, storage, or anything else). We&#39;d love to be able to use the cloud, but not at the cost of increasing our monthly expenses by an entire order of magnitude, so we just stick to bare metal colocation.I honestly believe that if you have the technical skill in-house, and are spending more than, say, $30k/mo on public cloud hosting, that you should seriously evaluate whether bare metal could significantly decrease your costs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AWS Egress - $0.09/GBAzure Egress - $0.0875/GBGCP Egress - $0.11/GBAlibaba Egress - $0.123Interesting that no mention is made of the other cloud providers pricing here when AWS isn&#39;t even the most expensive egress...Oh! I wonder if it is because Cloudflare has data transfer agreements with GCP, Azure, and Alibaba! But that would mean this is a shoddy hit piece to strong arm AWS into an agreement with them. Nonsense, I&#39;m sure Cloudflare would never do that...Edit: I&#39;ve removed claims about Cloudfront&#39;s pricing since it isn&#39;t actually clear what they charge for egress and seems to vary on a number of factors. Thanks Dylan16807 for pointing that out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had this idea nearly 10 years ago when my wife and I started dating and she introduced me to (very amateur) birding. I even talked about contacting Cornell for their database. But it was always going to be a hobby project.So when she read about this a few weeks ago, she literally smacked me for not building it. Now if I tell her it&#39;s on the front page of Hacker News AND everyone here loves the idea even more, I&#39;m going to get another, harder smack because she knows how HN is full of others like me!(yes I&#39;m aware that this community more than others will agree that ideas by themselves are a dime a dozen, but nonetheless, it would&#39;ve been a really fun project)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How can computers learn to recognize birds from sounds?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly the kind of thing that keeps me coming back to HN year after year. 99% may be a quick, mildly entertaining read, but that 1% tends to be empowering or life changing for me. I&#39;ve had a continuously growing interest in plant and bird identification as a hobby (animals are a bit  easier). I&#39;ve gone so far as to research apps, put Audobon society books on my wishlist, and try to look up some specimens I see in my area. Unfortunately it&#39;s, frankly, a steep learning curve and not a habit yet for me to take pictures, remember to look at them later, search their characteristics, etc. This will be the perfect tool to help me jumpstart my newfound interest and get more familiar with the flora and fauna around my home."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That&#39;s a fun read.I once wrote an entire CMS in Perl.I still wake up, screaming, sometimes.[UPDATE] It appears as if my flippant remark caused upset. I am sincerely sorry that this was the case. No offense was meant.@peteretep, you have my sincere apology. It was a flippant remark. At the time I wrote it (mid-1990s), Perl was the best way to write portable server-side code. I took the time to learn it, and got fairly good at it.
Since then, I have found my muse in other languages, but I sincerely did not want to give offense. I doubt that deleting the comment would help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In university, I learned Perl out of curiousity. It was the first scripting language I tried; I was only familiar with Java, C and Scheme at the time.After reading Programming Perl from cover-to-cover, I suddenly felt like I had superpowers. I probably would have felt the same if I&#39;d taken the time to learn bash scripting, but that&#39;s not how it worked out.I tried to automate everything in my life with Perl. I&#39;d walk to class in the morning and a script had already scraped and downloaded my lecture materials and sent a print job for me. It emailed me if it couldn&#39;t find notes for one of my scheduled classes. Others would manage my assignment submissions. I wrote scrapers to detect what events on campus might offer free food.This was the first time I felt like I could write programs that actually had the power to improve my life. It changed my perspective on what I had the power to do as a programmer. I&#39;ll always be grateful to Perl for that.I also learned how to quickly develop a thick programmer skin by asking questions on comp.lang.perl, but that&#39;s another topic altogether."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Syncthing is one of the &#34;fire and forget&#34; kind of programs. It takes some time to setup when doing for first time, but then you pretty much forget its there, and when you need it, you realise it has been chugging along doing its job.Two things I like about it in particular, are1. It can and favors syncing over local network. This has a huge cost savings in developing world. Even when you do have massive bandwidth, local network sync still has more throughput and lower latency. My music is shared between devices and if I add a track, it takes less than a second to appear on my other devices.2. You can set conditions, such that delets can be ignored. Eg. I have a WhatsApp message+media backup going back almost 7 years now, ~65GiB. But I don&#39;t need all that on my phone. So I just disable syncing delets on my storage. Now my phone can get away with ~3 GiB of whatsapp data (only because I don&#39;t delete very often) and I still have complete backup in case I need it.3. Absolute rock solid stable. At $DAYJOB we use syncthing to sync multi dozen GiBs of new data every day, total file count in 10s of thousands in about ~300 directories. And in past 5 years we have had about 3 instances where we had something that needed attention, out of which 2 were not syncthing&#39;s fault.I&#39;ve been using Syncthing for years and have absolutely zero complaints against it. Everyone with 2 or more devices should give it a try, just to see there are better options out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Syncthing for years now, between ~10 Linux servers, Linux desktops, Linux and Windows laptops and Android smartphones, over LAN, wired and wireless Internet.I&#39;m synchronizing less than 100 MiB of data, but it&#39;s changing all the time. I&#39;ve not yet had a single issue with it. I&#39;ve a few conflicts every week when the same file is changed in different locations at the same time, but Syncthing keeps all versions of a file until I resolve the conflicts; I can&#39;t see how it could handle that better.Long story short: I highly recommend this tool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On of my favorite program, and it keeps getting better.You can even set an encryption key per share, and if you want to use an untrusted device in your nodes, you can simply not provide it with the encryption key and it will simply synchronize the encrypted payload across nodes.So if you have a shady/cheapo VPS, you can use its storage without worrying about the plaintext data being stored there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fantastic blog post. I highly recommend reading it in full, and also checking out the work of the European Spreadsheet Risks Group, and Felienne Hermans specifically (referenced in the original post). I&#39;ve been working on a spreadsheet startup [1] for the past 8 months or so and those folks have a large amount of absolutely upsetting-but-helpful research on spreadsheet usage/errors.After the past few years working with spreadsheet power users, here&#39;s how I like to think about them:
1. Most spreadsheets are just used a lists/trackers [2].
2. Some spreadsheets are very calculation heavy, and are better understood as complex software projects (usually modeling something; s/o to those PE mfs) than as anything else.
3. Spreadsheets make the transition between (simple list/tracker) and (complex software project very fluid. This flexibility usually means that the (complex software project) that is created is buggy as hell.Spreadsheets give not-super-technical users an incredible visibility into their data. Spreadsheets give not-super-technical users a way to program data transformations in what I would argue is the most generally intuitive way that exists. Spreadsheets give not-super-technical users tools to build software without introducing them to proper software development methods. Ya know, like maybe a test. Or a code review. Or no global variables. Etc.If you want to see how we&#39;re attacking the spreadsheet problem, check us out. Feedback highly appreciated! [1][1] https://trymito.io/hn

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#39;000s of rows of data in a spreadsheet - sigh. But say &#39;database&#39; to some people and they hear &#39;The Devil&#39;.Excel is a glorious tool which welcomes all, the savvy and the unskilled but imaginative newbies alike. There is something about all those little cells that presents an itch everyone wants to scratch, and you just know that for some that scratching is going to produce something akin to a spreadsheet version of gangrenous melanoma.On the other hand, some people are happy to say that the complexity of sophisticated Excel models means they would have been better off built in a code interface. Ha ha ha!Even with the right mix of functional and object-oriented code and suitable documentation and version control applied to code, I respectfully disagree.Data handling capabilities could benefit from skill in all of these tools: error checking (including analytical review); pen &amp; paper; calculators; databases; spreadsheets; math &amp; stat techniques; Word processors (&amp; clear logical explanations).Together, they form a rich menagerie of tools which will probably all be around until we have an AI that follows us around and we just tell it what we want. Actually, even then, it would be good to know them so that we can grasp the underlying logic and frame the concepts leading to the actions that we ask the AI to assist with..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience, for a pure engineering role, nobody seems to care. I had credits at large companies, posted talks online (interviewers rarely looked at them), but if I forgot how to write binary search in 10 minutes in an interview it didn’t matter.This actually made me realize being just an IC wasn’t actually my goal though. Once I started interviewing for management and sales, all of those things _really_ mattered. Now that I’m running workshops and talks professionally, posting publicly is _critical_.Moral of the story: if you enjoy posting in public and teaching in public, but you feel like its getting you nowhere career wise, maybe you are in the wrong career like I was. Once I decided to double down on my strengths and spent nights and weekends at public speaking training instead of grinding leetcode things started to click."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two modes of hiring:1. General purpose: Typical FANG like where hire first and then do team matching later2. Targeted hiring: Companies want specific people and they try to recruit themA sizable number of top open-source contributors get recruited are in #2. Eg. 1) Top contributors in Rust lang hired by AWS. 2) FANG companies targeting top AI researchers from academia.One&#39;s open-source presence needs to be really prolific and the project has to make an large impact to be in #2 category.For #1 category folks, your public profile does not matter that much (atleast for FANG companies)Other way to think is #1 are treated as cattle, #2 are treated as pets.The famous incident where author of homebrew was rejected by a top company because he could not invert a binary tree got in the wrong channel (#1) to begin with where he was treated as a cattle.Note: Recruiter from FANG calling you still goes in #1 category for most people"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a few jobs interview recently. Here&#39;s what I got out of it:If you have something you want to promote (or is on your CV in general), be ready to talk about it. I&#39;m very lucky because I can talk about things on the spot very easily. If that&#39;s not you, make a list of the few main points that you want to talk about and try to memorize it. If you always get the same questions, it may be a good idea to address them before people even ask them, or to memorize an answer to them too.I really underestimate the amount of stress that can be felt when you&#39;re alone facing 6 people for a job that you want. I don&#39;t have a good answer on how to handle it, although I think having my canned answer ready helped. It got better once this started to be a conversation. The good part is that I developed a lot of empathy for people that talk about interview stress.It&#39;s going to be my first &#34;real&#34; job so these are probably obvious, but it might help someone so I&#39;d rather share."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Deploying k8s has gotten a lot easier these days -- some alternatives in this space:- https://docs.k0sproject.io (https://github.com/k0sproject/k0s)- https://k3s.io (https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s/)k0s is my personal favorite and what I run, the decisions they have made align very well with how I want to run my clusters versus k3s which is similar but slightly different. Of course you also can&#39;t go wrong with kubeadm[0][1] -- it was good enough to use minimally (as in you could imagine sprinkling a tiny bit of ansible and maintaining a cluster easily) years ago, and has only gotten better.[0]: https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/setup-tools/kubeadm/[1]: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubeadm"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried a few incarnations of self-hosted k8s a few years ago, and the biggest problem I had was persistent storage. If you are using a cloud service they will integrate k8s into whatever persistent storage they offer, but if you are self-hosting you are left on your own, it seems most people end up using something like nfs or hostPath - but that ends up being a single point of failure. Have there been any developments on this recently, aimed at people wanted to run k8s on a few RaspberryPi nodes?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Full disclaimer - I&#39;m an engineer at Talos, but I believe it&#39;s pretty relevant here)If folks are interested in this kind of K8s deployment, they might also be interested at what we&#39;re doing at Talos (https://talos.dev). We have full support for all of these same environments (we have a great community of k8s-at-home folks running with Raspberry Pis) and a bunch of tooling to make bare metal easier with Cluster API. You can also do the minikube type of thing by running Talos directly in Docker or QEMU with `talosctl`.Talos works with an API instead of SSH/Bash, so there&#39;s some interesting things about ease of use when operating K8s that are baked in like built-in etcd backup/restore, k8s upgrades, etc.We&#39;re also right in the middle of building out our next release that will have native Wireguard functionality and enable truly hybrid K8s clusters. This should be a big deal for edge deployments and we&#39;re super excited about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an employee of Hashicorp, I&#39;m very excited for this change. Not that Mitchell was anything less than a great leader—on the contrary, I thought he was excellent. It&#39;s just that he&#39;s also got such a great ability to identify the right abstractions when tackling a problem. The fact that he&#39;ll be &#34;in the trenches&#34;, so to speak, gives me even more confidence that Hashicorp will continue to make tools that strike a nice balance between power and simplicity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well done. A very graceful and transparent announcement.I decided to leave senior leadership and return to IC engineering work last year. I was met with shock and, frankly, negative feedback from my peers. It has been a difficult transition, and it&#39;s easy to miss the benefits of leadership, but I knew engineering was the right place for me.It was difficult to do this as a veritable nobody, I can&#39;t even imagine the difficulty of the decision for Mitchell. I wish him luck and continued success."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a great guy. At Hashiconf a few years ago he was just one of the normal people, a load of us all went to the speakers’ dinner and he just found a seat and sat down - opposite me, as it happened, and we had a laugh. Armon is a top chap too, we would talk motorbikes if I ever bump into him. Their tech skills are top-notch and I wish them the best of luck. So many tech companies would be better off this way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really dislike this writing structure of &#34;before I get to the point, let me tell you a story about my life&#34;Edit: I&#39;m not alone, https://style.mla.org/dont-bury-the-lede/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Over the last few years, our team has been exploring how to give industrial robots the ability to sense, learn, and automatically make adjustments as they’re completing tasks, so they work in a wider range of settings and applications. Working in collaboration with teams across Alphabet, and with our partners in real-world manufacturing settings, we’ve been testing software that uses techniques like automated perception, deep learning, reinforcement learning, motion planning, simulation, and force control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m “unlocking” that this will be dead within 18 months. It will get too hard and bored engineers will head back to Google Corp where the promotion game is better.I’m in manufacturing. Machinery is highly specialised. Making a generic robot without taking up huge amount of floor space and/or huge leaps in programming is like… Kubernetes being good for hosting your moms book club blog."</p>
