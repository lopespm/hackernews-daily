								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something similar happened to the cod fishing industry in Newfoundland and other parts of eastern Canada 30 years ago. The reason: overfishing, due in large part to technological advances. Here&#39;s what happened:Canada and NAFO continued to overestimate the abundance of cod in the Atlantic Ocean and therefore continued to set dangerously high [Total Allowable Catches]. This was in large part due to the widespread practice of calculating cod populations from catch rates in the commercial fishery – if fishers filled their quotas with ease, then officials believed the stock size was at adequately high levels. However, fishing technology had become so efficient by the 1970s that commercial catch rates remained high even as the cod population dropped to dangerously low levels. Electronic tracking devices could find fish no matter how small their numbers and trawlers could harvest most species with relative ease. ...Although overfishing in international waters did tremendous damage to northern cod, Canada also failed to maintain a sustainable fishery within its 200-mile limit. The government ignored warnings from inshore fishers and university scientists that cod stocks were in danger and chose to maintain quotas instead of scaling back the fishery, in large part to prevent economic losses and massive unemployment.By the early 1990s, after decades of sustained intensive fishing from Canadian and international fleets, the northern cod stocks collapsed. The spawning biomass of northern cod had dropped by about 93 per cent in only 30 years – from 1.6 million tonnes in 1962 to between 72,000 and 110,000 tonnes in 1992. In July of that year, Canada imposed a moratorium on the catching of northern cod and ended an international industry that had endured for close to 500 years.https://www.heritage.nf.ca/articles/economy/moratorium.phpThey called off the season in 1992 and it never came back. A pillar of the local economy in the Maritimes was wrecked.As for climate change and its impact on East Coast fishing, I&#39;ve read that lobster fishing is no longer a viable industry in Long Island and it&#39;s declining in southern New England as waters get warmer and the lobsters permanently migrate north."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bit of context, the south area which this reactor is suggested to be built in has occasionally a 1000% electricity higher price from the northern regions. A big reason for this is that prices in the south is highly connected to markets that the south region is connected to, and those region are heavily importers of electricity creating a higher demand than there is available of cheap energy. For example, in order to address this there is a oil power plant operating basically 24/7 and does so very profitably even with high oil prices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The new coalition government has pledged $40B (approximately the market cap of Twitter, heh) in loan guarantees for nuclear power construction.They have also pledged to create legal guarantees that future politicians will not be able to shut down functioning nuclear power reactors without suitable monetary compensation to the owners/operators of these reactors.In addition to this, they are commissioning an urgent study on how to rebuild Ringhals 1 and 2 (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ringhals_Nuclear_Power_Plant, about 1 GW each), two nuclear reactors that were prematurely decommissioned by the previous social-democratic government and shut down about 20 months ago.Personally I&#39;m really happy; I think massive expansion of 
 nuclear power is the only realistic way to fix climate change.The first reactors built will be modern but traditionally large. From then on: There has been a lot of interest in small modular reactors (SMR) from the political party that is driving all of this, and they actually got the nationally owned energy company Vattenfall to begin building prototypes at Ringhals a few months ago.In summary: Lots of champagne bottles popping tonight in Sweden in the homes of clean nuclear power proponents. We have been waiting for this for a very long time. Cheers!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something about this just seems very odd to me.As someone who grew up in the global South, this reads to me like a person from a privileged background trying to relate to the everyday people in other places and the marginalized- but it comes off sounding like a lot of projectionand assumptions- it would read much better if the conclusions were accompanied with dialogue from people, maybe explanations of where those statements are coming from.&gt;I don’t travel like most people do
I would think most travel is done by a wealthy few, but most travelers aren&#39;t wealthy- if that makes sense? It sounds like the &#34;travel&#34; being referred to here is &#34;flying somewhere and being a tourist&#34; but in fact to many people &#34;travel&#34; means taking the train/bus to another city, staying in a hostel, wandering around. Most people who go to see a wonder of the world do it because this might be the one time in their life they can afford to visit NYC, a place many people dream of seeing, and so they want to experience those things that are iconic there. I guess it really stands out to me, this writing sounds like &#34;I&#39;m not like those other stereotypical tourists&#34; and the stereotypes are those behaviors associated with privileged westerners- which isn&#39;t really an accurate representation of most travelers.From the Istanbul post:&gt;Most Turks are not secular though, and neither are they religious nuts like them ArabsHe considers education by traveling as sufficient, which I believe is not the best approach. Might be a good idea to read up a little about the history and cultures of a region before going.There is a lot going on with his writing that comes off ethnocentric, uninformed, insensitive. I&#39;m not going to dissect it, but I&#39;ll just say I recommend familiarization with cultural geography, anthropology, and ethnography if the topic of understanding people in different places interests you- because this blog is rife with problematic bias and some really broad generalizations that are prejudice at best, racism at worst."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems like people are criticizing this partially because it&#39;s pitched as an alternative to normal tourism. Just wanted to point out that Chris Arnade has done quite compelling photo journalism based on his way of engaging with communities, so what might seem like non sequitors or edge lord stuff might be in service of an implicit goal of his that most travelers don&#39;t share. Not that he does himself any favors with some of the framing.Highly recommend his book Dignity. https://www.amazon.com/Dignity-Seeking-Respect-Back-America/...Some of his work in the Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/profile/chris-arnade"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those not in the know the &#34;4080 12GB&#34; as compared to the 4080 16GB was not just the same card with a little less RAM, as you might assume from the name. It also had ~20% fewer GPU cores and was significantly slower for that reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My two cents on Nvidia&#39;s rollback reasoning:4080 12GB was universally panned. The 40 series launch also got heat for price gouging, particularly the higher cost for the low end of the launch (4080 12GB). They had to raise the cost of the lower end of the 40 series though if they wanted to maintain the value of the 30 series cards and clear out the remaining inventory. They couldn&#39;t just release a true 4070 for a true 4070 price. While the name was obviously bad, it seems likely that they wanted to obscure the release of a 4070-quality chip for a 4080-price while attempting to sell off remaining 30 series. Pure speculation: maybe they were hoping a &#34;cheaper 4080&#34; would come across to the uninformed as Nvidia trying to lower the entry cost for 40 series rather than raising it through an expensive 4070.Two potential reasons for the rollback come to mind:
1) higher than expected 4090 demand means they can wait to launch a 4070.
2) higher than expected heat for the thinly veiled 4070 price gouging made it worth it to wait on the release since it helps sell more 30 series cards by raising the entry price for a 40 series while getting better PR in the process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a strange post - the name is not right, so it&#39;s unlaunched. No indication of a new name? Am I supposed to conclude that the whole product is canceled for now? If that&#39;s the case it seems unlikely that the naming error is the whole reason."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can we please stop running network drivers and network stacks in kernel mode by default? It&#39;s 2022 and we&#39;ve got more than enough compute power nowadays that the performance hit for running these in user-land is negligible for most use cases. Smartphone, tablet or laptop users usually do not need the level of performance that requires running that stuff in the kernel when browsing the web.I get that there are some use cases where performance really matters to the point where kernel network stack and drivers make a difference (high-throughput and/or low-latency services running on servers, high-performance routers...), but that should not be the default for everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Could someone more knowledgeable than me comment if this is as worse as it looks?As I understood the issues, this will probably lot&#39;s of &#34;fun&#34;. You can broadcast the pcap files with any monitor mode capable wifi router. Luckily it&#39;s 5.1+ so most devices run very old vendor patched kernels and are probably not affected but at least for causing havoc this is really bad. As one issue is using beacon frames just a scan for networks should be enough for a crash. So you can at least crash and maybe exploit any device running recent Linux that scans for wifi networks.I&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s possible to do over the air remote code execution but I guess people are working on this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like these are all in mac80211. I&#39;m not 100% familiar with the intimate details of 802.11 but I have read the relevant parts of the standard, at least enough to RE some drivers, and a lot of things were clearly designed to be fixed and of a definite size so as to be implementable on a highly constrained embedded environment, so to see things like use-after-frees appear is a little disappointing."</p>
