								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of this company: https://www.blueheartenergy.com/The claims are pretty amazing. High efficiency, efficient over a wide range of temperature difference, high temperature differences possible.The operating principle is totally different. It is based on acoustic waves. Not using phase-changes but just the ideal gas law (pressure and temperature are proportional). I tried to get my head around it, and I got it with a standing sound wave. But they use a traveling wave, for which I could not find explanations I understood.The general idea is &#34;lower air pressure and move gas to cold side so the gas heats up&#34; followed by &#34;raise air pressure and move gas to warm side so the gas cools down&#34;. That means the low pressure needs to be low enough that the gas gets colder than the cold side, and the high pressure needs to be high enough that the gas gets hotter than the hot side. Luckily that is &#39;just&#39; a matter of amplitude of the sound wave. I think this is how they achieve their wide range of efficient temperature deltas.That wide range is the main difference with a phase-change based unit. The phase change happens at a much more difficult to change temperature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Technology Connections on Youtube has a great video series on how heat pumps work, why they&#39;re important environmentally and what kind of power cost savings they can bring. The second video is a longer guide for people who want to get a heat pump.https://youtu.be/MFEHFsO-XSI

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is plenty of opportunity in being more efficient.  To give an example, houses in the Bay Area has gray/black roofs.  In the summer such roof receives about 10kW of energy and readily converts it into heat.  Heat, which we are trying to evacuate from the house with our super-efficient heat pumps in the air-conditioning units.If only we&#39;d painted these roofs with white reflective roof paint (~92% reflection).  We would have removed ~8kW of heating from such roofs!  And then, maybe, we wouldn&#39;t  have to pump all that energy into air-conditioning.  So the surrounding air would be cooler, less noise would be heard from air conditioning, less energy would be spent.   And the cost?  4 gallons of white reflective paint and a couple of hours of work, painting the roof..."</p>

The laptop consistently wins, sometimes by an order of magnitude.LOL, this hits close to home. My company had a modeling specific VM set up to run our predictive modeling pipelines. Typical pipeline is about 50,000 to 5 million rows of training data. At best, using an expensive VM, we managed to get 2x training speed from lightgbm on the VM vs my personal work laptop. We tried GPU boxes, hyper threaded machines, you name it. At the end of the day, we decided to let our data scientists just run models locally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Static Typing reduces bugs.At least to me, the big advantage of static typing is not that it (allegedly) reduces bugs, but that it aids my understanding and helps in navigating the program. It&#39;s a tool for thinking and communicating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Hype: &#34;Identifiers should be self-documenting! Use full names, not abbreviations.&#34;&gt; Shower: Researchers had programmers fix bugs in a codebase, either with all of the identifiers were abbreviated, or where all of the identifiers were full-words. They found no difference in time taken or quality of debugging.That&#39;s a very weird take on the statement. The downside of using abbreviations is probably dominated by the difficulty of fixing the bug. The problem I have with abbreviations is that they just become another thing that you have to spend your mental resources on. “What is this variable exactly? Oh, I see.” is just wasted effort."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been listening to the audiobook of the Silmarillion while on a run or doing chores. At first I thought &#34;this has to be the worst idea&#34; since I found myself going back constantly and re-listening to bits to find out who was being referenced in some long description or I&#39;d lose track of what happened entirely.However, I&#39;ve since decided that this must be the best way to enjoy all the little detail. Each re-listen I&#39;ve understood more and more. It&#39;s a strange way to enjoy the work but I honestly think the creation myth at the beginning is really well written and had I just read the book I may have read it the once, retained some of it, referred back to it maybe, and moved on to the rest of the tale.Slow going but commenting just because you may enjoy this too if you&#39;ve made it to this thread. I haven&#39;t read the rest of the books since I was a kid so priming myself thoroughly for the re-read with Silmarillion first seems like it&#39;s going to have a nice payoff as rich as the world is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, if the author was fired for the reasons they believe, that&#39;s pretty bad behavior. But if he had not been fired, what was management supposed to have done about the cult members working for this department?Yes, the cult&#39;s leader sounds like a pretty awful person, but he wasn&#39;t working there. What were the cult members doing in their work in the department that was clearly wrong? It&#39;s suggested that there was favoritism and unfair promotion going on -- but it&#39;s not very well evidenced here. Were they using company money to fund their organization? It&#39;s also not clear from the article that the wine outfit is a cult subsidiary.And if the concern is primarily that the cult itself is a shady organization with some bad people, and that something should be done to stop Google from having a clique of staff that are even _affiliated_ with that organization ... well that seems like a really fraught policy. Are you supposed to then ask everyone in the department about their religious affiliations, or whether they&#39;ve given money to a fringe religious organization? That also seems like a really unhealthy road for a company to go down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can totally see how this can fly under the radar. &#34;Cults&#34; are common in tech, though not of this type.I&#39;ve received job offers where entire functions are all people who had worked together at a previous company and not hired through acquisitions. I&#39;ve had teams where majority of the team is from the same university or class. More than 50% of the team having a common denominator is common and it usually starts with one person getting hired in a high enough position where their hiring decisions are not scrutinized."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The number of amino-acids found has been mentioned in many on-line media, but it is completely meaningless.There exists a huge number of amino-acids, most of them are not made or used by the known living beings and of those made by living beings even fewer are used in proteins.A very large number of random amino-acids have also been found in various meteorites, because they easily form from the most abundant chemical elements in the Universe, H, C, N and O, whenever there is not enough oxygen to oxidize everything else, but among them only about 10 of those used by living beings have been found, i.e. about one half of the amino-acids used in proteins.What would have been interesting to know about the Japanese asteroid probe would have been if, among the many amino-acids found, there have been also the same about 10 amino-acids previously found, or only a part of them, and if there has been found any other amino-acid with biological importance besides those ten.The press release mentions only glutamic acid and valine, 2 simple amino-acids which belong to those 10 about which it is well known that they can easily be synthesized in abiotic conditions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They cooked a sample of Ryuguu and drove off about 15% of its mass,  mostly in the form of H2O and CO2.  That is,  Ryuguu is wetter and more carbon rich than the earth.Iron, Silicon and Aluminum are there in abundance. (Gerard K. O&#39;Neill and many science fiction writers have gotten wrong the idea that you need M-type asteroids to get iron.)  Astronauts found high quality hematite ore on the moon.If you wanted to make large solar sails (say to be a sunshade the Earth-Sun L1 point) you would probably de-volatilize materials by using heat and possibly oxygen.  It would be ideal to convert hydrocarbons to carbon monoxide so you can do C1 chemistry to make plastics.  You have waste CO2 no matter what (it offgases from carbonates and other chemistry) so you will need the same kind of chemistry people are talking about for capturing CO2 and using it as a chemical feedstock.The &#34;metal line&#34; and &#34;stone lines&#34; would reduce the devolatized rock to produce silicon solar cells,  electric connections,   mirrors,  etc.  You will make storage tanks from iron,  the devolatilization process could be a little awkward because you will need storage tanks to put the gate.The one resource I&#39;m not sure about is nitrogen, which is important for making chemistry work.  (Say you want to make a sail out of Kapton instead of Polyethylene.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is the article suggesting that they think these amino acids have survived in space for (over) 4.6 billion years?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funnily in linux we&#39;ve had kind of the opposite problem where dmcrypt at some point was changed to use high-priority, multi-threaded workqueues, creating a priority inversion situation.Regular userspace processes, even those with niced/lowered priority, could generate overwhelming amounts of CPU load just by creating a bunch of IO burden on a dmcrypt-backed mountpoint.  Far more than their fair share in terms of their own process scheduling.The effects of this were especially visible when listening to mp3 files on something like a core2duo (or older) machine.  Audio buffer underruns galore, just because you had a big git checkout or rsync running.It took me years to convince upstream to revert the responsible dmcrypt workqueue commit and fix this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yep. On a related note, when I was younger, I searched for advice from experts for how to develop expertise in studying and productivity on Reddit. It led to lots of highly-upvoted advice (including stuff like supplements, largely with few real benefits besides placebo), popular blogs by influencers (like Scott Young), and popular self-help books.However, the actual experts I knew in high school who later went on to great institutions like MIT or applied and got into extremely competitive investment banks didn&#39;t browse the internet very much, or relied on supplements and these books.Similar to the ideas expressed in the submitted article, these people didn&#39;t spend time online reading blogs and Reddit, or blogging/self-promoting themselves. They generally were involved in a sport (track and field or squash), spent little time online, and spent a lot of time using a lot of paper studying.They also were careful who they associated with as friends (they hung out with studious people). Less in one&#39;s control, their parents were financially successful or were in competitive positions (e.g. were professors or physicians), so they may have learned these strategies from them, versus inventing them independently.Long story short: there is absolutely a culture of improvement that is primarily offline and less visible, because people either don&#39;t record it, or people do record it and it doesn&#39;t get upvoted or ranked highly on Google searches. Examples of recorded good advice appeared on HN recently, shared by computer scientist Donald Knuth who is also usually offline: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31482116"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think about this constantly while reading Hacker News.  So many articles and comments by people whose level of enthusiasm doesn&#39;t match their experience.  Try to voice a comment that goes against the flow of that enthusiasm and you&#39;ll be downvoted to oblivion, even if you speak with more experience and context than the masses.  I&#39;m horrified by some of the stuff I see here and feel like it&#39;s often useless to speak out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Yes, there are many people who blog and otherwise publicly discuss development methodologies and what they&#39;re working on, but there are even more people who don&#39;t. Blogging takes time, for example, and not everyone enjoys it. Other people are working on commercial products and can&#39;t divulge the inner workings of their code.There’s a subset of this silent majority who tried to contribute to discussion platforms but gave up when they saw prominent voices that had next to no idea what they were talking about being promoted, hailed, and so on. The loudest voice is rarely the most articulate, and for subject matter experts articulation, nuance, and other learned-through-experience things count for a lot, one would assume."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In addition to the project itself being very cool and useful (you can count the number of verified SAT solvers that can solve most problems in modern SAT competitions on two fingers!), it&#39;s also an impressive demonstration of its toolchain, which essentially exploits the fact that the purely safe fragment of Rust (augmented with a handful of types that use unsafe code like Vec, which I believe have been proven compatible with the rest of Creusot in another recent paper) behaves like a functional language.  This allows borrow-checked Rust code to be treated purely functionally in safe contexts, which allows exploiting the large amount of existing software tailored to proving purely functional specifications, without having to worry about memory-related side conditions, separation logic, etc.This has always been the hope for Rust verification tools (that Rust would scale to these kinds of large proofs better than other industrial imperative languages due to the restrictions of the borrow checker), and I think this is the first real practical indication that that is indeed the case.  Both in terms of verification time and additional verification code, it weighs in at a small fraction of that of the only other verified solver with comparable performance on SAT benchmarks (IsaSAT), which is extracted using code generation from Isabelle (which is a full proof assistant), while other attempts to produce verified SAT solvers directly from imperative code fall far short of its performance because they do not implement any of the difficult optimizations (presumably due to the amount of extra proof effort required).Incidentally, another paper has come out at basically the same time making a similar observation, Aeneas: https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07185, which uses a resizable hash map as its case study.  Since it just came out, it does not have any larger proof developments yet that could be used as comparison, and it has somewhat different goals, but overall I am also excited about it and am very hopeful for the future of verification tools that integrate directly with Rust code like these two, as I think they are one of the more promising avenues towards the regular integration of verified code with more &#34;ordinary&#34; projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project uses one-way translation of Rust code into WhyML through Creusot. This translation is not formally guaranteed to be correct or semantics-preserving.Ideally, the code produced by Creusot should be translated back to Rust by a tool from Creusot or someone else. This way it is possible to use fixed point iteration, just like AST pretty-printer and parser for programming language syntax.This is more or less an approach taken by verification team of Buran (USSR&#39;s space shuttle) software. They took Fortran code and compiled it into executable code. The executable code was then manually translated back into Fortran and discrepancies analyzed. This way they found several errors in Fortran compiler. Buran made fully automatic landing in late 80-s.Contemporary verifiers should do the same automatically."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi! I’m the author of Creusot, Sarek did some amazing work on CreuSAT, he also had to teach himself formal verification and SAT solving along the way.If you have any questions about CreuSAT or Creusot, I’d be happy to answer"</p>
