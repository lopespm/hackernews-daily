								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So there&#39;s two options right - the first is that Parag is for some reason making big strategic decisions about the direction of the company despite the fact that we all know he&#39;ll be gone if the deal closes. Or he&#39;s making big strategic changes at the behest of the acquirers before the deal closes.Neither of these things seem particularly kosher moves to make. The question is how to figure out which one it is.It would seem weird for Parag to be following Musk&#39;s orders given how Musk has behaved. It also seems weird for Musk to already have the insight into the company to know specifically who to fire. There&#39;s not much advantage to making these changes now.On the other hand, going rogue and making big strategic decisions about the company really has the potential to burn Parag&#39;s reputation for wherever he would move next.I guess there&#39;s a third option - that Musk has expressed a specific view, Parag has a different view, but that they both think that this move is necessary anyway so just got on and did it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Twitter since it&#39;s main novelty was that it was a successful Ruby on Rails app, and honestly I&#39;ve been trying to figure out where the exit is for my personal use of Twitter lately. If the acquisition goes through, Twitter won&#39;t make enough money to service it&#39;s debt, and the things they will do to fix that are pretty much guaranteed to lower the quality of the platform, which frankly has never worked very well for me anyways. The fact that they&#39;re doing a leadership purge right now is not helping my opinion on this.I also think the proposal to have Twitter allow all content that is &#34;legal under US law&#34; is a dangerous idea for the platform being a healthy community that most people actually want to participate in. Content moderation debates have never been so ham-fisted as they are online so I won&#39;t try here, suffice to say there&#39;s some pretty horrible, disgusting things that are &#34;legal under US law&#34; (and as a content moderator, I&#39;ve seen them all). If Twitter allows people to do them, it will make it difficult for Twitter to maintain a healthy community, and the platform could quickly devolve into a scarychan-style sewer that only the craziest people on the internet will want to dwell in. To say nothing about whether advertisers will tolerate some of it, or even Apple&#39;s app store."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was some discussion on plausible NATO membership of Finland and Sweden. At that point the disucssion was based on guestimates from media.But now it&#39;s official. This is not the NATO membership application, but a statement from the political leadership in Finland that they support and suggest parliament proceeds with the application process with maximum urgency.The President and Prime Minister of Finland have published their position on NATO membership. This more or less seals Finland joining NATO.In Finnish system, the Prime Minister has most political power but president is the head of foreign policy. Their common statement was the required signal for the parliament to proceed with the process.Translation:
During the spring, there has been an important discussion about Finland&#39;s possible NATO membership. Time has been needed for domestic position formation both in Parliament and in society as a whole. Time has been needed for close international contacts with both NATO and its member countries, as well as with Sweden. We have wanted to give the debate the space it needs.Now that the time for decision-making is approaching, we also state our own common positions for the information of parliamentary groups and parties. NATO membership would strengthen Finland&#39;s security. As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense alliance. Finland must apply for NATO membership as a matter of urgency. We hope that the national steps still needed to reach this solution will be taken swiftly in the coming days.Sauli Niinistö

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fact that they&#39;ve been minting billions of tether without collateral should make it abundantly obvious that this isn&#39;t a stablecoin and never had been. Anyone can pretend to have a peg in the good times, that doesn&#39;t mean there&#39;s really a peg or that the peg will remain in bad times. And if you can&#39;t count on the peg in bad times, it&#39;s not a stablecoin. If you&#39;ve been honestly working on the assumption that it is, then you deserve to lose your (real) money to some crypto VCs on an island somewhere.And this doesn&#39;t only apply to crypto, look at how many countries with currency pegs can maintain that when their economy turns down, and then look at how many people actually seek to own the currency at that point rather than a currency backed by something (like a gigantic economy)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing that I think some people miss about Tether is that it&#39;s not about whether it is backed enough it&#39;s either fully backed or it isn&#39;t. If it&#39;s not, it&#39;s not a question of whether it&#39;s back enough to weather this storm, it&#39;s about whether the people running it think they can weather this storm. If they think they can keep it running they&#39;ll sell whatever backing they have and keep the peg. But if they even think there&#39;s a decent chance they can&#39;t permanently sustain the peg then the best thing for them to do is take the backing and run, not sink it into a stable-coin they now know isn&#39;t going to work. That&#39;s going to happen way before they run out of money.Let&#39;s say for example, Tether is 20% backed and there&#39;s $100Bn  of coins so the backing is $20Bn, and people start flooding out of it. Let&#39;s say $10Bn floods out. So the guys running it have handed out $10Bn. They now have $10Bn left, and money is still flooding out. Do they really continue to hand over the cash or do they say &#34;Well, the whole thing is about to explode anyway, I&#39;d rather keep the $10Bn cash I&#39;ve got left&#34;. At which point the holders of the coin have to play &#34;Find these fuckers and sue them&#34; which will be difficult since they&#39;ve got $10Bn to fight/flee/hide."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The entire concept of a &#34;stablecoin&#34; reminds me a lot of something from SIGBOVIK 2014. Keep in mind, this was written in 2014, before any stablecoins actually existed, and that SIGBOVIK is supposed to be a joke conference where people present extremely silly ideas as if they were real breakthroughs.&gt;  DollarCoin: We propose skipping the middleman and providing direct proof-of-dollar with a blockchain that consists of videos of burning US $1 notes. Each video will be unique as the hash of every block header is required to be written on the dollar bill to be burnt; the block header includes the previous block’s hash, which means that each block is forced to build on every previous block, forming a valid blockchainhttp://sigbovik.org/2014/proceedings.pdfThe fact is, people have convinced themselves that this is somehow a good idea. And then half the time, the person behind it doesn&#39;t actually burn any money and just arbitrarily mints coins. It&#39;s absolute lunacy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those wondering if we could get sharper images with JWST, here’s the previously imaged black hole (same angular size as our own) compared to a single pixel from Hubble’s wide field camera 3:https://twitter.com/alex_parker/status/1116070667068170240?s...JWST will have smaller “pixels” but is in the same ballpark."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am very skeptical of the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) images because they are not following a scientific method that results in a true representative image of their target. In my opinion astronomy is jumping the shark with these images by making this a big PR stunt.I&#39;ve looked at their methods for their earlier images and they seem to be hunting for a circle that looks like a black hole in their data. The EHT&#39;s full imaging stack has never been calibrated by looking at a known celestial body to compare images to validate their algorithms. They have calibrated their signals from results of other instruments, but their imaging algorithms change to fit their wanted results. This is my biggest problem with their approach. Anyone can modify algorithms of any arbitrary data to get an image of a glowing circle. A better method that shows a more true image would be to calibrate their imaging algorithms against a known celestial body to make sure their techniques produced comparable results from other instruments. Then they should have taken their calibrated imaging algorithms and gave it data from their target.I&#39;d have more confidence in the EHT if they would not change their imaging algorithms across images and give a side-by-side comparison of a known celestial body that other radio telescopes have imaged to verify their whole imaging stack.To me this a just a big PR stunt and I&#39;m very skeptical of their image."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am impressed.I have a few ignorant questions:1. There are three bright blobs on the image; I assume they are the same object, behind the BH. What are they/is it? They said the image was averaged; so presumably whatever the blobs are wasn&#39;t moving?2. Is it correct that the rest of the ring, ignoring the three blobs, is the far side of the accretion disk? Why can&#39;t I see this side of the accretion disk?3. According to the article, at least one submillimeter telescope was important. But submillimeter is infrared, isn&#39;t it? I thought infrared was blocked by dust, and if there&#39;s one thing there&#39;s a lot of at the centre of the galaxy, it&#39;s dust?[Edit] Questions 1 and two were prompted by this remark in the article:  &#34;The new view captures light bent by the powerful gravity of the black hole&#34;

The only &#34;light&#34; I can see is a ring with blobs in it; that&#39;s why I suppose the ring in the image is not the accretion disk, at least, not as viewed from the pole. Most other commenters here assume (or know) that it is the accretion disk, and we are looking at a pole.But if that is indeed the accretion disk, then that isn&#39;t light that&#39;s been bent by the gravity of the black hole.Perhaps the explanation is that many other commenters haven&#39;t actually read the article, possibly because they already know the story."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s scary, because CSAM (child sexual abuse material) is very, very broad, and quite vague in its definition¹. My three year old son stayed with my parents for a week, and he was being taught to swim in their swimming pool. Of course, I get sent pictures and clips of his progress by a proud grandma, and of course, him being a toddler, he felt swimming trunks to be completely optional (and of course, they are at his age in a private pool).That&#39;s not CSAM right? But who knows how the AI will mark those happy pics? Some quirk in its programming and training leading to them being pushed way up whatever ranking is used? It&#39;s a nude child after all, and that is most likely one of the few things such an algorithm can detect quite reliably.The automated filter won&#39;t care about the context though, and if any of the recent failures of algorithms ruining peoples lives are anything to go by (the Dutch Toeslagenaffaire comes to mind), being flagged by the CSAM filter is a high risk event — even if you can clear your name later by human intervention — because now you are on a list.1: People tend to conjure up horrific images of underage children getting raped by adults when they hear &#39;CSAM&#39; or &#39;child pornography&#39;, but when you read up on the legal definitions used it becomes very vague, quite fast. A seventeen year old boy sending a dick pic to his 18 year old lover is producing child pornography and can in many jurisdictions be sentenced as such, and nudism of any minor can be seen as CSAM if the pose they strike can be construed as &#39;erotic&#39; — yet there is no clear definition of what this means, falling squarely into “I&#39;ll know it when I see it” territory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think this proposal is quite enough, we can do better to protect the children.The homes of the people who champion this proposal should be thoroughly searched for child abuse materials every week. Naturally, their personal electronic devices should be taken for analysis. I understand this may cause them some inconvenience, but think of the children!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The worst thing is that, while the EU proposes dubious stuff like this, the police doesn&#39;t actually try to remove such content from the internet or are at least really ineffective at doing so. There was a documentary[1] from the german public tv station NDR in which reporters / journalists managed to delete the majority of content from one such CSAM forum, by sending deletion requests to the hosters. The police just... did nothing about it? :/It&#39;s mind boggling. It would be nice if only 50% of the energy put into laws with questionable results like this, would be used to give victims of sexual child abuse more help and support (or, in many cases, some at all) to continue living as much as possible despite the monsters in their own heads that such sexual abuse creates, wouldn&#39;t it? :/[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iItLpwkQMUQ

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s less that I&#39;m glad the market is crashing, and more that I&#39;m glad that the insufferable crypto bros are finally getting a punch to the mouth. Seriously, these people are the worst. Your average &#34;crypto investor&#34; has no skills, no mathematical foundations, nothing. Except for pure stupid luck, and the ability to spew inane crypto babble 24/7. And yes, they think they are much smarter than you, because they achieved better financial results than you did while only doing 1/1000 of the work to get there. I truly hate the fact that these people are so rich. It makes me want to move to Alaska and just try to ignore society for the rest of my days.This came off as pretty bitter. I apologize, but I am bitter, and I&#39;m having a shit couple weeks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel bad for people losing money, but crypto has not lived up to its potential at all, remains a solution looking for a problem, and is an environmental disaster.I used to be a huge believer. Brian Armstrong gave me my first Bitcoin in 2011 at District in SOMA. Electricity was included in my rent so I bought 10 video cards and mined for about two years on 5 systems. At a company I founded, I use Bitcoin to pay for food and drinks. According to the Barista, I was the first person to ever pay for coffee with Bitcoin at Coupa Cafe (despite having to stand there and wait 10 minutes while the transaction cleared).But nothing has come of it. All the years of promises and applications, nothing. Ether DApps, sure, but how much of the modern internet runs on those? I also mined StorJ and Monero for years. Apart from a way of making money and storing value, crypto is useless. Processing fees are way too high to even be considered as a replacement for payments not to mention other barriers such as the ability to integrate with antiquated point of sale systems entirely designed around credit/debit and cash.So I put all of my holdings into a retirement account and don&#39;t worry about the price. But I&#39;ve given up on crypto and everyone who babbles on endlessly like they know something I don&#39;t about how it&#39;s going to change the world. So even if Crypto loses its value some, I&#39;m glad because the lack of easy, effortless gains will disappear for a lot of those people and most of these short term hucksters will fade away. I&#39;ll gladly exchange crypto&#39;s price for less crypto bros. My cost basis is around $150 so I have a long ways to go before I care that much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a Macro crash. SP500 is down -%5 YTD. Meta -37%, Netflix -65%. Lots of pain spreading. You shouldn&#39;t gloat or be happy. Give it a couple of more months like this, and lots of the HN audience would be worried about layoffs.The security of your average software developer job is strongly tied to market cycles.If you want a place to direct your hate and bitterness, I would do it at the architects of the BOOM/BUSTS cycles that keeps happenings and destroys people lives."</p>

I&#39;d done it for our institution, but it was sort of straightforward to generalize it to any institution for which this would be applicable. The code was... awful. Rather than doing it &#34;properly,&#34; since I already had all the code I had written to do the analysis for my institution, I literally just ran it on the entire data set (10GB or so) for every organization that existed and then just put some result file on S3. My &#34;site&#34; would just let folks search for their institution, and present the data with a couple graphs, some nice visuals, and have them print it out. I was ashamed of it in a technical sense.But I just bought a domain and tweeted at a journalist. Whelp, two weeks later, I had my picture in the city&#39;s biggest paper, my org got some positive press, did a service for other non-profits, had folks reaching out to me about jobs, etc. It took SO LITTLE effort, and every instinct I had was that it was bad and I shouldn&#39;t publish it. But the reality is I had already done 95% of the work... committing to just do the extra 5% was so hard to do, but in hindsight, so obviously amazing ROI, even if it hadn&#39;t gotten the attention it did.Secondly, I built a reading app for a teacher at my school to let him do an activity where kids would jumble up sentences and paragraphs in order to help them understand transition words. The only reason I agree to try to do this was that I was learning React at the time and wanted to play with the React drag and drop library. After a weekend, I had it essentially working, and it was a success in his classroom. And here, too, it was to be the end of it... but I pushed myself through it, added a simple login mechanic, user account, etc. I had a small technical question as I was wrapping up, and I posted it on reddit. Someone who worked at a nonprofit mentioned to me that the app could potentially qualify for a grant that the Verizon foundation was running for learning apps. I applied... and we got it. The money award helped pay for my entire grad school tuition.Really... just ship it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A big fallacy that I always see - and that is implied by this post - is that the work ends after shipping, a.k.a. &#34;build it and they will come&#34;. That doesn&#39;t happen any more. So after you &#34;ship&#34; it, you need to promote it, advertise it, create buzz around it and make people use it. 
And that is a totally different kind of beast than coding something.But on the flip side, if you develop a side project just for yourself, you most certainly learn something. Heck, the author explicitly mentioned learning React Native, which is absolutely great and definitely worth investing time into.Learning things is valuable in itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The tone of this post suggests that if the author simply just shipped, they would be as successful as the competitor.Building successful products is not a matter of “shipping” but also promoting, selling, continually improving, studying user behaviors, providing customer support and engaging potential customers.Given that the author wasn’t even motivated enough to ship when all these other tasks weren’t even applicable yet, I can’t imagine they would be motivated to do all the work after shipping.Frankly, this is a good thing. I’ve never been more stressed than when I’ve managed to ship a product, picked up a tiny number of paying customers, and subsequently realized that many hundreds of more hours would have to be poured into the product to make it truly useful.You slowly start working on it, customers are upset and start churning, and you’re constantly questioning whether it’s worth it anymore to keep pushing.The most success I’ve ever had was building something I personally thought is fun and interesting with 0 expectations of money or profit, customers be damned.I’m building https://mintables.club right now, sometimes I pick it up for a few hours on a weekend, often I ignore it for weeks, but I visit it all the time because I love the artwork people upload. There’s tons of competitors that do similar things, even before I started it, but I couldn’t care less."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I noticed this too when I used steam to stream a game to my laptop over good wifi. Every minute it would stutter for a second. I set up iperf3 tests and noticed the wifi lag increasing every minute between my macbook and my server and between my windows desktop pc and my server (when connected over wifi). Of course no lag when using cables, so I reasoned it was wifi related, and had noting to do with my setup (I used different clients, and different AP&#39;s). I then took my macbook (only portable computer I had) it too a nearby coffee shop with good wifi and I could still measure lag spikes every minute. So then I was really puzzled, was there some rogue device interfering with wifi all over the neighborhood? Finally I found a suggestion to turn off location services (or whatever it is called), and the spikes disappeared. And I learnt that even when it is not used (not sure it the lid was closed) a macbook can cause significant interference to the wifi for all other nearby devices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is normal across all wifi clients; they can&#39;t scan for networks and transfer data simultaneously so there will always be increased latency during that event. You can test this yourself by doing a low-interval ping and clicking the wifi icon to show you nearby networks - you&#39;ll notice a brief latency spike.I agree that it&#39;s not a good default to have an app doing this, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m on Wi-Fi on my MacBook (Pro 16&#34; 2021). I opened Maps.app (which gets my location correctly), started pinging my router, it&#39;s been a few minutes...No spike. It must be occuring at some corner case, not for everyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We built a map like this at reddit a long time ago.  The methodology was pretty straightforward -- we looked at subreddits that had the same links submitted and upvoted.  We used the map to power the &#34;similar subreddits&#34; feature.  Unfortunately it suffered from a lot of spam and things like getting linked to very NSFW subreddits, and we didn&#39;t have the manpower to fix it or curate it, so the feature died."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I processed 176,178,986 unique comments that redditors left in years 2020 - 2021 and computed Jaccard Similarity between subreddits.&gt; Each dot on the map is subreddit. Two dots within the same cluster are usually close to each other if multiple users frequently leave comments on both subreddits.More detail from the repo: https://github.com/anvaka/map-of-reddit"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There’s actually a subreddit for this map, but can’t find it in the map itself  (too meta?) : https://www.reddit.com/r/MofR/  
Also surprised how big overwatch is relative to other games.Bonus - My roommate works at Amazon and works part time with Andrei in some capacity (don’t know the full details), but anyway he has mentioned multiple times how cool and out of his way helpful Andrei is.I bring this up because when someone of any notoriety is nice I think it’s really cool. I’ve met some ‘big’ tech people who definitely weren’t!"</p>
