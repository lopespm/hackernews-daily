								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just spent 30 minutes reading about this. I&#39;m so shocked that I&#39;m logging in to comment after 5 years of lurking.Justine has built a c library that allows you compile a binary once and have it run it on any os or baremetal. The SAME binary. Quite frankly, that sentence doesn&#39;t even make sense to me.Check out https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/cosmopolitan/index.ht...As far as I&#39;m concerned, this is literal magic. Look at the magic numbers: 
https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan/blob/37a4c70c3634862d8d...I could go on, but there&#39;s no binary portability comparison with any other language. And she has made some pretty neat optimizations.Back in the day, I saw some pretty neat stuff with the ELF format, but this takes the cake.Wow.Edit: 
I&#39;m editing because this is just so bloody absurd.https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/printimage.html$ ./printimage.com someimage.jpgLike wow. And also video.https://storage.googleapis.com/justine/printvideo.htmlI&#39;m struggling to put my shock into words. I&#39;ve been around.There&#39;s engineering. There&#39;s academia.But this falls into straight-up wizardry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love reading Justine&#39;s code. It comes up from time to time here and it just makes me happy. It reminds me of the passage from &#34;Programming Sucks&#34; by Still Drinking [1]  Every programmer occasionally, when nobody’s home, turns off the lights, pours a glass of scotch, puts on some light German electronica, and opens up a file on their computer. It’s a different file for every programmer. Sometimes they wrote it, sometimes they found it and knew they had to save it. They read over the lines, and weep at their beauty, then the tears turn bitter as they remember the rest of the files and the inevitable collapse of all that is good and true in the world.

  This file is Good Code. It has sensible and consistent names for functions and variables. It’s concise. It doesn’t do anything obviously stupid. It has never had to live in the wild, or answer to a sales team. It does exactly one, mundane, specific thing, and it does it well. It was written by a single person, and never touched by another. It reads like poetry written by someone over thirty.

Her work is always just a little bit trippy in a good way haha.[1] http://stilldrinking.org/programming-sucks"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unless I am reading this incorrectly, I think this paragraph better summerizes the article versus the headline:&#34;In this case, Google is accused of relying on pieces of its code within websites that use its analytics and advertising services to scrape users’ supposedly private browsing history and send copies of it to Google’s servers. Google makes it seem like private browsing mode gives users more control of their data, Amanda Bonn, a lawyer representing users, told Koh. In reality, “Google is saying there’s basically very little you can do to prevent us from collecting your data, and that’s what you should assume we’re doing,” Bonn said.&#34;It doesn&#39;t seem like the complaint is that Chrome collects data on you in &#34;Incognito&#34; mode, rather that websites (e.g. Google Analytics) still collect on you in &#34;Incognito&#34; mode."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People often defend companies with explanations of how the world is, when common folk often expect (or just want) the world to behave differently.Is it unreasonable to want, or even expect, an incognito window to disable all forms of tracking?Wouldn&#39;t the world be far better if a phone alerted me to an app scanning my local area network or contacts? Or if I got warnings when it took such actions?I think us tech folks need to, collectively, stop defending companies reasoning and explanations for the world they created, and start standing with and for a world which matches common folks expectations. It really seems like a better world.---EDIT: Ask what the layperson would think tracking is! Imagining the answer is pretty simple &#34;a website [or the web at large] learning or remembering anything about me.&#34; If we start from there, rather than the mumbo-jumbo thrown at us, we can make progress."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate tracking as much as the next person, but a simple reading of the &#34;You&#39;ve gone incognito&#34; screen ought to make obvious that its primary purpose is to hide your activity from others who use the same device. It&#39;s literally written on the first line:&#34;Now you can browse privately, and other people who use this device won&#39;t see your activity.&#34;It goes on to list other technical specifics about what is not saved, but those are pretty much just sub-points. I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s fair to expect Incognito to do something it&#39;s not meant to do."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author is less than enthusiastic about Apple and Microsoft pivoting to ARM. Considering the perf of the M1, this is virtually inevitable. And once most developer tool chains start supporting ARM as a first class citizen, I see no reason why we wouldn’t start running our applications on ARM in the cloud. A world with 2 architectures for mainstream use cases is the future, there’s no point fighting it.(Unless you’re Intel/AMD in which case please fight it by giving us faster, more power-efficient chips for cheaper.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Some apps, like Facebook, allow for some data tracking to be manually disabled. But by default, it is turned on. That gives the company reams of personal data on who we are and what we are doing, which it then vacuums up, packages and sells.My understanding is that Facebook does not sell this data, but rather lets advertisers create hyper-targeted ads, which are only possible because of this data.Edit: Certainly not trying to defend Facebook here (in the slightest).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work on a 3-person DevOps team that just finished migrating ~20 services from GCE vms running docker-compose to GKE.It&#39;s taken us a little over a year. Partly because K8s has a steep learning curve, but also because safely transitioning services without disrupting product teams adds a lot of overhead.The investment is already yielding great returns. Developers are happy. Actual quote: &#34;Kubernetes is the biggest quality-of-life improvement I&#39;ve experienced in my career.&#34;The same is true for me as a DevOps engineer. I never have to write a script to orchestrate a rolling deployment ever again. I&#39;ll never have to touch Puppet or wrangle OS upgrades. I no longer need to use Terraform to scale out a service.Now that we&#39;ve completed this transition, one of my goals for the next year is to get the team to a place where we spend 75% of our time on higher-level projects -- working on developer tools and Kubernetes extensions and setting site reliability standards, instead of the firefighting and operational work that has traditionally taken up so much of our time. Couldn&#39;t be happier about this change.... That is until management decides we&#39;re overhead and fires us to free up budget for feature developers. ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand their rationale. We manage thousand Kubernetes clusters and end-users can find lots and lots of creative way to shoot themselves in the foot:- I can store anything in a secret? Let&#39;s have thousands of cat images. Etcd then stops working because we have over 2GB of funny cats in the key store.- I can run a root Pod? Lets mount the docker socket and start building images with it. Oh and by the way, I never clean those up and my Node simply fills up. Also I add some additional docker networks that break Pod to Pod networks.- Istio is nice - why we don&#39;t add automatic injection for Pods in all namespaces? Including kube-system? And then they brick kube-proxy and the cluster stops working.- I can use validating webhooks for better security? Lets watch on all resources. To keep it more secure lets set the failure policy of the webhook to Fail, so we never admit any modification without the apiserver to make a call to out webhook. Whats that? My single replica webhook has was evicted from the Pod (we didn&#39;t add any resource requests and limits) and now it cannot even be created or scheduled because kube-controller-manager and kube-scheduler cannot update their lease and they lost leadership and now are idling, effectively bricking the entire cluster.Google would reduce the pain points with this change, however they would still face countless other issues with Kubernetes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember trying out docker sometime back in late 2013. Something about it never fully stuck with me. I always felt like the final boundary for a piece software should be the process, not the computer. Plopping an entire VM into a zipfile and saying &#34;here&#39;s your software&#34; felt like lazy engineering to many of us at the time (and still today).For our current stack, the answer has been to make the entire business application run as a single process. We also use a single (mono) repository because it is a natural fit with the grain of the software.As far as I am aware, there is no reason a single process cannot exploit the full resources of any computer. Modern x86 servers are ridiculously fast, as long as you can get at them directly. AspNetCore + SQLite (properly tuned) running on a 64 core Epyc serving web clients using Kestrel will probably be sufficient for 99.9% of business applications today. You can handle millions of simultaneous clients without blinking. Who even has that many total customers right now?Horizonal scalability is simply a band-aid for poor engineering in most (not all) applications. The poor engineering, in my experience, is typically caused by underestimating how fast a single x86 thread is and exploring the concurrent &amp; distributed computing rabbit hole from there. It is a rabbit hole that should go unexplored, if ever possible.Here&#39;s a quick trick if none of the above sticks: If one of your consultants or developers tells you they can make your application faster by adding a bunch of additional computers, you are almost certainly getting taken for a ride."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have thoughts, and I agree but also disagree a bit.We are in the dark-ages with respect to streaming sockets, and I am the architect of one of the worlds largest WebSocket and streaming services.First off, unseating the operational benefits provided by request response is a huge challenge. It&#39;s possible, and I&#39;ve done it. One of these days, my co-authors and I will present an OSDI paper with the broad strokes. It&#39;s very easy to list a lot of the challenges with scaling WebSocket, but each of them can be solved.I believe we will have a nicer world with QUIC --&gt; Http/3 and the up and coming WebTransport discussion. SADLY, that will result in a decade long &#34;caniuse&#34; issue, so we should expect to see WebTransport polyfills to arrive...Second, HTML over WebSockets is nice, but what is better is reactive data binding over the socket. Let the browser maintain a DOM tree that templates over a JSON object, then reactive-ly update and it&#39;s an amazing experience. You have minimal data transfer, and minimal rendering updates. There is a great deal of power in having your UI be a stateless function over a giant JSON object.Finally, the big challenge is dealing with the server state in a meaningful way. The exceptionally nice property of using request response for everything is the shared-nothing stateless nature of the web server. It&#39;s exceptionally forgiving in both operational and developer issues.It&#39;s very easy to fuck up the implicit state tied to the connection, and this requires discipline to get right. It&#39;s very easy to ship unreliable software that then has issues based on the connection.Now, I&#39;m a HUGE believer in that we need to use streams for everything, but it requires a mind shift. The key thing to tackle is dealing with the server side state, and this is where I have my shitty idea of a programming language for board games. In essence, I am building a DIY database such that people connect directly to the database and get that sweet giant JSON object along with a stream of updates.The DIY part is related to the fact that I invented a programming language to transact on the JSON object such that you get all the benefits of durability with the mental model of working within a single machine.http://www.adama-lang.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems like X Windows protocol over HTTPS with JSON as the wire encoding.It&#39;s sad to think how much effort is spent reimplementing technologies because the IPv4 address space wasn&#39;t large enough.If IP address space were larger, we wouldn&#39;t have needed to rely on Network Address Translation (NAT). NAT became a poor-man&#39;s firewall and effectively blocked peer-to-peer connections making it difficult to host a server at home. This incentivized early ISPs to offer only asymmetric connections that pushed users towards a consumer-only service that crippled early Internet protocols. With the World Wide Web being &#34;the&#34; reason people got on to the Internet in the first place, early NAT-enabled routers focused only on HTTP tunneling, so completed protocols that required inbound connections were finally killed off.Who would have thought that a small IP address space could result in a mass protocol extinction event from which only HTTP and HTML would survive...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seams really optimistic and kind of glosses over the subject of scaling out websocket connections apart from this.Anecdotally, the typical single Rails server process seems to be perfectly happy supporting nearly 4,000 active connections. And you can easily swap in the excellent AnyCable to bump that up to around 10,000+ connections per node by not relying on the built-in Ruby WebSocket server.That&#39;s not a lot of connections on it&#39;s own.  If you are implementing a chat service you&#39;ll still need some form of pub/sub (or something) to glue all of that together when users connect to disparate nodes.AlsoHow about client-side validations? Easy. On every input change, round up the form values and send ’em down the WebSocket.That&#39;s just server side validation.As a disclaimer, I haven&#39;t used any of the HTML over WS frameworks the author discusses, but I&#39;ve spent a fair amount of time dealing with scaling socket connections.  It definitely makes the question of scaling horizontally more challenging.  I feel like this article really glosses over that aspect."</p>

If you can exert a 5% pressure on some system and maybe only get a 5% reaction, that&#39;s perfectly fine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey folks, I&#39;ve recently had the idea of building an e-ink laptop from the devices I had at home. I decided to document the process and share each step of the way:Some of the posts planned for the series are: Dasung Paperlike HD-FT teardown, Thinkpad T480 teardown, Creating the prototype, Installing and configuring NixOS, M-x e-ink-laptop-modeIf you have any questions or comments, feel free to reach out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Has anybody tried to retrofit a transflector into a laptop LCD screen? I&#39;ve got no idea if this is even possible but I&#39;d love to be able to just trigger a brightness=0 and see a smartwatch-type display that doesn&#39;t strain my eyes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can use Parabola-rM[1] with a reMarkable 1 tablet as an all-in-one solution, and like the T480 can be totally freedom-respecting using only libre software.[1]: http://www.davisr.me/projects/parabola-rm/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read about Taler a few years back, and I&#39;m excited to see that it is still under development.In my opinion, for those of us who aren&#39;t anti-government, Taler represents an ethical future of digital spending:It is interoperable, so unlike our current Visa situation, the free market should be able to bid down payment fees to a fair rate. It&#39;s insane to me that Visa and Mastercard have basically positioned themselves as exclusive middlemen on the vast majority of digital transactions, in an age when so much commerce necessarily is digital.It offers privacy that Visa / PayPal / etc cannot.It makes income traceable in a way that bitcoin does not, to facilitate lawful taxation.It is inherently scalable in a way that bitcoin arguably is not (bitcoin has offchain scaling mechanisms, sure, but if you&#39;re being honest it&#39;s a stretch)It&#39;s not introducing a new currency or coin that will be endlessly speculated on, unlike most every crypto solution out there (even stablecoins rely on eth or others for transaction fees)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here are the core principles behind Taler: https://taler.net/en/principles.htmlNote: Taler is not a cryptocurrency. It&#39;s an electronic payment system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great name. The word “Taler” derives from the “Joachimsthaler Guldengroschen” currency (Guilder groschen of St. Joachin&#39;s Valley), or “Thaler” for short. The coin was introduced in 1518 in the Holy Roman Empire and many currencies in Europe became named after the Thaler. The Dutch brought their “leeuwendaler” (lit. lion daler) coin to New Netherlands (now New York), lending its name to the US Dollar. I presume Taler was used for this project to match modern German orthography and to avoid confusion with the English ‘th’ ‹θ› sound.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar#Historyhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J%C3%A1chymov"</p>
