								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wrote Hacking Healthcare for O&#39;Reilly, created ClearHealth/HealthCloud open source EMR, managed health systems for 15+ years, blah, blah, blah.It is very good there is are the transparency regulations. It is worth briefly explaining some of the reasons why many facitilities are having a hard time complying. There are some bad actors, absolutely true. However &#34;Hanlons Razor&#34; -- never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity -- definitely applies.Many health systems are a lot more like &#34;medical malls&#34; than they are single monolithic enterprises. Lots of health systems use really, really old technology and also a lot of it from a company called &#34;Epic&#34;. Epic does what it wants, when it wants and there is basically nothing anyone can do about it. There is rarely one central consistent mechanism and source of truth for pricing data because it gets generated from a complex web of different entities, systems, and processes. Herding all those cats is why it can take a health system a long time to comply. And also why a fine of even a million dollars can be small potatos vs the cost of actually complying in a timely manner.Just one facet, MUMPS is a widely used technology which you probably haven&#39;t heard of and which very few technologists understand. Lots of people are struggling to create new code to meet the new regulations using 1970s era technology including MUMPS.Another, a lot of health systems have been around a really long time. The insurers they work with also, (since the 1960s at least). They have Electronic Data Interchange EDI relationships built on the standard called 837. Business logic that surrounds pricing and billing is often buried in 50 years of tech debt. Everyone is deathly afraid of making too many changes too fast because when those systems break the money stops flowing and a health system will literally go insolvent. People still have hard physical lines connected to Medicare mainframes.This is a similar situation to other regulated industries like banking, airlines, etc. Modernization is hard, time consuming and very expensive. These regulations are a good driver for all that, but it takes time. Having been in some of these boardrooms there is not typically a cartel of evil executives figuring out how to screw patients. A lot of the time it is a group of relatively normal people trying to hold up a technological and business process house of cards with chewing gum, paper clips and hope.Disclaimer: I have been involved with the development of some of the fee schedules and health systems mentioned/criticized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When High Deductible Insurance was introduced the supposed concept was to &#34;give employees a stake in their costs, and therefore lower them for both employer and employee.&#34;However, even today doing so is very challenging, and before laws like this it was essentially impossible. There&#39;s no way to shop around American healthcare, with the system itself working against you at every turn (e.g. doctors prescribing named brand, and you not be allowed to switch back to generic without another $100+ appointment).You can try calling and getting quotes, but they&#39;ll just waste a bunch of time and then give you a RANGE with no assurances. Even getting the quote requires your doctor to write up the entire work-order, which itself can get pushback, and or cost money.Then you have random things like for-profit life flights, which are automatic bankruptcy machines. Imagine one minute driving down the road, then suddenly waking up in a hospital, and then getting billed $80K for just the trip to get there let alone your hospital treatment or recovery. And insurance doesn&#39;t cover it.Aside but all ambulances around me are &#34;out of network&#34; and don&#39;t work with insurance at all. So I guess I should shop around by moving cities..?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A better formulation of DRY is SPOT (Single Point Of Truth). Definitions (code, data) that represent the same “truth”, i.e. when one changes all have to change to represent a consistent truth, should be reduced to a single definition.  For example, if there is a rule that pizzas need at least one topping, there should only be a single place where that condition is expressed, so that when the rule changes, it isn’t just changed in one place but not the others. Another example is when fixing a bug, you don’t want to have to fix it in multiple places (or, more likely, neglect to fix it in the other places)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time I read an article like this, &#34;why &lt;often cited best practice&gt; is overrated&#34;, I think, yeah you are right in theory. But most places I have worked, these best practices were not overused, but underused. If you have the problem that your coworkers create unneccessary abstractions, I envy you, because I have so often had the opposite problem. Maybe this is not the case if you work in a great software development team. But if you work somewhere where they do software development on the side (science, hardware, etc..) it is the main issue.People not able to factor out functions or structure their code in a readable way. Variables are called v1, v2, v3. Unit testing seen as a waste of time. CI seen as a fun toy. They lack the experience to even notice the difference.Maybe I&#39;m becoming a curmudgeon, but I think many people would be well served by just googling &#34;&lt;my programming language&gt; best practices&#34;, learning the acronyms like DRY, and just following them. And when you have gained some experience, sure, then you should question the wisdom and not follow it blindly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  Instead of our code being architected around the concept of how pizzas are made in the abstract, its architecture is tightly coupled to the specific needs of these two pizzas that we happened to be dealing with. The chance that we will be putting this code back the way it was is extremely high.Mistake 1: Switch from DRY to premature optimization.&gt; You might think that legit reasonable developers but would not actually do something like this and would instead go back to the existing invocations and modify them to get a nice solution, but I&#39;ve seen this happen all over the place.Mistake 2: Assumption of incompetence to support your argument.&gt; . As soon as we start the thought process of thinking how to avoid a copy paste and refactor instead, we are losing the complexity battle.Mistake 3: Strawman argument. DRY does NOT lead to over-complicating things.
Overcomplicating things leads to overcomplicating things.Now, i wasted 5 minutes, so you can waste some more to reply to this comment, instead of completely ignoring this dumb random blog post."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The maritime coverage map shows coastal coverage around countries with inland coverage right now, i.e. they are bouncing the connection via one of their satellites to a nearby groundstation.Starting in Q4/2022 they want to cover mid-latitudes around the globe. That might mean that they plan to enable inter-satellite links then? (This is a bit surprising - on one hand, this step extends coverage towards higher and lower latitudes but on the other hand not as much as they already have inland-coverage (cf. Brazil). It also extends longitudinally around all of the globe?).Coverage above mid-latitudes requires satellites in polar orbits to join the network. (Their non-polar orbits have an inclination of 53° which means that satellites go no further north or south than that (plus a bit whatever their range is)).https://api.starlink.com/public-files/maritime-coverage-map...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work in the space industry and follow SATCOM closely. This is a very competitive space. Companies like Viasat, Iridium and Inmarsat already work in this vertical.SpaceX beats all these companies from a marketing perspective, but the big question is will a LEO operator provide better coverage than a GEO operator?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve always described myself as a person with zero ability to multitask.  Always have been, always will be.  Every time I cook, my wife about has a panic attack watching me fumble around, forgetting things, looking for things, oh god that&#39;s burning, etc.Back on topic, I absolutely cannot listen to music with words when I code.  I&#39;ll intermittently type lyrics instead of what I was intending to do.  Anyone else cursed with such a thing?If anyone cares, I actually like a lot of the vaporwave/outrun/whatever it&#39;s called now stuff when coding.  Techno is a bit too jarring, and while I love classical, it either puts me to sleep or carries me away in thought."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple of my go-tos are Solar Fields and Infected Mushroom. Both are electronic; former is calm/ambient focus, latter is energetic/driving focus. Both have huuuge discographies that you can just put on shufflehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7ldYxgJQG_Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQmvPQ0MmiYSolar Fields actually did the Mirror&#39;s Edge game soundtracks too, if you&#39;ve played those. Really nice mix of ambient, almost meditative sounds. Often there&#39;s a super long, repetitive, pulsing buildup to a brief higher-energy section at the end of a trackInfected Mushroom is a wild mix of heavy Israeli dance-electronica, trance, and even rock, with a dash of metal here and there"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just quickly scrolled through my collection and here are some random, but fantastic instrumental albums I&#39;ve used while &#34;in the zone&#34;:  - Miles Davis: In a Silent Way
  - Brian Eno: Ambient 4: On Land
  - Godspeed You! Black Emperor: F♯ A♯ ∞ (one of my favourite albums. listen with your best headphones. HD650s are good)
  - Aphex Twin: Selected Ambient Works Volume II
  - Mozart: Requiem (my first proper introduction to classical. I was absolutely blown away)
  - Boards of Canada - Music Has the Right to Children
  - Sun O))): Black One (extremely experimental doom metal. the musicality of it is questionable at times but it&#39;s fantastic to study to)
  - Sleep: Jerusalem (occasional vocals but trust me they&#39;re not distracting)
  - Tim Hecker: Harmony in Ultraviolet
  - Bill Evans: Sunday at the Village Vanguard

The worst part about these sorts of things is that 30 seconds after posting I&#39;ll remember all the awesome albums I forgot and kick myself for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very nice, I thought it was a basic wrapper around SQLite but then realized it actually had more features then that, such as it&#39;s own admin dashboard. Then I realized you built multiple auth designs into the system, then I realized there was a javascript SDK to interact with it, then I found your beautiful documentation site, then I realized there is an actual product inspiring it&#39;s development (https://presentator.io/)Each of these is another encouragement to use pocketbase. I went from &#34;eh, I&#39;ll just keep my own wrapper&#34; to &#34;pocketbase has a lot of promise, I should try it&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PocketBase is a small open source project that I&#39;ve been working for the last couple of months.You could think of PocketBase as a lightweight Firebase/Supabase alternative.In short, it is an open source Go backend (framework and app) consisting of:- embedded database (SQLite) with realtime subscriptions\- backed-in files and users management- convenient Admin dashboard UI- simple REST-ish APIAnd all of this compiles to a single portable binary.It&#39;s still a little rough around the edges, but you could give it a try and share your feedback."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks very nice.One thing I noticed is you are using server sent events for subscriptions.  SSE have a lot of nice properties but do have one nasty limitation (from https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent...):&#34;Warning: When not used over HTTP/2, SSE suffers from a limitation to the maximum number of open connections, which can be especially painful when opening multiple tabs, as the limit is per browser and is set to a very low number (6). The issue has been marked as &#34;Won&#39;t fix&#34; in Chrome and Firefox. This limit is per browser + domain, which means that you can open 6 SSE connections across all of the tabs to www.example1.com and another 6 SSE connections to www.example2.com (per Stackoverflow). When using HTTP/2, the maximum number of simultaneous HTTP streams is negotiated between the server and the client (defaults to 100).&#34;This can lead to some weird bug reports from users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Roblox is horrendous. It is as dangerous as any dark corner of the Internet, except that it appears child-friendly to parents. It _seems_ to have controls, and _seems_ to restrict bad behaviour, but it does not, and cannot. My daughter was roped into an online paedophile ring when she was 12. The initial contacts and grooming were made through Roblox... almost right under our noses. Every time we, as parents, looked at what she was doing, it seemed okay. We could have dug deeper, but did not. Luckily we caught it before it progressed too far, but some damage was done.Wherever you can, tell parents to flat-out block Roblox.Edit: Because people are asking how it works.Roblox is a lot about bragging rights for individuals. You gain skins, trade for rare items, buy Robux for real money that can be used to buy items. Players flock around those that that have rare or expensive items. My daughter had a &#34;super super happy face&#34;. I just googled, and it is current selling for $350. It makes them feel wanted and important. So just like fornite and skins in other games.The groomers feed the celebrity, sense of community and so on to engage in chat. It starts as in-game chat, which you can never see the history of, before moving to DMs. The chat has tricks to get around removed words, so they all communicate in some sort of code that they all pick up along the way. Then they are able to divert them to other platforms where there are fewer controls. My daughter was made to create instagram account and an a porn one. Then they follow up on other platform calls (or phone calls) and follow the usual grooming techniques.The trick is to identify the marks by how they behave in the game, and in the more popular, and social ones, I think that it is quite easy (in retrospect)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like Hearthstone is a good example of the maximum amount of communication two strangers can have on the Internet.  You can choose 6 pre-made things to say to your opponent; Thanks, Well Played, Greeting, Wow, Oops, Threaten.  This might be too much; I have definitely seen people get mad from their opponent using the voice lines too much.My thought is that this significantly reduces the richness of the in-game interactions (implies less engagement, implies less revenue), but doesn&#39;t need moderators to keep the game from being used for illegal sexual encounters, which is nice if your game targets kids."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the challenges here is that the incentives are misaligned.  It&#39;s well-understood in the cash-shop games industry that most of the revenue comes from &#34;whales&#34;, users that buy large quantities.  In a game targeted at children, who themselves don&#39;t have income/credit cards, it&#39;s unlikely that the &#34;whales&#34; are in the target demographic.  Rather, it is likely most of the &#34;whales&#34; are adults who are spending large in order to use the in-game currency to exploit interactions with others.Not only was this predictable, it seems nearly by design.  I don&#39;t see how Roblox can ever fix this without fundamentally changing their business model.  Their business model is essentially structured to enable commercial sexual exploitation of children over mobile platforms.On my own network I used various means to make it impossible for anyone to use Roblox, music.ly, TikTok, et al.  Services that are targeted specifically at children but provide a pathway for semi-anonymous communication are already ripe for exploitation by bad actors, the microtransactions aspect of Roblox just makes it even worse.It&#39;s ironic, but platforms intended for adults tend to be safer for children, because they don&#39;t concentrate bad actors in the same way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Part of taking on SOC 2 is also choosing whether you want your attitude to be &#34;Let&#39;s do the minimum to get past the audit&#34; and &#34;Let&#39;s take this framework, and figure out where we can learn from it.&#34;The post mentions background checks. On the one hand, I understand there&#39;s a real issue with these. On the other, if my PAAS isn&#39;t ensuring repeat offender fraudsters don&#39;t have access to sensitive data, that&#39;s possibly an area of concern. Hopefully the things they took from the other mentioned company do increase due diligence in vetting employees who have access to sensitive/regulated information.Use it as a framework to actually think about BCP, DRP, etc, etc, and it won&#39;t be a total waste of time.Edit:
Also adding I bring up background checks as an example of learning from vetted practices, rather than trying to attack the decisions of fly. I respect this article, especially where it&#39;s easy for people on the internet to criticize decisions, when the reality is security is a series of tradeoffs, and to function as a business means having imperfect processes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work somewhere going through a similar process for much the same reason.And to be frank, I&#39;m wondering if how it ends is in me looking for a new job.I know there&#39;s good reasons for the business to go through this process, and maybe it is really important for the business future but as an individual it sucks, my main motivator of achieving good outcomes for users, has been derailed by a large amount of procedure instigated under the belief that some auditor I&#39;ve never met will be impressed.Now with all this new procedure piled on, all of which is very new and thus immature and untried, I feel my energy to innovate, build new things and just generally drive change sapping away.So the cost of your company isn&#39;t just the direct hours and the auditors fees! There&#39;s also a harder to quantify cost, as everything and everyone bends to change every team to work in the way some external entity thinks it should. This loss of autonomy and the loss of spirit is I think potentially far far more expensive than the direct costs.Of course, maybe we&#39;re just going about the whole process poorly. I like to think if you were to do it well maybe it&#39;s not so bad. But, to do that I think you&#39;d need abnormally talented staff involved, who are well versed in the topic, enthusiastic and empathetic. Most people involved in these sorts of processes in my experience aren&#39;t like that, and I can&#39;t say I blame them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First, my company uses a tool called Vanta. Really simplifies the SOC2 process for a small to medium sized business. They have managed to automate large portions of the process. I think I created only 5 or so screenshots for the whole SOC2 audit.Second, the process is making your business more secure. There are so many things that people skip without the reminders of the SOC2 audit. Also, if someone has a SOC2 it tells me they are doing the Standard stuff I expect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, what a fun statistic! Even if it&#39;s pushing the common definition of &#34;sunlight&#34; quite a bit.Also makes me wonder what fraction of the world population is awake at a given time, and what that fraction looks like plotted against 24 hours of the day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not to be &#34;that guy&#34;, but claiming that 4:15am in California (11:15 UTC) is daylight is really stretching it, at least going by this morning. Also sunrise here is ~5:50 AM. Even for a 7am meeting I typically need lights on in my office until partway through. The room has both eastern and southern exposure in the south-east corner (my desk is literally by the windows)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems related to the fact that you can draw a surprisingly-small circle over part of Asia and have more people inside the circle, than out. Human geography is very uneven."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"De-nuclearization of other European countries is a long-held goal of the German environmentalist movement and the Green party. It&#39;s understandable that France doesn&#39;t want to go with that, as they don&#39;t want to be forced down the same ruinous path we&#39;re currently on here in Germany. And honestly, good for them.It&#39;s just sad to see how little actual science is respected in Germany. I did my PhD at the French nuclear energy agency and my French colleagues would always be puzzled when I talked about German energy policies and our anti-nuclear sentiment. But here in Germany the Green party will probably never reverse it&#39;s stance on nuclear energy, as their rise to popularity was strongly fueled by the anti-nuclear movement from the 80s and it&#39;s the one thing they can&#39;t abandon without losing a large number of followers.I partially blame the highly ideological stance on the way people rise to power in politics and administration in Germany. In France, top positions in the administration are usually filled by people that are technically excellent and have gone through the system of grandes écoles (ENS, ENA, X, ...), whereas in Germany most people rise through social engineering and party politics and most top positions in the administration are filled by people with law degrees that don&#39;t have a clue about technology. In my opinion that&#39;s also a reason why we completely fail in everything regarding digitalization, lawyers are simply not good technical problem solvers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You know how I know environmentalists are just dragging their feet on nuclear for ideological reasons?When we talk about a storage facility for nuclear waste, a scenario they insist you prepare for: if human civilization completely collapses to the point that any of the currently spoken languages on earth are no longer able to be read how to we keep the, whatever comes after us, from busting up the concrete and digging down deep into the earth and playing with it. That&#39;s the last gasp of someone out of obstructionist ideas. I&#39;ve had these people tell me that launching the waste into the sun would be dangerous for the sun, they aren&#39;t serious and need to be ignored.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long-term_nuclear_waste_warn..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About time. Nuclear is hardly an environmental risk even compared to the &#34;cleaner&#34; fossil fuels like gas.Hopefully this will allow the EU to return to competitive reactors designs instead of leaving China to pull humanities weight on that front.Though tbh I wouldn&#39;t be sad if we bought Chinese reactors until we are back up to speed, having Chinese nuclear &gt; no nuclear. Everyone bitching about China stealing IP finally have something to steal back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not anything like a shader, really, just standard non-shader masking and blending. (I mean, you can implement them in a shader, but that&#39;s besides the point). Nothing standard fixed pipelines haven&#39;t been doing for ages.Having said that, it is an excellent use of it - well applied, and the explanation is solid!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For once, something I&#39;m actually more than impressed by the overall effect. I love the fact that someone was familiar enough with all of the abilities of CSS plus other effects to be able to pull it off in the confines of CSS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The simple gradients used give it an &#34;artificial&#34; or &#34;color-overexposed&#34; look.Check out perceptually uniform color maps:https://colorcet.com/"</p>
