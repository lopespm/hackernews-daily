								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven&#39;t seen yet, news is it was a power loss:&gt; 5:01 AM PST We can confirm a loss of power within a single data center within a single Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) in the US-EAST-1 Region. This is affecting availability and connectivity to EC2 instances that are part of the affected data center within the affected Availability Zone. We are also experiencing elevated RunInstance API error rates for launches within the affected Availability Zone. Connectivity and power to other data centers within the affected Availability Zone, or other Availability Zones within the US-EAST-1 Region are not affected by this issue, but we would recommend failing away from the affected Availability Zone (USE1-AZ4) if you are able to do so. We continue to work to address the issue and restore power within the affected data center."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve built out many 42U racks in DC&#39;s in my time and there were a couple of rules that we never skipped:1. Dual power in each server/device - One PSU was powered by one outlet, the other PSU by a different one with a different source meaning that we can lose a single power supply/circuit and nothing happens
2. Dual network (at minimum) - For the same reasons as above since the switches didn&#39;t always have dual power in them.I&#39;ve only had a DC fail once when the engineer was performing work on the power circuitry for the DC and thought he was taking down one, but was in fact the wrong one and took both power circuits down at the same time.However, a power cut (in the traditional sense where the supplier has a failure so nothing comes in over the wire) should have literally zero effect!What am I missing?I&#39;ve never worked anywhere with Amazon&#39;s budget so why are they not handling this? Is it more than just the imcoming supply being down?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time a major cloud provider has an outage, Infra people and execs cry foul and say we need to move to &lt;the other one&gt;. But does anyone really have an objective measure of how clouds stack up reliability-wise? I doubt it, since outages and their effects are nuanced. The other move is that they want to go multi-cloud... But I’ve been involved in enough multi-cloud initiatives to know how much time and effort those soak up, not to mention the overhead costs of maintaining two sets of infra sub-optimally. I would say that for most businesses, these costs far exceed that occasional six-hour-long outage."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an immigrant I can tell you that the USA is basically Jurassic Park. The monsters are mostly predatory companies. It can be a lot of fun but it’s very easy to do worse than die - to end up a slave for the rest of your life to one of the predators. Along with bullshit like making options trading available to kids, debt is probably one of the velociraptors.It is a trap sprung at the very start of your adult life when you’re most vulnerable, as a student loan.It’s sprung when you’ve lost your job, are vulnerable and are about to become homeless.It’s sprung when you’re already in debt and vulnerable, by other lenders.Anyone see a pattern here? Debt preys on the vulnerable, turns them into something that delivers returns for decades to the holders, and wraps all that up into tidy looking financial products.The business of debt is the financial equivalent of the US pork industry: Everyone treats it as part of American life, but the details would make most people throw up.Anyone remember microfinance? That was the same play: usury with a fresh coat of paint.I’m seeing posts here making it sound like 36% APR is acceptable. Look up usury folks. This is it. Debt that is intentionally structured so that it can never be repaid and keeps the borrower harnessed to the cart.It’s incredible how folks, particularly in the US, have become this morally uncalibrated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;A central component of LendUp’s marketing and brand identity was the “LendUp Ladder.” LendUp told consumers that by repaying loans on time and taking free courses offered through its website, consumers would move up the “LendUp Ladder” and, in turn, receive lower interest rates on future loans and access to larger loan amounts. As alleged in the complaint, in reality, as tens of thousands of LendUp’s customers climbed the “LendUp Ladder,” they failed to qualify for larger loan amounts and continued to be offered similar or higher interest rates compared to previous loans.While the initial founding direction seems well intentioned, it sounds like they were scamming customers, or unable to actually follow-through on the promise to consumers.  Glad the regulators are actually enforcing some of the rules."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They don&#39;t spell it out in the press release, but the 2016 settlement included a $3.63 Million fine. https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/lendup-enf...According to Crunchbase, LendUp has $361M in funding. Maybe they thought that a few million here and there is a drop in the bucket, and they stand to lose more if reforming themselves impacts growth. Turns out you have more to worry about than escalating fines."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"GUI algorithms like these are not well documented anywhere (except, of course, all over the web and in source code! :-) ...Would be nice to have a site, maybe a wiki, dedicated to this kind of thing.Other interesting problems in this area:* Layout algorithms* Automatic assignment of keys for navigation (for nav w/o

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In cases when the boxes overlap, there are ways to choose an arrow which will not cross the boxes. But this is prevented by the constraint that the starting and ending points must be on the midpoint of a box edge. If the midpoint of the a given edge is occluded by a box, or occludes a box, then that edge is not considered, even though it is partially visible and has a viable point for the arrow.E.g. if we could start an arrow in the middle of the small protruding &#34;ledge&#34; of the bottom box, we could do this:    ,-------.
   :         :
   :         v
   : +----------------+
   : |                |
  +----------------+  |
  |                |--+
  |                |
  +----------------+

It&#39;s not written in stone that box-and-arrow diagrams must be connected by edge midpoints. That can&#39;t even work well any time you have multiple arrows emanating or terminating on the same edge.Very good first iteration round, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed reading this because it reminded me of a moment of hubris as junior developer. I was working with a complicated data structure I wanted to visualize, so I decided to write some quick code to basically read the data structure and output a graph as rectangles and lines connecting them.I was chastened by the complexity of just drawing the lines between boxes so that they didn&#39;t overlap (as much as possible) and were drawn on facing sides (one of the later problems discussed in the article). I don&#39;t recall how I did it, but I do remember a sudden refresher on matrix multiplication.It drove home how simple things can be more complicated than you might expect.EDIT: also, I appreciated the way the article was written. No cruft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; So I reach out to the manager and ask what is going on. This is a simple task, I said. Why does it take an entire quarter for your team to deliver? He doesn&#39;t have an answer.Your simple task, which you think would only take a few days to implement, is probably one request in a long queue of requests that team is dealing with. That means they won&#39;t be able to start on it for a long time.That team probably set up the onerous Google Docs process to gate requests because they get so many!When they do start working on your request, maybe it will only take a few days -- or maybe you underestimate the level of effort required because you are new to the company and you don&#39;t understand the complexity of the systems you are dealing with.Take this as a learning experience: don&#39;t assume that you are at a startup where people will drop everything to handle a request from you right away. Instead, assume that people are dealing with a lot of other requests, from a lot of other people. Learn how the system works, and learn how to be effective within that system.I know for sure that it&#39;s possible to be highly productive at a large company with a lot of bureaucracy -- but I also know for sure that new employees who try to bypass process and question the priorities of other teams, before they learn the ropes and build credibility and trust with other people, do not succeed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Is this how it&#39;s like at all large companies?Not all, but a lot.&gt;What should I do?Short term: Mentally check out.  Embrace the Zen of just doing what&#39;s asked of you. It&#39;s not your job to be a go-getter anymore.  Half because of institutional complexity/inertia, and half because in a tall organization hierarchy the middle managers don&#39;t want anyone below them swimming outside their lane (even if it would be to their unit&#39;s benefit and they can take every ounce of credit).You&#39;ll notice that many people in this thread explaining why you shouldn&#39;t expect this or that from other teams.  And they&#39;re not wrong, but none of them are acknowledging or explaining why those reasons weren&#39;t automatically communicated in your conversation with those teams.  You&#39;re not only not seen as a problem solver anymore, you&#39;re also too low on the totem pole to be owed an explanation.So follow the official processes to adapt their system to your product, and your product to their system.  Keep your management in the loop about the time cost of both options, it&#39;s their problem to fix, not yours. Pour your mental energy into something outside work.Long term: Decide if you like being checked out or want a new job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people have talked about the issues with this post, but I wanted to call out one specific thing:    The first engineer I talk to doesn&#39;t even attempt to answer my question but redirects me to their manager. Ok, that&#39;s odd, I think, but whatever.

This is definitely not odd. The whole point of managers is that they&#39;re there to protect their engineers from getting off track with every random request that comes up. I understand that it may feel bureaucratic, but as an engineer, someone who insists on talking to me directly without going through my manager is always going to mark themselves as someone who doesn&#39;t respect my time and doesn&#39;t understand that they&#39;re not the center of my universe.This feels like a rant of someone who isn&#39;t willing to put themselves in the shoes of the other team and understand the real complexity of deploying and maintaining large infrastructure systems over long periods of time. Any &#34;small option&#34; that the deploy team adds today is most likely going to be an option that they&#39;re still maintaining 5, 10 years down the line. As the saying goes—&#34;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure&#34;. In the best case, taking a few days to get the requirements right up front is (hopefully!) going to save months and months of cumulative man-hours down the road for maintaining the system later, or making future changes. In your case, if I understand right, your work got approved within *two days*—hardly an onerous wait time.I&#39;ll admit that the &#34;for compliance reasons, you can&#39;t see our codebase&#34; thing is kind of odd, and it would strike me as a bit of a red flag, but I&#39;ll also admit that, personally, if I was in that manager&#39;s shoes, I wouldn&#39;t want you anywhere near my codebase either. Just purely based on the way that you treat other engineers&#39; time as worthless &amp; fail to consider the possibility that the business has broader priorities that extend outside of your own personal tasks."</p>

They knowingly prompt up tons of fake profiles, to get you engaged. Horrifically this has lead to romance scams being the number one source of fraud in the US.

I&#39;m also in a much better place emotionally, if you&#39;re staring at your phone constantly waiting for box to message you, that&#39;s not good for your mind. Your mind. It makes everything 10 times of stressful, for fraction of the benefit.When I actually meet someone, It was always someone who is in their mid-20s to 30s without a job.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO, if your market share is bigger than ${some number}, you shouldn&#39;t be able to deny service without a documented reason, it should have some sort of time-to-live (i.e 1 year), and there should be an appeals process.  In a functioning marketplace, companies would be naturally incentivized to care about customers but that stops working in uncompetitive industries (which currently describes most of the economy)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Co-Founder and CEO here. We started Codecademy and launched on HN 10 years ago. I&#39;m so thankful to this community for helping us to get started and to see up the momentum! We&#39;re committed to making sure that the product stays as great as the one you&#39;ve used for years (and gets even better!)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First time I ever programmed was using Codecademy around 2013.I was always an average student in school. Never had the motivation/curiosity to study since I felt it was all pointless.  Never had any programming/computer classes in school.I completed the python course that was available at the time that eventually guides you to build your own version of battleship with 2 players. It was an eye-opening experience for me.I started to view all my math/chemistry/physics problems as “programming problems”, it really made learning fun for me. My grades changed drastically for the better with little extra effort. And more importantly Im now working as a SWE years later.So thank you Codecademy :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned the very basics to become a developer from Codeacademy. Back in 2015 I was a front line support technician at a small hardware startup who did Codeacademy in my free time, which was considerable. My first daughter had just been born and that really gave me motivation to learn and achieve my full potential. My boss was the only software engineer at our company and so was often overloaded with work, so he gave me small tasks to do, starting with learning regular expressions to massage a few thousand lines of data into something useful, and then getting to make PHP edits to Wordpress, and even some Visual C++.I more than doubled my income from that job to my next job, propelling me to the middle class, and have since achieved consistently high pay raises over the last seven years without much difficulty.As someone who dropped out of high school due to family issues and lack of motivation, I hope free resources like Codeacademy always exists on the internet and will be a pathway for those who have the aptitude to learn to code. For my personally it totally transformed my life as I was basically destitute before I got my first job as a web developer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Surprisingly I found myself not preferring the OS 9 versions nearly as much as I thought. I have always thought of the OS 9 UI and the late &#39;90s to early 2000s as representing the peak of OS UI design before everything went skeuomorphic, but a lot of the general aesthetic of that time just doesn&#39;t seem to have aged that well.  I still miss the crisp lines and clear affordances of actual buttons and other elements of that time, but there was also a LOT of visual clutter that we no longer need. There&#39;s much to say about modern design fads, but we have also come a long way.The author has certainly done a great job of capturing the zeitgeist of the era (the garish bevels on the Spotify app are spot on!), but I would love to see how the OS 9 UI would hold up in modern times, on a retina screen with more than 256 colours, modern anti-aliased typography and much more screen real estate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"incredible work (really) but this is obviously not a realistic user experience: I can tell what&#39;s clickable on the screen easily and things are generally too consistent and simply make too much senseI mean, neat concept, but really lacking in the user hostility that today&#39;s users demand"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2020 a rash of anti-zoom propaganda that I&#39;m almost certain was driven by Microsoft led to a company-wide prohibition on using anything other than Teams &#34;for security reasons&#34; where i worked.This was, I am almost certain, inspired by Microsoft corporate sales getting their hooks into management.This was largely because of news stories like &#34;end to end encryption doesnt really work as advertised&#34; and &#34;if you leave a room password unprotected bad people will enter&#34;. The level of press coverage was off the scale compared to what Teams got for far worse issues.The vulnerabilities werent nothing but they werent even in the same ballpark as the MS teams vulnerabilities foisted on us for &#34;security reasons&#34; like this howler they tried to cover up https://www.techradar.com/news/microsoft-may-have-downplayed..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work with several large organisations, all using Teams.In every instance, the previous solution (Slack/Zoom/Discord) was replaced by Teams following higher management making the switch for reasons like &#34;it&#39;s included in Office 365&#34; or a new hire influencing the migration to Microsoft solutions.In every instance, the application was/is not well received by the employees - it&#39;s slow, buggy, crazy complicated and generally doesn&#39;t feel &#34;right&#34;.Microsoft is good at channeling security topics for their PR, but at the end of the day they make software, just like everybody else (and this software is subject to bugs, just like everybody else).It&#39;s really disappointing that the vulnerabilities have not yet been addressed..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One in this temperament: try accidently pasting a very large amount of data in the chatbox in Teams. Then spend the next 40 minutes re-starting Teams to try to remove the data from said box while your laptop tries to fly away and Teams keeps many processors and gigs of memory lit trying to parse your data.Microsoft should (but won&#39;t) reconsider the idea that one chatbox to rule many underlying types of software is a good idea."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s definitely a great time to build websites, but saying they _NEVER_ have been easier to make... I&#39;m not 100% sure about that.Yes, tailwind might make css a lot easier, and github copilot might make coding a lot faster... but is this really easier than in the early 90ies, when you could just type &lt;html&gt; into notepad and make a website that didn&#39;t require any CSS or images or JS or even more than just the most basic html tags?When it comes to reading a blog or article or consuming any other form of textual information on the internet - I find myself increasingly enamored with &#34;Reader View&#34; in Firefox, which basically ditches all the crap, and displays the web-page in a default-style, as if it was just the most basic html - just like that we did write in 90ies.Of course this doesn&#39;t hold true for any webApps that do more than just present textual information (and the occasional image) - but why do project like ViewPure exist? There seems to be at least some demand for getting rid of all the clutter.Is tailwind really easier to work with something like - let&#39;s say - pico.css? Of course if you want to do super-elaborate layouts, then probably yes - but if you embraced a more minimalist approach?Isn&#39;t Hacker News itself a really great example of a website that successfully uses only very basic html with very, very little styling and fancy extra features?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m also developing for 25 years, I also really really like websites and coding, but not for the reasons the OP sums up. For me, it&#39;s not about all kinds of solved or unsolved technical questions.Today is a very good time to build websites, because a good website is the only way to push back to Big Tech and it&#39;s practices. Your website can be build on techniques invented in a time where the dream of the internet was not yet shattered by Big Tech.Of course you can choose to put your website on AWS and svck on the bolls of Jeff a little. But you don&#39;t have to! And that&#39;s what all kinds of young devs just miss.Oh, and RSS is not dead. Not at all (thanks WordPress, for putting a feed on every instance). RSS is the only workable way to make the web social again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Static was a fun diversion, but we&#39;re back to what works.I won&#39;t be moving away from static website. It is perfect solution for a blog/CV type thing.&gt;you might think that minutes-long build processes are normalIf compiling your static site takes minutes there is something fundamentally wrong with your site in my opinion."</p>
