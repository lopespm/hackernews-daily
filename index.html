								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I met John in an Atlanta airport lounge years ago[1]. I recognized him immediately as I&#39;ve always admired him, and I decided to go up to him and tell him as much. He invited me to sit down, and told him about when I was a teenager in the 90s learning about tech entrepreneurs at the time, I always thought he was pretty cool and had good ideas. I told him I respected him, and that I was sure he&#39;d lived an incredible life and thanked him for his contributions. He was clearly totally sloshed(inebriated) and insisted he called his wife so I could recount the story to her. I did. An hr later I had to leave to catch my flight, and i asked him where he was going - he said I&#39;d find out some &#34;pretty crazy shit&#34; about him next week, and that &#34;the doc was a bunch of BS&#34;. Two days later, I read Show Time had announced &#34;Gringo: The Dangerous Life of John McAfee&#34;.  In the brief time I spent with him, I have to say he had pretty positive energy for someone who was portrayed the way he was.[1] https://i.imgur.com/qThvR2S.jpg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Was just reading about McAfee freebasing bath salts from old posts on an old Joe Rogan forum and not paying taxes seems like the absolute least he was up to:&gt;I&#39;ve processed 23 kilos of this stuff in the past year or so, and bump it myself every day - in fair quantities the hypersexuality... is beyond belief. I have had a number of acquaintances (both male and female) who have rubbed their genitals way past the point of bleeding and still couldn&#39;t stop.&gt;In all honesty, a first time user, or a user on a large dose, when presented with food, will simply figure out a way to include it in the ongoing sex play with their partner. If alone, they will figure out a way to fuck it, or shove it up their rectum. This is not a joke. Everything on the Tan becomes a sex partner or a sex aid. If only visually. I will not, anymore, let anyone on Tan be alone with my dogs for example.&gt;A local brothel owner (prostitution is legal in my country) talked me out of a large amount of Tan and provides it to his working girls and their customers. The idea was to simply increase business by having hornier customers and more authentic product. It worked for a while, and then girls started taking larger doses and giving customers larger doses. They began leaving and running off with customers - some after a single contact with the customer.&gt;If a person takes a large dose of the Tan and has the misfortune to have no partner at the time, then truly terrible things happen. A number of men, and women, have molested strangers after massive doses of the pure product (which is why I no longer provide it to anyone other than trusted friends - everything else is cut 50 to one). Twice, users on large doses have tried to molest my dogs.&gt;I have distributed over 3,000 doses exclusively in this country. They call it SPT (I named it) and it is a seriously hot underground topic here. I know of at least a dozen people who spend virtually full time playing with this, and hundreds trying to get samples, which I dole out with meticulous care. Anyone caught sharing this with another without my consent doesn&#39;t get any more.https://www.resetera.com/threads/john-mcafee-this-might-be-t..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good or bad, what a sad ending to a colorful life.The guy was troubled and had many shortcomings, but he was colorful and also achieved success and arguably was one of the seminal figures in the nascent AV industry.Sad to see his fall from grace and into a world of extravagance, deceit and cheating (taxes) and, if allegations true, even worse; then to end it on the floor of a jail -all by his own hands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone please tell me how important this topic based on the amount of news time and eyeballs it attracts relative to the number of people that it affects?The numbers I can find for US citizens is: 0.6% or 1,988,696 out 331,449,281 of people total for the entirety of the US in 2021.&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_demographics_of_the_Unite...In the UK where the featured article took place the latest poll I could find comes counts the number of people who selected &#34;other&#34; when choosing a sex at 0.4% or 224,632 people out of 64,596,800.&gt;https://practicalandrogyny.com/2014/12/16/how-many-people-in...Personally I don&#39;t think this is very important compared to other topics.  There are more blind people than trans people.  There are more people with Alzheimer&#39;s than trans people.  There are more people in the US who have lost a limb than trans people.I don&#39;t mean to downplay what is happening because it is happening but do you not think the amount of outrage this topic generates surpasses the level of impact we can have assuming we fix it?  It just feels like we&#39;re being distracted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One shouldn&#39;t expect courage from The Economist, but it&#39;s always wise to bet on their prudence.I don&#39;t read The Economist for facts or details so much as to get a sense of what topics a current establishment can no longer afford to ignore. The details are secondary to the neccessity that a writer, a sub-editor, and a senior editor with tremendous personal stake in maintaining access to the circles that define establishment media, have collectively recognized that to remain relevant as a publication, the risk/reward on any ensuing controversy still means the magazine has to acknowledge which way the wind is blowing.When The Economist says something is just starting, it means it&#39;s been brewing for at least several years and they need to comment on it. I don&#39;t think direct discourse on the topic improves the discussion on gender because the participants use a critical theory in which the promise of  discourse is just bait to corner political targets for their mobs. However, we (and even The Economist) can recognize that popular tolerance for these tactics has finally reached an inflection point, and this change in attitude is what will finally allow real analysis and insight by thoughtful people into topics about gender."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is there an easy answer as to why Costa Rica is doing so well? They seem to be a bit of an exception in Central/South America.EDIT: From Wikipedia &#34;It is known for its long-standing and stable democracy, and for its highly educated workforce, most of whom speak English. The country spends roughly 6.9% of its budget (2016) on education, compared to a global average of 4.4%. Its economy, once heavily dependent on agriculture, has diversified to include sectors such as finance, corporate services for foreign companies, pharmaceuticals, and ecotourism. Many foreign manufacturing and services companies operate in Costa Rica&#39;s Free Trade Zones (FTZ) where they benefit from investment and tax incentives.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We really need two words for renewables: one for types that scale but don&#39;t provide power on demand (wind, solar), and the other for types that provide power on demand but aren&#39;t available at scale everywhere (hydro, geothermal).Costa Rica is blessed with plenty of the second type and uses it. Because we lump it all into &#34;renewables,&#34; it sounds like it should be easy for everyone to follow their example, and that&#39;s not the case. No country has run on a high percentage of wind/solar/battery for a long period of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The update is telling:&gt; Update 3/17/2021: Our original article stated &#34;Costa Rica Has Run on 100% Renewable Energy for 299 Days.&#34; It was pointed out to us that while Costa Rica&#39;s electric grid does run primarily on renewable energy, a better title would have been &#34;Costa Rica Has Run on 100% Renewable Electricity&#34;. Below the article says that the government had not burned any oil to power the country, but this would technically imply that the government does not own gasoline powered vehicles, which couldn&#39;t be true.Accounting for the origins of energy is tricky business. Want to squeeze out internal combustion engines? Go electric. Where do the batteries come from, and how much non-renewable energy does it cost to produce them? For that matter, how many goods are important with non-neglibile carbon footprints? Because carbon emissions can be exported.&gt; In other words, a country can be considered carbon neutral while still using fossil fuels by planting trees that offset the carbon, or funding conservation programs which aim to reduce the amount of carbon in the air.How long do those trees you&#39;re planting keep CO2 out of the atmosphere? When they die, a good chunk of that carbon may be released."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case the GitHub Issues team is still looking here, I have a request! Can you put the name of the commenter somewhere besides just the name field in the email from? Currently it&#39;s something like, Poster Name &lt;notifications.github.com&gt;, but that means you can&#39;t tell who the poster was from the email content itself.I use Apple Mail and have a contact for GitHub since that provides benefits like an avatar, easier search, etc, but now the contact clobbers the name field and I just see every email from &#34;GitHub&#34; with zero indication who wrote the comment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"if someone from github is looking at this, can u please include Gitlab&#39;s &#34;Scoped Labels&#34; in this - https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/labels.html#scoped-l...it seems that the new issues are going to operate on the basis of labels (as it should). Scoped/Nested labels are a godsend. For example, I can tag an issue with a label &#34;UI::App::Android&#34; and i should be able to filter on the basis of &#34;UI::App&#34; and get all issues.One of the things i still notice about the boards is that it is created on the basis of status. Gitlab&#39;s boards are created on milestones/status...or LABELS. https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/issue_board.html#org...Most importantly, dragging tickets across boards will change the labels. This is far more powerful than just hardcoding them on statuses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It floors me that they haven&#39;t addressed the underlying architecture issues that made Issues unusable: Issues are only for a single repo. Business users don&#39;t (and shouldn&#39;t) know what repo to add an Issue to. This is why we moved away from Issues and none of these new visualizations make the product usable until they deliver multi-repo issues."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The title here is a bit misleading: the first few paragraphs of this are a really enlightened description of the challenges of engineering for a startup regardless of what framework you are using.Even if you have no interest in Django at all I recommend reading the start of this.&gt; I wrote this guide to explain how to write software in a way that maximizes the number of chances your startup has to succeed — by making it easy to maintain development velocity regardless of the inevitable-but-unknowable future changes to team size, developer competence and experience, product functionality, etc. The idea is that, given the inherent uncertainty, startups can massively increase their odds of success by putting some basic systems in place to help maximize the number of ideas, features, and hypotheses they can test; in other words, maximizing &#34;lead bullets,&#34; to borrow the phrase from this blog post by Ben Horowitz."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a big Django fan and a former (unsuccessful) startup founder. I only took a quick look at this but wanted to leave a comment for anyone else sifting through new. My initial impression:1. There&#39;s a bunch of things a I disagree with in here.2. This is very well written.3. It&#39;s well organized.4. It&#39;s both concrete and high-level.5. There&#39;s a ton of info here.I&#39;m so burnt out on shallow content, it&#39;s really refreshing to see something well argued, whether I agree with every conclusion or not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is very nice, some great advice, and like others said it&#39;s not just relevant to Django.One part I don&#39;t agree with is about frontend. Frameworks have stabilised quite a bit, pick React or Angular and you can expect support for years to come. I still maintain a 5+ year old React frontend with lots of logic, updating hasn&#39;t been an issue at all (codemods), since we moved it to CRA it has been even easier.Things like formatting dates: you can wrap it in your own function then it takes a few minutes to swap the library, but you likely won&#39;t have to change it if you follow the tips in this article about dependencies, which are very good!Anyway, great article, very good advice. I think it does a good job of explaining that you should think about why you do things and focus on what matters and makes a difference."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; For fear of losing a job, or of losing an admission to school, or of losing the right to live in the country of your birth, or merely of social ostracism, many of today&#39;s best minds in so-called free, democratic states have stopped trying to say what they think and feel and have fallen silent.There are a lot of topics I won’t touch any more, more every year. Accounts - can’t stay anonymous, ml systems working around the clock to identify posters. My social justice focused friends have it worse, their online “friends” attack them publicly over every single little thing. They go quiet or form a tiny invite only groups to hide after an attempt to do something good that backfired because their skin is the wrong colour or they aren’t trans. They have panic attacks over the guilt and stress"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I very often type out comments on HN and then delete them. As Snowden alludes to, everything we submit to public forums is logged and stored. There is no doubt in my mind these comments are easily associated to my real identity with very little effort.Another side of censorship I consider often is signal to noise. There is no reason to prevent people from saying whatever they want if no one will ever see it. I recall a stat I heard that YouTube receives ~400 hours of content uploaded every minute to their site. Or the long-tail of Twitch streamers with 0 viewers.Finally, there is a threat of violence. We all know what happens to high-profile journalists because of their high profile. I often wonder how many nobodies disappear for some string of comments on some no-traffic forums/blogs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is possibly a unique angle, but by being in taboo art circles (erotic art specifically), I&#39;m struck at how much I see this topic resonating with my fellow artists.I know so many, too many, far more than I can count on my hands who have simply given up posting kink art because they keep getting mobbed, doxxed, slandered, and harassed simply by posting art (or seeing their friends getting shredded as well). I know so many that have forced to bounce from platform to platform from instagram to tumblr to twitter because either the algorithm censors you or the mob abuses the &#34;report user&#34; button if they simply don&#39;t care for your art.I know so many who have had to host on friend&#39;s servers because big-name hosts ban erotic art and kinks in tiny print in the TOS and it&#39;s just not worth it to fucking bounce from host to host unless if it&#39;s an actual friend who supports true artistic freedom.I know so many who are winding up in making zines as a last resort, because zines can be printed at the home computer, so they&#39;re one of the last truly uncensored artistic mediums in comparison to the internet. And yet - how many trailblazing artists have we lost from that crushing top-down censorship even with that one meager avenue open?So yes, this is relevant and urgent, and in more ways than it appears."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun fact: similar things, but much more general, were in the HTTP/1.1 standard from 1997. However, HTTP frames relied on HTTP chunks, which were fundamentally broken in the Win-HTTP-stack implementation. (Third party browsers like Netscape Navigator or Opera implemented a HTTP-stack of their own, but IE relied on the built-in implementation.)(Because of this flaw, keep-alive was broken, as well, and requests stalled until they timed out. Which is, why everyone set the request timeout to just a short period and you couldn&#39;t type a HTTP request manually in a terminal anymore.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; With the Amazon Project, the Teamsters are taking a different approach that doesn&#39;t rely on the traditional National Labor Relations Board election process that allows employers to run sophisticated anti-union campaigns and involves the task of running elections warehouse by warehouse.&gt; Instead the Teamsters plan to focus on a series of pressure campaigns involving work stoppages, petitions, and other collective action to push Amazon to recognize a union and bargain over working conditions.This is good. Even in the &#34;good old days&#34;, labor in the U.S. won a rather Pyrrhic victory in that organizing became shoehorned in a narrow legal framework with narrow goals. It makes the decline of union power same rather inevitable.This &#34;going back to the roots&#34;, along with the tightening of the labor market we&#39;ve seen lately, has the promise to attack that problem head-on rather than wishing it away."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s what Notion.so says about this on their website.https://www.notion.so/Back-up-your-data-1a8eb5bdfce34d19a636...- *I tried clicking the `Export all workspace content` button but received an error message.*    Oof, so sorry about this  For particularly large workspaces, the `Export all workspace content` function may have some trouble completing the export. We&#39;re investigating this issue and hope to have a resolution soon.

    As a temporary workaround for this issue, you can export in smaller batches:

    1. Navigate to a top-level page in your workspace
    2. Click the `•••` button at the top right of the page, then click `Export` (you may not see this option if you&#39;re not an admin in the workspace)
    3. Choose `Markdown &amp; CSV` or `HTML` as the export format, and turn on the `Include subpages` toggle
    4. Repeat for any other important top-level pages in the workspace that you&#39;d like to have a backup of

    Please note that we keep per-minute backups on our servers, and can help with data recovery at any time at team@makenotion.com. Thanks for your patience while we work on fixing this issue!"</p>
