								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m the content lead for web.dev. Just wanted to give a quick shout out to the people who made this happen because it&#39;s not clear on the site. I think this is also useful information because you&#39;ll see that a lot of CSS experts we&#39;re involved in this project.Adam Argyle [1] and Una Kravets [2] created the podcast series. Una mainly drove the overall project to convert the podcasts into this written series. Adam provided technical reviews on the written content and I also believe he created most or all of the self-assessments (i.e. the &#39;check your understanding&#39; quizzes). Andy Bell [3] wrote all of the content (and demos, I think). Rachel Andrew [4] edited all the content. Rob Dodson drove the engineering work behind creating this new &#34;courses&#34; infrastructure on web.dev. I was hands-off on this project so I may not have gotten everyone&#39;s roles exactly correct, but I do know these were the main people involved.[1] https://twitter.com/argyleink[2] https://twitter.com/Una[3] https://twitter.com/piccalilli_[4] https://twitter.com/rachelandrew[5] https://twitter.com/rob_dodson"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks great! Small pet peeve regarding tutorials: When learning a new technology I don&#39;t care about the headaches people had 20 years ago. My first concern is how I use the technology and what it can do for me.The section about layout starts with: &#34;In the early days of the web, designs more complex than a simple document were laid out with &lt;table&gt; elements. Separating HTML from visual styles was made easier when CSS was widely adopted by browsers in the late &#39;90s.&#34; etc. etc.This history lesson is not really relevant for newbies. It is basically a &#34;you kids have it easy, when I was your age...&#34;, something which every generating find really tedious to listen to, since it is irrelevant for their current situation.Knowing history is fine when it is relevant (e.g encountering legacy code), but it shouldn&#39;t be the first thing in a tutorial. Put it at the end or in a footnote or appendix.I think it happens because writers tend to explain stuff in the same order they learned it themselves. But this is not always the most natural order to learn things for newcomers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In terms of Flexbox, this guide in the React Native documentation is BY FAR the best guide I&#39;ve seen anywhere.It tells you just the right amount of things you need to know to be productive. https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexboxIt&#39;s not React Native specific. It works for web-based CSS as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hot take: this, as some like Ars Technica have observed, stands a decent chance of being a real game changer.Everything about this vehicle launch appears masterful, from its technology to its branding to the obvious care taken to ensure that in almost every respect it is so superior, and offers so many no-brainers, as to make anyone who can (both individuals and especially, fleet managers), buy these as fast they can.This thing has more than one killer app.The biggest by far IMO is its ability to power high voltage high draw tools at the jobsite.If you have never worked on a jobsite, this is a BFD.This is itself a game changer, it offers the ability to &#34;disrupt&#34; in a material way a whole class of project. Logistics just got 20% simpler and projects 30% cheaper.Sure, it can go super fast; yes, you can lock your stuff in the truck...But the other killer feature for fleet owners is that these are remotely manageable.Your fleet now has detailed telemetry and its only going to get better.And this is on launch.We just got a RAV4 Prime and if I didn&#39;t live in SF proper, I might be seriously regretting not waiting for this thing. (I don&#39;t, and don&#39;t think this makes sense in the city.)If we move to e.g. Sonoma and work remote? This would be that no brainer.Hallelujah. Now, to invest in Ford..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ironically, the frunk on electric trucks is a game-changer. Complementing the bed with an enclosed, waterproof, secure place to carry things (and no mucking around with insecure bed covers) is a killer feature. No more springing for a crew cab just to carry groceries in the rear seats. In terms of practical carrying capacity this dominates an SUV."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am positively agog. This is amazing.I would suggest to pgboswell that it may be interesting to reach out to a few local professors who teach introductory circuits at some nearby universit(y/ies) and do an in-person demo of the components. You may find you have a significant educational market you could tap into. I could well believe there&#39;s a lot of people who just never quite make it over the abstraction gap to understand circuits who would be able to follow them if they could physically interact with a mechanical circuit running at human orders of magnitude."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am glad to see that they are using LEGO Technic chains (https://www.bricklink.com/v2/catalog/catalogitem.page?P=3711) , and therefore the gear pitches are LEGO compatible (at least with the non-bevel gears, but the traditional spur gears). I am excited about the potential of interacting with existing Technic parts!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A competitive market would enable me to sort by salary and benefits and apply for the best job.However companies don&#39;t want to compete on salary, and potentialy drive them up - they want maximum leverage. They get more leverage if process is obscure, so that you only agree salary late in the process and for the applicant, pulling out is risky.The market is not really free - its being manipulated by one side.Similarly with healthcare you don&#39;t know how much you will be charged upfront, so there is no competition on price.With housing (in UK) there is no competition on quality because the seller doesn&#39;t have to disclose any problems with the house. If it falls of a cliff the minute you sign on the dotted line, it&#39;s your problem.You have to pay for the surveyor to find out any issues the house might have, and that means you can only view a few houses before you&#39;ve paid the house price in survey fees."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think one reason why this is difficult for companies that are hiring software engineers, is that they can hire at multiple levels of experience. They just need good developers! A company that needs, say, a Golang developer, or Scala, or React, might be willing to hire a junior, mid-level or senior developer- they&#39;ll take whatever experience level they can get. Remember, saying that you don&#39;t want to hire someone too experienced is pushing the envelope on age discrimination laws....So if they&#39;re willing to hire someone with 2-20 years of experience, the salary range may be so broad as to be meaningless. $80-180k doesn&#39;t really tell anyone anything, and I&#39;d imagine regulators can&#39;t do much if that&#39;s what companies put down as their range. I find that a lot of people imagine an open job &amp; job description to be Very Rigid Categories, whereas in practice companies hiring in high-demand fields have to be flexible to find people. From the employer&#39;s point of view, that&#39;s why we find demands for the salary range to be frustrating- lots of companies really don&#39;t have a specific range in mind!If you mandate that companies use a tight salary band, they&#39;ll simply say OK, our Software Developer 1 pays $70-90k, Software Developer 2 pays $90-11k, etc. However- we haven&#39;t decided which level of software developer we&#39;re going to hire you for. Tough for regulators to beat that approach too"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Coloradan another thing that&#39;s happening is companies are listing their jobs as Remote, only advertising in CO, and just mentioning it&#39;s a CO only job verbally. They do the thing where they sit in the gray area due to pandemic &#34;Oh, it&#39;s remote, FOR NOW, but it&#39;s a CO job&#34; Or listing the job as Denver and a few other cities, but it&#39;s really just Denver/Boulder (Twitter currently doing this).Another pattern is listing the range as 40-250k so the disclosure is effectively nothing. Consulting companies Accenture, PwC, Deloitte are doing that one.A few companies are completely rejecting this whole law too. I&#39;ve spoken with a few that still won&#39;t disclose (usually &#34;We aren&#39;t CO based and it doesn&#39;t apply&#34;) or they just straight up aren&#39;t doing it with no comment. Experienced many recruiters completely flustered by it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Although I ~never used Apple products, a good ten-fifteen years ago I ran through a quite expensive &#34;Apple Human Interface Design&#34;[1] book. After that, whenever another &#34;book&#34; / blog series / etc came out about &#34;UI&#34;, I was discarding them saying &#34;and now what, that&#39;s just common sense&#34;.It. Is. Not.The more companies and people I had been working with, the more I started to see that most of the UI design (or for that matter, displaying information on a UI / document / advertisement) what I thought had become &#34;common sense&#34;, hadn&#39;t. Most of my colleagues cannot properly position / color a button. Cannot structure a document (headers, tables, bulletpoints) to be easily comprehensible, consumable. Struggle to summarize information in an email.This 50 UI tips is great! Thanks for this. I will share as a baseline with my team.[1]: I can&#39;t find which one. Maybe its title was something different."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I liked the points you raised, I think they serve as a good checklist for the finer details of designing UI.One critique I had when I was reading through is the use of he/him when referring to a hypothetical user. This is likely region-dependent, but it sounds awkward to me to assign gender to an unknown user.Some authors prefer they/them and some (more rarely) prefer an equal number of masculine and feminine pronouns.Great work, nonetheless."</p>

As far as I know Firefox was one of the major contributors to pushing WebASM to the web and has a superior WASM engine in many aspects.I&#39;d be more interested in a post about what WebASM features are missing than an announcement that someone hacked Javascript into a browser."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the most frustrating things about this legislation is that it&#39;s set up so that the only outfits with the resources to do the requested censorship would be a GAFAM.  Which is utterly perverse, as on one hand the UK govt is despairing about the extent to which the UK is dependent on Big Tech social media and the control they exert on society... whilst simultaneously pushing through legislation which effectively ensures that GAFAM are the only people who can operate!The Matrix approach to addressing abuse is https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix... (and we&#39;re in the middle of building out the first implementation of the decentralised reputation proposal right now) - but it is not pleasant to think that if a judge considered that approach inadequate, the directors of UK entities providing Matrix hosting (e.g. Element, running matrix.org on behalf of The Matrix.org Foundation) would be eligible for jail time \o/Needless to say, we&#39;re doing our best to explain to the UK Govt that their Bill is throwing out the baby along with bathwater..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Whilst we sympathise with the government’s desire to show action in this space and to do something about children’s safety (everyone’s safety really), we cannot possibly agree with the methods.Respectfully, stop sympathising with authoritarians who want to take away your freedom. They are not good people. Good people aren&#39;t nosey. Good people don&#39;t deprive others of liberty. Neither do they class a whole group (Internet users and entrepreneurs) as responsible for the actions of a minority. Guilt by association and collective punishment are antithetical to any lover of freedom and life.Their reasons of &#39;child safety&#39; and &#39;online harms&#39; (whatever on earth that means) are simply pretexts. They don&#39;t give a shit about children&#39;s safety. This bill will do nothing, nothing to improve the safety of children. The perpetrators will simply go after children in other ways. They won&#39;t change.If you, Mr. MP, care about children then ask why are they drawn to bad online content? What&#39;s going wrong with families and upbringing? Start with questions that might actually address the problem rather than implicate everyone who uses the Internet!The trajectory is to increase their power and control over your life. Again, they are NOT good people. They know EXACTLY what they are doing. They love dominating you. It&#39;s understandable why some imagine the government as simply well-meaning but misguided, for it makes our helpless subjection easier to accept. But we won&#39;t stop getting the boot from the state until we start calling their actions out as morally reprehensible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sad to see UK becoming one of the apologists of internet censorship, closing the gap to the levels of authoritarian countries.Once you have censorship facility in place, the area of its application will only grow. The term &#34;illegal information&#34; is also widely used in Russia for the same purpose."</p>
