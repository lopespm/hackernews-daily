								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an interesting part to me: &#34;[T]he new order[0] adds more provisions to protect consumers in the future: ... Twitter must provide multi-factor authentication options that don’t require people to provide a phone number.&#34;I would like to see this be a more broad-based rule.  No, I am not moved by &#34;SMS is easy&#34; or &#34;getting a number that can receive SMS is harder for scammers to do in bulk.&#34;  If you must, give users the choice but not the obligation to hand over a mobile number.0 - https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/cases-proceedings/2..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t have the most optimistic outlook for this having any impact, but I really hope this sets a precedent for limiting the use of dark patterns with which companies try to tie your identity to a phone number. I think the total sum for this fine is rather myopic: it ignores the long tail of possible future data leaks and the impact it might have on the people behind the affected accounts.I created my current Twitter account a few years ago and it remained dormant for a while. It was flagged as &#34;in violation of our policies&#34; despite having not made any tweets or using a handle or nickname that would cause offense to anyone. In order to resolve this, I had to enter my phone number to &#34;secure&#34; my account. I don&#39;t know what process triggered this review, but I&#39;ll be damned if it didn&#39;t smell like an easy way to associate an existing marketing profile with my Twitter account. Of course, it&#39;s vitally important to profile a service I used to keep up with industry news and post about Goban puzzles.I&#39;ve also run into similar patterns on Discord and similar platforms; &#34;Oops! Something suspicious is happening with the account [you literally just created]. Please add a phone number to your profile to proceed.&#34;Although I follow a reasonable set of practices around identity/password management, I usually architect my risk profile with a &#34;I don&#39;t care if I lose this account&#34; approach. If that statement isn&#39;t true, then I will happily apply all of the security measures available. However, it seems like the idea of creating &#34;I don&#39;t care&#34; accounts is becoming increasingly difficult as we continue to invest in user marketing analytics and lower the barrier of entry to these types of technologies that do not have the consumer&#39;s best interests in mind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Twitter doesn&#39;t let me DM people who don&#39;t follow me because I haven&#39;t provided a cell phone number. I refuse to give it, mostly on principle. I send messages very rarely and am clearly not a bot. When did demanding a phone number become OK to access basic elements of a service? This happens even when I try to DM people whose DMs are open."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"[Borrowers: The Game]You live as tiny mouse-sized humans existing with regular humans who should never know your presence as you occupy the walls and spaces in their home. Every day you must hunt for food, which involves collecting gear to traverse spaces (paperclip + string = grappling hook and rope, matchstick = torch, plastic bag = parachute) to reach places where food is stored (i.e. the kitchen - defended by the cruel cat, mousetraps - easy to find but deadly to use, others). There&#39;s also more than one of you with time, where you can find and recruit others from outside the house, mate to create a family base of increasing members (prompting you to expand more into the walls which will increase your chance of discovery by normal humans), and most importantly - coordinate scavenger hunts with your crew (think: one Borrower leads a climb and trails a rope down, allowing others to follow, where more people == more food for the base). Due to the high death rate, there are no main characters, just Borrowers.[Extras]- Riding or rearing mice? (they can lead you to the cheese and help dodge the cat)- Stealing and riding a drone? (perhaps not such a rustic experience anymore)- Turning your tiny wall cave into a thriving Borrower city complete with electricity and beer? (might require killing the humans)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want a sort of civilization-but-for-countries.E.g. you are the newly elected president of Afghanistan/North Korea/Iraq/Other etc - now go rebuild infrastructure etc, set policies, see how the country develops as a result. E.g. do you invest in universal healthcare, or transport infrastructure?  Is transport infra required while your country is still largely subsistence farming?. What about education - save money there and spend on natural resource extraction?  How will that play out over decades and centuries?It would be nice to have direct control over city-level layout etc - demolish this neighborhood for flood defences, put in railways, major roads etc linking different parts of your country (not sim city levels of simulation, more just at the major civil engineering level of that makes sense - happy for actual city population to grow organically as a result of major works).Civ gets close, but it&#39;s too high-level and more focused on conquest.  I want to zoom in and have more control over where major irrigation canals get built, where to best build a nuclear plant, where that bridge should go or which mountains to tunnel through for a railway etc.  So instead of the grid being the entire planet, the grid would just be one country.Edit: I am specifically interested in the &#34;building&#34; aspect (so think civ-style grid with units moving around doing things), and less so on simple a-vs-b decision game model you see in Democracy et al."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A true &#34;MMORPG&#34;.Back in the day when the genre was new, people were fascinated by the potential of virtual worlds and virtual societies. Social scientists did online studies on player behavior and the interactions people had online, on spontaneous self-governance coming into existence, on how communities formed and developed, and many other similar topics. That potential was never fulfilled.Today - some twenty years later - the MMORPG has become a genre of checking off boxes and making numbers go up, along a linear way as laid out by the developers for you. Apart from PvP and maybe some forced grouping, most games would play absolutely identical mechanically, if you were playing all alone on your own private server. You&#39;d do the same quests, fight the same enemies, get the same loot. All the other players you get to meet online - they don&#39;t actually influence the game mechanics at all.You play next to each other. Not actually with each other.I&#39;d like to see a game, where the sum of players (and their interactions) are greater than just the sum of it&#39;s parts. A game with a virtual economy, a virtual society, etc. - that advance and evolve in a player-driven fashion. A simulated game world that dynamically adapts. Some glimpses of this sort of thing can be seen in games like EvE. Old games (pre-WoW) like UO and SWG had some of that magic as well - but were marred by limitations of the technology of the day. This kind of stuff has evolved very, very little since then.I would assume that with today&#39;s technology we should be able to get a lot closer to fulfilling that potential."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;I can&#39;t pretend to have derived any life lesson that applies to everybody from thisPart of what attracted me to software engineering in the first place was an interest in &#34;how things work&#34;, and being able to move between levels of abstraction (e.g. I know how IP, DNS, TCP, HTTP and JSON works, but most of the time I can just treat it as &#34;sending objects&#34;). So it was a bit of a eureka moment for me to realize that running a company is really just expanding the levels of abstraction that you operate with. It doesn&#39;t matter how well you code if people can&#39;t understand the user interface, so I got an interest in UX and usability. But it doesn&#39;t matter how user friendly it is, if it doesn&#39;t solve the right problem for people, so I got an interest in product development and customer research. It doesn&#39;t matter how good a product is if people never hear about it, so I got an interest in marketing and sales. And it doesn&#39;t matter how well I do all of that if I can&#39;t pay the bills, so I got an interest in pricing and monetization strategies.Juggling all those needs, and trying to shape the company and all its aspects into a cohesive whole is just as demanding and interesting as doing the same for a software project - it&#39;s just expanding the scope of which requirements and concerns you bring into the equation. For me at least, it&#39;s also been very rewarding to do the whole thing end-to-end, and it&#39;s felt like more of a natural extension of my ever-broadening interests than I would have expected. Bookkeeping can be as annoying as debugging, but in the end I&#39;m really grateful that I understand how each detail works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good job! I know exactly the feeling. I&#39;ll once again shamelessly plug my project, since it&#39;s vaguely relevant.I&#39;m making about 200 USD/month by selling watermark removals on https://gifmemes.io. What I&#39;ve learnt is that I&#39;m very bad at marketing &amp; design and will much rather spend hours programming useless features. For example I&#39;ve spent like 10 hours getting an wasm ffmpeg converter of gifs to mp4s and webms, which was not used AT ALL, while most of my traffic still comes from cold-writing (is it even a term) for 1 hour random people to put links on their websites or subreddits.The scene in the Sillicon Valley series, where Richards enhances the algorithm by 1 % is quite accurate.On the other hand, being the solo developer and product owner is quite powerful. My implementation of billing into the app took around 2 hours, which is probably less than a meeting about it would take in a company.Finally, I can run silly experiments. There is a button in the &#34;Buy watermark removal&#34; page that says &#34;It&#39;s too expensive&#34;, which leads to 50 % discount.  Around 70 % people still buy the full price."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well done! $500/mo, though not crazy money, is significant.How did you market your app and how long did it take you to build out the app?I&#39;ve built an app as well while I was doing my regular day job and recently quit the day job, mostly due to being burned out working in big tech as well.During my break from work, I decided to try to get my app sales up, but it&#39;s challenging. (During my best month, I think I got up to $200/mo but it&#39;s more like $100/mo right now.) As many others before me have found, marketing is the key, and I&#39;m still learning that game. So, $500/mo is really good stuff.That said, building the app and making my users happy is something that is incredibly gratifying, and something that was missing in my previous 9-5."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cleaning up after your parents is a gift you give to them: look at it like them paying it forward for all the times the cleaned up after you as a child.Psychologically, mentally, and physically, parents can have difficulty tidying up their stuff. My friend’s parents came from very poor backgrounds and had a lot of trash. The father had a shed full of stuff that was useful to him - he knew what was in it and how to use it. When the father died, the stuff in the shed was mostly junk to be sorted into scrap metal or put in the skip. A very few useful tools, a bunch of valueless obsolete tools, and a little antique/collectable stuff. The mother’s stuff was useful or precious to her, mementoes and knick-knacks. Plus some hoarder mentality that made sense given her background. Mostly valueless stuff to anyone else. What value is a drawer of your smalls?I want my parents to pass their problem down to me and my siblings. I think forcing parents to tidy up or downsize can be cruel. Why be selfish and needlessly make my parents sad?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It doesn&#39;t have to be this way.Synopsis of &#34;The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning&#34; by Margareta Magnusson.In Sweden there is a kind of decluttering called döstädning, dö meaning “death” and städning meaning “cleaning.” This surprising and invigorating process of clearing out unnecessary belongings can be undertaken at any age or life stage but should be done sooner than later, before others have to do it for you. In The Gentle Art of Swedish Death Cleaning, artist Margareta Magnusson, with Scandinavian humor and wisdom, instructs readers to embrace minimalism. Her radical and joyous method for putting things in order helps families broach sensitive conversations, and makes the process uplifting rather than overwhelming.https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/The-Gentle-Art-of-Swe..."</p>

Everything over 200 yrs had flowed to them.“Priceless heirlooms” weren’t of interest to anyone. Auctions led to junk dealers. There is a hopelessness in realizing that lifetimes of activity were of little value, that nobody even knew what many objects were.I felt like the girl in the movie Labyrinth when they weigh her down w worldly possessions.  There’s no way to train for it. It’s like the Kipple of Philip K Dick."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;The first bug that eats plastic was discovered in a Japanese waste dump in 2016. Scientists then tweaked it in 2018 to try to learn more about how it evolved, but inadvertently created an enzyme that was even better at breaking down plastic bottles. Further tweaks in 2020 increased the speed of degradation sixfold.Another mutant enzyme was created in 2020 by the company Carbios that breaks down plastic bottles for recycling in hours. German scientists have also discovered a bacterium that feeds on the toxic plastic polyurethane, which is usually dumped in landfills.&#34;Would love to see the timeline and capacity plotted on a chart. I wonder how much we need to make it practical. 6x increase in 2 years but did we go from decades to years?Hours on bottles sounds like we are getting there in speed but how much bacteria, and how quickly do they multiply and what do they do once they are done? I am asking because breaking bottles down in hours doesn&#39;t sound &#34;promising&#34;, it sounds like we are there. Just pour that on the plastic island in the ocean! If we cannot, there must be something else going on that prevents us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “The next step would be to test the most promising enzyme candidates in the lab to closely investigate their properties and the rate of plastic degradation they can achieve,” said Zelezniak. “From there you could engineer microbial communities with targeted degrading functions for specific polymer types.”John Todd has been working on ecologies (in a vat) that can process waste for over fifty years now. Among his accomplishments was developing an ecology that can break down DDT in a matter of weeks, instead of years. The main thing he does is drawing from all five of the major kingdoms together, and have them self-organize around the waste being processed. (https://www.toddecological.com/about)With the self-organization, it&#39;s not always necessary to model and engineer everything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imagine this:Monsanto patents a genetically modified bug that eats plastic, sells it to governments and recycling plants.Then, once it gets into nature and it starts eating things that isn’t trash, monsanto patents a series of plastics that is resistant to this bug.Increasing the price of plastic bags by 10x.Repeat this whole cycle over and over again. It becomes an arms race of patented bug, then patented plastic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If it were me, and I wasn&#39;t willing to just block the traffic, I might just set a 128 kbps limit on it and call it a day[1]. Eventually, the other side will figure out that their fetchers are all backed up and work out how to do their job without burning so much bandwidth.[1] Yeah, that can be a bit of a pain to setup depending on the server settings, but some people have to pay for bandwidth and server resources, so it&#39;s probably worthwhile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I was banned from the Go issue tracker for mysterious reasons, so I cannot continue to nag them for a fix.¹ I can’t blackhole their IP addresses, because that would make all Go modules hosted on git.sr.ht stop working for default Go configurations (i.e. without GOPROXY=direct). I tried to advocate for Linux distros to patch out GOPROXY by default, citing privacy reasons, but I was unsuccessful. I have no further recourse but to tolerate having our little-fish service DoS’d by a 1.38 trillion dollar company. But I will say that if I was in their position, and my service was mistakenly sending an excessive amount of traffic to someone else, I would make it my first priority to fix it. But I suppose no one will get promoted for prioritizing that at Google.&gt; [1]: In violation of Go’s own Code of Conduct, by the way, which requires that participants are notified moderator actions against them and given the opportunity to appeal. I happen to be well versed in Go’s CoC given that I was banned once before without notice — a ban which was later overturned on the grounds that the moderator was wrong in the first place.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article strangely undersells the advantages of low tech. It&#39;s true that they&#39;re not better for everything, but they have advantages well beyond the basic things mentioned.A tactile button has far fewer accuracy issues with positioning: if you can feel the button, you won&#39;t start pressing 2/3 off and then get further and further off until you&#39;re triggering something else, as happens all the time on touchscreens.A knob provides a richer communication path between your brain and the device. With touchscreens, you can basically just poke and swipe, with some unintuitive nuances like long press or multi-fingered gestures. With a knob, you&#39;re using separate muscles and so can associate muscle memory based on the size, texture, and granularity of &#34;click&#34; feedback as you turn. We also have the ability to finely modulate the rate of twisting something—compare that to tapping frantically on a touchscreen left/right icon to control a quantity.Knobs don&#39;t share space in our muscle memory with buttons. To some extent, different knobs and different buttons are distinguishable too.Physical sliders are good for fine-grained control, but are also good at just smashing them all the way to min or max. When I try that on a touchscreen control, it might not make it all the way to the extreme, or my angle is wrong (no physical constraint to keep my hand/finger in place!) and it doesn&#39;t register at all because I veered off of the control.Even when I&#39;m looking at the screen already, using a directional pad means I&#39;ll always gradually get further and further off until it stops registering. Either because my attention is on a different part of the screen, or because my fingers are in the way of seeing the displayed pad. Not a problem with a physical stick or knob."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Modern cars seem to be moving towards all controls on a touch screen somewhere. I suppose this allows for more frequent updates, but in my experience it just leads to more bugs and more painful factory updates.Not to mention using a touchscreen to adjust the temperature while driving is incredibly dangerous compared to a dial you can feel for without taking your eyes off the road."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like a lot of people have forgotten that before the iPhone, touchscreens were widely regarded as a terrible interface only suitable for niche applications like kiosks. There were good reasons for that, and latency and lack of tactile feedback were high on the list. Touchscreens have proved effective in situations where you need a highly-flexible interface in a small space, but an awful lot of devices (like appliances) have more space and don&#39;t need the flexibility, so they end up taking all of the downsides with none of the benefits.A lot of designers (or marketers) seem to be trying to copy the look and feel of Apple devices without understanding the factors that led to their design."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Minor usability suggestion that literally no one will likely care about but I notice it all the time:If you&#39;re writing a blog post about your service then chances are you&#39;re interested in driving people to the main website about that service?So...make it easy for those potential users to get there. At the top of your blog have a prominent &#34;what is [service]&#34; link to the marketing home / about page or a call out box.This guy does it as a CTA after the post which is a start but many, many people don&#39;t. That then leaves me and other potential users to have to figure out how to get to the homepage. I&#39;ll do it but you&#39;ll lose many others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I never realized that Healthchecks.io was a one man show.
I&#39;m almost ashamed to say that i&#39;ve been using the free tier for years. I moved from self hosted to the free tier when i killed off all of self hosted services, and i don&#39;t have much legitimate use for it, having it attached to a backup of a Raspberry Pi running HomeBridge in my summerhouse :)I do use it for a purpose it probably was not designed for :) In my summerhouse, one of the circuit breakers trips every now and then (1-2 times per year) for no apparent reason, and since the fridge is connected to that breaker, i very much fear arriving at a summer house where the fridge has been unpowered for a couple of weeks.The solution to that of course, was to setup a systemd timer on a Raspberry Pi (that also runs HomeBridge), which pings Healthchecks.io every 15 minutes. If it misses 2 pings it raises an alert.So far i&#39;ve had 2 notifications in the 2+ years it&#39;s been running, and both have been internet connection related, so monitoring the situation has apparently changed something :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m someone who likes configuring &amp; running my own servers, it is always a pleasure reading how others small / solo businesses are running their show.It is so cool to see one-person SaaS business running on old school bare metal servers without needing any fancy devOps / containerize tooling."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny, It reads like propoganda made by AI overlords in a posthuman world.
The leap between being scared to being friends to conclude that all AI is nice without any real compelling narrative tying it up is what I would expect from an automatic well-being machine taking over us for our own good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How many attempts and how much human curation was involved. Every &#34;I made AI do...&#34; story seems to necessarily omit the &#34;and I filtered out a LOT of rubbish before picking this one good example.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The future of ai generated content and entertainment is going to be wild!How long before we have ~unlimited high quality entertainment? Before an AI can generate infinite episodes of your favorite show, podcast, comedian, and so on.Going to be an interesting thing to watch unfold."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I always wanted a markdown-like video editor. I want to chop up my videos and make notes about what is in them.Text based document would be so much easier for this than big clunky Premiere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Any thought on providing an option to make a super cut that produces a desired output?Ie `videogrep --input *.mp4 --produce &#34;I am a robot&#34;` and will find all the pieces it needs to produce the desired output?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is awesome! I’ve considered building something nearly identical over the years, as I’ve definitely used VTT files to aid in searching for content to edit, but never did because getting all the FFmpeg stuff to work made my head hurt. I’m so glad someone else has done the hard work for me and that it’s been documented so well!Love this."</p>
