								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked in public accounting with some major corporations as clients. Every single company I interacted with used SAP. It is the de facto software in its field and is deeply entrenched. Its UX is the most horribly wicked thing I’ve ever come across. We would conduct walkthroughs with process control owners that showed us what they would do in SAP to perform their job functions, and it would take multiple, intelligent people to capture all of the processes. The knowledge that the users at the client had built up was extensive and highly specialized. If something happened to that person, I don’t think you could quickly plug in a new person and have them take over. The initial learning curve felt far too high. I’m sure it gave those people a sense of job security.I feel there is a lot of room to develop better tools that are not so horrid, however, the process for replacing SAP will be long and close to impossible. SAP feels like one of those businesses that’s too big to fail because it’s so entrenched in the corporate world. Somewhat jokingly, I think it would be easier to switch the US over to the metric system. Any challenger will have to be massive, accept losses for over a decade to gain market share, and have incredible support for their clients if they ever want to takeover in the Fortune 500 world. Challenges too great for a mere startup to accomplish.It’s easier to just hire people to learn the SAP workflow and then hire external auditors to make sure the accounting policies are properly being followed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My mother works for a fairly large textile lab. For decades, they used an internally developed system for lab reports (they had a few programmers and admins they called the &#34;nerds&#34; that did nothing else than extend and maintain the system). The company switched to a SAP solution a few years ago. Chaos ensued. The SAP solution missed so many edge cases that a huge number of lab reports were either inaccurate or completely wrong because information was lost in SAP translation between different labs. Sometimes clients (huge international players) noticed the mistakes, which then led to costly product delays. It became so bad that communication between labs eventually had to be done on two levels - within SAP, and &#34;informally&#34; by mail, telephone, or by simply walking to the other lab, adding a huge time overhead to every report.SAP removed virtually every automation advantage of the old system, and added the additional complexity of navigating the SAP GUI. Because of this additional workload and the reluctance of the company to hire more people to counter it (after all, SAP was implemented to streamline everything!), employee turnover suddenly skyrocketed. Everytime I talk with my mother, she complains about the system and tells me that another colleague has quit. She only stays because she only has 2 years until retirement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am an SAP developer since kind of forever, my first job after university (since 2009). First I hated it, but the deeper I am entrenched, the more I see why you choose SAP: Because there really is no alternative. The data model is so complex because it is growing iteratively since the 80s. Hacker News is valuing businesses that adjust to the customer instead of going for some kind of purity. Another complexity especially now is the different paradigm changes in between. ABAP, the programming language of SAP, is quite nice nowadays. CDSViews are a great invention, and so on. There&#39;s really a lot of innovation buried in the bad documentation, it&#39;s getting better. In summary as bad as it is, I don&#39;t see an alternative for all of the backoffice work. SAP is really flexible and supports a lot of different processes. A thing that makes it so costly is a lot of time culture, no small releases, MVP, and so on. But you can be agile with SAP, especially if you move to the cloud."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well this part is very familiar:&gt;  its work was given prominence in the engineering operation by former Chief Technology Officer Michael Schroepfer, who announced last year that he was stepping down.At the end of 2016, I joined Twitter to lead one of the anti-abuse engineering teams. My boss, who led the effort, was great: loved Twitter, hated abuse, very smart. 6 months later the CTO, who had been behind the creation of the anti-abuse engineering effort, left. My boss, previously gung ho, left in a way that made me think he was getting signals from his boss. And shortly after that, said boss&#39;s boss said that our team had succeeded so well that there was no need for us. He scattered the engineers, laid of the managers, me included, and declared victory. We all laughed bitterly.What these have in common for me is a high-level executive launching a special team with great fanfare in a way that addresses a PR problem. But because PR problems are generally fleeting, as soon as do-goodery loses its executive sponsor, everybody goes right back to the short-term incentives, meaning things like &#34;responsibility&#34; go right out the door. At least beyond the level that will trigger another PR disaster.And if you&#39;re wondering why you don&#39;t hear more about things like this, you&#39;re not supposed to. At least for the managers laid off, it was a surprise meeting and then getting walked out the door. In the surprise meeting, they offered a fair chunk of money (for me, $40k) to sign an additional NDA plus non-disparagement agreement. I happen to have a low burn rate and good savings, so I didn&#39;t sign. But I know plenty of people who have looked at the mortgage and kid expenses versus the sudden lack of income and eventually signed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Minetest is probably the best Minecraft alternative; it&#39;s free and open source software, which avoids the danger associated with centralized retaliation systems like the one Microsoft is operating.  Also, it&#39;s easier to write mods for, partly because mods are written in Lua, and you don&#39;t have to install mods on the client, just the server.https://www.minetest.net/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6Fyav6FiIsThe video&#39;s author doesn&#39;t mention it by name, but the quantum computing tutorial game he&#39;s playing in a couple of the clips is called QiskitBlocks; it&#39;s a series of puzzles designed to teach you how quantum computing works.The (public) games that run on the Minetest engine are listed on https://content.minetest.net/packages/?type=game.  QiskitBlocks in particular is https://content.minetest.net/packages/JavaFXpert/qiskitblock...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s apparently a minority voice opinion here on HN, but I for one appreciate what Microsoft is trying to do. As a parent of a 6 and 9 year old who have really gotten into Minecraft during COVID, I appreciate them basically deciding &#34;We want Minecraft to be a game for kids and an online community that is nice.&#34; I get why people are frustrated, but I also like the idea of a global decision that forces servers open to &#34;the public&#34; to have an enforced global standard of behavior. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, I don&#39;t see anything in their process that suggests that a group of adults playing with their friends are at risk of having their chat audited in the absence of a complaint?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, orsond from the fifth column here.The Fifth Column is a Minecraft hacking and griefing group. We created Project Copenhiemer which is a Minecraft server scanning tool. Copenhiemer scans the internet every 20 minutes for minecraft servers, logs players, server versions, mods and more.Originally we had created it to find players and grief their server worlds, highlighting how much information about players is leaked from Mojangs default server configuration. They have put some features into the game to stop this information from being leaked but have made it an opt in system which no one uses or is even aware of.We have become increasingly worried about the direction of Mojang&#39;s safety policies and we believe they are just playing lip service to the actual problems at hand.Online gaming and gaming coms has a seriously unaddressed problem with child safety.
Mojang&#39;s reasoning for chat reporting is to protect children. Chat reporting does absolutely nothing to solve this problem. You can report people for swearing, drug/alcohol references, etc. You cannot report a player for child exploitation unless they use the chat system to do so.As an example, I know one server admin that disabled chat entirely on his large server only to have pedophiles use in game signs to message and groom children over Skype and Discord.If Mojang were serious about protecting children, they would stop developing their paternalistic chat surveillance system and split multiplayer children and 18+ play from each other.For example, children should only be able to join under 18&#39;s Mojang hosted servers (realms) where conduct can be heavily monitored and 18+ players join multiplayer servers where children cannot play.It is clear they have thought about this problem for a total of 5 minutes and have shut down healthy &amp; reasonable debate about their solution to avoid embarrassment and scrutiny."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Patreon’s comment on this so far is on their creator Discord, so I can’t link to it, I’m afraid, but this is what one of their team members posted about an hour ago (7:29 PM EST):- - -“As a global platform, Patron will always prioritize the security of our creators&#39; and customers&#39; data. As
part of a strategic shift of a portion of our security program, we have parted ways with five employees. We also partner with a number of external organizations to continuously develop our security capabilities and conduct regular security assessments to ensure we meet or exceed the highest industry standards. The changes made this week will have no impact on our ability to continue providing a secure and safe platform for our creators and patrons, including the upcoming adult ID verification requirement.”- - -I have no idea how big their security team is (five may in fact be the entire group they called “the security team”), but I am not convinced that this is necessarily the end of the world for those who use Patreon. I don’t know how much financial data they even store directly (I would assume best practices entail letting their payment processors store actual credit card and bank account numbers, for instance, although I’m aware that may be easier said than done depending on their infrastructure).While I do think Patreon is going to have Issues (tm) due to having accepted so much VC money, it’s not clear to me that these layoffs were forced by their funders—they haven’t accepted any money recently, and I haven’t heard anything that suggests their revenues have been dropping to a point where there’d need to do serious belt-tightening.(Also, to people who seem to think any creator could just slap up “a basic microblog” and get all of Patreon’s functionality, that kind of falls into the “not even wrong” category. Replicating what they do would be a lot of work even for the technically-minded, many creators who use them are not technical, and even if you pull it off, there are things that just literally can’t be duplicated as a solo endeavor: all of your patrons may be supporting multiple creators, not just you; patrons may discover other creators based on who their friends support and who those they support are supporting; creators who support other creators just have those charges automatically deducted from their earnings; etc.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds rather scary but I would like to hear both sides of the story. I don&#39;t like guessing and passing judgment with basically a single sentence describing something that could have more to it than meets the eye."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be some speculation that this is credit card details being hacked. Firing your _entire_ security team sounds like the sort of action taken if basic security practices are not being done. Until we know more, hold out on hiring these people.Xe has commented on this and is suggesting to simply enable 2FA to deal with security concerns [1], as apparently a more measured response to security issues at Patreon. This seems to be more self-serving advice rather than good advice [2], the better suggestion would be to simply move to one of the many alternatives.The assumption is that the login system is somehow insecure, instead of the bank details themselves being stored insecurely. (Hypothetically) If you suffered a large leak of payment details, when payment processing is your _main_ income revenue, and you find out your security team of X people at probably $100k+ a year for N years have done nothing to secure payment details, you too may fire them on the spot.Until Patreon explain why they fired their _entire_ security team, the best advice is to remove your card details immediately. You can always add it back at a later date, or use an alternative payment processor.[1] https://xeiaso.net/blog/patreon-happening[2] https://www.patreon.com/cadey(Edit: As pointed out, Xe didn&#39;t mention credit card details.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google does this yet lies about their searches to maintain an illusion of competence.For example, you can type in something like &#34;purpose of life&#34; and it will say it has 2 billion results, yet if you try to go to result 500, you can&#39;t, it will stop at 400, then change the number to 400 results only on the last page.This happens for every query. Google lies about the astronomical number of search results, then only shows a few hundred at most."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious how much other major brands pay to stay in their placesCoke arguably pays megabucks to have giant displays in prime locations. Those locations have limited space so Coke taking up one isSimilarly, IIUC, companies pay to have their products put in conspicuous places in stores like Walmart, Target, etc. Only rich companies can afford to always get the spots that stick out the most.I don&#39;t know if those are compariable. Google pays Apple to be the default search engine seems no different than Coke paying to be the first soda on the aisle or to be featured on the edge of the aisle. People are still free to pick a different search engine or go into the soda aisle.Of course in retail another tactic is to make a bunch of products that appear to be different but are all basically the same. I think Crest or Colgate and 15 kinds of mouthwash all of which have the same &#34;active ingredient&#34; at the same concentration. The goal is to fill up the shelves with your products so there is no room left for the competition&#39;s products since shelf space is limited."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know I should hate google for some reason, but despite the SEO spam, they are still better than bing and duck duck go.I think my cocktail of degoogled Google products + adblock solutions + being that person who doesn&#39;t care about privacy has made Google &#39;fine&#39;.I avoid using Google products unless they are FOSS. I&#39;m not going to get screwed by &#34;play music&#34; or similar again.Out of FAAMG, I think I like Google the best. But that doesn&#39;t say much."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I produce Music Tech-based educational content on YT.  It started as a hobby and sideline to my main work (which at the time was classroom teaching of the same content).  While I&#39;m no longer working in classrooms (pandemic plus other reasons led to this), I&#39;m still producing content, which I think is of good quality and worthwhile.The issue I have with it is that I refuse to produce attention-grabbing clickbaity titles or thumbnails.  I don&#39;t like the whole algorithmically-driven race to the bottom of the brain stem, and have zero interest in producing the same.  I&#39;ve had plenty of comments from viewers who say the videos are great and informative, but if I&#39;d just jazz things up a bit then I&#39;d get more views.I&#39;m just wondering how this will change (if at all) with this new program.  It takes a LOT of time to produce decent content, and even more if you&#39;re going to provide a course and backup materials etc.. Writing curricula is HARD work, and writing tests, etc., that are actually valid is reasonably challenging and time consuming.I currently get about £100 a month from YT, which definitely doesn&#39;t reflect the time I put into it (but I know it has other benefits as I sell a fair number of books partly as a result of the viewership).  I know that the beasts of the platform (3b1b spring to mind) would do really well from this (and deservedly so), but I do wonder if things really need to change to make YT work well for genuinely-produced non-clickbait educational content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Every day, people come to YouTube to learn something new.True.&gt; shows content on commonly used education apps without distractions like ads, external links or recommendationsExternal links seem important on educational files, and I kind of like recommendations when I&#39;m browsing educational stuff, but whoo, no ads on educational stuff? That&#39;s great!&gt; Next year, qualified creators can begin offering free or paidThere it is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Next year, qualified creators can begin offering free or paid Courses to provide in-depth, structured learning experiences for viewers. Viewers who choose to buy a Course can watch the video ad-free and play it in the background.So you&#39;re cloning Udemy? Meh. Not much to be excited about so far.Finally, to help learners apply what they’ve learned, we’re introducing Quizzes — a new way for creators to help viewers test their knowledge.That could be somewhat useful, but..For example, a math creator who recently posted a series on algebra can create a Quiz on the Community tab to ask their viewers a question related to a concept taught in their latest video.Does anybody ever actually visit the &#34;Community&#34; tab of a channel? Why add this extra friction? Hasn&#39;t the technology progressed to the point that quizzes could be integrated right into the video player? For that matter, why not have &#34;adaptive&#34; videos where your quiz results can affect the video that you see (like triggering an extra in-depth explanation for notoriously tricky topic if the quiz taker scores below a certain level, etc.).I hope this works out and provides some value, but I have my doubts as it stands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With function signatures and state variables added in 5.010, I consider Perl feature-complete and have not really missed anything from it for as long as I&#39;ve been writing Perl.What I do appreciate that&#39;s missing from many other languages and systems is the extreme committment to backwards compatibility. The knowledge that the next minor release won&#39;t break existing scripts is underrated, IMO.Solo project with ~23K LOC of Perl and counting here. Bless you, Larry Wall and Perl maintainers.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was about 20, I went to the local Barnes and Noble to find a book about programming.Picked up the O&#39;Reilly Javascript book from around 2000. Had no idea what javascript was, just wanted to learn how to program and trying to pick the most popular language.$40 later, I got home and started reading! Very confusing, the first half of the book covered the language runtime (I think?) and the second half covered the browser sandbox, and it took me 200 pages to realize that I can&#39;t easily read or write to files on my machine with this language. Not what I was hoping for!Back to Barnes and Noble, another $40 and I came home with the O&#39;Reilly camel book, Beginning Perl I think? Cover to cover read, probably the last time I did that with a programming manual.Decades have passed, I&#39;m in the same camp as those that prefer Ruby now, but man what a breath of fresh air Perl was back in 2000."</p>

Maybe rose tinted spectacles on my part but i learned some really enlightening algorithms on there specifically in text processing and i recall it being a really warm community.Randall Schwarz used to run a podcast that was a total goldmine. Fond memories of listening to that on the train on the way to work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It just occurred to me, Zig could be a great learning-language for CSWhen I was in college we mostly used C++, which exposed (and thereby taught) a lot of core concepts around how computers and low-level languages work. But it was also a bit of a nightmare for... unrelated, obvious reasons.Rust is great for building software, but as a learning language I think it introduces too many additional concepts, has too many additional constraints, and has too many magical abstractions. Eg, doing manual deallocation helps you later appreciate what the borrow-checker does and why it existsZig is supposed to be C++ without all the pain and misery (esp around tooling). That could make it perfect for teaching people about pointers and heap allocations and working with bytes, with minimal extra pain and friction"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried Zig recently but I found the unsilenceable lints to be a huge productivity killer. I actually posted a link to the GitHub issue this morning. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32751317This makes a normal workflow with `watchexec zig test` basically impossible, since before I can even run the tests I have to spend time hunting down which variables are used/unused at the moment and (un)commenting them. And it seems like they&#39;re planning to double down on this by making you adjust even more trivial things like public/private and var/const before it will even compile your code. https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/335 https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/224Maybe I&#39;m a bad developer, but my code is never perfect the first time around. I always spend time experimenting and refining my designs. I want to find a design that works, and only then spend time polishing and prettifying before I git push.I do understand the reasoning (they don&#39;t want people committing poor quality code), but this implementation just seems completely backwards to me. It breaks the natural order. It&#39;s like saying we won&#39;t let you ctrl+s until your tests pass to make sure you don&#39;t commit broken code. Stop nannying me and let me get my work done!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why would anyone use a new systems programming language that is not safe? Zig might be better than C in some aspects, but is it worth it to switch to Zig when you realize that it&#39;s not much safer than C?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m quite interested in seeing where slim VM&#39;s go. Personally I don&#39;t use Kubernetes, it just doesn&#39;t fit my client work which is nearly all single-server and it makes more sense to just run podman systemd units or docker-compose setups.So from that perspective, when I&#39;ve peeked at firecracker, kata containers, etc, the &#34;small dev dx&#34; isn&#39;t quite there yet, or maybe never will get there since the players target other spaces (aws, fly.io, etc). Stuff like a way to share volumes isn&#39;t supported, etc. Personally I find Dockers architecture a bit distasteful and Podmans tooling isn&#39;t quite there yet (but very close).Honestly I don&#39;t really care about containers vs VMs except the VM alleges better security which is nice, and I guess I like poking at things but they&#39;re were a little too rough for weekend poking.Is anyone doing &#34;small scale&#34; lightweight vm deployments - maybe just in your homelab or toy projects? Have you found the experience better than containers?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Title is kinda clickbaity (wha-? how can a VM be lighter than a container). It&#39;s about unikernels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me: in 2015 I went to Dockercon and one booth that was fun was VMWare&#39;s. Basically they had implemented the Docker APIs on top of VMWare so that they could build and deploy VMs using Dockerfiles, etc.I&#39;ve casually searched for it in the past and it seems to not exist anymore. For me, one of the best parts of Docker is building a docker-image (and sharing how it was done via git). It would be cool to be able to take the same Dockerfiles and pivot them to VMs easily."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Understanding central banking, like so many other things, also means understanding philosophies, worldviews, perceptions, and outlooks. And goals. Especially goals.So yes, read. But my advice: read widely, not naively, because economic theory looks like math from the shoreline but it tastes and feels like philosophy when you dive in.Fun starting point: learning about the different &#34;schools&#34; of economic thought: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schools_of_economic_thought"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The lessons from Khan Academy are some of clearest, most distilled courses I&#39;ve seen.https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/macroec...Salman Khan, its founder, used to be a hedge fund analyst.I won&#39;t read hundreds of pages of dry economics any time soon. But maybe the books recommended in the article would be useful as a reference."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m currently writing a book about modern forms of money, and it so happend that I just read the first paper that is mentioned in this article:  &gt; Money Creation in the Modern Economy. By Michael McLeay, Amar Radia and Ryland Thomas of the Bank’s Monetary Analysis Directorate. Bank of England Quarterly Bulletin. Q1, 2014. 

It&#39;s a very accessibly written paper, not much &#34;dry theory&#34; at all.
The previous paper of the same team is also a must-read in my opinion.  &gt; https://www.bankofengland.co.uk/quarterly-bulletin/2014/q1/money-in-the-modern-economy-an-introduction"</p>
