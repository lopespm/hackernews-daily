								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why is the laplacian so ubiquitous? Well, locally any reasonable PDE is well approximated by a linear one. And linear PDEs are of the form Lu = f for a linear differentiable operator L. But why does the particular case of L = laplacian show up so often in physics? Galilean invariance says that the laws of physics should be invariant under translation and rotation. Checking this against Lu = f, you can verify that one requires that L commute with translations and rotations. That is L(u_h) = (Lu)_h, where u_h(x) = u(x+h), and similarly for rotations. What you can show (pretty easily on the Fourier side) is that every linear differential operator with these properties is a polynomial in the Laplacian."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sure. But I have a question: why? Why should we opt out of the telemetry? To me, this idea seems to not just be admitting defeat, it&#39;s ensuring defeat right from the start.Telemetry should always be opt-in. Yes, that means vendors will get much less data. It&#39;s on them to deal with it.On a related note, I wonder how long it takes until one of the vendors of popular CLI tools or desktop apps get fined for GDPR violation. I wonder how much of existing telemetry already crosses the &#34;informed consent&#34; requirement threshold. I&#39;ll definitely be filing a complaint if I find a tool that doesn&#39;t ask for it when, by law, it should."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;PRs and Status&#34; is a very optimistic headline for a list of rejected pull requests.I like the idea, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. I can understand why some Homebrew devs think it&#39;s just an attempt from someone to pad their resume. It&#39;s essentially a single person setting up a website, then submitting a bunch of untested pull requests to a bunch of projects.I imagine this would work much better if a large distro like Debian would adopt this first. They have the credibility and weight necessary for such a project, they can make it much more useful by asking for the desired setting during OS setup, and they can make sure it&#39;s universally respected via patches in the packaging process. From there it would have a chance at wide adoption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do not support this idea. The differences between the things they all group together under one umbrella is wild - ads, usage reporting, automatic updates, and crash reporting are all very different things and it&#39;s actively harmful to control all of them with a single switch.At the very least, there should be two different switches - &#34;ads&#34; and &#34;everything else&#34;.If you don&#39;t want telemetry or crash reporting, that&#39;s fine - you may not care about helping the developers of an open-source project improve their software and that&#39;s your personal choice. Similarly, you may want to manually install security patches, while I want them to be automatically installed so I have one less thing to worry about.There may even be some crazy person that wants ads. I don&#39;t, but I&#39;m not going to try to take away their freedom to choose them, which is what this proposal would do - an all-or-nothing switch for non-essential network access.Give me granularity. There&#39;s no (user-facing) reason not to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to me that there is not as much push back against Rust from the kernel. Linus (I guess everyone addresses him with his first name), has been very critical, even dismissive of systems programming languages other than C. But with Rust he has a more, I guess we could say passive approach. This might be a good indicator that Rust is doing something very respectable.On the other hand I&#39;m slightly suspicious of this movement. Rustaceans are very, very eager to promote the language. It would be interesting to know how much this movement comes from within the Linux kernel community or if it is driven more by the Rust community.In any case the language seems to have potential of becoming a new mainstream systems programming language in a few years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems like this now has enough momentum and strong industry support to actually happen.With the initial announcement I mentioned that Linux will need quite a customized Rust experience, and was hopeful that this effort could improve the situation for everyone.It&#39;s great to see this actually happen, with changes already flowing back into core and alloc.A lot of progress in just a few months!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reading between the lines it seems the writer has mainly watched American movies that are easily accessible. I recommend instead of scrolling through the Amazon catalogue like he described, he might want to see if there is a local film festival that screens world cinema. Cinema from other parts of the world for me often leads to great new perspectives and insights. Outside of Hollywood there is plenty of auteurs and refreshing cinema happening. Or take a deep dive into the best of the best without the American lens with lists like the TSPDT.https://www.theyshootpictures.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Roger Ebert wrote an essay [0] in 1992 reflecting on his career as a critic. He writes&gt;In the past 25 years I have probably seen 10,000 movies and reviewed 6,000 of them. I have forgotten most of those films, I hope, but I remember those worth remembering, and they are all on the same shelf in my mind.Overall, he seems never to have lost the joy of watching movies. A relevant quote:&gt;When you go to the movies every day, it sometimes seems as if the movies are more mediocre than ever, more craven and cowardly, more skillfully manufactured to pander to the lowest tastes, instead of educating them. Then you see something absolutely miraculous. Something like &#34;Wings of Desire,&#34; or &#34;Do the Right Thing,&#34; or &#34;Drugstore Cowboy,&#34; or &#34;Gates of Heaven,&#34; or &#34;Beauty and the Beast,&#34; or &#34;Life Is Sweet,&#34; and on your way home through the White Hen Pantry you look distracted, as if you had just experienced some kind of a vision.[0]: https://www.rogerebert.com/roger-ebert/reflections-after-25-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The root cause of this is basically Hollywood (i.e. who makes what gets shown in your local multiplex) has given up on making movies exclusively for American audiences.  You need a global audience, and you need the potential to get a billion dollars + in revenue.  E.G. as he points out comedies have died, that&#39;s because comedy is highly localized versus the kids movies + adventure plots which are more universal.  End result is everything gets boiled down to its rawest, most accessible elements and everything feels samey."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a xoogler who interviewed way back in 2004, let me say that this post sums up my feelings exactly. The people I worked with at Google back then weren’t necessarily there for high six figure salaries. We were there to work with other people like us. We were there to be part of something larger than ourselves. In some sense I felt alone most of the time, and when I interviewed I felt as if I had found my tribe. These are people who made me feel dumb, but also astutely aware that I could improve. I learned so much during my tenure there, and I regret none of it. Perhaps I do regret taking so long to realize the sense of purpose and mission died when Emerald Sea started and good projects (reader, google talk, code search) were being canabalized to prop up a pipe dream that was never going to work. That’s the nexus event in Google’s time line… where things went askew and never came back to normal. Now people only care about perf, OKRs, and levels. Being a poor new grad with no savings and intentionally picking projects that would not get you promoted (but were fun) was frequent back then. The courage to do new things is rewarded in ways different than titles and symbols. Perhaps no “one” is more cognizant of that than the anthropomorphic Google of today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked on the infra team for a TypeScript-based product downstream of the author. His and his team&#39;s approach and writings influenced at a lot of my thinking about core development, and I&#39;ll always be grateful for having had the opportunity to learn from them by osmosis.The success or failure with which any companies hires and retains folks like these is a mystery to me. As the evidence shows, Google (and I suspect almost any &gt;100-person company) is far too much an amorphous glob/slime mold to even have a single coherent approach to this problem. But what are the successful strategies here? How important is it even to retain this kind of talent? How do we know how a company is even doing in this regard?In my meager-in-comparison 6.5 years at Google, while I certainly saw many amazing SWEs come and many go, I&#39;m far from knowing what the real trajectory was. But I can imagine that for many folks, the perceived trajectory would be a major motivating or demotivating factor to stay or to leave themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; At the time I left, out of ~150k employees, only ~300 had worked there longer than me.This is why it is insane to accept the &#34;I know the people involved in developing that and they wouldn&#39;t let a terrible thing happen.&#34; Defense of it being ok for the co. to have massive unchecked power.The company is its people. The people /will/ change. Give a company serious power you cannot expect the staff to keep it reigned in. It&#39;s completely unrealistic and also unfair to the staff for them to have that moral responsibility forced on them. Ultimately 99.9% of the time the only thing they can do is resign, which reduces the impediments to bad things happening."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; But drill isn’t popular. It’s widely seen as boring. Worse, there’s a body of opinion, especially in education, that considers it an ineffective way to practice. That’s a shame, because it’s the most effective way to build your skills.This resonated with me as I watch my kids go through school.Math used to be taught with more drill style. Now with common core every single problem is an epic quest of 10 frames and double pluses. It seems so ridiculous. I&#39;d rather them crush a worksheet of 20 problems that practices a single skill then 2 problems that try to include everything from reading to drawing just for a simple subtraction problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The premise of Wooden&#39;s methods is that the players already have a lot of experience playing basketball. Many many games by the time they got to UCLA. Informal and formal.And that&#39;s my caveat for this as advice on painting. If a person doesn&#39;t already have a history of painting, by which I mean starting and completing paintings as paintings, no amount of drill is going turn them into a painter. The willingness to execute paintings has to be there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As much as I agree with a lot in this article, I totally don&#39;t understand the &#34;Code Kata&#34; thing promoted by Uncle Bob Martin and others. I understand drilling a specific skill in the arts, but writing the same piece of code over and over just makes no sense at all (and yeah, his example was solving the &#34;Bowling Score&#34; problem every time).So, anyone do code katas and like/recommend them? If so, what does it teach you? Do you do the same problem over and over, or tackle different problems?"</p>

Then work on issues for however long you wanted, billed hourly at a generous rate.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a tip on finding a cofounder. I&#39;ve been looking for the last 12 months and I tried a lot of things, but the thing that worked best is this:Post a job ad.That&#39;s it. My ad sounded like a normal job in every way, with a title like &#34;Director of X&#34;. A couple of specific notes: 1) the first line said &#34;cofounder&#34; in it somewhere, and 2) it specified &#34;part-time to full-time, heavy on equity compensation&#34; somewhere else.The result: Lots of inappropriate candidates applied. But also, my 2 job posts resulted in three extremely excellent team members: a equity-only cofounder, a mostly-equity cofounder/early hire, and an amazing advisor. I have been working with these folks for months and they are very solid.I also recommend my vetting process: just like a job. That is, I did a phone screen, a multi-hour interview, a little take-home, and I winnowed down the candidates at each stage. With the chosen few, I kicked off a &#34;let&#39;s do this&#34; conversation. My pitch was, &#34;I know it&#39;s ridiculous, but let&#39;s get business married, we&#39;ll set up an offsite and start working together full-time... and, if we really need to, we&#39;ll get an annulment&#34;. That&#39;s what vesting is for!Hope that helps :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been working on a startup for years, like the better part of a decade and finding cofounders is like planning where lightning will strike; unless you&#39;re already in the right place, it&#39;s almost impossible.I&#39;ve tried things like cofounderslab, cold messaging through social DMs and working my network but there&#39;s such a small cohort of people who (1) find value in working at a startup, (2) are willing to take equity in the beginning without being paid and (3) believe in your idea enough to want to work hard.I&#39;ve had to learn how to scale myself into different roles (outside of engineering) to keep going, but it really is an exercise in testing your limits: mentally, physically, emotionally, socially...I hope this is something that actually works.edit: Just to give more context, I have had people who I trusted and who initially signed on to help, but they fell out somewhat quickly due to one of the three things I mentioned above. Most people don&#39;t understand how much work goes into actually making a startup happen and flame out pretty quickly...alas..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using this since February-ish.Talked to maybe 20-30 people through the platform.Joined one startup as cofounder. Worked together for two months, then left. My cofounder was smart, had high EQ, and I enjoyed working with them, but we had different visions and parted amicably.My thoughts:- Early on, there was a smaller pool of people, but they were of higher quality. I feel the quality of people has diminished over time. YMMV.- It was interesting just to have talks with the high quality people and expand my network. This kinda segued me into Lunchclub, but I&#39;ve since stopped both. Depending on who you are, you might get burnt out with these &#34;social&#34; calls after a while.- As a technical person, I had a lot of business-y people reach out, most of which I didn&#39;t end up responding to. There&#39;s plenty of candidates, just like dating on Tinder. I get to choose to work with the really nice and productive people that I like.- BIGGEST PROBLEM: Unfortunately, it suffers the same problem as every other cofounder matching program. There&#39;s no system or formula to really dig deep and see if you&#39;re compatible on all the levels you need to be. This means it can be a big time and energy drain, from the initial meets, to the dating process, to even cofounder work.If you do use this, some tips:- Being short and sweet with your profile. Burying the fact that you&#39;re a high school student in 5 paragraphs of text won&#39;t make it more likely for me to work with you, and I probably won&#39;t even read it.- Add a photo. You&#39;re going to be working with a human, not a robot.- Your cofounder courting process is something you&#39;ll have to develop and figure out what you&#39;re looking for. Take your time and think about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"FWIW the ET Legacy[0] project remains active, and exists because the Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory code was GPL&#39;d.I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s a good example of the &#39;best aspects of the GPL&#39; that Carmack was talking about, but it&#39;s at least certain that all of the work contributed to ET Legacy is work that had the potential to be closed-sourced, but wasn&#39;t.It would be really interesting to see the lineage of open-source projects based on the GPL-licensed id games. The family tree at wikipedia[1] isn&#39;t complete (doesn&#39;t show ET Legacy, for example), and doesn&#39;t differentiate by license.[0] https://www.etlegacy.com/[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech#/media/File:Quake_-_fa..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This part of Carmacks tweets really touches home,&gt; I touched on that recently with the comment about open source culture and game dev;One thing I learned the hard way is how game dev is all about IP, creating business oppportunities, publishing deals, getting the game into the hands of as many kids as possible (while being able to keep paying for the mortgage), whatever APIs get used is a very tiny detail of the whole games production circus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m still bummed out that for years, GPL was the &#34;standard&#34; go-to open source license. So many projects became useless for any commercial projects whatsoever.GPL advocates say it&#39;s so that your code isn&#39;t exploited by corporations.But I&#39;d say that choosing GPL means it&#39;s more important to you that your code &#34;is not exploited by corporations&#34; than that it can be used for good by people with commercial interests.Those two things do not have to be synonyms. I&#39;d much rather allow the second if it means tolerating the first.(Edit: Seeing the downvotes, I&#39;d be genuinely interested in counter-arguments or thoughts on this)(Edit 2: Just because it keeps coming up, let me make absolutely clear that I do NOT in any way think GPL might never be a valid choice, nor that anyone, myself included, should feel &#34;entitled&#34; to &#34;free as in *.*&#34; code.)"</p>
