								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People are misunderstanding this and claiming it&#39;s not problematic. Ben Torrell (an OBS developer) notes later in the thread that there is indeed GPL code compiled into TikTok&#39;s executables; since source is not available and they have not got another license, it is unlicensed and hence illegal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So people that have ripped off OBS so far and violated GPL include TikTok, StreamLabs (Logitech), and StreamElements. Any other people I missed?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In almost all cases, TikTok&#39;s offering would be considered a derived work because you cannot swap out the OBS part for another and still have it work. So they are likely in full violation unless they agree to open source all their code.Seems like a pretty open and shut case to be honest - that is, if they intend to pursue legal action and the powers that be rule appropriately."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In addition to the points raised by BMJ and in the comments below, there is a limit to what independent fact checking can accomplish. For example, are their fact checkers conducting their own scientific experiments validating claims and outcomes of a scientific paper? Are fact checkers reaching out to sources from a news article and verifying quoted information? When “breaking news” or “scoops” are reported presenting totally new information about the world, how can that be verified against other information that - by virtue of something being new - cannot be verified by other preexisting sources?If the fact checking process is limited to verification based on other information that is currently available, and if the fact checking process cannot distinguish between factual information and the opinions people hold as a result of that information, the outcome will be an inevitable echo chamber that reinforces currently dominant views or whatever preexisting biases are present.In short, fact checking is hard and there is a reason why reputable publishing outlets have their own internal fact verification processes before something gets published (including safeguards and retractions, because they make mistakes too), and why news is separated out from opinion-editorial pages... even if it is in style to add opinions (read: “perspective”) to every article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This one is much trickier than it looks. Reposting user nojito&#39;s post (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29596111), but here in a top level comment:&gt; The fact check was correct in this instance though?&gt; https://leadstories.com/hoax-alert/2021/11/fact-check-britis...&gt; The conclusions in the original BMJ article make zero sense when actually scrutinized.&gt; https://www.bmj.com/content/375/bmj.n2635Please read both URLs before commenting in depth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Both Facebook (now Meta) and Youtube bungled their fact checking by disabling posts and videos that were counter to some narrative, but not factually incorrect.  That places them in a bad position, and they need to be called out publicly, as no other mechanism so far has pushed them towards more accurate fact checking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Praise, 2 suggestions and a question.Color coding OOM (order-of-magnitude) is smart, but the colors chosen seem quite hard to distinguish. Consider picking different default colors; also consider adding a redundant representation of scale, like an integer representing OOM scale.It is strange that a thoughtful design around OOM would also choose keep so many digits. If the goal is to summarize, then please throw those extra digits away. (e.g. 10.3992s is specifying the time down to the millisecond, but those extra ms are not meaningful at the second time scale.)What is this about the runtime polling tasks? Does that happen in Tokio? Why? I am only familiar with 2 async runtimes (node, vert.x) and I was under the impression that neither of these &#34;poll their threads&#34; in any meaningful way. Threads (or process or fiber or whatever you want to call it in this context) never initiate action on their own. They are ALWAYS waiting for something to happen to them, and that includes timeouts, which would be triggered by passing a thread a clock tick. The runtime&#39;s job is to centrally manage resources that must persist between thread behavior, so at most it is going to be polling external resources, and not it&#39;s own threads.Or maybe I don&#39;t understand what polling means here? I would interpret it as meaning &#34;keep checking a well-known place for changes, and then do something if a change is found&#34;. But since async threads can&#39;t initiate any change on their own, this is nonsensical."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Real wages have been flat since the 1970s (https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/08/07/for-most-us...). &#34;Okay, so people&#39;s living standards are about the same since 1970?&#34; Not even close. The problem with inflation is that its calculation is fraught with all kinds of selective weighting, bias, and politics. Take a look at the relative differences between the things which have decreased and increased in cost in real terms (https://static.seekingalpha.com/uploads/2017/5/29/saupload_i...). Okay, so TVs and cellphones are cheaper, but necessities like college, childcare, and healthcare are up significantly.And when you drill in more, there are other issues. For example, the housing metric appears relatively flat in real terms, right? Except, that doesn&#39;t tell the story for the majority of Americans. Housing costs are WAY up in cities as Americans migrate to where the jobs are, while housing costs are down in all the areas where jobs are disappearing. In practise, housing costs are actually significantly up for most Americans, but because the CPI is calculated across the entire nation, the government can claim inflation is low. This allow them to keep the fed rate low, which keeps stock valuations high. This LOOKS great and generates great headlines, but the reality is that most Americans are significantly worse off since the 1970s.And then we come to the other elephant in the room: why are real wages flat? Given the incredible performance of the American economy since 1970, shouldn&#39;t real wages be significantly UP? This is yet another reminder that wealth is being squeezed from the bottom and funnelled straight up. As a non-American, it&#39;s heartbreaking to see efforts to unify the underclass completely derailed by this ridiculous race war. Poor people in America have FAR more in common with each other than the rich, no matter race. I really hope you all manage to set aside the obvious red herring of race and unite in tackling your staggering wealth inequality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We had an all-hands meeting recently where we got to submit anonymous questions.  One of the questions was &#39;with inflation rising at 6%, will the company reconsider their &#39;standard&#39; 2% raise?&#39;  The lady answering looks dead in the camera and goes &#39;Honestly? No&#39; and goes on to talk about how we&#39;re reasonably competitive with the local market.  Hey, credit where credit is due, at least she was a refreshingly straight shooter.  It pretty much let everyone on the call know what they needed to do if they wanted a good raise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who does OK, but lives in reality (not the bay area), I feel a revolution coming.  I hope it&#39;s not a violent one, but who knows at this point.  Hopefully it&#39;s just a politician with big policy changes.People feel completely disenfranchised.  You keep hanging housing over their head but just out of reach like some baby toy, then inflation spikes everything else.  What&#39;s the point of working even?I don&#39;t know the solution, but I don&#39;t have a good feeling about the next 10 years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish I could say I stopped buying things off Amazon for ethical reasons, but the truth is, I stopped buying because if you look closely at the reviews, you realize that almost everything for sale there is now a scam or a knock-off. This was a slow creep for awhile, but now the problem has grown exponentially. Amazon is what Canal Street was in the 90s - somewhere to buy fakes, stolen goods, and electronics that might catch fire.Amazon has no interest in fixing this problem, because they know that well over half their &#34;inventory&#34; is now from knockoffs, IP theft and/or bait-and-switch scams. it&#39;s almost impossible to find items there anymore that are not fake, whether it&#39;s re-packaged hard drives or &#34;pyrex&#34; bowls that explode in the microwave.One way to look at this, and the way I think Amazon must look at it, is that it&#39;s not any worse than a third world night market. The attitude of vendors in, e.g. Phnom Penh or Mexico City markets is that the very fact that stupid Americans think they&#39;re going to get &#34;real&#34; goods just proves how much they deserve to be scammed. Amazon is actually helping baffled Americans to finally understand what the third world has always known - unboxing is going to be disappointing. Everything you think is affordable is probably fake, and you can&#39;t trust the packaging. Only the rich get actual brand products. As America degrades, people will start to get more savvy and more cynical about this, but right now it&#39;s still a newish phenomenon and people are shocked, shocked! to find out the kids toys they bought are full of toxic chemicals that we ourselves shipped overseas for burial or &#34;recycling&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand what Amazon thinks it&#39;s doing with its legions of data scientists, analysts, product managers and engineers that they consider so much more important than solving this problem, which will destroy their reputation long-term and create space for a competitor.At this rate, Amazon will be on its way to becoming Yelp -- untrusted, irrelevant, ultimately deserted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally experienced this. I bookmarked a keyboard I was interested in purchasing in a month or so.

This just results in me just not using Amazon. You may be able to justify it for large purchases because of Amazon&#39;s return policy but for something as mundane as a can opener or seat cushion? Just shop elsewhere.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/a72co8/seat_cushi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a load of nonsense in the comments here today.* Drata is a vendor that helps a company navigate your SOC2 compliance process, by organizing all the controls and helping you gather evidence that you have done so. For instance, they&#39;ll connect with Github and make sure everyone with access to your repos is a company employee. If you don&#39;t use Drata you have to gather this evidence yourself, repeatedly over months, and it&#39;s a pain.* The Drata agent is a pretty innocuous thing. It checks you have done things like turn on disk encryption, have updates enabled, and that the screen locks if you walk away. It does NOT monitor employee&#39;s activities. These kind of security checks are incredibly common and are required for certifications like ISO27001 and SOC2. SOC2 is not really optional for large enough b2b SaaS.* The poster says &#34;Their business model (in my case) seems to be to take money from companies to spy on their employees/contractors, and then they sell the employees/contractors private information to &#34;targeted advertising&#34;.Do you have any evidence for this?? I&#39;ve just been involved in selecting Drata as a vendor for SOC2 compliance planning for our company. If this is true it&#39;s a huge deal and totally against my understanding of their business model. It honestly sounds like bullshit to me! But if you have evidence that they do this, please let us know.* As a freelancer, whether you are required to install security monitoring software is definitely an open question. If you&#39;re delivering work separately and not connected to company systems, then ok. If you&#39;re basically just acting like any other employee, and connected to the company systems, then you will probably have to do this. Because otherwise they would fail SOC2 and managing your legal status as &#34;Freelancer&#34; vs &#34;Employee&#34; (for tax reasons??) is not worth not being certified."</p>

You unplug your laptop from a wired connection, switch to wireless - we recovered in milliseconds. You heard barely a click.The encryption issue is fun - we had a rotate-key message in-band. The receiver loaded new keys and tried them in sequence to ease the turnover time - out-of-order packets etc could make it ambiguous for a short while which key to use. A cache and aging keys out made it work pretty well.Remixing on user stations proved to be problematic (mentioned elsewhere on this thread). You&#39;d think if 6 people at one site were conferencing with a dozen elsewhere, you could elect one at each site to mix-and-forward. But corporate networks made it hard to determine who was &#39;adjacent&#39; - they were often layered and without uPNP (is that what the router protocol is called?) you couldn&#39;t tell if somebody at the next desk was even in your company.We had up to 100 people in a conference, and our enter-the-conference time was on the order of 100ms. Click into an all-hands, and be able to hear everybody before you finger left the mouse button. It was wonderful.Sococo today is a sad shadow of that. They went open-source and lost all our IP instantly. Just another WebRTC client last I knew."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt;  There is no off the shelf software that would allow us to support calls of that size while ensuring that all communication is end-to-end encrypted, so we built our own open source Signal Calling Service to do the jobBut wasn&#39;t there Jitsi? [0]I think its great we have competition among Free Software projects so that both can improve. But sometimes I feel like maybe duplicated efforts create two 5/10 solutions. Instead what we really want is one 8/10 solution, or better.[0] https://meet.jit.si/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The progress on all fronts is really impressive, and even the write-up is top notch. The pace at which the team advances is incredible, as it seems Apple support is minimal...Maybe the core tech users is negligible to Apple, but it shouldn&#39;t be: Winning over the power users generally precedes larger adoption and I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if Macs continue to gain market share in the years to come with their CPU lead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Alder Lake, Intel&#39;s flagship dekstop class CPU, is only 10-15% faster than the M1 Pro/M1 Max in CPU performance but it requires an insane amount of cooling and the power consumption is frankly ridiculous.Seems like Apple Silion will be 5 years ahead of the competition - similar to how long it took for others to catch up with the first iPhone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s still not really ready for prime-time, but I&#39;ve got a M1 mac mini running debian as an arm64 build bot (and a few other small things) now, and I can say that the bits that work, work really well.Storage is fast, CPU performance is solid, PCIe for ethernet works just fine.Now if I could just get one with 64G of RAM and 2TB of SSD... ;)edit: the setup process is still far from polished but that&#39;s not unexpected this early, and it&#39;s still in a &#39;build your own kernel&#39; state. But it was easy enough to get going in an hour or two with a pointer or two from IRC and from reading the wiki."</p>
