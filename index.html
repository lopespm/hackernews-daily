								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Current USPTO patent examiner here. The most effective way to eliminate bad patents would be to give examiners more time, say double the time across the board to start. If an examiner can&#39;t find prior art in the little time they&#39;re given, and they have no other reasons to reject the application, they&#39;ll have to grant it. The amount of time was (basically) set in the 1970s based on data from the 1960s. There have been some minor increases since then. Several orders of magnitude more prior art exists now. And while search technology has improved, it hasn&#39;t become orders of magnitude better. So I&#39;d argue that the workload has increased dramatically since the 1970s. Simply giving examiners more time would probably greatly reduce the grant rate, and also incidentally reduce examiner stress levels. Patent examination is a tough job, as examiners rarely get enough time to do a quality job, and this leads to the high stress levels.USPTO upper management is taking comments about the &#34;robustness and reliability of patent rights&#34; until February. You can leave your comments here:https://www.regulations.gov/document/PTO-P-2022-0025-0001Unfortunately giving examiners more time is only briefly addressed in this request for comments. I think the public should really drive home the point that the procedural changes discussed wouldn&#39;t be anywhere near as effective as simply giving examiners more time.Don&#39;t believe examiners are overworked? Take a look at this subreddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/patentexaminer/(Note that this comment is only my opinion, not that of the USPTO, US government, etc.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two additional notes:1. Zhang posted an attempt at solving this problem in 2007 that he later more or less admitted was flawed: https://mathoverflow.net/questions/131221/yitang-zhangs-2007.... But speaking with mathematicians who are intimately familiar with Zhang&#39;s previous work, there seems to be good reason to be optimistic nevertheless. First, the idea behind Zhang&#39;s proof is similar to the zero-repulsion ideas appearing in known results about Siegel zeros, and is thus reasonable. Second, Zhang seems to have matured late, and unlike the flawed 2007 paper, his 2013 paper on bounded gaps in primes is meticulously written. He came a long way between those two papers, and he may have come even further since then.2. Zhang is 67 years old. If the paper is correct, then Zhang constitutes a strong counterexample to G.H. Hardy&#39;s famous claims that &#34;mathematics is a young man&#39;s game&#34; and nobody alive today could say, as Hardy did, that &#34;I do not know an instance of a major mathematical advance initiated by a man past fifty.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not a mathematician, but the story of Yitang Zhang desperately makes me want this paper to be correct.&gt; Prior to getting back to academia, he worked for several years as an accountant and a delivery worker for a New York City restaurant. He also worked in a motel in Kentucky and in a Subway sandwich shop. A profile published in the Quanta Magazine reports that Zhang used to live in his car during the initial job-hunting days.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yitang_Zhang"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t resist saying one last thing about Siegel zeros: number theorists REALLY would like for this result to be correct because the possibility of Siegel zeros is unbelievably annoying. I mean mathematicians are supposed to enjoy challenges / difficulties, but Siegel zeros are just so recurrently irritating. The possibility of Siegel zeros means that in so many theorems you want to write down, you have to write caveats like &#34;unless a Siegel zero exists,&#34; or split into two cases based on if Siegel zeros exist or don&#39;t exist, etc.But here is the worst (or &#34;most mysterious,&#34; depending on your mood..) thing about Siegel zeros. Our best result about Siegel zeros (excluding for present discussion Zhang&#39;s work), namely Siegel&#39;s theorem, is ineffective. That is, it says &#34;there exists some constant C &gt; 0 such that...&#34; but it can tell you nothing about that constant beyond that it is positive and finite (we say that the constant is &#34;not effectively computable from the proof&#34;).*So then, if you try to use Siegel&#39;s theorem to prove things about primes, this ineffectivity trickles down (think &#34;fruit of the poisoned tree&#34;). For example, standard texts on analytic number theory include a proof of the following theorem: any sufficiently large odd integer is the sum of three primes. However, the proof in most standard texts fundamentally cannot tell you what the threshold for &#34;sufficiently large&#34; is, because the proof uses Siegel&#39;s theorem! In this particular case, it turns out that one can avoid Siegel&#39;s theorem, and in fact the statement &#34;Any odd integer larger than five is the sum of three primes&#34; is now known https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldbach%27s_weak_conjecture. But it is certainly not always possible to avoid Siegel&#39;s theorem, and Zhang&#39;s result would make so many theorems which right now involve ineffectively computable constants effective.*Why is the constant not effectively computable? Because the proof proceeds basically like this. First: assume the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. Then the result is trivial, Siegel zeros are exceptions to GRH and don&#39;t occur if GRH is true. Next, assume GRH is false. Take a &#34;minimal&#34; counterexample to GRH, and use it to &#34;repel&#34; or &#34;exclude&#34; other possible counterexamples."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; And, for the any employees still at Twitter, don’t underestimate the power of a pocket veto.This is something I&#39;ve been repeating to some of my younger colleagues.Engineers aren&#39;t really fungible resources, to the extent that these projects require. Ask any manager how easy it is to swap &#34;allocated resources&#34;, and they&#39;ll probably sigh heavily.People are afraid that if they don&#39;t follow their manager&#39;s every request, they will be fired. But remember that hiring is hard, and managers are loath to fire someone they&#39;ve already spent so much effort finding, hiring, and onboarding. Finding someone else to do it can take weeks, months, or longer! Which in many cases risks killing the project altogether.Even if you&#39;re at the bottom of the chain, as the person who does the actual implementation, you have a lot of power on what gets prioritized.See also the oft-circulated OSS &#34;Simple Sabotage Field Manual&#34; http://svn.cacert.org/CAcert/CAcert_Inc/Board/oss/oss_sabota..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What I want is Little Snitch on steroids built into the OS where every process, including all native ones, including UI apps, are blocked from network connectivity by default, and the user gets an easy monitor of outgoing traffic with TLS/SSL inspection built in (you&#39;d need some OS API to enable that).Kind of like granular oauth permissions, apps should have to declare which outgoing they have, a description/why, and allow inspection of the actual traffic.What Adobe CC, Google Chrome, MS Office, and macOS/Windows itself do with this background network connectivity is completely out of control and abusive to the user. They get away with it because the vast majority of users are non-technical and don&#39;t realize it&#39;s happening.I&#39;ve profiled and decrypted the background traffic on a stock Android install and the volume was also appalling. Getting macOS to 0 background traffic involved blackholing large Apple IP blocks at the router, whereas some of their processes use random IPs from these ranges and don&#39;t use DNS.Just as the general public doesn&#39;t have the awareness or ability to fight for their privacy rights I doubt any of this will ever be remedied."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a one paragraph claim that doesn&#39;t provide resources to show that their claim has basis. It could very well be entirely accurate, but there&#39;s no information contained here to know one way or the other.For example there have been numerous claims made previously that link ANY network traffic to a supposed invasion of privacy, but once you delve into the underlying traffic it isn&#39;t nearly as nefarious as it initially seemed.This article is telling you to &#34;open up the network monitor of your choice&#34; but network traffic and CONTENT are apples Vs. oranges, and yet we&#39;re meant to draw conclusions from that? We&#39;re meant to know Microsoft are taking your slide&#39;s content whole-hog? Isn&#39;t that yet to be determined?"</p>

It&#39;s met with some combination of indifference and lack of understanding and not-my-responsibility-ism, but I&#39;m sure that this will eventually blow up hard in some company&#39;s face - like 9-digit settlement for breach of contract, or worse things like breach of export control laws.Enterprise data security on the &#34;MS Office level&#34; at this point is like driving 60 mph on a road with no lane dividers. You just pray that you never meet a drunk driver or someone texting in oncoming traffic who suddenly swerves into your lane. You pray that none of your employees click the wrong button and bankrupt the company."</p>

I&#39;d be more physically and mentally drained at the end of each day. And I&#39;d fly out with a huge to do list. Yet there has been many heartening observations along the way.I saw a poor woman go up to the window of the frequent flyer lounge kitchen, she placed with her hands out, and the staff returned and gave her a bundle of eggs. She was so grateful.While stuck in a jam traveling between meetings, slums lined the side of the road, three kids under 5, no clothes, covered in filth, hitting a stone around with a stick with huge smiles... happiness.And last night on the way home in Mumbai I see a father and son on a dark street intersection with almost nobody around. The father laid out a tarp and the under 5 year old son was hopping and dancing around taking shoes out of the sack and placing them neatly in pairs.And then the little jobs to help people. The chaiwala and the lift attendant.And well... the food! Thank you India."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I started a company to pursue circadian lighting (called Twist) and sadly pivoted away from it as a core value proposition because of weak reception from the market.I feel we were 20 years too early (we shut down about 5 years ago).Our tech enabled smart circadian lighting (we called it adaptive lighting) without configuration, an app, or wifi. The lightbulbs worked without any smart gadgetry necessary.Every time the switch turned on the light made a 20 ms computation based on the time it stored (via a low power clock and a super cap) and turned to the right brightness and color temperature automatically. This was protected by a patent but also could not find a buyer for the tech despite how differentiated it wasNow I have an entire home with hue downlights + bulbs that does circadian lighting (with HASS as well) and while its not nearly as elegant of a solution as Twist (aforementioned startup), it is pretty great and a huge life changer to me and my fiancè.Edit: for context we use Philips Hue downlight retrofits + bulbs in other fixtures, all white ambiance, and Lutron Aurora  dimmers, connected to HASS on a RBPI, running adaptive lighting from HACS"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, Apple HomeKit + Hue has supported this for a few years (fall 2020?), they call it Adaptive Lighting, and for me this has been a killer app.It&#39;s kind of a bummer that Hue doesn&#39;t support it natively, but since I was already in the Homekit ecosystem, it was fine for me.I&#39;ve paired this with powerful Sowilo [1] light strips, which have excellent warm/daylight white range and brightness, and it&#39;s kept S.A.D. in relative check.[1] https://sowilodesign.com I&#39;m sure some people can come up with a cheaper solution via AliExpress than Sowilo&#39;s, but having a turnkey solution that integrated with Hue was essential for me."</p>

Additionally, if manufactured cells last longer in the body, patients who regularly need blood may not need transfusions as often. That would reduce iron overload from frequent blood transfusions, which can lead to serious complications.&#34;They discuss automating the process, but the costs are still likely to be high as you&#39;d need near-clean-room standards of sterility to avoid contamination problems - although that&#39;s also a problem with blood donation.  Notably, some countries (incl USA, China) allow people to sell their blood, which tends to draw in poor and desperate people who may be more at risk of having transmissible diseases:https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2018/03/plasma-...In the long run however, this might become the normal process.  Bio-synthetic blood cell production has been talked about for over 20 years, it&#39;s cool to see it actually happening.

It would become practical to keep a stock of lab-grown blood in ambulances, as it can just be rotated out when it expires, but the immediate availability of blood in the field can mean the difference between life and death.I just hope that blood donation doesn&#39;t go away as a result. There are both ethical and personal benefits - ethical, because it&#39;s a visceral experience of doing something good for society that most people can do, and with little effort; personal, because of potential health benefits from donating blood, see e.g. https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle... ."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I started moving my things out of Apple two years ago.  Two years on, I&#39;m still entrenched in a few places.  I can tell you, Apple does everything they can to keep you in.  Slow download rates, surprisingly frequent failed downloads from iCloud.com, requesting your data from Apple takes at least a week while they put it together, etc.One of last form of lock-in that I&#39;m struggling with is iCloud Photo Library.  A service that has been a blessing and a curse.  I&#39;ve been saving my photos there for the better part of a decade.I&#39;m working on getting my photos out (first by requesting my data from Apple, then from iCloud Drive on Windows) and I&#39;m appalled - everything gets dumped into one directory.  Inconsistent file naming. Timestamps not always accurate, and &#34;Date Taken&#34; seems to have disappeared from a number of my photos.  Albums are not included (unless you count them being a list dumped into a csv). All of that data is kept inside iCloud.. only for them- not for you.So what comes next is a long journey to re-organize all of my photos by year, month.  I&#39;m not even sure if my Hidden photos got copied over.This is all 100% a dark pattern to keep users locked into Apple.  How many people would get this far?  Not many- my wife would have given up at having to request her data from Apple. Then how many would stop when they find out all of your photos get dumped into a single directory (30k photos!) if you try to leave?All of this is to say, I&#39;m done with Apple.

So grab a cuppa for story time. It was a time that I worked for Microsoft, and mmm, mmm, wasn&#39;t that uncarbonated company soft drink tasty. But as I dicked with some Plays for Sure(tm) device for the last time, I got fed up and told the spouse, &#34;get in the car, we&#39;re going to BellSquare to buy iPods.&#34; iPods turned into ditching the Windows Phones for iPhones, then a hackintosh to get a feel for OS X Leopard, then &#34;fine, I&#39;ll get a MacBook if I&#39;m going to do iOS development on the side&#34;.Fast-forward fifteen years, and it&#39;s a house full of HomeKit, Apple Watches (loving that new Ultra), MacBooks, HomePods, etc. It all works well together, so it&#39;s easy to justify ditching $DEVICE for an Apple product. And when Apple Premium (one price for all of Apple&#39;s services such as TV+, iCloud storage, et. al.) came around, well, of course I said &#34;put that on the Apple Card, please.&#34;The point I&#39;m driving at is that a household of Apple products started with one simple purchase of a couple of music players. But keep up the advertising crap to the point that I&#39;m loading a non-Apple OS on Apple hardware, and that unravelling thread might take the rest with it. &#34;It all works so well together&#34; is a blessing and a curse. I&#39;m pretty sure that if, whatever the reason, we ditch the iPhones the rest of it goes with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This general trend of deteriorating UX in widespread services is extremely exhausting and depressing.The accuracy you could get with Google searches in 2005-2010-ish was amazing. Knowing how to Google was a secret weapon of computer literacy, you could find anything. Now I save links on a small server (I work on many machines) unless something is posted here on HN, as it&#39;s one of increasingly few places where I can search and actually find things.Same story with YouTube, searching for a video there has become an exercise in self flagellation.I don&#39;t know if it was Netflix that started the ball on nonsensical, avant garde categories followed by thousands of auto-playing calls to action, but combined with intrusive ads and obfuscation the day-to-day experience on mainstream internet really sucks the joy out of whatever amazing content that lurks in the cracks of what is actually a set of amazingly marvelous technology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Isn&#39;t the whole point of monospaced fonts columnar alignment (e.g. the table in the article)?  Seems like &#34;almost&#34; defeats the point.Then again, I don&#39;t see values lined up much these days:    {
      &#34;someKey&#34;:       &#34;someValue&#34;,
      &#34;someOtherKey:&#34;  &#34;someOtherValue,

and if you only care about leading whitespace (that is, the whitespace before a character appears on the line), maybe it doesn&#39;t matter how your font is spaced.I suspect numbers in these almost-mono fonts are monospaced, so numerical values should still have nice rhythm too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Stanford has now reached the point that they recently built an entire 35-acre campus just for administrators.[1] This is completely separate from the main campus and miles away.&#34;The campus provides workspace for about 2,700 employees (including three of the university’s eight vice presidents) working in critical areas such as the School of Medicine administration, libraries and archives, business affairs, human resources, development and Land, Buildings &amp; Real Estate. Stanford will be the city’s third-largest employer in Redwood City.&#34;Amenities:* Cardinal Café -- Located on the first floor of Cardinal Hall, serving globally- and regionally-inspired cuisine for breakfast and lunch.* Recreation &amp; Wellness Center -- The 28,000 square foot facility includes a six-lane rooftop pool, indoor basketball court, state-of-the-art fitness equipment, locker rooms, showers and an outdoor fitness courtyard.* Stanford Transportation* Digital Media Production Studio* Wellness and Lactation Rooms* Dry Cleaning* Pine Cone Children&#39;s Center* Stanford Catering &amp; Conferences* Stanford Federal Credit Union[1] https://redwoodcity.stanford.edu/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the US, both college education and healthcare have become enormous taxpayer wealth extraction schemes.  Everyone has a &#34;right&#34; to education and healthcare, therefore we should subsidize it with taxpayer money.  That is as far as the politics go.  We have stupidly funded the demand side of the equation to where both education and healthcare are incredibly bloated behemoths capable of absorbing all the money thrown at them.  All perfectly justified.Where the taxpayer money should have gone: on the supply side.  For example, the number of UC campuses in California should have doubled as the population doubled.   The last UC campus to open was Merced in 2005.  Before that was Irvine and Santa Cruz in 1965.  And we wonder why tuition keeps increasing?  1) Demand increases with population increase.  2) Demand increase with more people seeking 4 yr degrees.  3) Demand increases with the US subsidizing the ever living shit out of college tuition.  4) Supply stays relatively constant.Similarly Obamacare drove the demand side by subsidizing health insurance and onboarding millions of new members.  It did almost nothing on the supply side - same number of hospital beds and doctors.  Insurers and medical groups made a killing as the price of their services grew dramatically.In both cases, political stability was achieved in shoveling taxpayer money at education and healthcare without increasing competition.  This is a very clever way for existing vendors in healthcare and education to soak the government.Solution: drive prices down by investing in supply of education and healthcare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Double edged sword. What the author proposes can be found. Go to some small low endowment private or public school for less money. Oh wait, you say, I don’t want to go there! The buildings aren’t as nice, the dorms are cramped and drab, there aren’t as many resources, the food sucks, the Wi-Fi is spotty, heck even the website sucks. Why is this? Because they don’t have the human or financial resources to do so.You get what you pay for. Student and parent expectations have changed and so have college and universities. If you want what colleges used to be like 50 years ago go to a small private or public school that is just barely staying afloat, it will be more or less similar to the so called halcyon days of low cost, no frills college.The thing is—people don’t want this as voted for by their choice in school. The biggest drops in enrollment are at community colleges, state schools, and small private schools. If people were price sensitive cheap schools would have people busting down the doors to get in. They don’t. In fact, when a college lowers their tuition, they paradoxically often see a dip in enrollments.Why? Because human brains are broken. We connate price with prestige and prestige with quality.Colleges get punished if they lower the price, so what do they do instead? They increase the discount rate. Rarely do families pay the sticker price. Google any college tuition and you will see average price paid. It is typically anywhere from 50-75% of sticker price."</p>
