								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if you are a person who will never in your life end up as any kind of person of interest for the government, handing over data in this way could still be quite dangerous.Phones will often contain data that can facilitate theft and fraud if ending up in the wrong hands. If they&#39;re able to copy everything, including private data from all apps that could be quite bad. For example many countries now use apps to login to online banking, with private keys for the login stored in the app. Will that be copied? Will it ever be found out if one of the 3000 government officials with access to this data sold it on darknet markets?Maybe some months after your travel you suddenly wake up one day to find all your money transferred from your bank account to some account in Nigeria."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Terrifying for only 2 reasons:1. Any malicious person savvy enough to pull off a crime of interest to the Feds is smart enough to provide a wiped or burner phone to DHS/ICE, and they have to know this. So, what is the point in doing this if not to target law abiding citizens.2. USGOV has a spotty track record of keeping this information secure. A foreign actor is likely to access this info eventually. As one former government official once joked many years ago - concerning Chinese hacking - &#34;Well, its probably more secure in the CCP&#39;s data center, so I wouldn&#39;t worry.&#34;This is the problem when a non-technical generation makes the rules and regs. Luddites ought not be permitted to ascend the GS ranks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The killer feature of Kodi (on most hardware, for example the Raspberry Pi) is that it can switch the output resolution to match the video you are playing. It also bypasses things like ALSA in order to be able to bit-bang audio in supported formats directly to an external receiver. These are basic functions of normal video playback devices like blu-ray players or cable boxes.A Plasma skin can&#39;t do any of this. So while it&#39;s probably very suitable for things like games and photo frames on a big screen, I fear that it is disadvantaged from the start for video and audio."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having watched most of the GamersNexus video, my takeaways were:- Will maintain some stock for RMAs- Made pre-production boards for 4xxx, will not manufacture- 3080 and above are not profitable for EVGA- NVIDIA is not transparent about pricing with board manufacturers, they find out MRSP same time we do- NVIDIA limits MSRP heavily on cards so they can&#39;t do things to sell more profitable higher end cards- It sounds like (this is my takeaway from GN&#39;s description, not their words) EVGA&#39;s CEO is tired of dealing with NVIDIA, wants to refocus on family, and there isn&#39;t a clear person to replace him and hesitant to sell to people who would mistreat employees/cut corners/damage brand.- Will continue selling power supplies- No plan to work with AMD or Intel making boards, CEO sounded dismissive toward it"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"EVGA is doing what every iOS developer secretly dreams of doing whenever they have to deal with some new stupid bullshit from Apple. Respect.Also, I&#39;ve always liked EVGA. I&#39;ve bought a few of their cards over the years, and many power supplies, and I&#39;ve never had a bad experience. It seems like they really care about making quality products, which is pretty rare to see nowadays.If they start expanding into new products with the same focus on quality, that&#39;ll be a net gain for the world. Maybe they&#39;ll try making laptops again?Or maybe this is all just an elaborate power move to put pressure on Nvidia and renegotiate their relationship."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s crazy to see them go, they&#39;ve been a big name in the GPU space since as long as I can remember. If they truly don&#39;t expand into AMD GPUs or something else as they&#39;ve said, I don&#39;t see them sticking around in the long term. A bit sad, they have been a good company to their customers.I don&#39;t blame them though, it sounds like Nvidia is a PITA to deal with, and the recent pains with GPU shortages and mining have likely exacerbated it as well.My best wishes to their employees, hope they all find good work elsewhere."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think it&#39;s worth repeating: at this point, MFA that is not based on Webauthn (https://webauthn.guide/#about-webauthn) should be considered dangerously insecure. Uber almost certainly enforces MFA for remote access; I strongly suspect we&#39;ll end up hearing that it was successfully provided during the authentication step (update: screenshots on Twitter appear to confirm this). As we saw in the case of the 0ktapus campaign, a sufficiently-skilled attacker will simply proxy the MFA calls to the real identity provider in real-time, the user none the wiser.Webauthn, however, binds the authenticator to the domain and port, and requires https as the scheme. If a user gets phished, they cannot be compromised: the phisher&#39;s domain will not match and any Webauthn authentication challenge would fail.So if your workplace is letting you authenticate with SMS codes, push notifications to an app, or 6-digit codes generated by an authenticator app/hardware device, you need to start banging on pots and pans up your reporting chain to get your security team the support they need to make Webauthn + FIDO2 hardware tokens or Webauthn + Mac Touch ID happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why are people talking about MFA on this thread. Look, as someone whose day job is responding to such incidents, someone targeting Uber and is persistent will get in, MFA or not. Infostealers for Mac are a thing (Uber is a mac heavy shop I hear) and that&#39;s all it takes to steal cookies and tokens post-mfa, or why even bother with that, if you&#39;re running code just make it a reverse shell.The big screw up here is powershell script on a network share. A cheap pentest would have uncovered something like that.Modern security is not perimeter focused where you try to keep the bad guys out. Yes, you should do MFA,firewalls,vpns the whole schtick but(!!) your presumption should always be that threat actors already have a foot-hold in your network. This is very important because it helps you  focus on basic things like scripts and gpos with creds in them but also you treat internal devices the same as internet exposed devices. It&#39;s sort of what the whole &#34;zero trust&#34; thing is about as well. In other words, host/user compromise is a given but lateral movement should be at least as difficult as breaching the perimeter.But my prediction is, just like top commenters here, they will slap MFA on it and of course cleanup scripts with creds and call it fixed until the next compromise. Oh and FYI, MFA on VPNs is a PITA, that&#39;s rarely done for good reason, instead you use device certificates in addition to passwords which is what the recommendation should be not yubikeys or webauthn (vpn!=web??) because VPNs need to reconnect and you can&#39;t have people insert a yubi each time their connection drops. Ideal setup would have 7 day valid (or however long is reasonable for users to disconnect their PC and remain out of office) mutual-auth certs+ocsp getting conditionally reissued new certs to remain connected (compliance stuff like patching, unapporoved software,security alerts for the device). If you think about it, you typically issue users two yubikeys not just one so if the backup gets stolen you have a problem depending on how easy it is to social engineer users or reset their password with a good yubikey but a stolen laptop means certs+password revoked immediately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unconfirmed method of breach: https://twitter.com/hacker_/status/1570582547415068672- Socially engineer an employee to get on their VPN (could have been prevented with webauthn / hardware 2fa)- Once on VPN, scan their intranet and find a network share- Network share has powershell scripts with admin credentials for their PAM vendor, Thycotic- From there can get full access to all systems"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is so much interesting stuff going on in GPU compute that isn&#39;t crypto. I&#39;m really excited about this because there are SO MANY gpus that are now going to be cheaper than sand. There is A LOT that can be made of that and I intend to get mine. I think the crypto boom really covered up what we can really, really do with GPU compute and possibly stifled adoption and innovation but now we&#39;ve got so many just sitting around. Which is super useful as we move more into a world after being able to get things manufactured and shipped world wide in what feels like an instant."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like this list, I like that Sketch is #2, and #1 is an OSS self-hostable solution, https://penpot.app/ -- https://github.com/penpot so we can&#39;t quite get burned like we did with Figma.From some cursory review, it seems pretty good! And there&#39;s now effort underway to be able to import Figma files.edit: okay, I&#39;ve gotten signed up with penpot, made rudimentary sketches, it seems solid and promising. I&#39;m now a fan and I think this seals the deal for me, I&#39;m glad that it was an easy decision. And I will give them the benefit of the doubt when it&#39;s not exactly up to par because 1) they seem to be new and characterize themselves as still being in beta and 2) it&#39;s self-hostable OSS and the inherent security of this offering is something I value deeply."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since 2012, through the eras of Photoshop, Sketch, InVision, XD, Figma, and whatever else, I&#39;ve been using Antetype: https://www.antetype.comFor me, it&#39;s been a 10x tool since it was always the only piece of software that was designed from the ground up as a UI design tool, rather than being some other kind of app that was pressed into service for UI design. Auto-layout, responsiveness, and flexible components that can be edited per instance without breaking their link to the master component are all features that were present from day one rather than being awkwardly bolted on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really wish OmniGroup had the vision and resources to bring OmniGraffle into some kind of shared collaborative editing world, whether by developing a web app, or incorporating some kind of collaborative, versioned backend for &#34;corporate&#34; users.It has one of the best overall general diagramming/graph layout engines and UI of anything I&#39;ve used on the desktop and web. My experience in the diagramming, layout and technical-ish drawing realm includes Figma, as well as Illustrator, Photoshop, Pagemaker, Freehand, Deneba Canvas, Mac Draw Pro.I still love Omnigraffle for flow charts, presentations, UML diagrams, and UI wireframes. It&#39;s not a 1:1 replacement for Figma, but it suits many of the same problems.But its existence as a solo, mac-only, desktop-only app relegates it to my personal projects and I can never use it fully at work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"* I far, far, far prefer Craigslist interface to anything else in that space. It&#39;s clear and focusedIts search engine too - I get things I search for in the area I search for.For me, Kijiji and Facebook marketplace are awful UI, awful distractions, and give me 10,000 &#34;suggested&#34; or &#34;fuzzy searched&#34; things in random order, suppressing things I&#39;m actually looking for. And I&#39;ve completely given up on eBay over last decade.However.* Nothing is on Craigslist anymore in my area (Greater Toronto Area). Until about... 5-6 years ago, I could find comparable number of photography, computer, music &amp; kids stuff on Craigslist and Kijiji. Today, Craigslist is a desert, a void, an oasis of empty search results.So network effect wins, as always :-/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My problem with Craigslist isn&#39;t that it looks old, the problem is that they seemingly refuse to modernize anything else about the site. Craigslist is chock full of spam and people abusing the search feature. I&#39;m no anti-spam guru, but surely there is a way to cut down on people submitting the same thumbnail dozens of times using as many keywords as they can so their cellphone screen repair service shows up when looking for just about anything.Craig is no saint, and actively goes after any competition to his site. That, coupled with the complacency or refusal to go after spammers leaves me with a very sour opinion of the platform and Craig himself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate FB Marketplace.It&#39;s actively hostile to buyers.Like, try to find a &#34;kinda nice&#34; bicycle. You can&#39;t find the bicycle category  (though it does exist as a sub-group of Sporting Goods), you can&#39;t just say &#34;show me bikes&#34; unless you hack the URL, you can search for the word &#34;bicycle&#34; but for some reason people selling a &#34;Specialized Rockhopper&#34; think you know it&#39;s a bicycle so don&#39;t use that word.Oh, and when selling, they just suggest random categories instead of letting you choose from their heirarchy. So you get bicycles in Hobbies. You get them in Sporting Goods. You get them in Bicycles. But... You can&#39;t search for them by type.That&#39;s not even complaining about the lack of attributes, like &#34;type=BMX&#34; or &#34;type=Mountain&#34; or &#34;Size=Large&#34; or &#34;Frame Material=Carbon Fiber&#34;... all of which are in Craigslist and eBay.And! when searching, they actively work to inject ebay-like selling (non-local) into the mix by resetting my distance preferences every time I change the search. &#34;Find bicycles&#34; -&gt; &#34;Find bicycles in 30 miles&#34; -&gt; &#34;Find &#39;Specialized Rockhopper&#39;&#34; -&gt; Why am I getting &#34;Ships To You&#34; results?! Why am I getting non-bicycle results?! Oh. They reset my distance again.^-- BTW they do this because they actually make money when the sale happens through FB. If you just buy it in-person with cash they don&#39;t get a cut. Misaligned incentives, as they say.And! even if I do find the bicycle category, if narrow the category by searching with a word in there, like &#34;Rockhopper&#34; it takes me out of the bicycle category to do the search!G. A. R. B. A. G. E."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read these articles sometimes about crypto games, but they all never seem to describe the actual game, it’s like crypto is the primary concern, and game is secondary, and i’m getting the distinct impression none of these games are any fun and everyone in the space has to avoid mentioning it.I think that the people writing these things only have a very slim grasp of gaming, but they know it would be a good market to capture"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; What Went Wrong?It&#39;s in the title of the article. It&#39;s a &#34;Blockchain Game&#34;. That&#39;s what went wrong. It was a flawed concept from its inception. Blockchains are pretty cool from a math/cryptography standpoint, but they really do not provide added value in most areas people try to apply them to.CryptoKitties is a digital trading card game. You get cards, you can &#34;breed&#34; cards together to make new cards, you trade/buy/sell cards. That&#39;s it. Nowhere at any point in this &#34;game&#34; is a blockchain necessary. Nowhere at any point does a blockchain add any value whatsoever. In fact, due to transaction fees, I&#39;d argue the blockchain actively detracts from the game.The idea of an artist signing their work in a cryptographically unique way is not new or revolutionary, and it certainly doesn&#39;t need a blockchain. There&#39;s a reason the general sentiment the art community has towards NFTs is overwhelmingly negative: it&#39;s because they literally actively harm us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I don&#39;t see addressed in this article is that as far as I know, it&#39;s basically impossible to trust the reported price or volume of NFT transactions, because there&#39;s no way to distinguish fake wash trades from real ones.So it&#39;s hard to draw any conclusions about whether the data reflects an actual peak in user activity, or just a peak in scams."</p>

However, please note that these tests are also being revised shortly after some brief feedback [1]:- The sendfile tests at the end actually didn&#39;t use sendfile, so expect much greater performance there.- All the Caddy tests had metrics enabled, which are known[2] to be quite slow currently. Nginx does not emit metrics in its configuration, so in that sense the tests are a bit uneven. From my own tests, when I remove metrics code, Caddy is 10-20% faster. (We&#39;re working on addressing that [3].)- The tests in this article did not tune reverse proxy buffers, which are 4KB by default. I was able to see moderate performance improvements (depending on the size of payload) by reducing the buffer size to 1KB and 2KB.I want to thank Tyler for his considerate and careful approach, and for all the effort put into this![0]: https://caddy.community/t/seeking-performance-suggestions-fo...[1]: https://twitter.com/mholt6/status/1570442275339239424 (thread)[2]: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/issues/4644[3]: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/pull/5042"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like we never see HAProxy in these reverse proxy comparisons. Lots of nginx, Apache, Caddy, Traefik, Envoy, etc.The HAProxy configuration is just as simple as Caddy for a reverse proxy setup. It&#39;s also written in C which is a comparison the author makes between nginx and Caddy. And it seems to be available on every *nix OS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote up a few notes on my Caddy setup here https://muxup.com/2022q3/muxup-implementation-notes#serving-... which may be a useful reference if you have a static site and wanted to tick off a few items likely on your list (brotli, http3, cache-control, more fine-grained control on redirects).I don&#39;t think performance is ever going to matter for my use case, but one thing I think is worth highlighting is the quality of the community and maintainership. In a thread I started asking for feedback on my Caddyfile (https://caddy.community/t/suggestions-for-simplifying-my-cad...), mholt determined I&#39;d found a bug and rapidly fixed it. I followed up with a PR (https://github.com/caddyserver/website/pull/264) for the docs to clarify something related to this bug which was reviewed and merged within 30 minutes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"from the article,&gt;&gt;As much as we love exciting new features, we also want to see people create games on the full spectrum of devices for everyone to enjoy.This is one of the main attitudes of the Godot team I really appreciate a lot. It might be easy for people in more developed nations to upgrade their hardware every few years, but there&#39;s people still playing games running on computers from 2002 and before. I used to know of a player who used to play (an old MMORPG) games on a computer he aimed a table fan at to keep it cool. The whole casing was open, it was kinna funny to look at it and it had hardware he got as a birthday gift more than 10 years ago. He played that old MMORPG because newer games wouldn&#39;t even start on that old thing. But most people who played that MMO were in the same boat, it was one of the very few ones they could run.The requirements for some of the games coming out these days is sometimes so insane a lot of people from around the world are unable to play them. I always found it funny how we had so much developer time wasted on supporting ie6 because a small percentage of people were unable to upgrade their browsers, but when it comes to gaming, all bets were off and you are now expected to spend a few grand a year on upgrading your computer to play newer games. And don&#39;t get me started on the bandwidth costs to play some of the new games."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I played with Godot back in the early 3.x timeframe (3.1? 3.2?) and then fell away and spent some time with Unity. But between some of Unity&#39;s missteps and Godot getting dotnet 6 support it is time to give it another go, plus a bunch of nice changes to gdscript that might make it something I&#39;m okay with using (functions are first class citizens now unlike before where you just passed the name of the function as a string which always felt incredibly gross).Though based on the discord conversation there are still a lot of bumps even in the beta so I would not expect smooth sailing yet, but lets see if it is any good.For anyone interested, the main documentation on their site is still pointing at 3.x. If you want the docs for 4.0 start herehttps://docs.godotengine.org/en/latest/index.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HN hug of death? godotengine.org is offline for me at the moment. Regardless, really looking forward to trying it out! Here it is on the wayback machine:https://web.archive.org/web/20220915181526/https://godotengi..."</p>
