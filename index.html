								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I greatly respect the initiative and scrappy-ness of someone doing this.  And the legacy providers are clearly sitting on their monopoly position in a way that makes their pathetic alternative so starkly unattractive.But isn&#39;t it also true that once his network grows above a certain customer base (and gets into the maintenance phase), he will start to see all the effects that eat into being able to do this cheaply?Namely:-- customers who don&#39;t behave as well or kindly as before-- customers who need 24 hour customer service-- maintenance that can&#39;t be done himself, and he has to employ people-- customers and vendors who sue you for breach of contract, or other simply nuisance lawsuits-- upgrading the network to the next technology requirement, or when he&#39;s unable to get 2nd-hand parts so cheaply, etc.-- or a natural disaster that unexpectedly forces replacement of (and charging for) equipment that wasn&#39;t anticipated in the original subscriber priceMaybe none of this rises to the level of making it fundamentally different or unsustainable?  But it seems to me the honeymoon phase doesn&#39;t last long, and it&#39;s got to hit some unavoidable realities soon.   At least, if you think you can replicate this, it requires finding people and neighbors who are willing to do actual work and investment/concern to make something like this possible, and not simply pay a vendor a premium to phone it in.  It must be treated like a neighbor-to-neighbor community project, not a faceless commercial transaction with its attendant obligations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple of fun facts about this guy:His little ISP is AS267, which is a SHOCKINGLY low number. That&#39;s like.. the ISP equiv of a 4 digit slashdot id, or owning something like sodapop.com.He&#39;s also one of the authors of RFC 5575, which is a pretty big deal in the DDoS world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I have at least two homes where I have to build a half-mile to get to one house,&#34; Mauch said, noting that it will cost &#34;over $30,000 for each of those homes to get served.&#34;That&#39;s over $11 per feet. That sounds about right. I paid $18 per feet to have a private fiber optic line of 1000 feet installed at one of my houses (in the US), going down a very long driveway, with 3 patch panels, 2 at each end and one in the middle at a gate. That was just for my LAN, not internet access. I needed the link to hook up intercoms and security cameras. I absolutely wanted 100% reliability of the network link, so wireless solutions wouldn&#39;t have been adequate. The previous homeowner had buried a cat5e line in the first 500 feet, with a cat5e repeater (underground), but its electronics failed after a couple years and its exact location couldn&#39;t be found. And he had not even put the cable in conduit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was super confused by this since to the best of my knowledge SFSafariViewController blocks anything like this, you, as a developer, cannot inject anything or peak into the view it creates. Then I got to the bottom and realized I was correct, but FB/Meta/IG/etc aren&#39;t using SFSafariViewController and instead using the older ways to embed a web view.Honestly I thought all other methods had been deprecated and had no idea apps could still make use of the less secure (for the user) options. Trust me, as a developer I&#39;ve wanted to reach inside a SFSafariViewController many times to make my life easier but in the end I&#39;ve just grumbled and assumed it&#39;s not possible and worked around it.I wish there was a privacy-safe way to get the best of both worlds but due to bad actors I doubt that will be possible. I need to look more into App-bound domains but I don&#39;t think even that will give me what I really wish for (a way for the page loaded in SFSafariViewController to tell my app something). Something like postMessage support for SFSafariViewController would be amazing and be safe privacy-wise I think since the contained page would need to support sending/receiving messages instead of just having code injected against their will."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Only Instagram? Every app maker who makes an in app browser can see what you do, that’s the point of embedding it. And why not? You arrive there because of a link in the container app you clicked on. They want to see what you do with the link they gave you. Otherwise only Google/Apple can see what you do with it. Someone can see what you do with the link no matter what."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a consultant, I come around a bit.I have seen many companies with very poor productivity, and in zero of those cases was it laziness of the employees. In fact they usually would have loved to be more productive. Nobody wants to spend their life being dead weight.But as companies grow they install more and more rules and regulations that end up making sure nothing ever gets done. It is not unusual to meet &#34;developers&#34; whose company calendar is 80% filled with meetings. Well no wonder they don&#39;t get anything done!Also remember that this is only half the problem. The other half is that agile makes you iterate through pseudo productivity before you actually understood the problem, accumulating cruft that you need to maintain and extend as you go on. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if of the productivity that is left, more than half gets wasted on crufty software structures and writing code before you understood the problem.And then nobody wants to throw code away that turned out to be not what we need. Wasting yet more productivity on working around bad decisions from before we knew what we are actually building."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By the end of my employment at Google I was not working very hard.  Probably a few hours a day, mostly doing whatever I felt like doing.  My managers consistently gave me &#34;meets expectations&#34; regardless of how much I achieved or how hard I worked.  However, any time there was an emergency related to my function, I had everything required to jump in, fix serious problems, and then get out of the way during the cleanup then contributing my bit to the postmortem.  
I could tell there were very few (fewer all the time) people who truly understand google prod, and in that sense, the company seems to be OK with paying top salaries to people who can prevent the company losing lots of money, or other critical prod issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it’s not the employees fault, but the management who hired them… or maybe it’s the fact that it takes forever to get anything done at FAANG nowadays.Or maybe, just maybe, interviewing based on esoteric computer science problems isn’t the best way to identify high performing builders.. but a great way of identifying people who can hack a process to secure maximal reward.Look, if I can ‘crack the coding interview’, then I can certainly crack ‘how to do as little work as possible and stack paper to the ceiling while my stock vests’.I wonder when the last time was that Mark or Sundar actually wrote any code they pushed to prod."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m looking at https://docs.astro.build/en/concepts/why-astro/ and I still can&#39;t tell what&#39;s interesting and unique about this as compared to other options in this space.I acknowledge that this might be a PEBKAC situation, but I&#39;d love to hear thoughts from people who used Next.js, Remix, or whatever and found Astro to be a revelation.It seems like Astro&#39;s creators believe &#34;content-focused&#34; is a differentiator, but I find that confusing since content-focused sites are a popular use case for web frameworks that are also suitable for more complex apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used Astro recently to rebuild my personal website/portfolio, and I really enjoyed it. I&#39;m not a frontend dev and I quickly get overwhelmed by all of the choices and the breakneck speed that the web ecosystem changes at. Astro was exactly what I needed. It&#39;s optimized for spending most of your time writing content in markdown, but it gives you complete freedom to seamlessly add web code of any complexity you like. MDX is just markdown plus custom components, and Astro lets you drop in stuff from React, Vue or Angular, so you&#39;re not restricted to whatever components you can find for the single framework that you choose at the beginning of your project. Everything possible is made static. I found it to be pretty intuitive and I don&#39;t feel boxed in by it. This is how I want to make (frontend-only) websites in the future.My biggest issues using it (admittedly in the beta state) were 1) wrong line numbers printed for errors due to extensive rewriting and transpilation without source mappings and 2) no built-in image optimization (there is a third-party tool that works well enough, but for a content-first framework this doesn&#39;t seem good enough to me).[Edit]: Ah, I see in the 1.0 they have built-in image optimization :) I&#39;ll have to try that out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sometimes all the frameworks that re-invent MVC (but in a detached fashion) and tout &#34;server side rendering&#34; just feel like we&#39;ve come full circle where we&#39;re just serving a static view cache that was generated from models and data using a controller.The big difference here (as with other JavaScript-based renderers) is of course the &#34;use one tool/language for everything&#34; aspect which to me is a bit of a &#39;meh&#39;-benefit.At this point, while all the renderers get better and simpler, we&#39;re still in a situation where complexity or writing code hasn&#39;t really gone away, it just shifted around to new places. Perhaps at some point we get to the HTML + WebComponents stage again (kinda like MDX and React mixing), and classic Apache Server-Side Includes become the new hot thing again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Someone reading this may disagree with abortion. But if we can separate the controversy of the topic at hand from the fact a state government requested data from a private company for what is not universally considered a crime it could lead to a pragmatic discussion into data requests and privacy (i.e questionable practice of &#39;emergency data requests&#39; that function outside the normal process of a subpoena[1])[1]: https://krebsonsecurity.com/2022/03/hackers-gaining-power-of..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real issue I have is that Facebook keeps an unencrypted copy of everyone&#39;s DMs stored and just waiting to be handed to the government. I understand it&#39;s how they make money, and that they&#39;ve done it forever, but man, I guess using Signal has spoiled me. It&#39;s so weird to me that most people are completely unaware or unworried that their &#34;private&#34; conversations aren&#39;t private in the slightest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story leaves out some details: https://nypost.com/2022/08/09/nebraska-mom-and-daughter-char...&gt; When an investigator interviewed the teen, she allegedly confirmed that she had a miscarriage after midnight on April 22, and said that she and her mother placed the fetus in a bag in the back of their van, according to the court papers.&gt; Jessica and Celeste also said that Barnhill, whose relationship to the two women has not been revealed, later helped them bury the fetus on his property.&gt; Police were led to the makeshift gravesite and unearthed the corpse, which was found to show signs of “thermal injuries,” the documents stated.&gt; Barnhill reportedly confirmed to the investigators that the mother and daughter had attempted to burn the fetus before putting it in the ground.My opinion might be a bit contrarian, but I was always taught that Roe v Wade was because abortions had become so unsafe without a proper place to do them. I imagine in this case we&#39;re missing some details, because the actual abortion involved sourcing some pills that are specifically used for abortion. I don&#39;t imagine sourcing those was quick. My read on this set of circumstances is that if you put arbitrary blockers on something that someone really wants to do, it course corrects them into a very unhealthy path. In this case, the details are shocking, but not incongruent with what I have been told was the reasoning for Roe v Wade and true to other harm reduction logic.It&#39;s awful easy to argue post-facto that she could just have given birth, but I think that ignores a lot of changes and sacrifices a woman at 17-18 years old will have to endure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have noticed that a lot of/majority of  &#34;regular people&#34; tend to coast along on the back of others as a way of life. If &#34;smart people&#34; are perceived by friends and family as being problem solvers, many will route their problems to a &#34;smart friend&#34;, someone who seems to have their life somewhat in order or always have the answer to everything. I used to get an endless stream of requests for everything from technical help, legal/financial advice, help planning vacation, help making decisions on purchases, career advice and help fixing their &#34;failed to launch&#34; kids, really often far exceeding simply asking for an opinion, folks effectively transfer ownership of their problems to you for you to fix.Of course they may praise you for this and perhaps you get addicted to this positive feedback, but it comes at a high cost, especially as you can end up spending so much effort on &#34;friends&#34; that you neglect to solve or even recognize your own problems.I have come to realize recently that I don&#39;t actually have any friends, only dependents. Declining to take ownership of people&#39;s problems caused basically all of them to more or less cut off contact with me (maybe I get a text once a year or something), but I am so much happier now that I ever was before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many people conflate hedonistic pleasure with happiness. This is a big mistake that leads to addiction, selfishness and inevitable dissatisfaction. Even happiness as a sustainable state may be an unrealistic or unattainable goal. For me the answer to this puzzle is a finely tuned balance between self growth and contentment with perhaps a heavier emphasis on contentment. Regular and consistent periods of reflection and appreciation for what you have (no matter how small) is the recipe for promoting states of contentment. Pleasure is ephemeral, happiness comes and goes but contentment can be reliably and directly cultivated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not especially smart, or happy, but, personally, I don&#39;t know how to be it, or what it feels like. I know pleasure, but being in a constant pleasurable state is not what is meant by happiness as far as I know.Slavoj Žižek (someone who does seem to be especially smart):“Happiness was never important. The problem is that we don&#39;t know what we really want. What makes us happy is not to get what we want. But to dream about it. Happiness is for opportunists. So I think that the only life of deep satisfaction is a life of eternal struggle, especially struggle with oneself. If you want to remain happy, just remain stupid. Authentic masters are never happy; happiness is a category of slaves.”"</p>

Way less takeout, avoiding toll roads unless it saves at least 30 minutes, fewer streaming services (will renew on a show-by-show basis), and food is getting so crazy I might start going to multiple stores to try and save money instead of my one consolidated trip to Wegmans.I&#39;m also stuffing my freezer with meat and have a year&#39;s supply of non-perishables, not because I&#39;m a prepper but because I know it&#39;ll be so much more expensive next year as to be worth it.Also my rent is up 6.9%, but that&#39;s because I locked it in for two years.  Would have been 10.5% for a one-year lease, and that&#39;s on top of last year&#39;s comparatively conservative 4.5% increase.And my salary is up a mere 4.5%, and that only because I took on stretch assignments at work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For people interested in this topic I can recommend &#34;Can Applications Recover from fsync Failures?&#34; by A. Rebello et al[1]. The paper analyzes how file systems and PostgreSQL, LMDB, LevelDB, SQLite, and Redis react to fsync failures. It shows that although applications use many failure-handling strategies, none are sufficient: fsync failures can cause catastrophic outcomes such as data loss and corruption.- [1] https://www.usenix.org/conference/atc20/presentation/rebello"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recommend the excellent articles by the SQLite authors themselves likeHow To Corrupt An SQLite Database File: https://www.sqlite.org/howtocorrupt.htmlAtomic Commit In SQLite: https://www.sqlite.org/atomiccommit.htmland more under the &#34;Technical and Design Documentation&#34; section of their docs at https://www.sqlite.org/docs.htmlThey go into the details of challenges SQLite faces due to how hardware and OSs work or not work and how they solve them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t get me wrong, I run SQLite in production with millions of records, but it seems people have discovered it just very recently.
All of the sudden, there&#39;s always a post about it with hundreds of comments.What changed?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think Apple&#39;s official code signing tool is also open source? https://github.com/Apple-FOSS-Mirror/security_systemkeychain...xar is another tool for codesigning Mac installer packages, which runs on Linux. I&#39;ve used it successfully in the past.https://users.wfu.edu/cottrell/productsign/productsign_linux..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is so fantastic. I wouldn&#39;t have believed it was possible had I not seen it here. I maintain multiple old OSX machines solely for this purpose; migrating to Linux for this step makes me feel so much safer for my CI build systems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only thing left to solve is to actually build cross platform. You can do with rust cross but you have to build your own docker images on macos first since apple licensing prohibits redistribution of binaries. It would save us so much money in github CI minutes."</p>
