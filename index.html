								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People should understand this:A free tier is a loss-leader, intended to support sales of the paid product.If too many “…have been happily using Slack’s free plan for years”, then Slack will have to change the terms.Generally, storage and access to storage cost money. If you aren’t paying for it, it is definitely temporary, whether anyone says it explicitly or not. I don’t just mean in a “nothing lasts forever” way, but that it will gone in the relatively short term. This is just reality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting (and sad) how the forums of yesteryear have essentially gone away entirely, with no good solutions popping up to replace them. I know they were/are incredibly prone to security issues, but they were good at one thing and one thing only: community.I recall spending a crazy amount of time refreshing the index on a site called TradeGamesNow (and to a lesser degree CheapAssGamer) waiting for new posts/comments. Now every site on the web either has a Subreddit (too much tertiary noise), Discord (I&#39;m terrified of making a post on the wrong server by accident), or (to a lesser degree) Slack (limited features, as noted in the article).As to the Slack announcement: I get that guests staying in your house for free eat not-free food. That being said, I have to imagine that Slack could offer a non-real-time updating experience (no polling, disable calls/video/file hosting) to cut down on costs (my assumption is that the active nature of the service is the biggest expense) and make it feasible for a free or $5/mo for X users &amp; unlimited guests.(I&#39;m aware that Discourse was Supposed To Be The Chosen One, but at $100/mo and no self-hosting option (that I can see), I don&#39;t think it&#39;s even considered much. But I could be wrong.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An example of the company making the world better (for its investors):1. Destroy low-maintenance forums and IRC (often fully owned by their owners) by providing &#39;better&#39; and more convenient services, let them &#39;own&#39; a virtual channel and a promise (no public history in order to force the creation of more accounts, paid for by investors but that&#39;s a detail)2. discontinue or make free plans unusable in order to force users to pay and bring investors huge profits3. sell the company and live your life, laughing at the stupidity of the users who now have no history and no money"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I want more costcos.To people who don&#39;t know, part of the core of Costco&#39;s business model is curation, which leads to customer trust.  I know that almost any product that I buy at costco is going to be high quality.  I know that anything with a kirkland brand on it is going to be so high quality and so cheap that it feels like I found a cheat.What&#39;s funny about costco is that their in store experience is so good that they have seemingly ignored any sort of online presence.  Yeah they have a website, but it doesn&#39;t seem to actually have a comprehensive list of everything they sell.  You have to go to the store and check out what they have (and get a hot dog or a piece of pizza while you&#39;re there)If there was a delivery app that curated restaurants, I would absolutely love it, and I also think it would be really successful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean, why not?Companies like Unilever have been doing this for far longer than anyone in the restaurant space. Churn out thousands of brands that supposedly &#34;compete&#34; with each other in the marketplace. If one of those brands has a reputation problem, shut it down and replace it. Rinse and repeat.If the practice is distasteful, then change the law, but beware the lobbyists."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just can&#39;t believe that aggregator sites would be gamed by bad actors... Shocked, I tell you.Also, on all of these delivery services I desperately just want a &#34;no cloud kitchens&#34; option. I want to support local businesses — actual restaurants. It&#39;s annoying having to research any new place I want to try to make sure it&#39;s not operated out of the back side of some warehouse.(Also: &#34;Curate,&#34; don&#39;t aggregate. It&#39;s a little more expensive and requires actual knowledge, which is why no one wants to do it. But then you actually become a service people can trust.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel the need to defend Finnish cases. Yes, they have a gazillion, but unlike other languages you might know (eg Latin or German), there’s nothing difficult about Finnish cases.Most cases are simply used where English would use prepositions. In Finnish those are postfixes instead, a bunch of letters tacked onto the end of a word. It’s a case and not a word because there’s no space between the two, that’s it.Eg “talo” means house. Talossa means “in the house”. Talon means “of the house” (actually, “the house’s” - omg English has cases too, super difficult). Talolla means “on (top of) the house”. That’s not harder than prepositions is it?I did cheat a bit, because with some words you first got to find the root before you can tack on “-ssa”. The root of talo is also talo, but for some words you got to apply a (simple, purely letter-based) rule. Eg the root of “ankka” (duck) is “anka” so “the duck’s house” becomes “ankan talo”. There’s a bunch of rules to find the root of a noun and you can learn them in half an hour or so.There’s plenty stuff that’s harder about Finnish (notably the vocabulary), but the cases are peanuts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It should be Japanese, of course!Japanese can be written using either the Latin alphabet, or Chinese characters.  The two most common writing systems in the world.  It can also be written with its own elegant and purely phonetic writing system.  There&#39;s even Braille, Morse code, and sign language encodings.  It is truly media agnostic.Japanese has a regular grammar.  From a linguist&#39;s perspective, aside from the politeness system, it&#39;s really quite normal for a language.  Very little in it to surprise a Finnish, Turkish or Korean speaker.   (Unlike English, which if first discovered today spoken by a people in the interior of New Guinea, would lead to accusations of a linguistic hoax.)Finally, some 40% of Japanese vocabulary is based on Chinese, and Chinese and Japanese technical terms flow freely between the languages to this day.  Another ~20% of Japanese vocabulary is borrowed from European languages like English or Portuguese.  The majority of the world already speaks a significant amount of Japanese and they don&#39;t even know it!  For this reason, Chinese, European, and American, alike, usually find it quite easy to learn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You got me until the first point&#34;It is an essentially logical language. The rules are absolute and reliable in all situations, except exceptions.&#34;&#34;except exceptions?!&#34; whoa..! the brought back memories from learning German.perkele!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve seen so much anti-car, pro-walkability, pro-transit, pro-bikeability sentiment online recently.I really hope this is proof of the younger generations -- Millenials, Zoomers, and younger folks even -- waking up to the idea that the USA in particular has become a toxic environment thanks to cars. WFH was a big wakeup call, I think -- once you step away from the commute for a year or two, trying to sit in traffic again seems insane. I guess it&#39;s a successful &#34;unboiling of the frog,&#34; where we realized that car infratructure has been turned up for the last century to unbearable levels.I hate cars. I don&#39;t want to use them on a daily basis. I&#39;m cheap, and I don&#39;t want to own one, or maintain one. I try to do everything I can by biking or walking, or transit if those aren&#39;t feasible. It is nearly impossible in 95% of the USA.Selfishly, I really want the USA to bring city centers back to livable levels by banning most cars and redesigning them for humans. Otherwise I&#39;m absolutely going to end up moving to Europe eventually -- likely the Netherlands -- because driving a car is just so unpleasant for me. I&#39;d rather not learn a whole new language and leave my family and friends so far behind, but especially since covid I&#39;ve come to realize that driving makes me miserable, and I need other ways to get from my home into the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love the car and car culture. I&#39;ve road tripped across the U.S. and live in an RV. I will never go back to living in an apartment. There&#39;s no human connection there. I spent years living in apartments and maybe met one or two people, with no meaningful connections ever developed. Cars are great for road tripping, and America is highly optimized for it. You can, with the same vehicle, without unpacking once, travel from the Atlantic ocean to the Pacific ocean in a matter of days. You can visit the mountains, beaches, camp in hundreds of national and state parks (for cheap or free).In Florida, some of my fondest memories was jumping into two cars with my teenage friends and riding out the one hour drive to Daytona, where we&#39;d drive our car literally on the beach and then plop down right next to it, sneaking sips of Natural Light that we illegally smuggled there between sessions of football and boogey boarding. Then we&#39;d get back in the car and be back before curfew.All of our vacations were to the Smokey Mountains, a mere 9 hour drive from central Florida. Dad would drive overnight in our minivan while us kids slept in the back seats. We&#39;d pull up to a cabin first thing in the morning and excitedly rush to our claim our beds for the few days we&#39;d be staying there. Despite sleeping a little rough in the car, we were more than energized by the newness of the locale and the existence of elevation we were quite unfamiliar with back home on the relatively flat peninsula, and we&#39;d proceed to hike the woods around the cabin to survey the land.Plenty of human and natural connection is to be had with your own vehicle in America. And I wouldn&#39;t have it any other way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always thought it was strange when people would say &#34;The automobile represent freedom&#34;. I grew up in a &#34;streetcar suburb&#34; and later moved to a big city. So for me, cars were always viewed as an expensive annoyance you might need depending on your life circumstances, but certainly not something you&#39;d go out of your way to buy unless you needed it.But as I got older and lived briefly in a suburb of Houston TX it finally clicked: the way so many subdivisions are planned you are quite literally trapped inside your subdivision unless you have a vehicle. Need to buy groceries? Get to school? Go hang out with friends? You need a car. You aren&#39;t heading anywhere interesting without one.So I get why people have a romanic idea of the automobile, but that romance is a side-effect of poor urban planning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"At a company I worked for we had a strong incentive program to submit patent applications for our work, where each listed inventor would receive a monetary payment of ~$2-3k if the patent was deemed worthy and filed by our lawyers, and an additional bonus if it was granted some years later.The problem is the patent applications would flood in from employees with the hopes that the non-technical lawyers would miss some due diligence like finding prior art. Worst case is you wasted a bit of time on the application, best case is you just made an easy $3k.Now the company was not a patent troll, so I don&#39;t recall hearing about any instances of them actually suing anyone over patents. But it still opened my eyes to how ridiculous the software patent process really is. You don&#39;t have to create anything, write any code, or even be the brightest engineer with a unique idea. You just need to get that idea past enough people. The entire industry is a scam for money, no matter which end of it you&#39;re on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Or, maybe this is just a new “fad” for juvenile orcas that could go out of fashion as they grow up, Jared Towers, director of Canadian research organization Bay Cetology, tells NPR. In the 1990s, scientists observed another strange orca trend, but it has since faded away.&gt; &#34;They&#39;d kill fish and just swim around with this fish on their head,&#34; Towers tells NPR. &#34;We just don&#39;t see that anymore.”Imagining the behavioral / fashion trends of Orcas over time is really fascinating :D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article mentions it. One of the most mind-blowing facts is that there has never been a recorded human death caused by an Orca.There are many possible explanations for it, selective eaters, not tasty, knowing what they are getting themselves into.At the same time they are curious, playful, and it seems emotional, if they have trends like breaking boats &amp; carrying dead fish. It&#39;s a miracle such playfulness never ever accidentally killed a human.After Sperm whales they have the largest brains in the world. Of course big sections of that is dedicated to their complicated bodily functions. But I think we are most likely severely underestimating their intelligence.Edit: &#34;a recorded human death in the wild&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is at least one well-documented case of a pod of orcas understanding enough about people and boats for them to to initiate a mutually-beneficial and reciprocal understanding of how to cooperate in hunting whales.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Killer_whales_of_Eden,_New_Sou...Given this, I think it is conceivable that these orcas may have achieved some sort of understanding of fishing boats as competing with them for their food, and developed a hostility towards boats as a result.IIRC, not all orca pods hunt whales or other marine mammals, and many are generally fish eaters. I would not be at all comfortable in a life raft or similar boat in the presence of orcas that do hunt seals or emperor penguins."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dear DuckDuckGo,Please let me pay for this service.  It looks worth having and: 1) I&#39;d like to know that it is funded by users, rather than advertisers and thus can resist privacy invasion presuures. 2) I&#39;d like to have some basis for belief that it will be around longer than it takes the VC money to run out, (or the marketing budget, or whatever non-sustainable pot it comes from)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prompting the user to install a browser extension to use an email forwarder looks like a dark pattern to me.This lowers my trust in DDG.It&#39;s the same approach all companies use, once they grow. &#34;Everyone is telling you they are the good guys, but they are throwing invasive technology at you! Fight back! ... by installing our invasive technology! Trust us, we are the good guys!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did a little digging into the source and discovered that every email sent by your email alias to your main email, includes a password capable of deactivating that email alias. Imagine you want to forward an email sent to you through an alias, to someone else. You&#39;ve now given that person control over your email alias.Every email from an email alias includes a link. That link is used to look at the details of that email alias and gives you the option to deactivate it. You&#39;d think there would be some login verification to prevent just anyone from using that link, but no, anyone that has this link, can now deactivate your email alias. The password itself is formatted in json, compressed with deflate, and simply tacked on to the end of the link&#39;s URL. When you click on the link, the destination webpage takes the end of the URL, decompresses the deflate, and serves a deactivate button to deactivate the email alias. When you click on that button, the email alias&#39;s address and password are sent to DDG&#39;s API and your email alias is disabled."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have always had an introverted nature. As a child, I would immerse myself for hours reading a book or other solitary activity. When my parents sent me to my room for punishment, they found it didn&#39;t work as I would not be begging to come out.But at different times of my life, I have been quite active socially. My college years especially were filled with social interactions that I grew to enjoy. It started out as friends and roommates dragging me to one thing or another, but after a while I instigated a lot of it.But I naturally gravitated to a career in programming where I can spend 10 hours straight at the keyboard with almost no interaction. My hobby project is a major one that deals with a whole new way to manage data. It has consumed several years of my life as I spend a great deal of my &#39;free time&#39; thinking about it, writing code, or optimizing something.My introverted nature has affected my family life as I withdraw into my own little world. My wife sometimes wonders if I am depressed, unhappy, or stressed. Although I am perfectly content, I have to force myself to come out of my shell and interact much more with the wife and kids (and friends and neighbors). Many of my fellow programmers that I have worked with over the years also exhibit some of these tendencies.I guess it is debatable whether this adds to or subtracts from actual creativity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s kind of easy to take this extremely literally and pick it apart, which a lot of comments here are doing, but might be helpful to broaden what “solitude” means and maybe even read it as though it’s a bit allegorical. Also important to remember this was more than 100 years ago, and that he’s talking very specifically about how to write poetry. All the way through I felt like he could have been talking about social media.Metaphorically, he seems to be saying (to me even more strongly than isolation): that motivation needs to be intrinsic, it should come from yourself and your own desires, not from others; and that you should practice your craft intensely and make sure the practice of writing poetry is free from interruptions or noise that cloud things. He may be naming the state of flow we all want using words for it that we’re not used to these days, along with a push for writers to set their own standards and not judge themselves by publishing metrics. These are fairly timeless and applicable ideas today, not to mention all of us programmers frequently dream of solitude and perhaps resent the fact that we almost never get it at work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Humans are fundamentally solitary. That is our natureAmazing, every word of what that guy said is wrong.Maybe he was actually talking about cats, that would make sense. But humans literally can&#39;t function outside of a society."</p>
