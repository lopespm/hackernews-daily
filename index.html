								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow. This gives a lot of false positives, but it found all ~10 of my old accounts over the years.The most interesting thing is that my writing style changed pretty drastically since a decade ago. Searching for my oldest account matches my earliest usernames, whereas searching this account matched the rest.The details of the algorithm are fascinating: https://stylometry.net/about Mostly because of how simple it is. I assumed it would measure word embeddings against a trained ML model, but nothing so fancy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The method used, i.e. to calculate the cosine of the two authors&#39; word vectors, is poorly suited for stylometric analysis because it is based on a poster&#39;s lexicon and the word frequencies of each word, but ignoring stylistically relevant factors like word order.Also, the cosine of the vectors of word frequencies conflates author-specific vocabulary and topics; in other words, my account is grouped (with &gt;51% similarity, according to the demo) with someone probably because we wrote about similar things. A strong stylometric matcher ought to be robust against topic shifts (our personal writing style is what stays constant when we move from writing about one topic to writing about another topic, just like our personality is what stays constant about our behavior over time - of course styles do change, but the premise then has to be that such changes happen very slowly).Stylometrics/authorship identification is interesting and has led to some surprising findings, e.g. in forensic linguistics (Malcolm Coulthard wrote several good books about the topic).This paper lists some other features that could be used and compares a bunch of techniques: https://research.ijcaonline.org/volume86/number12/pxc3893384..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting that the article&#39;s thesis is about reading, but most of the article is actually about writing. And I think that&#39;s an understated point. I myself wrote a blog piece about &#34;Blogging as Structured Thinking&#34; earlier this year.I think that actually plenty of people do reading in various forms of content. The real challenge is getting people to do more writing.If you want to be a thinker, you have to write.It really forces you to address your ideas more formulaically and concretizes your theses.Start a blog! If you&#39;re reading this chances are you know how to buy a domain and spin up a blog in less than 30 minutes. Try Wordpress, or hugo with templates if you want more control. And if you don&#39;t know what to write about, this link was recently shared on HN, I thought it was pretty useful: https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/And yes, it&#39;s important to publish it. It makes your thoughts real. And ideas were meant to be shared."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many of us are programmers. Some of us are also trying to be writers. Trust me: writing is like programming. Reading code is very useful to become a better programmer, but you learn programming mostly by writing code. Similarly you mostly learn how to write prose by writing prose, tons of it. Reading is especially useful if you identify certain books that are very high in style (for me one of such books was &#34;Vite di uomini non illustri&#34; by Giuseppe Pontiggia), for your taste at least, for what you beleive the best writing is. You read these books many times, to understand what&#39;s going on, what are the patterns, how to do the same magic. As a casual reader you can read 200 books every year and yet remain a terrible writer.EDIT: more about that on my blog if you care -&gt; http://antirez.com/news/136"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there is clear historical evidence that this thesis is, at a minimum, greatly exaggerated.  Socrates never wrote, and I think he had more good ideas than Paul Graham ever will.  Muhammad was not even literate, and unless he was inspired by divinity, his ideas were extremely powerful.I mean, I do personally find that writing is a powerful tool for thinking.  Maybe that means that Paul Graham and I are normal, and Socrates and Muhammad were atypical.  But maybe it says more about humans-in-our-society than it does about the essential human condition.  If humans learned &#34;by tape&#34; (as per the SF books from the Silver Age, referenced in TFA&#39;s opening para), maybe idea-production would work along different lines.I admit, I tend to agree with him about the usefulness of writing.  But I think it&#39;s just an irrational intuition, not the clear argument he implies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes, sequential I/O bandwidth is closing the gap to memory. [1] The I/O pattern to watch out for, and the biggest reason why e.g. databases do careful caching to memory, is that _random_ I/O is still dreadfully slow. I/O bandwidth is brilliant, but latency is still disappointing compared to memory. Not to mention, in typical Cloud workloads, IOPS are far more expensive than memory.[1]: https://github.com/sirupsen/napkin-math"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I question the methodology.To measure this I would have N processes reading the file from disk with the max number of parallel heads (typically 16 I think). These would go straight into memory. It&#39;s possible you could do this with one process and the kernel will split up the block read into 16 parallel reads as well, needs investigation.Then I would use the rest of the compute for number crunching as fast as possible using as many available cores as possible: for this problem, I think that would basically boil down to a map reduce. Possibly a lock-free concurrent hashmap could be competitive.Now, run these in parallel and measure the real time from start to finish of both. Also gets the total CPU time spent for reference.I&#39;m pretty sure the author&#39;s results are polluted: while they are processing data the kernel is caching the next block. Also, it&#39;s not really fair to compare single threaded disk IO to a single process: one of the reasons for IO being a bottleneck is that it has concurrency constraints. Never the less I would be interested in both the single threaded and concurrent results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I haven’t shown an optimized Python version because it’s hard to optimize Python much further! (I got the time down from 8.4 to 7.5 seconds). It’s as fast as it is because the core operations are happening in C code – that’s why it so often doesn’t matter that “Python is slow”.An obvious optimization would be to utilize all available CPU cores by using the MapReduce pattern with multiple threads.I believe that&#39;d be necessary for a fair conclusion anyway, as you can&#39;t claim that I/O isn&#39;t the bottleneck, without utilizing all of the available CPU and memory resources."</p>

Nope -- it runs all workflows defined in the repo, all at once in parallel!This seems like a crazy default to me.  I&#39;ve never wanted to do anything remotely like that, so it just seems both dangerous and inconvenient all at once.Nice otherwise though..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This piece of software would have to handle all the intricacies of the GitHub actions but also be updated to the latest changes...We are moving back to a makefile based approach that is called by the GitHub workflows. We can handle different levels of parallelism: the make kind or the indexed by worker number when running in actions. That way we can test things locally, we can still have 32 workers on GitHub to run the full suite fast enough.I also like that we are less bound to GitHub now because it has been notorious unreliable for us this past year and we may move more easily to something else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is simply amazing.  There were so many images there that are photorealistic enough that I was trying to figure out was this a real live action project? Or had someone simply staged the images as part of a larger &#34;art project &#34; or something...Took me by surprise that this was AI generated, although in hindsight it should have been obvious.  For me, this is the moment I realized AI art had become something &#34;useful&#34;, and the world isn&#39;t going to be the same.I can see where this is going... The commercial implications are enormous. Speeding up the concept art process for movies, etc.  As someone here mentioned, why not make entire movies this way?  Once they figure out how to animate this stuff, it puts the movie industry out of business.I can only imagine what my grandkids are going to be using this for."</p>

The content at the link the OP posted appears to be an oversimplified, high level and naive overview"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have absolutely loved working in genomics. I am a huge believer that genomics will be a huge part of healthcare in the future, and i have two examples to motivate that point that I think may be interesting to the reader.1) The Moderna vaccine was made with the help of illumina genome sequencing. They were able to sequence the virus and send that sequence of nucleotides over to moderna for them to develop the vaccine - turning a classically biology problem, into a software problem, reducing the need for them to bring the virus in house.2) Illumina has a cancer screening test called Galleri, that can identify a bunch of cancers from a blood test. It identifies mutated dna released by cancer cells. This is huge, if we can identify cancer before someone even starts to show symptoms, the chances of having a useful treatment dramatically go up.Disclaimer: I work for illumina, views my own.I wrote some more about why genomics is cool from a technical point of view here (truly big data, hardware accelerated bioinformatics) : https://dddiaz.com/post/genomics-is-cool/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really glad to see this, but it reminds me of the earlier HN post that said engineers don&#39;t go into genomics because it doesn&#39;t pay and requires a lot of investment in learning biology."</p>

  area(x) = np.prod(np.shape(x))

The dht is its own inverse, which is a neat trick. No need for an inverse fft. In other words, dht(dht(x)) == x.Notice that the output is the real component of the fft. That means the storage required is exactly identical to the input signal. And since the input signal is copied to the real and imaginary components (1 + 1j)*x, the intermediate representation size is also equal to the input signal size. (Just take sin and cos of the input signal.)The dht has almost all the same properties of the fft. You can blur an image by taking a hamming window and multiplying. You can resize an image by fftshift + pad with zeros + fftshift. Etc.In practice the dht seems to have all the benefits of fft with very few downsides. I’m amazed it isn’t more popular."</p>

The stereographic projection makes it look like the animation in this post.&#34;[1] https://twitter.com/mananself/status/1595132523264167936"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who as held national records in the sport of speedcubing, I don&#39;t feel this makes it easier to understand, at least if you are going for an instrumental understanding of how to solve it. I think the community are pretty good at teaching that now! But it does look extremely cool.My favourite one-liner for improving understanding is something roughly like &#39;solve areas made of pieces, not faces made of stickers&#39;. Very much clearer when you have a cube to take apart and put together in the order you would solve them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Was trying to make sense of that solve, but couldn&#39;t see any algorithmic thing happening. Either that&#39;s the craziest method I ever saw, or it&#39;s just a reversal of a random scramble.Regardless, none of that takes away from the nifty 2D projection technique!"</p>
