								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back in the late 90s, I implemented the first systematic monitoring of WalMart Store&#39;s global network, including all of the store routers, hubs (not switches yet!) and 900mhz access points.
Did you know that WalMart had some stores in Indonesia? They did until 1998.So when https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_1998_riots_of_Indonesia started happening, we heard some harrowing stories of US employees being abducted, among other things.Around that same time, the equipment in the Jakarta store started sending high temperature alerts prior to going offline. Our NOC wasn&#39;t able to reach anyone in the store.The alerts were quite accurate: that was one of the many buildings that had been burned down in the riots. I guess it&#39;s slightly surprising that electrical power to the equipment in question lasted long enough to allow temperature alerting. Most of our stores back then used satellite for their permanent network connection, so it&#39;s possible telcom died prior to the fire reaching the UPC office.In a couple of prominent places in the home office, there were large cutouts of all of the countries WalMart was in at the time up on the walls. A couple of weeks after this event, the Indonesia one was taken down over the weekend and the others re-arranged."</p>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp0_on_fireReally though, I feel truly awful for anyone affected by this. The post recommends implementing a disaster recovery plan. The truth is that most people don&#39;t have one. So, let&#39;s use this post to talk about Disaster Recovery Plans!Mine: I have 5 servers at OVH (not at SBG) and they all back up to Amazon S3 or Backblaze B2, and I also have a dedicated server (also OVH/Kimsufi) that gets the backups. I can redeploy in less than a day on fresh hardware, and that&#39;s good enough for my purposes. What&#39;s YOUR Disaster Recovery Plan?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bigger problem in my opinion is that Rust has chosen to follow the poll-based model (you can say that it was effectively designed around epoll), while the completion-based one (e.g. io-uring and IOCP) with high probability will be the way of doing async in future (especially in the light of Spectre and Meltdown).Instead of carefully weighing advantages and disadvantages of both models, the decision was effectively made on the ground of &#34;we want to ship async support as soon as possible&#34; [1]. Unfortunately, because of this rush, Rust got stuck with a poll-based model with a whole bunch of problems without a clear solution in sight (async drop anyone?). And instead of a proper solution for self-referencing structs (yes, a really hard problem), we did end up with the hack-ish Pin solution, which has already caused a number of problems since stabilization and now may block enabling of noalias by default [2].Many believe that Rust async story was unnecessarily rushed. While it may have helped to increase Rust adoption in the mid term, I believe it will cause serious issues in the longer term.[1]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/62149#issuecomment-...
[2]: https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/63818"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been working on a reasonably complicated project that is using rust, and I think about de-asyncing my code somewhat often because there are some nasty side effects you can see when you try to connect async &amp; non async code. E.g., tokio makes it very difficult to correctly &amp; safely (in a way the compiler, not runtime) catches launch an async task in a blocking function (with no runtime) that itself may be inside of a async routine. It makes using libraries kind of tough, and I think you end up with a model where you have a thread-per-library so the library knows it has a valid runtime, which is totally weird.All that said, the author&#39;s article reads as a bit daft. I think anyone who has tried building something complicated in C++ / Go will look at those examples and marvel at how awesome Rust&#39;s ability to understand lifetimes is (i.e. better than your own) and keep you from using resources in an unintended way. E.g., you want to keep some data alive for a closure and locally? Arc. Both need to writable? Arc Mutex. You are a genius and can guarantee this Fn will never leak and it&#39;s safe to have it not capture something by value that is used later in the program and you really need the performance of not using Arc? Cast it to a ptr and read in an unsafe block in the closure. Rust doesn&#39;t stop you from doing whatever you want in this regard, it just makes you explicitly ask for what you want rather than doing something stupid automatically and making you have a hard to find bug later down the line."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not totally sure what the author is asking for, apart from refcounting and heap allocations that happen behind your back. In my experience async Rust is heavily characterised by tasks (Futures) which own their data. They have to - when you spawn it, you&#39;re offloading ownership of its state to an executor that will keep it alive for some period of time that is out of the spawning code&#39;s control. That means all data/state brought in at spawn time must be enclosed by move closures and/or shared references backed by an owned type (Arc) rather than &amp; or &amp;mut.If you want to, nothing is stopping you emulating a higher-level language - wrap all your data in Arc&lt;_&gt; or Arc&lt;Mutex&lt;_&gt;&gt; and store all your functions as trait objects like Box&lt;dyn Fn(...)&gt;. You pay for extra heap allocations and indirection, but avoid specifying generics that spread up your type hierarchy, and no longer need to play by the borrow checker&#39;s rules.What Rust gives us is the option to _not_ pay all the costs I mentioned in the last paragraph, which is pretty cool if you&#39;re prepared to code for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really think that Windows 2000-era Windows Forms had the user experience nailed perfectly.  It wasn&#39;t the prettiest UI paradigm ever, but it was the most functional and easiest to teach.  Nothing was omitted, and the user was shown everything they needed to see in order to get a complete idea of the state of the application.I don&#39;t think that efforts to hide UI elements that aren&#39;t in use is going to prove to be a good idea when we look back at today from the future.Here&#39;s a good rule, in my mind: Don&#39;t hide UI elements from the user.  End of rule.  I do not care if it looks better without whatever UI element.  The toolbox in my garage would look better if I could only see the tools I needed at the time I need them, and I would return that toolbox (or never buy it in the first place) because it is constantly lying to me about the state of the toolbox, which is absolutely insulting position for a toolbox designer to adopt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I have a really hard time believing anyone would chose this as opposed to some design lead at Apple pushing a weird personal preference for tidyness on their entire user baseMaybe I don&#39;t understand completely what he is referring to, but on mobile I certainly prefer having a bit more space than a always visible scrollbar. It is usually clear enough that there is more to see below the fold.Scrollbars used to be sometimes useful to get a sense of how much content there is. But everyone using infinite scroll broke that, not apple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting output of this is, if you keep scrollbars visible, you&#39;ll find that a lot of websites end up with weird extra scrollbars on random elements.What often causes this is some HTML element overflowing by one pixel, but no one saw it during the QA process because all the webdevs were using Macs, which have invisible scrollbars by default. I always enable visible scrollbars on my dev computers specifically so I can catch problems like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;  That way, when candidates were pitched to us with &#34;X years of MOVA experience&#34;, we knew that somebody was full of it.I&#39;d put my money on the recruiter. I once had an excruciatingly awkward interview at a company on an industrial estate in the middle of nowhereland with no train station nearby that took me bloody ages to get to… which was actually going well until they asked me about my long experience with Exchange 2000. I had no experience with Exchange 2000, so I told them, and watched their faces drop.That was specifically why they wanted to speak to me. The recruiter had inserted it onto the copy of the CV he sent to them. I&#39;m surprised I&#39;m not still doing time for murder.What I&#39;m not surprised about though is why they do it. I&#39;ve been to plenty of interviews where my CV hasn&#39;t been given more than a glance. At moments like those I feel a deep sense of pessimism. The whole recruitment process seems broken from end to end and has been for a while."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, let me get this straight - you lie about your job requirements, but get all bent out of shape when the candidates lie right back at you?Brilliant.I can’t think of a better example of why hiring is broken; of how unequal the power dynamic is between employers and employees."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of an anecdote I read once, maybe in Liars Poker, about how lots of people applying to this hedge fund put &#34;Chess&#34; on their resume somewhere thinking it made them seem like a deep or strategic thinker. As it happened, at this hedge fund there worked a former Soviet master or grandmaster ranked player. And so, whenever interviewing any candidate who claimed great proficiency with chess on their resume, at the end of the interview they&#39;d take the candidate to go play the master."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This would benefit the Northeast quite a lot.Assume that your average adult works 9-5, and your average school child is in school 8-3. Broad strokes, these are the two groups to focus on. I know most adults commute earlier than 9, and most students are up earlier than 8, but it&#39;s safe to say that most Americans are up-and-at-&#39;em from 8-5.On the shortest day of the year in Boston, sunrise is at 7:10am and sunset is at 4:14PM. Including civil twilight (&#34;it&#39;s still kind of daytime&#34;) extends it to 6:38am to 4:46PM.Even on the shortest day of the year, if you wake up even before 7 you&#39;re waking up in daylight. But, sunset is super early. Every working adult is commuting home in actual nighttime.Shift that forward 1 hour, and it gets light at 7:30AM and gets dark at 5:45PM. While slightly darker for students in the morning, it&#39;s immensely better for working adults, who at least get some daylight in the evenings, and not actual nighttime before 5PM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first few articles I could find on this topic neglected to identify the senators co-sponsoring the bill.  Here&#39;s a list from boston.cbslocal.com:* Roy Blunt (R-MO)* Cindy Hyde-Smith (R-MS)* James Lankford (R-OK)* Ed Markey (D-MA)* Marco Rubio (R-FL)* Rick Scott (R-FL)* Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI)* Ron Wyden (D-OR)Wikipedia has some history on similar, short-lived efforts in the past:&gt; Seasonal observation of DST was first enacted in the US during World Wars I and II, as an attempt conserve fuel. The practice was unpopular and promptly repealed after each war; however, lobbyists from the petroleum industry lobbied to restore DST, as they had noticed it actually increased fuel consumption.&gt; Permanent DST in the US was briefly enacted by President Nixon in 1974, in response to the 1973 oil crisis. The proposal was initially supported by an estimated 79% of the public; that support dropped to 42% after its first winter, owing to the harshness of dark winter mornings that permanent DST creates. An estimated six school children were also killed by motorists due to the new law.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permanent_time_observation_in_...On the eastern edge of the enormous Eastern time zone, I&#39;m sympathetic to permanent DST, but I&#39;m not sure it&#39;s a good idea nationwide.  I would probably be in favor of the proposed Atlantic time zone, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"DST has become my favorite &#34;holiday&#34; as an adult. Seasonal depression evaporates when I can see the sun after I finish working for the day. I can go work in my yard, or wash my car after work instead of having to cram it in the middle of the day. I feel more motivated to go do other things in the evening instead of feeling like its time for bed at 5pm."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fun stuff I read since his passing yesterday in the Dutch newspapers.Although he had indeed humility about his contribution to the cassette tape and the CD, he also was frustrated what Sony did in this department. He wanted the CD to be 11,5 cm instead of 12 cm and was disappointed Sony sold the first CD and invented the concept of a walkman instead of Philips.His opinion about cassette tapes and vinyl having a revival because of the analog experience?&#34;I am not a psychologist, but that music experience is of course all nonsense. Nothing can match the sound of the CD. It is absolutely noise and rumble free. That never worked with tape. But who am I to say what&#39;s better, I&#39;m over ninety and have old ears. I have made a lot of record players and I know that the distortion with vinyl is much higher. But some people call it &#34;warm audio.&#34; I think people mostly hear what they want to hear. But there are always madmen who want to look back to the past. There is always a market for that.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I quit my job and went travelling I used this framework:1. Go via land. You see everything in between all the places you should see as a tourist. You immerse yourself in how a place actually feels. You meet people who aren’t just trying to extract money from you. I cycled, because I like cycling, but any form of transport works.2. My algorithm was something like “Go east. Stay somewhere if it’s interesting, until you get bored. Continue going east.” I didn’t have a fixed itinerary, but I did have some framework.That was the basis of it, I think. I cycled from London to Italy, stopped for a while in Italy, cycled on to Greece, then fell in love (with the place and somebody in particular). I met some of my best friends, worked on side projects, volunteered for charities, and ended up staying there for several months. I skipped forward to India on a plane, cycled across India, then returned back to Greece.My partner in Greece wanted to visit the Middle East and Central Asia, but she wasn’t quite as excited about cycling through the desert as I was, so we bought a van and drove — to Central Asia, and everything in between.My framework worked extraordinarily well. If I have one regret, I think it was not making an effort to interact with more people. You do that a lot more naturally when travelling by land, but you still need to put in effort to make it happen.For example, I was up late in a bar in an Italian village, and met one of the locals. It was a long cycle ride back to the place I was staying so he offered me his spare room. Turns out he lived with his parents and the next day his elderly Italian mother cooked us pasta for lunch. Possibly one of the best meals of my life.I wish I had done more of that. Just hanging out in bars and making friends. And not tourist bars — real bars. Knowing the local language better would probably help."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Absolutely worth it, however I&#39;d offer a few short tips:1. Try to stay in one place for a few months, minimum. If you can stay a year or two, do that. Jumping from city to city every week seems exciting at first, but it quickly makes everywhere feel the same.2. To quote Lao Tzu, when your work is done, forget it. If you work remotely, actively disconnect at the end of the day. It&#39;s too easy to be constantly plugged into the English-speaking media world and ignore what&#39;s right in front of you.3. Try to blend in and adopt local clothing, culture, foods, etc. Read books by local authors, watch local films. A bit obvious, maybe, but I&#39;ve met many people who insisted on only eating Western food, reading Harry Potter, and watching Netflix while abroad. At that point, why even bother traveling?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Did not quit my job, but instead went full remote in 2018 (age 55 at the time).Still doing it, but the pandemic forced me to stay in one country for just about a year now.In that year I put down roots, got long term visas and maybe will spend another few years there while we see how things shape out this and next year.But ya, 2-3 months minimum in a place is what you need, with just a small backpack.Make local friends.Don&#39;t hang around or go out with other tourists or expats. This is the kiss of death.Make it a rule to eat only the food of the city or the country that you find yourself in.Learn a few words of the language &#34;hello&#34;, &#34;thank you&#34;, &#34;bathroom&#34;, &#34;stop&#34;, etc.Don&#39;t think people are less than you. They&#39;re not. They want the same things as you.As an introvert, being forced to make friends with people who speak another language and look the opposite of me (black guy in Asia), was exactly the ticket.Well recommended to do it.The main thing I would say - is have a mission when you travel. Seeing the sights and drinking the bars and mingling with other tourists and shtupping the local girls is fun, but not a mission.You will get bored after some time of doing that.Have some particular work or meaning to each day to keep you grounded, and you can do the moving around for a super-long time.You will find that you&#39;ll set some schedules for work, play and discoveries - regardless of where you are.Just don&#39;t quit your job. Instead go remote (even if you have savings). Ok?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oooh I like a lot.The whole idea of a two-way links like the wp pingbacks in the good old days is getting traction. For more info about this, see https://indieweb.org/Webmention and https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LinkbackAnother useful related thing I saw is https://brid.gy/ which transforms social mentions into webmentions"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m too young to know what are webmentions or pingbacks (love the band Pinback though), you should briefly mention what they are on your homepage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At first, I didn&#39;t get it. Pingbacks, isn&#39;t that from the 90s?Then, I thought: does this mean the bar for joining a conversation on my publication is that you have to publish something too?That seems like a nice bar to set for asking both parties in a conversation to be fully engaged. Trolls seem like they will be too lazy to do that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My personal experience as a business owner. We do not care about reviews since we are a B2B software house. Our customers are mid- to large-size companies so they do not play reviews but lawyers if our service wasn&#39;t of highest quality :) My personal preference would be to prevent 3rd party companies like google from publishing reviews if the business owner doesn&#39;t want them.Anyway - no customer gave us any review on google and our website is full of recommendation letters. But at some point google started nagging our employees to put reviews since they visited our office.Guess what happened. We got our first review from an employee we were not happy with and planned to gracefully close our cooperation with.This is against Google policy. So we complained. We had to spend significant time to get to a real person at Google and get this removed.After a year similar situation happened. I thought ok - this should be easy the second time. No way - this time all the emails we knew did not respond, we could not reach anybody. We flagged the review several times. We could not do anything about that.It is like a person can just put a shit on your office wall and you could not clean it. And shit owner - Google doesn&#39;t care.We were forced to play by the rules and we bought 50 reviews to paint our wall. The company that provided this service was a Google partner. They explained that 80-90% of reviews of everything is written for money.And the best thing - once we started getting our reviews, the flagged reviews were finally removed. Seems like AI decided the we are a good company.Do you think we did something wrong? Immoral? Or just played business on a not leveled field?And to summarize. I do not care about reviews. And we have money to fight back with lawyers or PR. But it is sad that some businesses don&#39;t have this option and somebody (Google) can harm them through reviews they did not ask for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once wrote a negative review of a business on Google, and it went up, but when I went to look at the business&#39;s reviews under my wife&#39;s Google account, it was not there. I waited an hour and checked. Then a couple hours and checked. Then a day. It never showed up.I posted the review under her account and did the same checks for my account. It never showed up.I do not know why it didn&#39;t show up, but I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the business had been able to pay money to Google to be able to check reviews before they went live and mark them as spam.Edit: Because some commenters did not seem to get the implied message, what I am actually implying is that in this context, or any context, I don&#39;t trust Google. I have no evidence of what commenters said I have claimed. (I have not claimed anything; I just said I wouldn&#39;t be surprised.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting thing about paid reviews - you can prove that the reviews are fake, but you usually can&#39;t prove that the business itself actually paid for those reviews. In a hypothetical world where companies with fake reviews are regularly discovered and lambasted in public, it&#39;s easy to imagine a sinister metagame where unscrupulous small businesses can buy bad good reviews (i.e. 5-star reviews that are obviously fake) for their competitors to make them seem sketchy. The folks selling the fake reviews certainly don&#39;t care who&#39;s paying. There&#39;s no obvious solution to me for that potential problem aside from stopping fake reviews before they&#39;re posted (which feels like the kind of thing that&#39;s much harder than it sounds); thankfully it doesn&#39;t appear to be a very common thing yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What really frustrates me is I had already turned off all of the &#34;personalized advertising&#34; toggles I could find prior to this.  But I log in to turn these off and the ones I&#39;d touched before were back on.Increasingly, the &#34;if you&#39;re not paying then you&#39;re the product&#34; saying is bunk.  I am paying, almost $400 per month, for quite a few SIMs to be active on T-Mobile&#39;s network yet that&#39;s not enough.  They have to harvest data about me for even more.(Don&#39;t come at me with the &#34;a company is legally required to take in all of the money it possibly can for its shareholders&#34; bit.  Nothing says a company can&#39;t make a reasonable business decision to leave money on the table.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From Mac Rumors:T-Mobile customers can opt out of the advertising program through the T-Mobile app or the T-Mobile website. In the app, access the &#34;MORE&#34; tab, select Advertising &amp; Analytics, and toggle off &#34;Use my data to make ads more relevant to me.&#34;On the website(https://www.t-mobile.com/signin), choose &#34;My Account,&#34; select &#34;Profile, Privacy, and Notifications, then choose Advertising &#34;&amp; Analytics. From there, turn the opt-in toggle off. Sprint users can change the setting through the Sprint website. Select &#34;Visit My Account,&#34; choose &#34;Preferences&#34; and then scroll down to &#34;Manage advertising and analytics preferences.&#34; From here, turn off &#34;Use my data to make ads more relevant to me.&#34;Took me a few reloads throughout this process"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"John Legere, who was responsible for T-Mobile&#39;s norm-shattering &#34;uncarrier&#34; direction, resigned last year after the Sprint merger went through.Now that T-Mobile isn&#39;t a scrappy underdog anymore, I think we can expect more American business-as-usual customer exploitation from them."</p>
