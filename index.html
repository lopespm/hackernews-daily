								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Previous related discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26328758If things go as planned, this may become a paid, ad-free, zero-tracking search engine. I can&#39;t express how exciting this is to me.Over the past few years, I have made several attempts to replace Google Search with DuckDuckGo. But they have all failed and I always ended up changing the default search engine back to Google. I mean, DDG worked fine for 95% of time, but the remaining 5% failure often led to some extreme frustration that I just couldn&#39;t stand. I would imagine Brave Search to have similar issues, at least in the beginning, but they did something smart to make it less painful:&gt; Brave Search beta is based on an independent index, the first of its kind. However, for some queries, Brave can anonymously check our search results against third-party results, and mix them on the results page.So, if I am not satisfied with Brave&#39;s result, Google&#39;s result is on the same page, or just one click away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On 6 June 2020, a Twitter user pointed out that Brave inserts affiliate referral codes when users type a URL of Binance into the address bar, which earns Brave money. Further research revealed that Brave redirects the URLs of other cryptocurrency exchange websites, too. In response to the backlash from the users, Brave&#39;s CEO apologized and called it a &#34;mistake&#34; and said &#34;we&#39;re correcting&#34;.Brave is just a &#34;pop-privacy&#34; company.  I will skip this one..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apparently, they have their own search index, which they say covers ~95% of queries, and if the results aren&#39;t in the index, it will then get it from Google or Bing.I&#39;d love some more details on how this works. They probably aren&#39;t scraping the whole web. Are they just mirroring Bing and Google indexes? They seem to have their own page ranking algorithm that they&#39;re hoping to get trained."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Read up a bit on ADHD. That &#39;hyperfocus&#39; that occurs either with deadlines or on a passion project is a symptom, as is the inability to get excited about projects you simply don&#39;t want to do - especially given your otherwise positive reviews and your ability to clear your mind and hyperfocus near a deadline, it&#39;s something to consider.I was diagnosed at 33, and it changed my life infinitely for the better. YMMV, and you may not have ADHD, but if you do, it is nothing to feel guilty about - it, in fact, gives you some insanely useful abilities that others simply don&#39;t have, as evidenced by the number of comments on this post explaining you have no guilt to feel, and your positive performance reviews.But being able to understand why we do these things, and being able to understand how to adjust for them (whether through medication or coping mechanisms) is, alone, insanely relieving.Consider picking up &#39;Driven to Distraction,&#39; or &#39;Delivered From Distraction,&#39; or check out these posts by Mark Suster which was what led me to get started on the path:* https://bothsidesofthetable.com/how-to-know-if-you-have-add-...* https://bothsidesofthetable.com/why-add-might-actually-benef...* https://bothsidesofthetable.com/developing-an-action-plan-fo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sounds like it might be good thing for the company. Having employees who have extra capacity is incredibly important for an organization that wants to get things done; if you&#39;re constantly hard at work on something important, when something else comes up (someone has a question, there&#39;s a bug or an outage, whatever), you either have to delay the thing you&#39;re already working on, or delay the thing that came up. This tends to have a cascade effect on most kinds of work, locking up all your people resources.Plus, those other things you&#39;re doing sound like they overall, in the long-term, probably give you a wider range of knowledge, improving your usefulness.Just wanted to add a voice against that sort of Taylorism perspective on work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly why I&#39;ve concluded trying to go my own way is the best long-term plan for me. Before learning about YC and HN and such, the thought never really occurred to me.When I&#39;m working on a personal project I&#39;m really passionate about, my productivity is literally orders of magnitude higher than at any day job I&#39;ve had. Months or years are compressed into days.For any ambitious personal project that I&#39;m intrinsically motivated by, I&#39;m working on it and designing it pretty much every free moment I have. It&#39;s actually crazy to me how much I can get done if there&#39;s absolutely zero &#34;ugh field&#34; [1] inhibiting me. It doesn&#39;t feel like work at all. I&#39;d happily take 20% of my current salary if it meant I could do that all day instead.Even if it&#39;s stressful and even if I might fail miserably, I think life should be lived. If there&#39;s even the tiniest sliver of a chance that I could support myself just doing something like that, I know I&#39;d be much happier. And if turning such a thing into a job or organization sucks the fun out of it, then I&#39;ll just keep trying again and again until I can find a project with a sufficiently viable enjoyment:financial stability ratio.[1] https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/EFQ3F6kmt4WHXRqik/ugh-fields (Regarding the author&#39;s username: yes, it&#39;s that one.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great work! Hacker News still seems to have a deeply skeptical culture with regard to machine learning - not sure why. There&#39;s always someone saying it&#39;s &#34;not novel&#34; and it&#39;s &#34;just doing x&#34;.Overfitting is a known issues in machine learning, people.  If you still think all neural networks are doing is memorizing the dataset completely in the year 2021 - you might want to revisit the topic. It is one of the first concerns anyone training a deep model will have and to assume this model is overfit _without_ providing specific examples is arguing in bad faith.Sentdex has shown his GAN is able to generalize various game logic like collision/friction with vehicles and also learns aspects of rendering such as a proper reflection of the sun on the back of the car.He also showed weak points where the model is incapable of handling some situations and even did the impossible task of &#34;splitting a car in two&#34; to try and solve a head-on collision. Even though this is a failure case; it should at least provide you with some intuition that the GAN isn&#39;t just spitting out frames memorized from the dataset because that never happens in the dataset.You will need to apply a little more rigor before outright dismissing these weights as merely overfit.@sentdex Have you considered a guided diffusion approach now that that&#39;s all the rage? It&#39;s all rather new still but I believe it could be applied to these concepts as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like your YouTube videos in general and think this content is a great benefit to the community.I wouldnâ€™t take the few negative comments personally - Iâ€™ve seen many GAN architectures that heavily overfit (including my own bobross pix2pix) get a lot of praise, while â€˜less violatingâ€™ models (like yours) get more skepticism.  Skepticism isnâ€™t bad! But Iâ€™d wager in your case it may be because youâ€™re a YouTuber, and other ml YouTubers are notorious for ripping off content (eg Siraj).Not really related to this, but Iâ€™d personally love to see the difference in training times it would take an RL agent to adequately learn to drive a car in gta versus adequately flying a helicopter."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These are one of the few times I can say that I don&#39;t care if Boston Dynamics are making money as yet.Boston Dynamics are one of the few real serious players in the robotics space worldwide doing deep R&amp;D.Hyundai are basically paying for the BD Labs research. And they are well positioned to reap the products and techniques from the lab with their own manufacturing and engineering prowess and experience over the next decade.And it won&#39;t be walking dogs.It will be things like a little flexi-joint in a car that you buy without knowing (or caring) it&#39;s in there. Or some industrial machine that Hyundai builds that gives them a 5% competitive edge in the manufacturing of it that 99.9999% of us never hear about.But for that it&#39;s worth it.Very happy to see people put good money into this Lab."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Normally tech companies tend to be overpriced, but $880M for 80% of Boston Dynamics (total value of $1.1 billion), doesn&#39;t that seem a little low?Other tech companies can seemingly lose millions, as long as there&#39;s an advertising or data-mining angle to the product. Because Boston Dynamics aim to actually create physical products they then get valued lower?"</p>

Financial literacy is just one issue, but all that stuff like media competency, scientific method, cui bono, negotiations, assertiveness, how to deal with bullies, mental health basics, economics 101, mechanics of addiction and manipulation aaaand so on, all explained by first principles, would go such a long way towards a better functioning society.Then again, thatâ€˜s not going to happen as it would eventually destroy whole industries and populist voter bases.I smell a non-profit I should do one dayâ€¦"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It bothers me that so many people use the fact that something wasnâ€™t taught in school as an excuse for not knowing it, especially something as obviously necessary as personal finance.I was dumb in college and graduated with about $4k in credit card debt. It didnâ€™t take a classroom lecture to realize that spending more money than I earned was not a sustainable practice. Itâ€™s also not that hard to keep track of how much you spend and make sure itâ€™s less than how much you make.For almost anything personal finance related there is free information available all over the Internet if you care to spend a couple minutes googling for it.Likewise with taxes, if you have a regular W2 job, taxes are not hard, just read and follow the instructions. It doesnâ€™t help that people keep repeating the dumb meme that if you make a typo on your tax return the IRS will immediately throw you in jail. They wonâ€™t, they just send a letter telling you they corrected it for you (guess how I know)."</p>

  * Saves your battery 
  * No unexpected mobile data charges

In my opinion, people have given up caring about privacy and expect to receive an inferior experience from products that proclaim this. Therefore, again imo, products that focus on privacy and such will remain niche.I suspect that the world is ready for paid services that provide a better Ux. I am thinking about how Netflix supposedly put a dent in piracy. People were willing to pay for content with a better Ux.Aside from saving battery and no surprised mobile data charges, the list many other benefits:  * No ads 
  * No annoying registration 
  * No mandatory tutorials 
  * No noisy email spam 
  * No push notifications 
  * No crapware

I wonder if a project could charge a small monthly fee if they focused on these user benefits that everyone cares about, and partially use that money to support OSM and partially use the money to support themselves?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Organic Maps is an Android &amp; iOS offline maps app for travelers, tourists, hikers, and cyclists based on top of crowd-sourced OpenStreetMap data [â€¦]Good to see the source data mentioned right at the top, where it should be.&gt; [â€¦] and curated with love by MAPS.ME founders.What does that mean? Not the nonsensical &#39;with love&#39; part (that sounds unpleasantly sticky), but the curation; what is being curated? Is the source map data being hand-picked or modified, or is this just an opaque term for &#39;we built an app that gives you OSM in a handy offline format with custom rendering&#39;?"</p>
