								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NCMEC has essentially shows that they have zero regard for privacy and called all privacy activists &#34;screeching voices of the minority&#34;. At the same time, they&#39;re at the center point of a highly opaque, entrenched (often legally mandated) censorhip infrastructure that can and will get accounts shut down irrecoverably and possibly people&#39;s homes raided, on questionable data:In one of the previous discussions, I&#39;ve seen claims about the NCMEC database containing a lot of harmless pictures misclassified as CSAM. This post confirms this again (ctrl-f &#34;macaque&#34;)It also seems like the PhotoDNA hash algorithm is problematic (to the point where it may be possible to trigger false matches).Now NCMEC seem to be pushing for the development of a technology that would implant an informant in every single of our devices (mandating the inclusion of this technology is the logical next step that seems inevitable if Apple launches this).I&#39;m surprised, and honestly disappointed, that the author seems to still play nice, instead of releasing the whitepaper. The NCMEC seems to have decided to position itself directly alongside other Enemies of the Internet, and while I can imagine that they&#39;re also doing a lot of important and good work, at this point, I don&#39;t think they&#39;re salvageable would like to see them disbanded.Really curious how this will play out. I expect attacks either sabotaging these scanning systems by flooding them with false positives, or exploiting them to get the accounts of your enemies shut down permanently by sending them a picture of a macaque."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good article, however-&#34;Due to how Apple handles cryptography (for your privacy), it is very hard (if not impossible) for them to access content in your iCloud account. Your content is encrypted in their cloud, and they don&#39;t have access. If Apple wants to crack down on CSAM, then they have to do it on your Apple device&#34;I do not believe this is true. Maybe one day it will be true and Apple is planning for it, but right now iCloud service data is encrypted in the sense that they are stored encrypted at rest and in transit, however Apple holds the keys. We know this given that iCloud backups have been surrendered to authorities, and of course you can log into the web variants to view your photos, calendar, etc. Not to mention that Apple has purportedly been doing the same hash checking on their side for a couple of years.Thus far there has been no compelling answer as to why Apple needs to do this on device."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see many people pushing back on the child pornography laws themselves that are the cause of this. I&#39;m stepping into a hornets nest by even bringing this up, because any criticism of the laws on the books makes one look they&#39;re a pedo, so I&#39;ll preface by saying, child pornography (filmed with actual kids) is vile and disgusting, but it is the production of it that is evil to be fought and suppressed, not the possession of it. Remember in the 90s, we had to deal with the Communications Decency Act I &amp; II, because every time they want to crack down on the internet, the excuse is always &#34;it&#39;s for the children!&#34; And pedophilia is the go-to excuse in a lot of circumstances.The CPPA had bans on virtual child porn (e.g. using look-alike adult actresses or CGI), that was overturned by SCOTUS, and then Congress responded with the PROTECT act which tightened up those provisions. These laws on possession are practically unenforceable with modern technology, peer to peer file sharing, onion routing, and encrypted hard drives.Thus, in order to make them enforcement, the government has to put surveillance at all egress and ingress points of our private/secure enclaves, whether it&#39;s at the point of storing it locally, or the point of uploading it to the cloud.While I agree with the goal of eliminating child porn, should it come at the cost of an omnipresent government surveillance system everywhere? One that could be used for future laws that restrict other forms of content? How about anti-vax imagery? Anti-Semitic imagery? And with other governments of the world watching, especially authoritarian governments, how long until China, which had a similar system with Jingwang Weishi (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jingwang_Weishi) starts asking: hey, can you extend this to Falun Gong, Islamic, Hong Kong resistance, and Tiananmen square imagery? What if Thailand passes a law that requires Apple to scan for images insulting to the Thai Monarch, does Apple comply?This is a very bad precedent. I liked the Apple that said no to the FBI instead of installing backdoors. I&#39;d prefer if Apple get fined, and battle all the way to the Supreme Court to resist this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Slowly and almost imperceptibly if you look at it day-to-day, public research repositories like arxiv and biorxiv, along with public code repositories like github and gitlab, are becoming or maybe already are the world&#39;s most important academic &#34;journals.&#34;All research and code posted on them gets a quick once-over; good work gets the attention it deserves; bad work is quickly ignored. Reviews take place over the Internet via both public and private forums.Gatekeeping power lies more and more in the hands of a global, distributed scientific community open to anyone willing and capable of doing and reviewing the work. It&#39;s fabulous IMHO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reed Elsevier and the other rent seekers got no reason to live.That said: in the legal world, where PACER extracts $0.10 per &#34;page&#34; even now that you get things electronically and the cost is near zero:There&#39;s a service RECAP (PACER spelled backwards), where you can install a browser extension which automatically copies anything you download from PACER to a free archive. So one person pays, and the rest get it free.It is amazingly complete, much more than you would think. For instance, here&#39;s the entry for the Elizabeth Holmes (Theranos) trial:https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/7185174/united-states-v..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A good development - depositing papers in OA journals is extremely expensive and internationally, most funding bodies requiring OA don&#39;t give you money to publish OA. For example, Nature Communications charges around $5,000 for a single paper; I can send a student to an overseas conference for that kind of money!Public repositories like arxiv or biorxiv are free."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The worst offender recently in my opinion is Spotify on desktop.It used to be that when you clicked on an artists page you would see all the music tracks listed. Now it&#39;s all buried deep in and you have to search through the individual albums. Even the list of albums itself is not shown on the main artist page, you have to click &#34;See Discography&#34; first.The &#34;Home&#34; page is even worse. Where is my discover weekly playlist? Sometimes it&#39;s near the top, sometimes it&#39;s in this &#34;Made for you&#34; section. Sometimes you have to click &#34;See All&#34; next to that to find it.I mean moving shit around when you update your software is bad enough. Spotify moves shit around every time you boot the app!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ecosystem has also lost its mojo, and Apple is the one that killed it.The good old days of really good, dedicated mac software studios are over. Made by Sofa, Delicious Monster, SubEthaEdit, TextMate, Panic Inc, Rogue Amoeba, Strange Flavour. These were really great software studios that really upheld a standard of excellence for Mac software.But how are you supposed to keep that up when apple forces you into a marketplace that basically relies on customer handouts, where your only way to make profit on your 99ct app is to hit it so big, that your have several million customers.It&#39;s no wonder that there are no good apps anymore, we&#39;ve swamped the market with cheap cheap stuff, and nobody wants to pay for quality anymore.I&#39;ve recently switched from VSCode to Panics Nova, and for a very brief moment I felt like I was back in the old days of Mac Os X where things just worked, and where I felt at home with my OS, without constantly waiting for a better alternative to come along."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It’s obvious. Every high-tech company has people called “Product Managers” (PMs) whose job it is to work with customers and management and engineers to define what products should do. No PM in history has ever said “This seems to be working pretty well, let’s leave it the way it is.” Because that’s not bold. That’s not visionary. That doesn’t get you promotedThis mentality isn&#39;t unique to product managers. Mobile developers and front-end developers increasingly don&#39;t want to work on technologies that are perceived as outdated, or even to work on someone else&#39;s code. Everyone wants to list new technologies and greenfield projects on their resumes.This was one of the biggest hiring challenges at my most recent large project: iOS developers wanted to rewrite everything in Swift. Android developers wanted to rewrite everything in Kotlin. Our web app was already written in React, but the web developers constantly wanted to refactor it to use the latest state management trend. When Hooks were introduced in React, we spent far too long arguing with developers who wanted to refactor all of the working code to use hooks instead.The bigger problem is that nobody wanted to work on someone else&#39;s codebase. Everyone wanted to work on greenfield projects and technologies that would look good on their resume going into the next job. Some of the most talented developers we hired were obviously only interested in using our company as a stepping stone to FAANG jobs (which didn&#39;t actually pay much more, but they were more prestigious on a resume so they wanted to switch).Blaming product managers is an easy out and will likely match popular opinion among people who aren&#39;t product managers, but the problem extends to development teams as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks like a giant variety of &#39;Pachyrhizus erosus&#39; or Jicama, which is also a street snack widely sold in Mexico. I&#39;v never seen ones as large as the one in the article, but the watery texture and how it&#39;s condimented (lemon, sugar, salt, chili powder) is exactly like Jicama. Seems wikipedia has a reference to ones as large as 2 meters and 20 kg https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachyrhizus_erosus so it may be like those tree trunk sizes in the article.It&#39;s not Agave. Agave roots are very fibery and dry, there&#39;s almost no moisture in them and you wouldn&#39;t be able to cut such thin slices like the article points out, agave roots are mashed up to start the Tequila process, here are some pics http://www.todomezcal.com/Elaboracion/molienda.htmlSource: I&#39;ve cut open both Agave and Jicama plants, I grew up in Mexico. You can find Jicama/(fruit) street vendors in most Mexican cities main streets or outside Mexico a mexican market is also a safe bet. They have rough peel,  like a potato but rougher, and they&#39;re about 90% water."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have eaten it many times, vendors say it&#39;s a root.  But the last time I ate it, it was little more fibrous and hard and I ate little more than the usual.  For the next couple of days my tongue was itching and I had little difficulty speaking. Then I googled it and read somewhere that it&#39;s not edible.It&#39;s surprising experts don&#39;t know what the thing is given it&#39;s so commonly available."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There’s something… different about how people (techie people are most of my sample) would write before the 00’s. I’m not sure if it has to do with the medium, or the constraints of the time, but reading it always fills me with something I can best describe as peace/nostalgia. The belief that technology honestly can change the world for the better and that the most influential people driving it have good motives instead of profit motives. And they were real visionaries most of the time. By contrast, anything seemingly after the dot com boom (I can’t draw a clear line, this is just throwing a dart) seems, I don’t know how to describe it. Too self-aware, too clever? It’s similar to the contrast between HN and other forums/social media out there. I’m not sure, but whenever an older article or something shows up, I usually enjoy it. Perhaps it’s that only the best have survived till now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From an old comment of mine on the topic:https://youtu.be/sKOk4Y4inVY?t=518 [1]1. &#34;In 1995, there was a debate at Harvard Law School – four of us discussing the future of public key encryption and its control. I was on the side, I suppose, of freedom. It’s where I try to be. With me at that debate was a man called Daniel Weitzner who now works in the White House making Internet policy for the Obama administration.On the other side was the then Deputy Attorney General of the United States and a lawyer in private practice named Stewart Baker who had been chief council to the National Security Agency, our listeners, and who was then in private life helping businesses to deal with the listeners. He then became, later on, the deputy for policy planning in the Department of Homeland Security in the United States and has much to do with what happened in our network after 2001.At any rate, the four of us spent two pleasant hours debating the right to encrypt and at the end there was a little dinner party at the Harvard faculty club, and at the end, after all the food had been taken away and just the port and the walnuts were left on the table, Stuart said, “All right, among us now that we are all in private, just us girls, I’ll let our hair down.”He didn’t have much hair even then, but he let it down.“We are not going to prosecute your client, Mr. Zimmermann,&#34; he said. “Public key encryption will become available. We fought a long, losing battle against it, but it was just a delaying tactic.” And then he looked around the room and he said, ”But nobody cares about anonymity, do they?&#34;And a cold chill went up my spine and I thought, all right, Stuart, and now I know you’re going to spend the next twenty years trying to eliminate anonymity in human society and I am going to try to stop you and we’ll see how it goes.And it’s going badly. We didn’t build the net with anonymity built in. That was a mistake. Now we are paying for it.&#34; -Eben Moglen"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me a part of the melancholy feeling comes from the indignity of being forced to prove I&#39;m human, and then the frustration at this stupid world we&#39;ve created which requires me to do so which immediately follows the indignity.A website with captchas is like a retail store with metal detectors; it&#39;s not somewhere I feel welcome."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me this effect is significantly compounded by not being from the US / North America. This has come up on HN before (e.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25226805 ) but it still strikes me as so odd that you need quite a bit of USA cultural / vernacular knowledge to navigate the internet anywhere in the world (or at least English speaking sites?). What a strange view into another country to see each day!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve read the whole article, and I see so many comments agreeing or even adding detail to the post. Am I really in the minority if this kind of thing couldn&#39;t even cross my mind or feels like written by someone living in a parallel universe?A few poorly shot street photos are &#34;unbearably depressing&#34;? And there&#39;s even a detailed explanation breaking it down into points, each one feeling more alien than the last. They&#39;re just pictures from the street! Just how? How does a person come up with a whole emotional essay for this?I am failing to understand the author to the degree I feel like there&#39;s something wrong with this person&#39;s psyche or something is wrong with mine. Am I having a stroke and words are no longer making sense? Am I too young, or am I too old at 26 to &#34;get it&#34;? Is it because I live in a third world country and lack perspective or have &#34;too much&#34; of it? Is this homework for an English class and it&#39;s just trying to talk about literally anything for a given arbitrary word count? I almost feel like I&#39;m dissociating from reality by an article talking about a freaking captcha."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NASA&#39;s response, printed as an addendum, contains the sort of non-sequiturs that, contrary to the presumed intention, can only suggest that NASA is doing exactly what is alleged here: hoping a serious issue will go away.&#34;As shared by NASA&#39;s Kathy Lueders and Joel Montalbano in the media telecon following the event, Roscosmos regularly updated NASA and the rest of the international partners on MLM&#39;s progress during the approach to station...&#34;As far as we know, nothing untoward happened during the approach to station. Restricting this comment to this period renders it irrelevant and signals that NASA is trying to avoid the issue.&#34;When the unexpected thruster firings occurred, flight control teams were able to enact contingency procedures and return the station to normal operations within an hour...&#34;So there&#39;s no need to be concerned over why it happened, how long it took to discover the problem, or the inability of those at NASA who discovered it to counteract it until the ISS was in a position where Roscosmos could intervene? As the article author points out, this &#34;all&#39;s well that ends well&#34; attitude is what led to the Challenger and Columbia crashes.&#34;We would point you to Roscosmos for any specifics on Russian systems/performance/procedures.&#34;So, NASA seems to be saying, it is not our problem - but, of course, anything that threatens the integrity of the ISS most definitely is.That covers the whole of NASA&#39;s response so far to IEEE Spectrum, other than the utterly anodyne &#34;We continue to have confidence in our partnership with Roscosmos to operate the International Space Station.&#34;What I would like to know is why public relations spokespersons think it is in the interests of their organizations to make those organizations look clueless, while simultaneously insulting our intelligence by implying we will fall for this nonsense?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is a piece of commentary from a Russian insider covering the launch of Nauka, but not the docking, in Russian [1]. There was a litany of smaller issues with the launch, probably stemming from the fact that the module has been tossed around for 25+ years.I generally don&#39;t expect Roskosmos to make any comments regarding Nauka unless it blows up or something. Part of the reason, apparently, is that Roskosmos is being assessed for new funding (from the blog post, Google translate edited for clarity):&#34;&#34;&#34;Docking is scheduled for July 29. The future of Russian manned astronautics depends on its success. With Nauka, the Russian segment will be able to operate for another 10 years, and be more effective as a research platform.The future of the independent Russian Orbital Service Station (ROSS) is also indirectly related to the success of Nauka. With Nauka, Roskosmos gets a chance to show that it has the ability to create and launch manned space stations. This, in turn, increases the likelihood of obtaining the funding for ROSS.Probably, this is the reason that Roscosmos has been reluctant to voice any of the problems with Nauka. When half a trillion rubles is at stake, you will inevitably lose your voice.&#34;&#34;&#34;Half a trillion rubles is about $7bn American. I&#39;ve been hearing about plans for this new station for a few years now. I don&#39;t really know if it&#39;s real. Involvement with the ISS, where Americans shouldered 80% of the financial burden, is really what kept the Russian space program relevant. So I don&#39;t expect us to pull out of the ISS voluntarily. If the ISS ends up being decommissioned this decade, hopefully we can piggy back with the Chinese on their new projects or something. That&#39;s assuming we have anything they want, which is a big question mark come year 2030.[1] https://zelenyikot.livejournal.com/158629.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In principle I agree, but there&#39;s a lot riding against a proper, non-nasa investigation.1. No one died, unlike Columbia, there won&#39;t be a Congressional committee put together on this.2. Even if there was a congress committee/investigation done, what changes can actually be instituted? Block any more Russian modules?That&#39;s requiring putting pressure on a foreign country to make changes where the relationship runs a knife edge balancing act of frenemy.The Russian space program is a shell of its former self since ~2010.The most realistic course of action (at this moment) of any corrective recommendation is to remove them from the ISS. They&#39;ve been threatening pulling out for a few years now, so let them?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No, the space being shown here remains entirely flat.  There is length contraction and time dilation at play, but that’s a uniform effect.  The reason the image appears distorted is because we have more time to catch up to light rays emitted from farther away.  This visual phenomenon is called Terrell rotation.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrell_rotationIt’s based entirely on special relativity—not to be confused with general relativity, which deals with curved spacetime in the presence of gravitational fields."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also check out the game &#34;A Slower Speed of Light&#34; [0] if you are interested in visualization of relativistic effects. It includes effects like Doppler shifting of colors, perceived warping of space and time dilation. Good luck at not getting nauseous.[0] http://gamelab.mit.edu/games/a-slower-speed-of-light/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I found very interesting when I learned about it several years ago: it&#39;s possible to formulate SR and GR with the Euclidean (++++) metric instead of the Minkowski (+---) or (-+++) metric. Such a formulation (there is a variety of them) is sometimes called Euclidean Relativity (ER).See: https://www.euclideanrelativity.com/Some ER research is particularly fascinating to me, e.g. Montanus&#39; work on Flat Space Gravitation:https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10701-005-6482-0   A new description of gravitational motion will be proposed. It is part of the proper time formulation of physics as presented on the IARD 2000 conference. According to this formulation the proper time of an object is taken as its fourth coordinate. As a consequence, one obtains a circular space–time diagram where distances are measured with the Euclidean metric. The relativistic factor turns out to be of simple goniometric origin. It further follows that the Lagrangian for gravitational dynamics does not require an interpretation in terms of curvature of space–time. The flat space model for gravitational dynamics leads to the correct predictions for the bending of light, the perihelion shift of Mercury and gravitational red-shift. The new theory is free of singularities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think back to how we have responded to this pandemic.  We were in denial until the pandemic was spreading unchecked wildly through the population, and even a good chunk of the population is still in denial after 100,000s of dead.We are a hopeless species when it comes to organizing effective collective action ahead of known disaster.  We seem to only respond collectively once disaster has struck, and even then it takes time.I read a book in 1997 that was about this.  Can not remember the name or author of it for the life of me.  It was about climate change and the risk that North Atlantic currents would shift causing a state change that would be hard to reverse.  24 years later we think it is getting closer, but we still do not act swiftly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I often hear that as individuals we can&#39;t really be held responsible for climate change and that instead we should look to our government to impose laws that restrict carbon output.This made me curious: what is the &#34;fair&#34; amount of carbon dioxide that the average individual can emit? According to this article[1][2] published in Nature it looks like the answer is 1.61 metric tons of CO2/year.That strikes me as close-to-impossible for industrialized nations to achieve. A round-trip flight from NYC to SF emits 1.5 metric tons per passenger. In order to reach 1.61 metric tons an individual would not be able to own a gas-powered car, could not regularly consume meat, could not live in remote areas only visitable by plane etc. Many things people don&#39;t even consider &#34;luxuries&#34; (like visiting family overseas) would be a non-starter.In France they implemented a modest fuel tax and they got the Yellow Vest Protests[3] in response. I can&#39;t see the average individual ever voting for a party that wouldn&#39;t let them visit family and nearly eliminate meat consumption.As China, India and Indonesia have industrialized their per-capita emissions have shot up well above these levels as well. I imagine the same thing will happen with African nations over the next 25-50 years.I don&#39;t really see any way out of this other than some miraculous technological breakthroughs like solar powered planes which I understand to be near-impossible with today&#39;s technology.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-018-0021-4[2] https://sci-hub.se/https://www.nature.com/articles/s41893-01...[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_vests_protests"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The last line in this article is the most insane one of them all.&gt; ... Bento, who did not respond to a request for comment, said officials in that office had instructed him not to hand over any documents related to Castleberry’s 2006 drug case, including all records filed after May 2017 that actually pertained to Spriestersbach.&gt; Spriestersbach was not entitled to the documents, officials said.&gt; The reason: He was not the defendant in that case. He was not Thomas Castleberry.They are saying he is not allowed to get the documents for the case which he was the main suspect and subsequently hospitalized for since the documents for the case is for the other person. Even though it happened to him and not the other person. I&#39;m dumbfounded."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nevertheless, the officer insisted that Spriestersbach was actually Castleberry and took him to jail. He was fingerprinted and had his photo taken, generating records that could have been used to prove he wasn’t Castleberry, the Innocence Project asserts.It&#39;s beyond me how anyone has one iota of faith in the US judicial system anymore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We need to take away qualified immunity (which incorrectly protects the police officer involved from any kind of prosecution).Next, the police officer needs to face charges for his role in this.  He failed in his duty to the community.Finally, the police department needs to be held accountable for their role and pay damages to this man."</p>
