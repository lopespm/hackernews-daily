								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; ClojureScript is not that easy to integrate with the JS ecosystem. I know, there’s been a lot of improvements done in this space over the years, and I’m sure someone will immediately point me to relevant docs, but it’s still the extra mile you need to go when compared to regular JS codebaseThis always kills me. Clojure(script) is one of the neatest languages I&#39;ve ever used, but it is just such a pain to work with. I spent hours getting NPM imports working in a project, when it ought to take seconds. It really makes it hard to recommend, even though the language itself is amazing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The results keep getting &#34;refined&#34; so as to suit the popular 80% of queries, while getting much worse for any technical or obscure queries. Forced synonyms and &#34;people also searched for&#34; are typically useless and almost infuriating. Once you get off the first or second page, the results get even worse-- with pages entirely unrelated to the query (e.g. not even containing the searched phrases). They are probably testing/already implemented some sort of multi armed bandit type optimization like on Youtube&#39;s search results where they just show any popular pages (ignoring relevancy) to see if they yield a click.I&#39;ve used DDG for the past ~5 years, and it is typically worse without using a hashbang like !so for technical queries. I guess that is what the web has evolved to-- knowing which mega-site you want to search against rather than discover new sites?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It feels like the algorithm (combined with the SEO/marketing industry) has effectively nuked discussions from organic results.Based on the search box suggestions I get, it seems many people work around this by appending reddit to their searches. If I search for &#34;warmest winter coat&#34; it&#39;s a bunch of untrustworthy content marketing until you try something like &#34;warmest winter coat reddit&#34;Unfortunately I prefer to avoid reddit (which also has a fair amount of astroturfing), but I haven&#39;t found a good alternative. I severely miss Google&#39;s old &#34;discussions&#34; (or was it forums?) filter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a whole class of searches that no longer have value because of SEO. Try &#34;best exercise bike&#34; or anything that can be similarly monetized and you will of course end up at a well-crafted page designed to monetize you.My deepest apologies for saying this, but for any type of query that has a monetization angle, I now add &#34;site:www.reddit.com&#34; to the query to find actual discussion about it.Normal Reddit disclaimers apply as much of what you find is garbage but at least if you search &#34;best exercise bike&#34; confined to reddit you&#39;ll get real opinion not hellbent on monetizing you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems everyone here is confused. Here&#39;s the official FAQ, and it has 0 marketing garbage.https://aws.amazon.com/private5g/faqs/There&#39;s no &#34;telecom as a service&#34;, and there&#39;s no &#34;5g can be split into multiple networks&#34; nonsense.Amazon is just selling 5g access points and hardware (just like you would install wifi), and rents you a private connection for that hardware to AWS, and management of that network from AWS. Basically."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Become a telecom as a service!Super cool. For those who are glancing over, this is a big deal. 5G isn&#39;t really like 4G upgraded. It&#39;s more its own thing. I believe this has been available though for a while and many telecoms have partnerships with FAANG beyond Amazon.With 5G you can essentially split a network into multiple partitions and scale them independently on-demand called Network Slicing. (like cloud computing but just the network).This could be extremely useful for security. Maybe even the death of VPNs. This is also useful for scaling network resources to services as they need it.Short-term, things like &#34;Tesla Free Network&#34; could exist for their self-driving cars. Or, Uber offering free fast Internet to their drivers or a truly private device.Long-term, I am concerned about the emergence of private networks with different access. Such as a &#34;Google Network&#34; or a &#34;Netflix Network&#34; that offer different services or privacy levels at different costs.It&#39;s a crazy, scary, but also fun direction we are going.Edit: Final comment. If you think this might be the death of AT&amp;T with independent providers, think again . Amazon &amp; Co. and others like Google are bringing their developer platform, while the telecoms offer their infrastructure. It&#39;s a gross partnership that makes sense. When you send bits over the network -- everyone will be getting paid except you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me put my perspective, coming from a guy who is involved in private Cellular networking (US as well as other countries):1) Private 5G can be deployed either with licensed operator (Cellular provider) or in CBRS band (CBRS band is opened by FCC for the private cellular deployment). It can be used free or paid, different options. (Fees is minimal).2) CBRS still doesnt support 5G. No idea how AWS will provide. But even if it is private 4G, for the end user it doesnt matter.3) Your available bandwidth is limited by the air waves bandwidth you are using, nit by 4G or 5G. Per enterprise, CBRS band is limited to LTE equivalent band (20MHz). Total CBRS band is 200MHz, if I am not wrong). You are not going to get giga speed just because its 5G.4) Not all phones support CBRS band. You will be limited to CBRS band support in handset feature.
5) Each end device will need SIM (SIM card either physical or virtual). Its not like your laptop will be connected with private 4G or 5G. You will need modem as well as SIM card (unless your devices support these features).6) Its really for small geographic reason. Its not that easy to take the equipment with you and start using. (like in car or train etc).7) There is a concept of SAS server, that&#39;s why AWS device needs to be connected to this server in cloud (There are SAS license holders, to them). Once you install the system and that is connected to the SAS server, first you get the frequency band which is open in your area. If some one using that band (another CBRS player), you are out of luck (ask me , who has to call different teams when deploy in lab). PLus, there are scenarios when these licenses can be revoked (if you are using free band). The law enforcement can ask FCC to use the band temporarily. GCC can revoke your lic and stop the system.What AWS did is big, but for enterprises."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like this quote from the manual:&lt;&lt;There are a class of &#34;ideal attractors&#34; in engineering, concepts like &#34;everything is an object,&#34; &#34;homoiconicity,&#34; &#34;purely functional,&#34; &#34;pure capability system,&#34; etc. Engineers fall into orbit around these ideas quite easily. Systems that follow these principles often get useful properties out of the deal.However, going too far in any of these directions is also a great way to find a deep reservoir of unsolved problems, which is part of why these are popular directions in academia.In the interest of shipping, we are consciously steering around unsolved problems, even when it means we lose some attractive features.&gt;&gt;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We are gettig an increasing amount of interesting Rust operating system for different uses.- Hubris for deep embedded- Redox OS for Desktop/Server (https://www.redox-os.org/)- Tock for embedded (https://www.tockos.org/)- Xous for trusted devices (https://xobs.io/announcing-xous-the-betrusted-operating-syst...)I assume there are more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have an embedded real-time control project that is currently written in Rust, but runs with RTIC (https://rtic.rs/), a framework which is conceptually similar (no dynamic allocation of tasks or resources) but also has some differences. RTIC is more of a framework for locks and critical sections in an interrupt based program than a full fledged RTOS. Looking through the docs, here&#39;s the main differences (for my purposes) I see:1. In Hubris, all interrupt handlers dispatch to a software task. In RTIC, you can dispatch to a software task, but you can also run the code directly in the interrupt handler. RTIC is reliant on Cortex-M&#39;s NVIC for preemption, whereas Hubris can preempt in software (assuming it is implemented). This does increase the minimum effective interrupt latency in Hubris, and if not very carefully implemented, the jitter also.2. Hubris compiles each task separately and then pastes the binaries together, presumably with a fancy linker script. RTIC can have everything in one source file and builds everything into one LTO&#39;d blob. I see the Hubris method as mostly a downside (unless you want to integrate binary blobs, for example), but it might have been needed for:3. Hubris supports Cortex-M memory protection regions. This is pretty neat and something that is mostly out of scope for RTIC (being built around primitives that allow shared memory, trying to map into the very limited number of MPU regions would be difficult at best). Of course, it&#39;s Rust, so in theory you wouldn&#39;t need the MPU protections, but if you have to run any sort of untrusted code this is definitely the winner.Hubris does support shared memory via leases, but I&#39;m not sure how it manages to map them into the very limited 8 Cortex-M MPU regions. I&#39;m quite interested to look at the implementation when the source code is released.Edit: I forgot to mention the biggest difference, which is that because tasks have separate stacks in Hubris, you can do blocking waits. RTIC may support async in the future but for now you must manually construct state machines."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope everyone considers themselves as working for themselves, regardless of the actual vehicle that attaches themselves to their current income stream (job or their own company or whatever...)Even self-employed, you still have many bosses (customers, etc). In fact _those_ bosses can be harder to fire depending on contracting terms... And you might find it harder to churn out the sales to maintain a steady income stream.Even company-employed, you still should frame things in working-for-yourself. What are you getting out of the relationship? Is the employer holding up its end for you?The traditional, paternalistic concept of employment is outmoded. It says your career growth should be managed by your employer (don&#39;t let it...). It presumes the work you do and your job are always 100% the same (they&#39;re not). It assumes a kind of one-sided evaluation of the employee, where the employer has all the power (very untrue these days)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These stories always feel like they picked a few good anecdotes and interviews, but they wanted to present it as a national trend to make it sound like a bigger deal.Indeed, the statistics they provide aren&#39;t as significant as the headline suggests:&gt; Hundreds of thousands of Americans are striking out on their own...For reference, the United States has around 160 million employed people. 0.1% of them moving to freelancing might be significant, but is it really a new era? That was happening on the regular well before COVID.1 in 1000 people striking out on their own doesn&#39;t really explain the &#34;ongoing  shake-up in the world of work&#34; like they&#39;re trying to suggest."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems like a good place to say that I strongly recommend Yasha Levine&#39;s Surveillance Valley book (https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/34220713-surveillance-va...) where he suggests that all of this is working as intended, going all the way back to the military counter-insurgency roots of the arpanet first in places like Vietnam, and then back home in anti-war and leftist movements. The contemporary themes that are relevant are the fact that current privacy movements like Tor, Signal, OTF, BBG are fundamentally military funded and survive on government contracts. It distracts from the needed political discourse into a technology one where &#34;encryption is the great equalizer&#34; and everyone can resist big brother in their own way on the platforms the government has built. Encryption does exist, but it also distracts from other vectors like vulnerabilities (that led to Ulbricht getting caught), what services you would e2e connect to, how you get the clients to connect to those services, what store can push binaries for said clients etc."</p>

No need to sell the company. By the way, Facebook buys, does not sell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess I don&#39;t get it. This is based on speculative misuse - that FB may in the future deny access to Giphy to competitors.  So if you own a tool that your competitors may use then that&#39;s anti-competitive? Seems like that could apply to a lot of companies. Why not wait for actual misuse and base a case on that?Also what&#39;s so special about Giphy? Seems it could be duplicated fairly easily by any serious competitor.And competition being defined as other social media platforms? Pretty broad definition.Seems FB hatred is making bad law. And that bad law will bite others not just FB."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a UX problem on mobile. I have to click on something to make the GIF appear. What do I click? A link. Expected behavior of a link is to link me elsewhere, not to show a pop-up GIF, so I&#39;m immediately confused when that happens. I also can&#39;t figure out how to make the link actually link. Does it link anywhere? Is it even a link or just Jscript onClick thingy? Do I have to click on the GIF to make it link, because that&#39;s 2 clicks when precisely one is accepted link practice. Clicking to engage and then clicking again to disappear is super aggravating, especially on mobile screen, especially on such a long list. Click, click, click, click, click click, click, click. Ahhhh!This works well if I can hover over the links with a mouse to engage the pop-ups, which then disappear when I hover away. If I have to click on the links, like you do on mobile, then click again to dismiss, neither click actually linking to anything, it fails UX.Also, too much info in too small a space on mobile. Too much being communicated. Too dense. What UX test calls engineeritis. You need drill down pages for these links. If I click one, I expect a page with detailed information, a drill down, not a pop-up summary GIF.Mixed UX metaphors. Not lethal, but not quite there yet. Very cool, though, especially for the rapidity with which you were able to implement it, but it needs a bit more test on the UX side on mobile.A button toggle that displays a responsive, inline GIF as a drop-down, not pop-up, is perhaps the better solution, even if it&#39;s not quite as neat as what your creativity created. That would work as expected without damaging your intent, but that still involves click click click."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t use GIFs, use audioless mp4s instead. They can be made to work in the exact same way as GIFs (autoplay, loop or not, etc) but are a fraction of the bandwidth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not a bad idea in and of itself, but screw hover effects.I&#39;ve come to really hate everything involving hover.  On all sorts of websites there&#39;s some menu bar at the top or the side where it&#39;s way too easy for me to accidentally move my cursor over it and suddenly 1/5 of the page is blocked.  I really wish that these things could just be replaced with a click.  If I want to view a dropdown or something with dense details, I can jolly well click or tap on it.EDIT: Interestingly, it appears possible to intercept and nullify mouseover events.```document.addEventListener(&#39;mouseover&#39;, (e) =&gt; e.stopPropagation(), true);```Works on wellsfargo.com, making their menus work like I think they should.  Obviously it wouldn&#39;t work for CSS-based hover.Maybe I&#39;ll make this into an extension."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a wonderful surprise. DESQview (and anything early Quarterdeck) holds a special place in my heart.My uncle, Gary Pope, co-founded the company. I grew up with DESQview and QEMM as two of our primary pieces of software running on our computers.I moved onto Linux many years later, and used to have a Linux box as my primary machine, but with a DOS computer sitting next to it, DESQview/X loaded up, and would use DESQview/X as a makeshift second monitor by using it as an X11 display server.DESQview/X was based on X11R5, I believe, rather than X11R6, so I was a bit limited in terms of which software worked, but terminals were just fine.Anyway...A while back, I assembled all the DESQview/Quarterdeck material I had sitting around and put it up for others to look at. There&#39;s some stuff in here that you won&#39;t find anywhere else:https://www.dropbox.com/sh/htvf2edf3mrx0be/AABllqVhf0BzOytup...There&#39;s a README with some background, screenshots, marketing material, photos, product reviews, and even a paper that my mom wrote up about DESQ (the precursor to DESQview and DESQview/X), with a little bit of background on its development, back in 1984.Hope it proves interesting! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, looks like this has never had an HN thread before. One interesting submission (https://archive.org/details/desqview-x-booklet) but no comments:DesqView/X: A Technical Perspective [book] - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=7061438 - Jan 2014 (0 comments)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember running DesqView (without the X) in the early 90&#39;s, it must have been on a 286 (is that possible?), I only got a 486 around 1994.I remember being impressed by the fact that I could run multiple applications at the same time and switch between them. I think I ran a BBS at the time (a combination of Frontdoor and something else... the memory is thin).I vaguely remember excitingly showing my parents, probably my mother, &#34;Look! I can run multiple applications and switch between them!!!&#34;, and she gave me a confused look of &#34;what the hell is this boy going on about&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really hope the privacy-conscious people downloading this aren&#39;t just downloading these binary blobs and instead compiling it from source. Especially after seeing this disclaimer on their download page:&gt;&gt;&gt;IMPORTANT: These binaries are provided by anyone who are willing to build and submit them. Because these binaries are not necessarily reproducible, authenticity cannot be guaranteed. For your consideration, each download page lists the GitHub user that submitted those binaries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with this is updates: there is no trusted publisher of binaries, and even if you pick one person to trust, oftentimes builds are 6 - 8 weeks out of date with Chromium which means you&#39;re susceptible to all the published zero-days.Tried building it myself and it takes 4 hours on my 32-core 5950x, and you still depend on someone actually porting a version bump because their patches need to be regenerated for every new chromium build.I like the idea of it in principle; if someone donates some CI time and we get official CI builds, plus getting more active with picking up new builds it&#39;ll be a real contender. I&#39;ll stick with Firefox for now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s surprising to me is that this product not only removes Google services integration, but also adds rather opinionated &#34;Enhancing Features&#34; of its own. Many of these are pretty good, but not everyone will like all of them. I, for example, doesn&#39;t like the &#34;Force all pop-ups into tabs&#34; change.https://ungoogled-software.github.io/features/"</p>
