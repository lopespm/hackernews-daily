								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I checked the keyboard debouncing logic [0] and it was fine. Some keyboards from other manufacturers, notably Lenovo Thinkpads, have absurd debouncing algorithms that scramble keys or add delays, so it&#39;s good to see Framework has a correct solution.[0]: https://github.com/FrameworkComputer/EmbeddedController/blob..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been so happy to see what Framework has been doing lately, and really want to support them, but I already have a desktop as my primary computer and two Thinkpads that are already set up nicely, but that I rarely use. I moved from 15&#34; laptops to 14&#34; when Lenovo added the numpad on the larger variant, and 14&#34; is about as small as I want to go.I kind of want to buy a framework though, just to support them? But I have no use for another laptop, let alone a small 12&#34; one! Should I get one anyway because, what the hell, why not? Should I wait and then jump on one if/when they release a larger model?Anybody else have similar feelings?Edit to add:I also have one of the last Thinkpad models that support S3 sleep (T480 -- within a model or two, I think?), which is currently super critical for Linux... I need to be able to close the lid and come back after a week.It&#39;s easy to blame the manufacturers for this, but the consistent answer seems to be &#34;Intel&#39;s Tiger Lake platform does not support S3 sleep,&#34; and all of the system builders base their work on what Intel&#39;s reference platform does. So short of going to extreme effort to hack it together themselves (something that is likely not their specialty), reasonable sleep behavior is not going to be an option unless Intel brings S3 back, or does work to improve the S0ix states.I absolutely do not want to support the no-more-S3 clusterfuck right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running NixOS on my Framework for the last few months, and I&#39;ve been really happy with it. I initially got it so I&#39;d have viable hardware to do osdev on, so learning that they are going to open-source its firmware makes me even more happy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had another version of this at the DMV. They needed to see bills that offered proof of my residence (ie power/water/etc). Turns out they wanted them to be mailed to you, which wasn&#39;t going to work because I do paperless billing for everything. So I printed them out and tri-folded them as if it had been in an envelope.People in front of me in line got turned away for using printed bills, but mine worked just fine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really hate dealing with my printer (or any printer for that matter), so I make pretty liberal use of my drawing tablet at this point.  I import the PDF into Krita, use the ballpoint pen brush, and sign.  I export to PNG, then use an imagemagick script to rotate it some random number between 1-3 degrees, and add noise onto it to look like a scan.It&#39;s a pain, but it&#39;s still less annoying than dealing with a printer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a shell script based on ImageMagick that gives a PDF a &#34;scanner&#34; look.

It has avoided me the need to print and scan 100+ pages for a mortgage company, some stock brokers and banks.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m so glad Fly exists. Every other edge focused thing out there I&#39;m aware of are &#34;serverless&#34; which these days basically means they charge per request.That&#39;s fine for a lot of use cases, but the unit economics of the per request pricing model means it&#39;s really hard to operate a predictably sustainable (i.e. profitable) business without also charging our customers on a usage basis, or enforcing limits on usage, neither of which is ideal for maximizing engagement as incentives are no longer aligned.Fly just gives us compute at the edge for a predictable price per unit of actual compute resources as opposed to requests, and gives us freedom to serve as much traffic as we can min-max onto those resources, like we could with traditional cloud compute.This provides much better unit economics for many kinds of applications, at the cost of having to manage the scaling ourselves. But because the option exists, we can make this tradeoff on a case-by-case basis, which is so much better than if all we had was &#34;serverless&#34; stuff at the edge and had to choose between just low latency across the globe vs good unit economics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO, small projects most often do not need a database. It is much simpler to serialize to a binary encoding and read/write to disk. I have several small projects, even some with &gt; 100GB of data, that use this approach and it is very nice. I even have login/out without storing user data at all (yes, it is possible)...The primary exception to this being if you absolutely have to normalize your data (with key constraints), or need the transactional guarantees of a database."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fly is great.They’ve got Chris McCord there, who has already improved their Elixir deployment story. I tweeted a few weeks ago about improving the default Rails deployment experience to not require DB provisioning and configuration of env vars like SECRET_BASE_KEY and they said it would likely ship within the next 3 months.My hot take is they’re setting themselves up to ride the server-side rendered HTML renaissance we are experiencing with LiveView and Hotwire. It will become much more important to deploy applications geographically closer to customers to lower latency, which Fly makes sane for the rest of us."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is actually a brilliant location for them. One of those places that has much more going for it than people not from the region would realize.International airport, large rail depot, extremely low cost of living and a city/region that has more good restaurants and activities than might be expected. Ohio State University is in the city and is a huge school that is rapidly growing in academic standing. Road transit in the area is also very good allowing access to any part of the city from any other part in rapid fashion. Good schools, relatively low crime, etc. Probably the only drawback, from a lifestyle point of view, would be the winter and that&#39;s not even that bad, compared to other winter regions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This same street has a Facebook data center, an AWS data center, and a Google data center (within a couple of miles).  There is a biotech research campus, Bath &amp; Bodyworks main research lab, and the main operations center for AEP (a midwest electric company).  If you travel about 2-3 miles orthogonal to that street we have a big data center for Nationwide Insurance, a campus for Discover (credit cards), and a State Farm insurance facility.It is literally across street from one of the Ohio East-2 availability zones.  If they were making rack-mounted server boards, they could just walk them across the street and plug them into the cloud."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, cool! The model is specified as a constrained nonlinear optimization problem for which a solution is found using high-quality proprietary numerical solvers.[a] All partial differential equations specifying the model have a basis in economic theory or in heuristics and approximations shown to be consistent with reality. Parameters come directly from (what I assume is a large amount of) economic data collected by the Danish government.The authors working for the Danish government deserve an A+ for making their code and assumptions public, along with comprehensive high-quality documentation.[b] It was a delightful surprise to click on the link and find... a carefully curated repo.I have only one nitpicking: This looks like the kind of project that should have been -- and in fact probably should be -- implemented in Julia, instead of in a proprietary language. I suspect many heuristics and approximations could be more accurately modeled by ML components, interspersed between equations, as has long been proposed by Julia folks like Chris Rackauckas.--[a] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30028188[b] https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/DREAM-DK/MAKRO/mai..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that the model is implemented in GAMS[1], a proprietary language focused at constrained optimization problems (think Matlab, but more niche). This makes it a non-starter for most interested outsiders.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Algebraic_Modeling_Sys..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Economics is not a science like physics. We can&#39;t do controlled experiments, we can&#39;t falsify hypothesis. This leads to very muddy waters and what you are left with are two kinds of economists: Those who tell people what they want to hear and those nobody listens to.Econometrics gives people everything they want to hear, and with a scientific veneer as a bonus. The HN crowd should however appreciate how susceptible this is to the tyranny of metrics. Claude-Frédéric Bastiat warned of this over a century ago with his parable of the broken window: Think not only of what you can see (the glazier who is employed to repair the window), but also of what you cannot see (the alternative purchase of a suit) had the window not been broken."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since the article and the study are light on the details of &#34;persistent&#34; Here&#39;s the supporting data&#39;s in a bit more detail[0].Overall this makes sense to me as an individually who personally enjoys it. The whole point of getting high is to be impaired (for me). So it&#39;s not really telling me anything new. Like drinking, I can&#39;t expect myself to be 100% functioning the next day so plan accordingly.The question is how long is that persistence and how much does it affect? Permanent? Doesn&#39;t really seem to be answered in a way that I was hoping.[0] https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/action/downloadSupplement?do..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve known many people in silicon valley who smoke cannabis regularly (several times a week if not daily). They all seemed to be cognitively normal. Some of them function on a level I only wish I could attain.I think regular cannabis use attracts a certain type of person. That type of person can vary in their ability and intelligence, just like any type of person. This is also true of say, hardcore fans of fantasy fiction. They all have certain things in common, but you couldn&#39;t paint all of them as &#34;creative&#34; or any other trait.I&#39;m hesitant when hearing about long term effects, even on developing brains. Both Barack Obama and Carl Sagan smoked a ton of cannabis when they were younger. And they and others really turned out fine.This paper seems to be a meta study that combines the results from other studies. Since there were multiple methodologies it&#39;s hard to get a sense of exactly what questions they were answering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Before anyone freaks out too much:&#34;Persistent&#34; means up to one week. From the actual paper: &#34;However, results were not significant for an abstinence period of more than 7 days.&#34;Basically, science has proved that stoners behave like stoners. And if you stop it takes a few days for everything to wear off."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The strange trend of &#34;authoritarian minimalism&#34; design that seems to be working its way through the majority of newer software is very strange. I wonder who actually wants this stuff, and is not content to merely make it a default, but instead forces it to be the one and only way.Monitors are bigger than ever with huge resolutions, and yet UIs are being dumbed down to uselessness and alienating an increasing number of users.A recent related article https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29954266 seems to indicate that not even people inside Microsoft --- who are being forced to use Win11, because MS --- have any say in the matter. It&#39;s almost like some tiny extremist faction has gained control of Windows and is determined to show everyone else how much power they have by making these changes and gloating sadistically at seeing everyone object, but still end up using Windows.I wonder how much damage they will inflict before people start turning to WINE and a saner Linux distro, just to run their Windows applications."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My #1 issue with Windows 11 is not being able to un-group my taskbar items.I found having multiple instances of apps open across multiple monitors was extremely painful after using it ungrouped for so many years. And the little dot provided to indicate an open app is worthless. I resorted to StartAllBack to fix it. Everything else has been generally fine for me. So disappointed.There are several highly voted feedback posts and comments about the taskbar but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve seen anyone at MS acknowledge any of it.(Main suggestion is currently at 11k votes. https://aka.ms/AAeyt69)And as if that wasn&#39;t enough, sometimes just clicking the taskbar item does nothing. It can sometimes take several clicks to get it to re-open an app.https://twitter.com/vyrotek/status/1461748895906553856"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am mad about how slow the search is now. I used to press window button, start typing first few letters of app of choice hit enter and it would open. Now it takes like 3 seconds for the search to start and by muscle memory I&#39;ve hit enter now before its even warmed up and for whatever reason ends up doing a web search..That alone Makes me want to quit Windows."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow. I used to go to the mindfulness retreats at his affiliated monastery in San Diego. You left your phone in your car, and had 3-5 days (or more sometimes) of meditation, fresh cooked meals, and nature. It was really peaceful, and so different from what I had expected (something like a cult, being plied for donations etc. there was none of that). I stopped going when I left California, but it&#39;s hard to feel much more free than that these days. You&#39;re on a schedule for sleep, meals and events, basically making no decisions, and without internet pulling your attention, you feel like your mind is coming back to yourself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thich Nhat Hanh taught that just like a cloud seems to disappear from the sky, it&#39;s not really, it has simply changed form. The appearance of vanishing is just that: an appearance. Really nothing is created or destroyed. In this way, there is no loss here, Thầy has transitioned into another phase of life. A beauty worth celebrating"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This man was my first introduction to meditation.  I read his book &#34;the miracle of mindfulness&#34; when I was undergoing an extremely difficult, near suicidal period of my life, and it pulled me out and put me back on track.  I&#39;m indebted to him and I wish I had an opportunity to meet him."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is no reason to autocorrect a QR code scan. QR codes come with built-in error correction, so there’s a vanishingly small chance of a successfully-scanned QR code containing an error. It seems like Camera here might be treating QR code URLs as manually entered URLs or OCRed URLs and applying autocorrection logic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So far, I&#39;ve been able to reproduce a few transformations:* www[0-9].example.tld -&gt; [0-9].example.tld,
e.g. www1.nyc.gov -&gt; 1.nyc.gov* example[ac|co|gov|edu].tld -&gt; example.[ac|co|gov|edu].tld
e.g. exampleac.uk -&gt; example.ac.ukMy guess, as someone else further down the comments mentioned, is that some URL handling library is doing more than expected to its input. I filed an internal bug report referencing some of the public reports from a dev build of Android 12, so hopefully this will get triaged soon if someone hasn&#39;t already done a similar reproduction.(I work at Google, but on nothing remotely related to Android.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sigh. There is literally nothing I like about the changes in Android 12 versus 11.  This seems like yet another shoe-horning in of &#34;cleverness&#34; when it wasn&#39;t invited and in this case appears to be outright broken.After disabling every single assistant or enrichment option I could find, Android is still putting auto-reply prompts into any notification that has a reply button. GO AWAY!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I switched to this font a couple of years ago and I&#39;ve been unable to find anything that even comes close! At this point I would consider JetBrains Mono to be my forever font."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After playing the CodingFont that others commented (https://www.codingfont.com/), I ended up with this list of winners:* Cousine* JetBrains Mono* Roboto Mono* Source Code ProHowever, when actually testing, they all have a something that doesn&#39;t click as good as the Ubuntu Mono in terms of horizontal spacing.All these fonts are too wide, and the step from 10pt to 11pt causes a huge increment on horizontal space usage. Whereas Ubuntu Mono stays in a perfect sweet spot when set at 13pt.Anyone finding the same?EDIT: I made a quick visual comparison (mind that all of the fonts listed above have practically the same width):https://pasteboard.co/qZ8rvfV4aEHf.png"</p>
