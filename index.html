								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; But math never decreed that sine and cosine have to take radian arguments!That is not entirely true. It comes from the relationship between those functions and the complex numbers via the Euler formula.     ix
    e    = cos x   +   i sin x

There may be arithmetic/numerical inconveniences, but that&#39;s not all there is to &#34;math&#34;.Let&#39;s define ncos and nsin (&#34;nice cos, nice sin&#34;) as follows:   nsin x = sin 2πx
   ncos x = cos 2πx

So then what do we make of:   ncos x   +   i nsin x

This has to be   cos 2πx  +   i sin 2πx

which is then     2πix        (   2π) ix        ix 
   e           = ( e   )      =  f 

      
           2π
Where f = e    is a weird number like 535.4916. This f doesn&#39;t have nice properties. E.g.:      d     x           x
      -   f     /=    f 
      dx

Otherwise it works; for instance 90 degrees is 0.25 and surely enough     0.25i 
   f          = i

In situations not involving e in relation to angular representations via Euler, f cannot replace e.I&#39;m all for having parallel trig functions in libraries that work with turns, though.The annoying 2π factor shows up in lots of places though. Should way, say, in electronics, redefine a new version of capacitive reactance which doesn&#39;t have 2πf in the denominator, but only f?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author makes the point that turns allow for exact representation of many commonly used angles, but with binary floating point, many common angles (1/6 of a turn, for example) are inexact.This could be addressed by using a whole number other than 1 to represent a turn ... one that is a multiple of 3 (or 3x3) and 5, and while we&#39;re at it, 2 (or 2x2x2), so most commonly-used angles are whole numbers!  That gives us 360 as the value representing a whole turn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My favourite way of handling angles was always with either unsigned char or 16bit unsigned int that was treated as 1/nth of turn. Usually in these cases cos/sin tables were pre-calculated for speed, although that need went away to an extent. As long as as the calculations wrap around on the underlying system, it makes angles much easier to manage, because angle1 + angle2 = angle3 is always within 0 to 255 or 0 to 65535. Unfortunately I mostly work with higher level languages now that have mostly dropped integer types.If anybody knows how similar calculations can be easily achieved in JS for example, I&#39;d love to hear about it. I&#39;m sure there must be a better way than boundary checks and manual wrap-around."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can relate to the frustration of the author.
I wrote an open source library which gets downloaded 50K+ times per week.
At one point, I hadn&#39;t updated it in several months and people started asking if the project is dead...
In fact, it wasn&#39;t updated in a while because it had been working perfectly and was built in a forward-compatible way; that makes it more healthy and therefore more alive than probably 99% of libraries on the internet.The expectation that software libraries or frameworks should break every few months is disturbing. I think this may be due to the fact that many of the most popular frameworks do this.
I find that React-based apps tend to break every few months for a range of reasons; often because of reliance on obscure functionality or bundling of binaries which aren&#39;t forward-compatible with newer engine versions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; So I had to spend four hours on Saturday upgrading all my platform libraries simply so that I could compile the damn app.I sort of assume this is the actual point? Apple presumably wants to drop support for older versions of the SDKs, and that requires that app developers update to the newer versions. I think you can make a reasonable argument that dumping work on third-party developers to simplify things for themselves is bad, but the author&#39;s belief that it was simply pointless busywork is probably incorrect from Apple&#39;s perspective.I suspect the minimum download threshold to be exempt from this is _very_ high. Maintaining backwards compatibility for a small fixed set of apps doing things an old way is a categorically different problem from maintaining backwards compatibility for every app out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think culling games/apps based on age is the right approach to improving discoverability.I don&#39;t see Nintendo removing old Switch games from the eShop.I don&#39;t see Apple Music removing the Beatles because they haven&#39;t updated recently.My recommendation, which Apple&#39;s (obnoxious) ad business would never accept, would be to1. Remove the obnoxious and generally useless ads which eat up the top half of the first page of app search on the iPhone.2. Improve app search with more options and a fast, responsive UI. Also they might consider allowing you to consider ratings from other sources such as critical reviews vs. user reviews (a la metacritic.)3. Better human curation with more categories. This is the same approach that Apple Music takes and it seems to work well. Games should have Artist/Studio/Developer pages as well as Essentials lists to facilitate discovery. Same with genre/category essentials, which have a rotating list that can be saved/bookmarked."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A key fact to understand in thinking about cheating in over the board chess: a strong player can defeat a much stronger opponent with just 1-3 hints per game indicating the strongest move.  For example, most chess experts agree that a ~2600 rated player with 2-3 hints at key moments per game would be expected to beat a ~2800 rated player.  Many people might assume that a cheater needs guidance every move, thereby requiring a potentially more obvious cheating mechanism. That is not the case.Also, clever cheating devices have been found in over the board chess competitions.  So, this is possible.  Moreover, one needn&#39;t carry a device on themselves.  A cheater may have accomplices providing hints, if they carry a device.It will be interesting to see how chess tournaments, as well as FIDE, chess.com, and other major chess institutions react to this situation.  The potential for cheating has now been brought to the absolute forefront of chess discussion.  And Carlsen&#39;s actions have been questioned by FIDE in recent interviews, with FIDE staff condemning &#34;vigilantism&#34; of a kind.Some set of resolutions seems necessary--perhaps standards for security in major chess tournaments, perhaps an alliance to share cheating or reliability data amongst major chess operations, perhaps a standard term in major chess tournament agreements that no previously identified cheaters (online or otherwise) will be allowed to play, and perhaps sanctions in some form against Carlsen (or Niemann, if concrete evidence against him emerges)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imagine you know someone with a history of stealing cars and other valuable objects. He has been caught multiple times. Now you see him with a shiny new car that you’re pretty sure he can’t afford.Did he steal it? Not necessarily — it’s entirely possible that he got a higher-paying legit job and saved up for it, or inherited money from a relative, or got it legally in some other way. He shouldn’t be convicted of a new crime with no other evidence just because he committed similar crimes in the past.However, it would be entirely natural for a reasonable person to assume that theft is the most likely explanation of the facts, and to avoid trusting that person.This is basically what happened with Hans. He has been caught cheating multiple times, and then had an unusually fast rise in rating. Is that rise impossible? No. But it’s consistent with cheating, and given his history, cheating is the simplest explanation.So it would be totally normal for Magnus to refuse to trust such a person even though it can’t be conclusively proven that he’s still dirty. But even then, Magnus agreed to play against him, until further circumstantial evidence came to light and it just got to be too much.So, is it possible that Hans is clean? Sure. If that’s indeed the case, do I feel sorry for him? No. He made the choice to destroy his own reputation when he cheated multiple times. If he doesn’t get the benefit of the doubt now, it’s on him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe people might be seriously underestimating just how good Magnus may be at detecting cheating.Dude probably trains with computers regularly. He has a better memory than 10 average Joe&#39;s combined. He&#39;s been the absolute #1 of the world for what, 10 years now?He wouldn&#39;t risk his whole reputation for nothing.I personally take his suspicions very seriously, though I agree that evidence has to be presented sooner or later."</p>

So, let me bear my thoughts.Since July of this year I&#39;ve been CTO for a small games company, I&#39;ve worked in this industry before in a more specialised role but this is much broader scope.I&#39;ve gone from being responsible for 1 person to 10 which will likely become 50 by the end of next year.I&#39;m terrified.I&#39;m terrified because I feel like I will let my reports down.I&#39;m terrified because a lot of the work I&#39;m doing lacks transparency, how do I tell my compatriots about things that may not come to pass, especially deep political things -- and the amount of work necessary to onboard/offboard people, about &#34;strategic partnerships&#34; and why they&#39;re taken, or not taken or any of the hundreds of other things which are changing direction 3 times a day each.I am technical, deeply, passionately technical.I will not do service to people by being technical, my days are too fragmented, my worries too broad, it&#39;s impossible to dig into a small focused problem and give it the treatment it deserves - and even if I could then I&#39;d be dooming one of my colleagues to maintain it forever because I couldn&#39;t possibly..My being technical is good because I know the problems and I know what can make people feel valued; I can give people autonomy and direction and I can understand when help is needed and how to give it.However, almost nothing in my work is technical, it&#39;s all presentations, discussions, breakdowns, timelines, contracts and negotiation.The most code I write now is to do cost reporting.My most frequently accessed cloud console pages are the billing sections.This is not fun at all (and frankly, I didn&#39;t think it would be); but I fear what will replace me if I leave."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a difference between remembering something (like a fact) and a deep understanding of a concept.Let me give you an example in programming: I sometimes have to google for the names of functions I&#39;ve already used a hundred times. Sometimes extremely simple functions (just a while ago it was list.size() in Java), only because I can&#39;t remember the name of the function, but of course I understand the concept - the length of a list/array. I just can&#39;t remember if it&#39;s length(), or size() or count(), or whatever.This deep understanding feels quite different from simple memorization. It feels more like something in my body, similar to muscle memory or like playing a piano piece. It&#39;s something I feel I will never forget.I&#39;d love to learn more about this kind of understanding. For years I&#39;ve tried to find good reading about it, but much has been disappointing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has been using Anki for the past 4 years to learn Japanese and now Chinese, I&#39;ve recently found that the initial &#34;learning&#34; step is not that hard. (i.e., given 辞書, I remember &#34;dictionary&#34;) What is hard is keeping the content I&#39;ve learned, _learned_, for more than a day.So now I&#39;m wondering, is my initial &#34;learning&#34; process wrong? Since definitions are fairly simple and I find them easy to remember at first but hard to hold onto. And my process in Anki for New cards is to rep them like reviewed cards until I pass the card; so really, I&#39;m just staring at the kanji + definition until I remember it.This brings me to my question: is there more Anki can do when it comes to learning new cards? Is there something we can do when learning new information that will help make it &#34;sticky&#34;? Especially in regards to &#34;simple&#34; facts, like basic kanji -&gt; definition mappings, where there are no mechanics to understand, just simple mappings.Edit (an addition):Also, I love SRS, but I don&#39;t understand how it can be advertised as completely different than rote memorization. When you learn a new physical flashcard, you&#39;re learning it the same way as you would be when learning a new Anki card. The only difference is that Anki will show it to you again at a more efficient time in the future, rather than at some regular interval."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Calling learning remembering, is like calling a computer a hard drive. Sorry, but, remembering is just one part, although important part of learning. There is loads of difference between remembering the words of a foreign language and fluently speaking it. The process of learning is complicated, eg. good teaching is not giving the final answers to learner, which should seem faster, but letting the learner arrive at their answers, even sometimes arriving at a wrong answer at first.
And the point about reducing forgetting, that&#39;s also a terrible way of learning. If you want to minimize forgetting, that means you have to learn in baby steps, repeat everything using some kind of spaced repetition algorithm, and endure the pain of doing all this for a considerate amount of time. Instead, learning the content rapidly (meanwhile forgetting a lot of the content), getting a whole picture, and gradually gain more understanding repeating the process using different textbooks/courses, is a much more faster way of learning. The brain is more used to BFS (breadth-first-search) than DFS (depth-first-search), and the whole process is much more stimulating. This is because new knowledge needs to be encoded with connections to pre-existing knowledge, and most knowledge is intertwined together, for example in calculus, limits, derivatives, integrals, infinite series, etc. Learning limits in isolation of the whole picture, optimizing for less percentage of forgetting, often leaves learners confused, why am I even learning this, and what use is this for. Even though the percentage of forgetting is much higher in the latter holistic BFS process, the overall content mastered in the same month or week duration is higher. So forgetting is actually normal and you shouldn&#39;t panic when you forget things- since you will gain more understanding each time you learn and re-learn the content.
For the last ten years, I&#39;ve been making products for learning, and every day now and then, I&#39;m still learning something new about learning."</p>

A powerful exception to the &#34;double-pumping&#34; found in most other AVX512 instructions.* AMD seemingly handles the AVX512 mask registers better than Intel.* Gather/Scatter slow on AMD&#39;s Zen4 implementation.* Intel&#39;s 512-bit native load/store unit has clear advantages over AMD&#39;s 256-bit load-store unit when reading/writing to L1 cache and beyond."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the vpmullq part the most stunning.This instruction is used in some bignum code, for example if you are implementing RSA. Yet AMD implemented it three times faster than Intel.I&#39;m also fascinated by AMD now making AVX512 worthwhile on consumer devices (where they would until quite recently artificially slow down Intel CPUs that had it), which presumably will lead to widespread adoption where it matters. Intels strategy of turning off AVX512 in the recent consumer devices because their energy efficiency cores don&#39;t have it may turn out to be a monumental mistake."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"phoronix:AMD Zen 4 AVX-512 Performance Analysis On The Ryzen 9 7950Xhttps://www.phoronix.com/review/amd-zen4-avx512&#34;On average for the tested AVX-512 workloads, making use of the AVX-512 instructions led to around 59% higher performance compared to when artificially limiting the Ryzen 9 7950X to AVX2 / no-AVX512.From these results I am rather impressed by the AVX-512 performance out of the AMD Ryzen 9 7950X. While initially being disappointed when hearing of their &#34;double pumping&#34; approach rather than going for a 512-bit data path, these benchmark results speak for themselves. For software that can effectively make use of AVX-512 (and compiled so), there is significant performance uplift to enjoy while no negative impact in terms of reduced CPU clock speeds / higher power consumption (with oneDNN being one of the only exceptions seen so far in terms of higher power draw).AVX-512 is looking good on the Ryzen 7000 series and I&#39;ll continue running more benchmarks over the weeks ahead. These AVX-512 results make me all the more excited for AMD EPYC &#34;Genoa&#34; where AVX-512 can be a lot more widely-used among HPC/server workloads. &#34;"</p>

Instead of assuming that phones can be insecure and developing appropriate crypto based mechanisms, Cloudflare is proposing to bring the phone inside a &#39;trusted&#39; network. Remember, ZT does not rely on trusted network.Solutions like this will increase confusion and fragment the already &#39;interpretation led&#39; as opposed to definition led ZT landscape."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is there no opposition to this shit? SIMs were physical for a reason. As a consumer what do you get out of it? You have to go through the carriers to switch between phones now! You can&#39;t just pick up a random unlocked phone and put a sim in it. No more burner phones. I have been in situations where I changed SIM between phones multiple times a day.But it sounds like it is too late for this. It&#39;s like people who oppose cash payments out of the convenience of card/app payments. This small chipping away of a small libery adds up.I hope eveyone knows that you can&#39;t as a layman register an email address or any meaningful service you depend on without a phone number (i.e.: a sim), that is what is being regulated here even more."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Finally. Publish it all. Tracking of every vehicle, visible for everyone.It has been that way with aircraft for a long time. Pilots, however, are such a minority that noone really cares.Now that everyone is impacted, regulation might get updated (or someone might spend the time to identify existing regulation that prohibits this), and that would extend to other vehicles than those with wheels."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many are of the listed items are merely being deprecated. These shouldn’t really qualify as breaking changes. In fact, the ability to migrate away incrementally is precisely the point of deprecating instead of removing a feature.What surprises me is that a lot of the deprecated functionality seems really recent — C++14 or newer. Compatibility is C++’s big thing, that’s historically why it kept almost all of C as a sublanguage. I know organizations where migrating to C++11 is still an ongoing process. It’s not great news if features become obsolete faster than many users can adopt them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wait, so the words &#34;concepts&#34; and &#34;requires&#34; were newly made keywords, and this breaks code, but the words &#34;yield&#34; and &#34;await&#34; were determined too important and too common to standards members that they needed to be renamed to the horrifically ugly &#34;co_await&#34; and &#34;co_yield&#34;?Also, last time I actually tried to use C++20 none of the standard library implementations had std::format; has this changed now?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just a note but I&#39;m fairly certain this is purely from the perspective of Google Chrome, meaning it excludes google3 (Google&#39;s repo for nearly all Google services). I don&#39;t know this for a fact but I suspect it&#39;s the case. I only bring it up because google3 C++ is (or was; it&#39;s now been years since I&#39;ve done this directly) a very different beast. It was notionally compliant with recent standards but a very restrictive subset of features were allowed.The C++ standard currently sits at &gt;1800 pages. Looking through these examples, I&#39;m honestly horrified. The semantics around moving and copying and the many ways you can initialize a variable [1] and how you can mess that up so it&#39;s actually a copy instead of a move is just mind-bending.Can we also talk about how in 2022 we&#39;re still talking about and getting wrong const-correctness? I guess we&#39;re going ever further now because this presentation touches on constexpr correctness (as in const vs constexpr).Another thought: problems like comparisons between base and derived problems shouldn&#39;t even be problems (IMHO) because you&#39;ve already messed up by wanting that behaviour.The change about not doing arithmetic on enum values is a good one but pretty late.TIL this is a valid way to cast:    size_t{expanded_size}
