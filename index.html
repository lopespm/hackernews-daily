								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the mid nineties I worked in a research institute. There was a large shared Novell drive which was always on the verge of full. Almost every day we were asked to clean up our files as much as possible. There were no disc quota for some reason.One day I was working with my colleague and when the fileserver was full he went to a project folder and removed a file called balloon.txt which immediately freed up a few percent of disk space.Turned out that we had a number of people who, as soon as the disk had some free space, created large files in order to reserve that free space for themself. About half the capacity of the fileserver was taken up by balloon.txt files."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For everyone saying &#34;This isn&#39;t a real solution!&#34; I&#39;d like to explain why I think you&#39;re wrong.1) It&#39;s not intended to be a Real Solution(tm). It&#39;s intended to buy the admin some time to solve the Real Issue.2) Having a failsafe on standby such as this will save an admin&#39;s butt when it&#39;s 2am and PagerDuty won&#39;t shut up, and you&#39;re just awake enough to apply a temp fix and work on it in the morning.3) Because &#34;FIX IT NOW OR ELSE&#34; is a thing. Okay, sure. Null the file and then fill it with 7GB. Problem solved, for now. Everybody is happy and now I can work on the Real Problem: Bob won&#39;t stop hoarding spam.That is all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Same idea as this game development legendhttps://www.dodgycoder.net/2012/02/coding-tricks-of-game-dev...&gt; he had put aside those two megabytes of memory early in the development cycle. He knew from experience that it was always impossible to cut content down to memory budgets, and that many projects had come close to failing because of it. So now, as a regular practice, he always put aside a nice block of memory to free up when it&#39;s really needed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think people are giving enough credit to how stuck the ship is.Look at some of the photos of the front of it.  Look at how far out of the water it is sitting.  The ship might look like that if it were totally empty, but not when it is full of containers like this.Some people saying: just drag it off of the sand.  Okay!  And what happens when that causes you to rip a hole into the hull of the ship?  Now it&#39;s really stuck.Some people have suggested unloading the ship.  I don&#39;t think you realize the infrastructure required to unload a ship.  You&#39;re basically asking to build a port in the middle of the egyptian desert.  That isn&#39;t going to happen.It&#39;s really stuck.  It&#39;s probably going to take a couple of weeks to get it unstuck."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun facts:1. The owner is Japanese2. The operator is Taiwanese3. The flag is Panamanian4. The cargo is Chinese5. The insurer is British6. The crew is Indian7. The canal is Egyptian and was built with forced labor by the French8. The dredgers/salvage op managers are Dutch"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It will be weeks before this ship is free.Fuel and oil can be pumped out but that only makes up a fraction of the total weight of the vessel. Containers can be unloaded but again the lightest will be at the top so a significant number will need to be removed to make a big enough difference. And unloading them will be a slow process. You can maybe unload a few per hour with helicopters. There doesn&#39;t exist any infrastructure which could get to that location and lift off containers. You could build a custom crane barge but that would take at least a month to fabricate and get to the site. The easiest way to remove containers will be using cutting equipment, winches and possibly explosives. It won&#39;t be easy and will likely take several weeks to unload a significant number of containers, the ship and containers will be damaged in the process.That leaves dredging the sand under the ship. Again the infrastructure to do this rapidly doesn&#39;t exist. You can dig out the sand around the ship but there is a huge amount that the ship is resting on. It will take specialist dredging equipment to start removing this sand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; There is a popular opinion among developers that SQLite is not suitable for the web, because it doesn’t support concurrent access.No, the issue is it doesn&#39;t have high availability features: failover, snapshots, concurrent backups, etc. (Edit: oops, comment pointed out it does have concurrent backups.)SQLite isn&#39;t a toy DBMS, it&#39;s an extremely capable embedded DBMS. An embedded DBMS is geared towards serving a single purpose-built client, which is great for a desktop application that wants a reliable way to store user data.Once you have multiple clients being developed and running concurrently, and you have production data (customer accounts that are effectively legal documents that must be preserved at all times) you want that DBMS to be an independent component. It&#39;s not principally about the concurrent performance, rather it&#39;s the administrative tasks.That requires a level of configuration and control that is contrary to the mission of SQLite to be embedded. They don&#39;t, and shouldn&#39;t, add that kind of functionality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve built a complex CRM that handles 2.1 million USD in transactions every year. It is running sqlite with a simple in-memory lru cache (just a dict) that gets purged when a mutating query (INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE) is executed. It is very simple and more than fast enough.Friendly reminder that you shouldn&#39;t spend time fine tuning your horizontal autoscaler in k8s before making money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With no sense of overstatement here, SQLite is one of my favorite creations in the entire world, so I have a bunch of links some of you might find interesting if you want to dig further:https://github.com/sql-js/sql.js - SQL.js lets you run SQLite within a Web page as it&#39;s just SQLite compiled to JS with Emscripten.https://litestream.io/blog/why-i-built-litestream/ - Litestream is a SQLite-powered streaming replication system.https://sqlite.org/lang_with.html#rcex3 - you can do graph-style queries against SQLite too (briefly mentioned in the article).https://github.com/aergoio/aergolite - AergoLite is replicated SQLite but secured by a blockchain.https://github.com/simonw/datasette - Datasette (mentioned at the very end of the OP article) is a tool for offering up an SQLite database as a Web accessible service - you can do queries, data analysis, etc. on top of it. I believe Simon, the creator, frequents HN too and is a true SQLite power user :-)https://dogsheep.github.io/ - Dogsheep is a whole roster of tools for doing personal analytics (e.g. analyzing your GitHub or Twitter use, say) using SQLite and Datasette."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Whatever was said at the time, I’m convinced Google Reader was collateral damage from the Bay of Pigs Google Plus effort. It had social features (which I honestly never used) and anything social had to be G+.Still, I honestly don’t understand why this is the hill people want to die on, what they feel most betrayed about. Like I haven’t seen some people this upset since Firefly was canceled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was in the summer of 2008, three years after Google launched Reader and had at least 5 million users, when I decided to write my own RSS reader. There were just so many features I wanted that I knew Google would never build and for some strange reason I thought I could make money with my own opinionated take on a news reader.Then at 4pm on March 13th, 2013, I got an email from Nilay at The Verge asking if I&#39;d heard the news. That was a difficult month as I scaled (and wrote about scaling[0]), since by then Google Reader had 10 million active users. After Reader was sunset, about 5 million found their homes on the news readers that remained.It&#39;s strange to think that naively competing with one of the big platforms paid off, but there&#39;s plenty of companies that did well in the wake of a giant choosing to ignore the ecosystem near their feet.[0]: https://blog.newsblur.com/post/45632737156/three-months-to-s..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All these years later, I still use the Google Reader frontend (with newsblur as the backend).It turns out that Reader&#39;s UI assets were stand alone enough that you could just implement the backend API and it all would work.I saw this originally in a project for viewing your Reader Takeout data[1], and just built on that idea to make my own personal Google Reader experience.[1]:  https://github.com/mihaip/readerisdead"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Probably an unpopular opinion, but I don&#39;t think most people who buy a Linux phone actually want a Linux phone. They want an open-source phone. The Linux philosophy isn&#39;t important to them, they essentially want open-source iOS (with all of the polish and out-of-the-box doodads). They want the ability to make modifications, and they want the freedom and transparency that open-source gives them, but they don&#39;t necessarily want to open a PR against the camera app if they want it to more closely match the polish of iOS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OK I&#39;ll bite. I wrote a plugin to get mmsd to function with modem manager and I wrote a reference implimentation to integrate MMS functionality into chatty. I also took the time to make sure my patches were upstreamable, and I have taken and worked on every feedback to ensure my patches are upstream able. I filed the ITP bug to include mmsd into Debian proper.I did all of this back from December to February.I still have no idea when Debian will bother to look at the mmsd packaging to include it into their repository, nor when my changes for chatty will be integrated. The ofono mailing list and IRC channel (i.e. the original authors of mmsd, but i think they abandoned it as they have said it hasn&#39;t been maintained in 8 years) have ignored me, so I doubt my changes will ever go back into upstream mmsd (I just consider what I have a fork now). I&#39;m waiting on the chatty dev to finish off a current project to then get to integrating my MMS patches into chatty.I still really want to help, but there&#39;s not much for me to do except wait for upstream devs to get around to integrating my work.Being frank, I&#39;m frustrated that I spent all of that time to implement a feature I want and I know a lot of other folks want, but now I&#39;m just in a limbo hoping that others will get around to it.So I&#39;ll ask, if you want folks to help on the boring things or missing functionality, how do you prevent that from happening?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes I want a Linux phone. But I also want one that has similar app support to Android and iOS.The problem is not with the Linux phones that are out there, it is that no apps are and likely never will be compatible with (non-Android) Linux phones. Until that is solved, most people (like me) could not switch out their phone for a Linux phone as a daily driver, however much they would like.Having Linux as an alternative for Windows is a lot easier than having Linux as an alternative for Android/iOS. A lot of the Windows applications we use can be replaced by opensource applications on Linux. And browser based applications already work on both.However, apps on Android/iOS are mostly tied to cloud services. Unfortunately services that most people need in this age. Messaging systems like WhatsApp and Signal are usually tied to your phone, and going without them would result in social isolation for a lot of people. But also for banking and sometimes government services, you likely need to use their apps. And there will never be opensource alternatives for such apps."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Cal Newport said it best in his book Deep Work: the ability to perform deep work is becoming increasingly rare at exactly the same time it is becoming increasingly valuable in our economy. As a consequence, the few who cultivate this skill, and then make it the core of their working life, will thrive.The people who cultivate that skill, stay up late at night while everyone is asleep so they don’t get distracted. Then they come in late because they need sleep like every one else. As a consequence, deep thought workers are seen by their immediate and responsive counterparts as obtuse, eccentric, or worse: lazy and unable to manage their time.This really comes down to the workers dilemma. Do you spend your time marketing your self to others and letting people know your accomplishments, or do you spend the time doing work that will benefit others? Deep thought workers will bias heavily towards work that will benefit others. This benefit is often non-obvious deep thought workers will run the risk that their peers, that are more connected and more reachable, will take the credit for the results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m constantly amazed at how the mainstream population uses phones.Most people tend to have phone with alarming-notifications, so they get informed that they have a message, or email or whatever. The phone interrupts them and directs their attention. They train themselves to be controlled by their phones.I&#39;d go crazy trying to live like that. I have no audible notifications, and vibration only for actual calls. Everything else: I&#39;ll see it when I see it. I tend to think of it as receiving a letter -- I&#39;ll see it when I check if there&#39;s any post, I don&#39;t need to be interrupted right away. Personal space and all that.It just seems so mentally unhealthy. The same applies to sleeping with your phone in the same room."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"this constant urge to check your phone, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s much different from an OCD. OCDs constantly interrupt the normal flow of one&#39;s thought processes with obsessive, intrusive interjections (&#34;you are dirty&#34;, &#34;did I do x/y?&#34;, &#34;maybe you are gay&#34;, etc).that&#39;s what apps have instilled into our minds: a constant urge that interrupts our thought processes, so that we check fb, WA, gmail, etc.I switched all notifications off and I still have this, less than previously, but still. I am thinking of going back to a brick phone because of that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently ported a reinforcement learning algorithm from PyTorch to Julia. I did my best to keep the implementations the same, with the same hyperparameters, network sizes, etc. I think I did a pretty good job because the performance was similar, solving the CartPole environment in the a similar number of steps, etc.The Julia implementation ended up being about 2 to 3 times faster. I timed the core learning loops, the network evaluations and gradient calculations and applications, and PyTorch and Julia performed similar here. So it wasn&#39;t that Julia was faster at learning. Instead it was all the in-between, all the &#34;book keeping&#34; in Python ended up being much faster in Julia, enough so that overall it was 2 to 3 times faster.(I was training on a CPU though. Things may be different if you&#39;re using a GPU, I don&#39;t know.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Julia is such a wonderful language. There are many design decisions that I like, but most importantly to me, its ingenious idea of combining multiple dispatch with JIT compilation still leaves me in awe. It is such an elegant solution to achieving efficient multiple dispatch.Thanks to everyone who is working on this language!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running the 1.6 release candidates, and the compilation speed improvements have been massive. There have been plenty of instances in the past where I&#39;ve tried to &#39;quickly&#39; show off some Julia code, and I end up waiting ~45 seconds for a plot to show or a minute for a Pluto notebook to run, and that&#39;s not to mention waiting for my imports to finish. It&#39;s still slower than Matlab for the first run, but it&#39;s at least in the same ballpark now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is cool! I really enjoyed playing around. Some feedback:1. Do not ask for signup before making a theme. There is so much power in allowing users play around without friction. You will get signups from users that are interested.2. Make the editor preview itself a selection tool for various colors and other items. That would make it a whole lot easier to use3. Allow grouping of colors. Some colors are always set to the same value. Allow setting the colors individually too. But users often want harmony."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi HN,I built the VS Code Theme Studio after realizing how hard and annoying it is to create a theme the standard way.
You have to tweak tons of hex color codes in a huge JSON file... yuck.
Most of the time you don&#39;t even know which settings to edit, or how they actually affect the UI.
I wanted to build a much more intuitive and user-friendly way of designing VS Code themes, so that anyone could design a beautiful, polished theme in under an hour (instead of a week).
In a future iteration, I want to make the theme studio even handle the process of publishing your theme to the VS Code marketplace for you.
This way, all you&#39;ll have to do is design the theme, and click a single button... &#34;Publish&#34;.
I had a lot of fun building this and I look forward to seeing the themes you create :)(Built with my favorites: Vue.js + Nuxt.js + Firebase)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are ways that people talk about gentrification that always makes me slightly uncomfortable. As a non-white person, something always feels like gentrification is something that “good” white people like to blame “bad” white people for doing, when the real problem tends to be wider and more systemic.In this particular instance I find myself asking why it matters that the Weaver residents were originally not from Austin. If you’re born in Chicago, shouldn’t you still have the same rights as someone who was born in Austin? That includes the right to complain. However it doesn’t mean anyone has to listen to you. As other users have pointed out, it’s not exactly a new situation for people to move to a neighborhood and immediately try and kick their neighbours out. It’s just that most of the time they’re told to kick rocks.It seems to me the real crux of this issue is that rich white people are so much more prioritized by the law that a couple of irate Karens can overrule an entire neighbourhoods opinion. It has nothing to do with where they’re from or gentrification.Not that gentrification doesn’t cause it’s own problems. But the way some people talk about it, as though existing residents are entitled to a higher set of rights, leads down some pretty dark paths, especially when newcomers are of a different nationality, or race than current residents. It reminds me of something that used to be said a lot in jest when I was younger in the 90’s and 00’s and working in fast food. Whenever people gave me extra work to do, they justified it by saying something like, “well, he should just be grateful he isn’t working in a rice paddy” (I’m from Singapore originally, but ok). There seemed to be this view that because my parents chose to move to Canada when I was young, I was somehow entitled to fewer rights, even as a citizen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in this neighborhood, about three blocks north of where the car club meets. I’m white. I’m a homeowner. You get the picture.Honestly, these people complaining in Weaver sound insane. They moved into a community and it’s their job to integrate with the community. We have a Brit who lives on my street that does community organizing and he’s been wonderful about building a sense of community that integrates the old and new residents. They should really be talking to him or Pio, mentioned in the article, instead of calling the police and accusing the car club of dealing drugs. Yeesh.With that said, I think there are legitimate criticisms about the car club. For one, they absolutely trash the place every Sunday. When I walk down to the lake on Monday, there’s just tons of trash on the ground. I don’t know who picks it up but it’s certainly not the car club.Also, doing burnouts and donuts on public streets sounds fun but it leaves the road covered in tire rubber and I imagine it smells awful while they’re doing it.Those are basically the two things I’d like to see change, and in my humble, gentrifier opinion, they seem like reasonable issues to talk about with the community. Instead of having those conversations, we get white people leveraging their white privilege in the worst ways and anarchist groups like “Defend Our Hoodz” intimidating new businesses that open up. Fun times in my little corner of the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be fair, I&#39;m a middle-aged white engineer raised in San Jose, CA relocated to ATX in Dec 2020.I live at the corner of I-35 east-side frontage and 5th in a mega apartment complex. I&#39;ve tried meeting many of my neighbors and most are asocial/antisocial. There are 2 women roommates and an African-American kid who are legit cool that I&#39;ve met so far. Also, I don&#39;t even know the people across the hall. My conclusion from many interactions is my neighbors are mostly phony, little life experience, selfish, corporate clones who steal shopping carts and leave them blocking the hallways, let their dogs pee everywhere in the hallways and don&#39;t clean it up, throw garbage on the floor, don&#39;t wear masks, don&#39;t talk to one another, sit by the pool on their phones, and act phony cool like they&#39;re still in high-school. Heck, my upstairs neighbor complained about my music on the weekend during the day without introducing themselves and not diplomatically. Point being: gentrifiers tend to be mostly uncool and don&#39;t care about anything other than forcing their own bubbles on everyone else.More power to Austin car clubs. Let the gentrifiers pound salt.Edit: I would like to move somewhere near cooler people, but I&#39;m probably going to have to grow a social circle to find that. Also, I wonder if more upscale or cheaper housing tends to attract or repel cool peeps."</p>
