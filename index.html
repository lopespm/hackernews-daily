								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My partner sat in the same cube pod as someone who took their life. One day they were just gone and a crying family member came by to take away a box of things. There was no official acknowledgement of what happened, no service or memorializing, only hushed whispers. It was terrible.Thank you for your humane response to Pete&#39;s death, for creating room for the team to grieve and official acknowledgement that it was no longer business as usual. This is one of those moments that leadership really matters. There&#39;s more to being a leader than shipping a volume of features, you are also an important figure in the lives of your team and they need you in a time of crisis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pete would ask to work more hours. He claimed he could use the money. He was a contractor rememberAmidst the loss here, this line stood out to me and brings to mind all the terrible ways contractors are taken advantage of, or at least, treated and compensated vastly different than their &#34;staff&#34;/&#34;full-time&#34; peers who are often doing the exact same work. For fun, google the phrase &#34;permatemp&#34;.E.g. I had a past job as a middle manager where my team interfaced heavily with a group of contractor developers overseas.  When the time came to demo new features and place superlatives upon the various teams, I noticed my leadership cadre said nothing about the contractors and did not acknowledge any of the work they had done.I spoke up about it when the floor was given for anyone else to give kudos where they desired, and mentioned the overseas team and thanked their team lead for working with me on delivering. He spoke up and expressed his gratitude in kind.Apparently, this got my CTO into &#34;trouble&#34; with &#34;legal&#34; because I guess merely acknowledging contractors was some kind of a &#34;problem&#34;. As a result, my boss got in trouble. As a result, I got written up. I was out of that company within six months after relationship with my boss and CTO deteriorated immediately after I opened my darn mouth.For expressing gratitude.To contractors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I interviewed with my current company (where we work mostly-remote) last year. One of my interviewers was a very sharp, experienced, and nice developer. After I learned they were going to make me an offer, I emailed my interviewers, and this developer emailed me back saying he was looking forward to working together.The week before I started, he passed away in a car accident. I was really looking forward to working with him, but I never got the opportunity.As soon as I found out, I again emailed everyone I knew at the company to express my condolences.When on-boarding I said “I know I’m joining at a rough time for the team”. It turned out it was the day after his funeral (which I found out my manager and at least some devs attended). They didn’t seem to be expecting empathy from a brand new hire, but some folks were obviously still mourning. I’m glad I acknowledged their loss. We didn’t dwell on it, but it might have been really awkward if I had just charged like a bull into a China shop saying “I’m so psyched to be joining your team!!!” as if nothing had happened.In my inbox, I also found an email from our CEO to the whole company (about 100 employees) from the week of his passing.There is also an archived Slack channel to memorialize him where different folks who knew him shared their fond memories. The company established an annual teamwork award in his name. And a lot of folks contributed to a GoFundMe for his son’s education.All of these things are strong indicators that I’m at an awesome company. We don’t say we’re “a family” (don’t believe it if your company or prospective company claims that - often it’s an outright lie and otherwise it’s code for a toxic culture with no boundaries), but we do care about each other.No matter your position, if empathy doesn’t come naturally, learn it. It will serve you in so many situations in life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience docker-slim[0] is the way to go for creating minimal and secure Docker images.I wasted a lot of time in the past trying to ship with Alpine base images and statically compiling complicated software. All the performance, compatibility, package availability headaches this brings is not worth it when docker-slim does a better job of removing OS from your images while letting you use any base image you want.Tradeoff is that you give up image layering to some extent and it might take a while to get dead-file-elimination exactly right if your software loads a lot of files dynamically (you can instruct docker-slim to include certain paths and probe your executable during build).If docker-slim is not your thing, “distroless” base images [1] are also pretty good. You can do your build with the same distro and then in a multi stage docker image copy the artifacts into distroless base images.[0] https://github.com/docker-slim/docker-slim[1] https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This and other common considerations and gotchas are brought up in Shekow&#39;s excellent Docker optimization guide.https://www.augmentedmind.de/2022/02/06/optimize-docker-imag...Was posted here last month: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30406076"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using `COPY --chmod` is not the correct solution for this. It works, of course, but it isn&#39;t very logical from Dockerfile readability standpoint. The real issue is the incorrect use of multi-stage builds. In multi-stage builds you define additional build stages where you prepare your binaries(eg. compiling them) and copy to the final runtime stage, so your final stage remains clean of temporary files created by your build steps. Based on your comment in your current build stage you run curl, extract etc., but you don&#39;t actually finish preparing the binary by correcting the executable bit. Instead, you copy the half-prepared binary to runtime stage and then try to continue your further modifications there. Eg. similarily if you would skip extracting step, copy the zip instead and extract it in runtime stage and then you would have the zip and the final binary in your exported image.Another red flag is that you run `apt-get` after copying the binary to runtime stage(because you still want to tweak the binary there). That means any time source for binary changes, the `apt` commands need to run again and are not cached. If you just add the executable bit in your build stage you can reorder them, so the `COPY` comes after `RUN`."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These comments make me feel like I&#39;m getting old, which is weird to me. There are so many proactive comments that remind me of my 18 year old self.Social awkwardness, for me and for a lot of people I know, sort of just vanished with age.
- The same kind of weird, unexplainable, vicious attitude that passes for cool among teenagers and some early adults fades for most people. The people who still adhere to that code go off and form their own cliques and you just don&#39;t see them anymore.
- Real adulthood is simpler socially. With personal stability (job, hobbies, network, etc.) and age you care less and less what people think and put less emphasis on what people think about you.
- At the same time, you judge people less and less because, what does your judgment really matter? And when you judge people less you judge yourself less.
- A lot of awkwardness is a function of trying hard to fit a social shape and failing. When you let go of most social expectations of yourself and others, in my experience mostly because of age and stability, you lose the awkwardness.If you really need help with social anxiety I have heard that there are psychologists who are good at treating it, although I have never used one myself.Take some comfort in knowing that it will probably pass with time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Practice. Practice practice practice. Which sounds daunting, but……now, I realize it’s unfair to map physical appearance to awkwardness, but…let’s take a look at me in 2008 versus 2021. https://imgur.com/7sR0qKt Can you infer I might have been awkward? Because I was awkward. Always had been, and in a lot of ways, I am still am.But I am vastly better than I used to be. And it was practice. Slow, slow, slow practice. I started at the gym. Built a little confidence. Got a job where I was required to be in more meetings. Built a little more confidence. Moved to a new city. Built even more confidence. Joined a sports league. Built yet even more confidence. It’s a slow process of leveling up and being out there and exposed to the world and learning to live in it.And as you get older, I find for me it’s gotten easier. People in their late-20s and 30s are not the back-biting den of snakes they were in high school—everyone begins to realize they have their own faults and foibles, and you begin to accept that other people are always going through things too. And, conversely, you begin to realize you’re never the star of anyone else’s internal story. People are paying far less attention to your awkwardness than you think. So…roll with it, find some hobbies you like that involve other people, and just keep practicing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Throwing myself out there, getting rejected and snubbed otherwise slapped around a lot .. until I slowly started to figure out how to observe &#34;normal, healthy&#34; people and learn from them.Among the things we learn is -- that we are much more &#34;plastic&#34; (and able to change by sheer force of will) than we initially thought.  Things like hygiene, posture, clarity of speech (such that people can at least understand us) and tonal confidence are, for many of us, simply matters of bad habit that can be unlearned and their negative effects reversed, over time.The more we improve ourselves in these basic areas, the better we feel about ourselves... and soon enough people notice, and over time it becomes not only gets easier but starts to feel natural.  Not instantly but... over time.  Until the day comes when you stop thinking (so much) about how &#34;awkward&#34; you are, and instead you&#39;re thinking about your new life, your new friends, your hot new relationship, your awesome new day job (if that matters), etc.That and two other tips:  (1) Taking the plunge, and moving to a totally new geographic area (or even just getting a different, much better place in the city where you live) can do wonders; as does (2) Paradoxically, not giving an F about what other people think.  That is to say, acknowledging that it matters to some degree, on a certain level ... but in the scheme of things, it also just doesn&#39;t matter.   Which helps you relax and feel confident (which does a lot to ameliorate the negative perceptions people have of you)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unfortunately, this (really nice) PDF isn&#39;t complete.For me an Operating System means processes in userland, sadly it comes short of that.I&#39;m now pushing my own x86 32bit OS in Rust using [0][1]:There is definitely a shortage of information on this stuff (for example writing a USB driver is really hard and I couldn&#39;t find easily available tutorials - you have to resort to raw *HCI and USB specs to get things done).[0] https://wiki.osdev.org/Expanded_Main_Page[1] https://os.phil-opp.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the PDF:
&#34;It is true: in our quest to make full use of the CPU, we must abandon all of those helpful routines provided by BIOS. As we will see when we look in more detail at the 32-bit protected mode switch-over, BIOS routines, having been coded to work only in 16-bit real mode, are no longer valid in 32-bit protected mode; indeed, attempting to use them would likely crash the machine.&#34;So what this means is that a 32-bit operating system must provide its own drivers for all hardware of the machine (e.g. the keybaord, screen, disk drives, mouse, etc). Actually, it is possible for a 32-bit protected mode operating system to switch temporarily back into 16-bit mode whereupon it may utilise BIOS, but this teachnique can be more trouble than it is worth, especially in terms of performance.&#34;--In the toy 32-bit OS I am currently writing, having easy disk access and text output was more important to me than performance, so I decided to implement this technique to access the disk and screen via the BIOS instead of writing an ATA disk driver.Although I could not find any minimal yet complete working examples of dropping to 16 bit and later resuming 32 bit mode, I was able to piece it together and write assembly functions called enter_16bit_real and resume_32bit_mode. See https://github.com/ironmeld/builder-hex0/blob/main/builder-h.... Those routines are working well but beware the project is a volatile work in progress and is coded in hex for bootstrapping reasons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://www.udemy.com/course/writing-your-own-operating-syst.... If someone interesting It&#39;s good course for OS kernel development. Using this course, I was able to write a 64-bit kernel with memory management, user space, file system, shell. It only lacks an ata disk driver for something like minimum complete kernel. https://github.com/JustVic/melisa_kernel. Sorry for the ads."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apparently Vanced was a patched YouTube app for Android, removing ads, adding a dark theme and YouTube Premium features (probably more ?).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a feeling that any piece of closed-source software that becomes important enough will inevitably be reverse engineered by highly motivated people. This is doubly so for Vanced: The original team took pains to not release the source, but it merely took a few weeks for someone else to reverse engineer the reverse engineered codebase.I&#39;ve worked on preserving a few games with decompilers long after the original creators have moved on. Anecdotally, the death of Flash all but killed off a couple of assorted communities that didn&#39;t have enough motivation to hack the binaries themselves.My guess is the only software that can perpetually maintain a community is software where the source code is available to be modified."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A quick trivia question: when you compile a program using GCC and do not specify the name of the output binary, an A.out file gets created. Is that A.out binary using the A.out format, or is it an ELF binary?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The NetBSD kernel still has support for a.out.  On BSD, a.out is something simpler than ELF that works without any problems.^1  On Linux, a.out may have caused problems when building shared libraries thus motivating the switch to ELF.^21. ELF is OK, but times have changed since ELF was created.  The same constraints no longer exist.  Personally, I prefer static binaries and can afford the space for them.   It is good to have options for people who prefer shared libraries as well as those who prefer static binaries.2. https://people.freebsd.org/~nik/advocacy/myths.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I &#39;m an heavy user of diagrams to take notes while learning topics in biology and medicine. I think the most interesting feature of diagrams.net is its extensibility, which is not frequently mentioned. If you run in the javascript console...    var editorUi;
    Draw.loadPlugin(app =&gt; editorUi = app)
    var editor = editorUi.editor
    var graph = editor.graph

... then you can automate changes to the diagram using mxGraph&#39;s api [1] on the `graph&#39; variable from the console.Around this plugin mechanism I wrote some dirty hacks for personal use to make the editor behave more to my likings [2] (some features stopped working with recent versions of the desktop app), and an even dirtier Emacs mode for editing labels and having the js REPL available directly from Emacs when I need to run some code to fix my diagrams programmatically [3] (based on Indium [4] + the fact that electron apps can be launched with --remote-debugging-port=...). It&#39;s not pretty, but works enough for me, and it&#39;s only thanks to the customizability that diagrams.net allows.[1] https://jgraph.github.io/mxgraph/docs/js-api/files/view/mxGr...[2] https://gitlab.com/spellcard199/drawio-plugin-eight-droves-o...[3] https://gitlab.com/spellcard199/emacs-drawio[4] https://github.com/NicolasPetton/Indium"</p>

Then I can use automations to generate images based off that source file: https://github.com/roapi/docs/blob/main/src/images/roapi.svg."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another thing I found impressive is how fast Carmack grew in term of technical skills.In 1989 and 1990 he was still programming Apple ][ tile engine games, which are Ultima spinoffs. Not bad but not a new thing either. Starting from 1991 when he joined Softdisk it took him a few months to figure out smooth horizontal scrolling, and in just a bit more than one year, around late 1992 he managed to go from it to a mature ray casting engine, and you can see his evolution from hovertank to wolfenstein. And it took him another year to go from Wolfenstein to shadow caster to Doom. Quake took longer but it was still impressive considering he has to got it before anyone else solved it.I mean this guy learns really fast.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Over the past few months we’ve been trying hard to make Appwrite as simple to setup and use as possible. Your candid feedback has been crucial in shaping the project and it would be great if you can share some features you’d like to see in the project going forward.What is Appwrite ? 
In simplest terms, Appwrite is an open source Backend As A Service (aka BaaS). Appwrite is an all in one solution with all the essentials you need like Authentication, User Management, Realtime Databases, Webhooks, Storage, Cloud Functions, SDKs for your favourite language and it’s light weight. Appwrite even runs on a Raspberry Pi. Most importantly, Appwrite is self-hosted which means you own your data and prevent any vendor lock-ins.Talking about Appwrite’s features
- Realtime Databases and events ( Recent benchmarks have showed a single server handling 1M+ concurrent connections )- SDKs for iOS, Android, Flutter, Web ( React, Angular, Vue, Svelte etc.) Python, PHP, Node, Deno, Kotlin and more- Bring your own Database - Use your choice of SQL or MySQL databases ( MariaDB, MySQL, MongoDB and more )- Database permissions for finer tuned access control- Storage API with built in encryption, compression and antivirus- Bring your own Storage - Use your choice of the local filesystem, DigitalOcean Spaces, S3 or an any other storage provider of your choice- Cloud functions with support for over 20 runtimes- Webhooks to connect with 3rd party APIs and services- User Management and Authentication- Multiple authentication methods - email, 25+ OAuth providers, JWT, API Keys- Completely stateless and extensible architecture allowing easy integration with your existing backend- A Dashboard, CLI and VSCode extensions to manage your server and many more..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From my quick research when I was selecting the next backend I was going to use for a project in the past, and today reading some responses on this page:- Appwrite is written in PHP. Just because something is open source, doesn&#39;t mean it is extensible, scalable or otherwise written well. I haven&#39;t seen many popular projects written in PHP recently. The only time I used PHP was in university, where the PHP application was the target machine in a CTF.- AppWrite doesn&#39;t yet have their Cloud version, so they aren&#39;t ready to be a &#34;backend as a service&#34; - it&#39;s a product that isn&#39;t ready &#34;as a service&#34;. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t use it, and I can see similar sentiment here on HN. I&#39;d be willing to try it out when it&#39;s ready.- It&#39;s not built on Postgres. Their comment about Supabase using postgres did not include any real substance: &#34;I&#39;m trying to be as objective as I can, but building the entire ecosystem around a single product like Postgres ( even though tried and tested ) comes with its own downsides...&#34;. The downsides of what AppWrite might be that they&#39;re rolling their own database... in PHP? They may not be database experts, and there&#39;s lots to think about and fix when building a database, and Postgres has been tested for a long time.- Not much progress is happening on the GraphQL side: https://github.com/appwrite/appwrite/pull/974/files, whereas Supabase has it: https://supabase.com/blog/2021/12/03/pg-graphql.Overall, it seems like the project doesn&#39;t move as fast as its competitor (primarily Supabase) for features I care about, and perhaps this is caused by PHP?Anyway, I&#39;d love to hear your thoughts about my comments, Eldad and team."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Before I even look into it, I&#39;ll tell you this: the headline was enough to grab my attention on its own. I strongly feel this is a badly underserved niche and I&#39;ve had major issues with Firebase&#39;s limitations. You definitely have a winning idea here in this user&#39;s opinion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Automation is imperfect, and I wonder if the reality is that, if you can’t successfully automate the approval of ads or copyrighted material, or account suspension, then maybe you’re too big or trying to do too much.Maybe the answer is that these things can’t ever be automated and if you can’t staff the process then you (and therefore nobody) should be working at this scale."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yesterday, on one of my increasingly rare Facebook peeks, I kept getting this ad which was a link to a controversy with Mayim Bialik where she apparently got into a big spat with a producer over her touting new CBD gummies that supposedly cure dementia, and then it exploded into a huge thing, with even Tucker Carlson from Fox News weighing in, blah blah blah. It was perfectly-crafted clickbait because I clicked through just to read how insane it was.The whole thing never happened! Complete and total hoax. A pump and dump scheme that Snopes got wise to more than a week ago. And it showed up in my feed 4 times in scrolling five minutes. I reported every single one of them as a scam.I swear, no one is at the helm over there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Shortly after Myanmar became connected to the internet in 2000, Facebook paired with its telecom providers to allow customers to use the platform without having to pay for the dataAs far as I can tell, that program started in 2016, not &#34;shortly after... 2000&#34;"</p>
