								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"NFTs make perfect sense for representing a claim on things that can be used, like event tickets or in-game virtual goods. But as certificates layered on top of collectibles... I&#39;m not so sure.With something like CryptoKitties, you can do something with the tokens (play a virtual pet game). But with something like CryptoPunks you&#39;re essentially paying for digital beanie babies, which are worse than real ones since anyone can display and enjoy the image you paid for.You can brag about owning such-and-such an image, but only as long as enough other people desire images from that particular set. When a set&#39;s popularity wanes, so does your token&#39;s value, and your ability to show it off.I&#39;m always happy to see artists being paid for their work, and if they can make some money during this craze - more power to them. Beyond a few creators being rewarded, it seems like this is going to be 90% bubble (with plenty of hucksters), and 10% real use cases that stand the test of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty bad take on NFTs.There are numerous configurations, networks, and commercial structures that can be created for NFT offerings that can mitigate &#34;problems&#34; described in the OP and accommodate for different tradeoffs.A simple retort would point to the many alternative NFT networks that don&#39;t use POW-based consensus algorithms or the NFT offerings that enable value add offerings very differently than purchasing art or baseball cards.Evaluating the capabilities of NFTs against the value offerings of something like rare art is an apples to oranges comparison. Of course the market for digital assets offered via NFT is immature and speculative; this is a new market, based on an alternative technology paradigm, that has a long way to go before it settles into a more usable and valuable structure.Ultimately, the idea of using key-pairs pegged to widely accessible peer-to-peer public networks as a mechanism for tracking ownership of digital (or near digital or at times even physical) assets is incredibly novel. It turns the conventional model of third-party hosted digital assets on its head and enables really interesting mechanisms of distribution, ownership, access, and value consumption and creation that does not compare well with traditional mechanisms. And in saying it doesn&#39;t compare well I mean to acknowledge its limitations and its potential at the same time. However, the critique in the OP is pretty bland and doesn&#39;t seem to acknowledge the full scope of the situation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"NFT&#39;s are Bullshit: https://samim.io/p/2021-03-05-non-fungible-tokens-nft-are-bu...In Summary:
1. The NFT doubles down on the worst of copyright, the property metaphor, &amp; tries to impose old ideas of scarcity &amp; exclusion on the digital realm, where both are obsolete.2.NFTs are an absolute ecological disaster"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having distinct types for P0 and P1 is deliberate and is what is called &#34;type state programming&#34; in the embedded rust book [0]. The advantage is that you can prevent misconfiguration at compile time  (ensuring that a given pin cannot be used in multiple places). In the Zig example, it seems to me (and I have zero knowledge of Zig, so sorry if this is inaccurate) that you can potentially introduce bugs where the same pin is used twice.For a generic led driver, it should not use these types, but instead the trait types from the embedded_hal crate, such as &#34;OutputPin&#34; that is implemented by the different chip-specific HALs. There is an example of a generic led driver that uses these traits at [1].In general I recommend everyone who wants to try out Rust on embedded to read the embedded rust book, because it clarifies a lot of the reasons and advantages of its approach.[0] https://docs.rust-embedded.org/book/static-guarantees/typest...[1] https://github.com/drogue-iot/drogue-device/blob/main/rt/src..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s another example of the coolness of Zig&#39;s comptime code execution:https://github.com/ziglang/zig/commit/0808d98e10c5fea27cebf9...That&#39;s a generic container class (similar to vector in C++ or List in C#). But! With a twist!It stores structs in &#34;column major&#34; order in memory (e.g., if a struct had two fields A and B, then in-memory layout would be A...AB...B), and you can idiomatically and efficiently get a a slice of the values of each column.I.e., it&#39;s a datastructure that automatically applies the struct-of-arrays optimization:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/AoS_and_SoA#Structure_of_Arr...And the code to do it is straightforward, normal Zig.Pretty awesome stuff!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zig&#39;s design is so radical, that it completely rethinks how low-level programming can and should be done, rather than improve on one of the existing low-level programming philosophies (C or C++&#39;s). That the result is such a simple and easy-to-learn language that, despite being so radical, doesn&#39;t feel foreign is truly an accomplishment.&gt; In particular, that much of the complexity I’d unconsciously attributed to the domain — “this is what systems programming is like” — was in fact a consequence of deliberate Rust design decisions.I also thought that, and, to be fair to Rust, it is following the tradition of C++ and Ada, two low-level languages that would also easily make the top five most complex languages in history alongside Rust. Until Zig showed up, I, and I think many others, didn&#39;t believe that an expressive low-level language could be made so simple, certainly not one that values safety."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got the privilege of having lunch with Mr. McDonald when I was an IEEE officer during college. He gave a lecture at my university on ethics, and the IEEE council got to take him for lunch afterwards.He was not shy at all about saying whatever was on his mind. It was pretty awesome to hear him dunk on his VP, right in the middle of lying to the Rogers commission&#39;s face. He was also really open about the fact that nobody at Morton Thiokol trusted him for the better part of a decade after he did that. He said something to the effect of, &#34;It definitely made my career harder, but on the bright side, I never had any major crises of conscience for lying about it.He also didn&#39;t give a single fuck about getting a lunch beer at a student gathering. I wish I&#39;d joined him in drinking beer at noon on a Tuesday on IEEE dime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found the history of the related company Morton-Thiokol quite useful as part of understanding as well. [1]https://www.encyclopedia.com/books/politics-and-business-mag..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The film “Challenger: The Final Flight” on Netflix includes interviews with the most important participants in the launch decision, including McDonald. (It also has interviews with many of the astronauts’ families and does a great job at putting their experience front and centre.)The guy whose job it was to send the fax because he happened to be the one who knew how to operate the fax machine is to this day utterly devastated; weeping.The MTI VP who signed off (although the decision was made above his head) admits that he agreed with it at the time, but acknowledges it was a mistake. He’s being interviewed in a large room full of very expensive furniture.The NASA manager who bullied them into agreeing to launch because they couldn’t prove that it was unsafe basically says that if he had his time over he would kill all of the astronauts again. Truly terrifying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Switzerland has an awesome electoral system [1].  Instead of being ruled by a president or a prime minister who can be polarising, divisive, or selective, Switzerland has an Executive Council.The 7 member Executive Council is composed of the top 7 candidates from each election.  The chairperson of the executive council rotates each year, so that the top 4 vote winners each get a turn at being chairperson.This means that different social and political priorities get implemented in turn.  It also means the way the government works is more cooperative, because each council member, including the chairperson, knows there will be a new chairperson next year.So, if a pro-business candidate places 1st, and an environment candidate 2nd, and a social welfare candidate 3rd, and a libertarian candidate 4th, it is in all their interests to cooperate and create legislation that serves all of their interests as much as possible.  Instead of disregarding the environment, the pro-business council member is encouraged to develop green business initiatives that will be supported for the full 4 year term under the different chairs.The system creates a leadership team that looks for win-win, rather than a sole victor who can abuse majority rule.[1]. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Council_(Switzerland)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quite a few people who voted against this did so purely because they didn’t want private companies controlling the system.If the proposal had been for the government to issue and control the identities, it may well have passed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; From a distance, procrastination looks like a time management problem. There is growing evidence that it is rather an emotional management problem — a flight response.It&#39;s eye opening how a lot of life struggles turn out to be an emotional management problem at their core: procrastination, addiction, stress.I wish I had that perspective earlier in my life. It completely changes the solution space from trying random productivity tools to focusing on one&#39;s emotions and possibly getting into therapy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is all true but but I&#39;ve been recently been diagnosed with adult adhd in my mid-30ies and on a low dose of slow release Methylphenidate and it&#39;s all the difference between getting things done and procrastinating like hell. If you exhausted all the articles and nothing worked and you have big problems for years (like this: https://gekk.info/articles/adhd.html) give it a try. In the last weeks I managed to really learn in a structured way for the first time. Of course it&#39;s no magic solution to all your problems but it&#39;s a stark difference for me. I just want to leave that here as I&#39;ve read these articles every other week and nothing sticked. Neither did counseling or talk theraphy - it helped but didn&#39;t solve the procrastination / time issues"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the interesting things you can do with ffmpeg, if you have a LOT of scratch disk space, and you&#39;re trying to compare subjective encoder quality (not VMAF, but human eyeballs) on a certain video file:1) take your raw uncompressed y4m file and write it out to a directory of PNG files, one png file per frame. this is your static image reference baseline for subjective eyeballs.2) take your raw uncompressed y4m file and encode it to x265 or whatever codec you&#39;re testing, at various different bitrates and encoder settings3) take your various encoded x265 files and also write those out to PNG files in separate directories3) pick exactly the same frame number filename from your &#39;master&#39; PNGs and your encoder-output PNGs, copy them and put them in the same directory so you can quickly flip back and forth between them in a image slideshow application.If you want to do this with 2160p24,p25 or p30 videos at several minute lengths, be prepared to have 150-160GB of scratch disk per y4m and per PNG-dump-directory."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a fun read, especially as someone who grew up with those 80s and 90s movies.That said, and as the author touches on, the action/super hero of today is a PG-13 one. Studios need to reach the widest audience possible to make the most money, so it&#39;s a safer bet.Sure, back in the day studios had the same imperative, but the licensed toy game was still young, so they didn&#39;t realise that maybe if they made Die Hard PG instead of R they could sell some John McClane action figures to younger viewiers.Nowadays, that&#39;s basically the starting point; what we can we sell outside of the movie? how can we milk the franchise for as much as possible?And that&#39;s where a lot of the sex appeal is lost. Marvel movies can&#39;t be as raunchy as a result.Another topic that the author touched on was the way the ideal aesthetic has changed in not just our bodies but where we live or what we do in our spare time.I agree that more and more we are optimising for artifice; fitness classes, extra curricular activities, holidays, concerts and events we attend, just to keep up an appearance online or in person. And in those activities we often don&#39;t get the true value out of them because we&#39;re doing them for the wrong reason.Anyway, it&#39;s a complex and interesting topic and I&#39;d love to read more about this perhaps from even further back (50s or 60s) if anyone has something similar to this post?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this a side effect of normalizing porn, that sexuality is more effectively partitioned?I once had a debate in an online forum about legalizing prostitution, and most participants were supportive of it. Then I asked the same group, what about legalizing partial prostitution, like a receptionist that also has sex with the boss as part of the job description. The participants all immediately switched to revulsion at the idea and none would support it.So why is 100% sex work less exploitative than 50% sex work? I don&#39;t think it is. But for some reason our culture finds specialist sex workers more tolerable. The same pressure seems to be bifurcating entertainment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; [Julia] was a bold-looking girl, of about twenty-seven, with thick hair, a freckled face, and swift, athletic movements. A narrow scarlet sash, emblem of the Junior Anti-Sex League, was wound several times round the waist of her overalls, just tightly enough to bring out the shapeliness of her hips. Winston had disliked her from the very first moment of seeing her.&gt; Better than before, moreover, he realized why it was that he hated her. He hated her because she was young and pretty and sexless, because he wanted to go to bed with her and would never do so, because round her sweet supple waist, which seemed to ask you to encircle it with your arm, there was only the odious scarlet sash, aggressive symbol of chastity.1984, George Orwell, 1949"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Been following the creators for awhile and very much happy to see them democratizing their difficult skillset.Most designers -- think anyone using figma -- are effectively locked out of modern interactive and animated visuals due to not knowing hardcore shaders + effective js coding. To get a feel for how hard that is, look at the public timeline of Shirley Wu, another wonderful award-winning designer and experienced js coder, to pick this kind of stuff up. Nodes makes it a lot more accessible, similar to Max/msp for musicians. Once you look beyond the over-claiming, which is clearly nails-on-chalkboard for most engineers and scientists as you are seeing in the comments -- this is a wonderful and enabling project.Extra impressive is they do not seem to try to &#39;dumb it down&#39;. They are a consultancy and (seem to) try to use it for their own bespoke advanced installations. I don&#39;t know how well this will translate to others, but the success of Max msp and super collider make me optimistic that it can grow to those levels. Cycling 74 supports 20+ employees and empowers many musicians, and as Nodes can be used for commercial art (web+tv ads, music videos, landing pages, ...), I can see them being even bigger."</p>

By Googling, I found the GitHub repo [0], but it’s empty of code and looks to be used for issue tracking only.I can’t see something that’s trying to be an ecosystem being very successful without being open (see: every closed-source language/runtime ever).I couldn’t even find any example code. I tried clicking the examples on the home page. I even tried clicking “Playground” and it wasn’t a link.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s an avalanche of people commenting on this who didn&#39;t bother to check the article before raising their methodological objections, so let&#39;s get these out of the way here.- Yes, they controlled for objects appearing in the pictures that might indicate political affiliation. The images are tightly cropped around the face. See Methods.- Yes, this is significantly better than both a coin flip and a human classifier. They gave the same test to humans, who did much worse than the model. See Abstract, Introduction, and Results.- Yes, this is doing more than just detecting a person&#39;s race, age, and/or gender. The classifier is still accurate when they compare people with the same race, age, and gender. See Results.If you want to discuss actual limitations in the study, here are some the author points out:- &#34;A more detailed picture could be obtained by exploring the links between political orientation and facial features extracted from images taken in a standardized setting while controlling for facial hair, grooming, facial expression, and head orientation.&#34;- &#34;Another factor affecting classification accuracy is the quality of the political orientation estimates. While the dichotomous representation used here (i.e., conservative vs. liberal) is widely used in the literature, it offers only a crude estimate of the complex interpersonal differences in ideology. Moreover, self-reported political labels suffer from the reference group effect: respondents’ tendency to assess their traits in the context of the salient comparison group.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t a study that shows that people&#39;s faces indicate their political leanings.It&#39;s a study which shows that pictures that people select to represent themselves publicly have features that indicate political leaning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the key line is how much better this system is than humans attempting the same task:&gt; Political orientation was correctly classified in 72% of liberal–conservative face pairs, remarkably better than chance (50%), human accuracy (55%), or one afforded by a 100-item personality questionnaire (66%).This isn&#39;t a matter of &#34;recognize that old white people are conservative&#34;, because people will do that already, and they know all those biases. And the system doesn&#39;t lose much accuracy when comparing otherwise similar people.This system is picking up on things we don&#39;t notice. Maybe it&#39;s the photos themselves (they are self-selected), maybe it&#39;s micro expressions in the face, maybe it&#39;s something else entirely.But damn it&#39;s neat and maybe frightening. Imagine if your next hiring manager had a quiet little camera in the corner and chose you based on your predicted approval of unions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Just 100 cars will be made available with the technology in Japan, and they will cost the equivalent of $101,900. None of these Legends will make their way to the U.S.&#34;I&#39;m assuming if it won&#39;t come to the US it won&#39;t come to the UK, Canada or Australia either.Is 100 units really a &#34;production car&#34;? I don&#39;t agree.Also:&#34;It does all this with zero input from the driver, who Honda says can &#34;watch television/DVD on the navigation screen or operate the navigation system to search for a destination address.&#34;and yet:&#34;Please do not overestimate the capabilities of each Honda Sensing Elite function and drive safely while paying constant attention to your surroundings. Please remain in condition where you can respond to the handover request issued by the system, and immediately resume driving upon the handover request.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is notable is level 3. Not the features, but the legal aspect of claiming drivers can now be distracted with your mode.Tesla &#34;auto&#34;pilot does more, while pretending to enforce an always alert driver. This has resulted in a couple wrongful deaths no one at Tesla has been prosecuted for.Honda meanwhile is taking advantage of the Japanese governments legal changes which make level 3 legally tenable. Drivers need not watch the road, but they must respond when the car asks them to. This means Honda is promising your Honda will not silently drive you into a wall as the Tesla autopilot is known to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s not mentioned in all the othe english based articles is that Honda&#39;s system only works on highways at speeds below 50km/h. It&#39;s a system specifically designed for dealing with traffic jams on highways, and is not comparable to, say, Tesla&#39;s autopilot.https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Automobiles/Honda-launches-...&gt; It can free drivers from driving in congested traffic on an expressway when travelling slower than 50 kilometers per hour.&gt; The system automatically accelerates, brakes and steers while monitoring the vehicle&#39;s surroundings, using data from high-definition mapping and external sensors."</p>
