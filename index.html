								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems to have been announced a couple of weeks ago, so we don&#39;t need to just trust the tweet: https://www.macworld.com/article/1377200/apple-to-limit-aird...Having it open to everyone for only a limited amount of time actually kind of seems like the right thing, but it&#39;s hard to come up with a legit explanation for why they rushed that change to China first."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For context: AirDrop was one of the only ways protesters had to communicate en-masse.Signal is unsafe for Chinese protesters, since it requires SMS verification upon signup and is therefore linked to your identity.[0] Mesh networks are the only real solution there, and AirDrop is about the only mainstream one. AirDrop has been used by Asian protesters for years.[1] I highly recomment you read the full China Digital Times article, which gives excellent context, and lets these protesters explain the value of AirDrop in their own words.[1]Apple&#39;s timing is unmistakeably suspicious; keep in mind that there have been protests for weeks, which preceded the iOS update.It must also be pointed out that Apple issued an official statement to Western media outlets that the goal was to prevent spam.[2] At no point did Apple ever admit that this was done to follow any government demand. It&#39;s unknown whether Apple could be under a Chinese gag-order, but we shouldn&#39;t speculate that it&#39;s the case unless experts say it&#39;s likely. If Apple is complying with a Chinese government orders, then it has an ethical duty to make that public, and again, we have, as of yet, no reason to assume there are gag orders related to this. Apple deserves criticism for the update, and for trying to hide its true purpose.[0]: https://twitter.com/RealSexyCyborg/status/159707255662827929...[1]: https://chinadigitaltimes.net/2022/11/netizen-voices-apple-r...[2]: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-11-10/apple-lim..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have to admit that when you actually look at the details this is a rather perplexing change. Ditto for reading the comments here.Is Apple being Pro-CCP with this change? If you open airdrop to everyone, your device can be tracked and identified individually. When this setting is disabled, this becomes far harder.I&#39;m of the opinion that this change is good and actually increases security across the board, including for the people who are using it to exchange information during protests since it disables a vector for tracking devices."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"FFmpeg is powerful technology, yet approaching it can be very daunting. So we decided to create an approachable guide for intermediate devs.
Feedback is very much appreciated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not to criticize the guide, it&#39;s brilliant!
If asked for improvements, I&#39;d suggest adding a table of contents.Slightly off topic, but the guide does suggests reading time. It&#39;s interesting that people keep using read estimates for technical/scientific/professional documentation. This one says it&#39;s a 58 minute read. Not 1 hour, not 59 minutes, but spot on 58 minutes.Now, I&#39;m not a novice in using ffmpeg and I think I&#39;m at least an average person. I can tell you that it would take me a _lot_ longer to read this guide in a meaningful manner.But, a brilliant guide. I&#39;m definitely going to use it to expand my ffmpeg knowledge."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fortunately have close friends, but not through any of my own doing. Over the years, there were a lot of friendly extroverts that encouraged me to hang out and join them for burger night, or they’d message me when they were in town. Everyone I dated took the initiative to ask me out, including my wife. I always feel awkward when I reach out to people, as though I’m bothering them somehow, so I tend to avoid doing so. Once someone is a close friend, I go out of my way to maintain the connection, but it’s that in-between stage of “acquaintance” where I have a hard time.I had a bit of a revelation when I left my last job. There were very few comments from coworkers when I left. I don’t think I was disliked (hopefully?), but I don’t think anyone really considered me their friend either. Looking back I think I came across as somewhat of a NPC to coworkers. I preferred to eat lunch by myself and I only discussed the business topic at hand during meetings unless someone else brought up a personal discussion.I wouldn’t mind to start more personal discussions, but I’m always concerned it might come across the wrong way, so the furthest I seem to get is “how was your weekend?”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Making friends is easy, keeping friends and growing the relationships are difficult. I am mostly introverted but have periods of extreme extroversion. I&#39;m 34 but all of my best friends have passed away from various accidents over the past decade.I feel like a shell of my former self where all I do or have a desire to do is work. The only person I consider my friend is my former boss who, after losing his wife to ALS, I did everything I could to be there and support him because he took a chance on me by offering me a job that ultimately has led to a great career in the tech field.I&#39;ve noticed my personality has slipped away, I no longer have hobbies or anything of real passion in my life anymore and thus there&#39;s nothing I have to offer another person in a relationship.It&#39;s incredibly lonely and a poor place to be yet I really don&#39;t know how to escape it. Most other dudes my age have families or many of them only care to go out to breweries which I don&#39;t enjoy.There&#39;s still a bit of hope deep down that all isn&#39;t over yet and a ray of sunshine can still propagate itself somewhere, sometime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very brief summary: a personal anecdote about forming good friends followed up by advice for how to have better conversions (vulnerability, curiosity) and how to meet more people who will become friends (meet people but filter out most of them, take initiative with following up), and lastly how to deepen friendships.As someone who has a fair number of close friends, I think this is a good post with lots of solid advice. And it&#39;s written well! Personally I&#39;ve been lucky to just naturally meet and form my best friends over time, but I definitely think taking initiative and following up are important to maintaining a close friendship.A general point in this post I also like is that making and keeping close friends may require work and energy, rather than being something that life just throws your way. I intentionally try to periodically message friends, come out to places they live, just generally keep in touch; as one gets older people move about and it&#39;s harder to maintain your closest friendships, but it is possible!Last comment: this is a very pragmatic and analytical post with a lot of discussions of things you can do, and not much discussion of how you should feel. I&#39;d add this - just CARE. Appreciate the people in your life and let that appreciation guide you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like it, but the array details are a little bit off. An actual array does have a known size, that&#39;s why when given a real array `sizeof` can give the size of the array itself rather than the size of a pointer. There&#39;s no particular reason why C doesn&#39;t allow you to assign one array to another of the same length, it&#39;s largely just an arbitrary restriction. As you noted, it already has to be able to do this when assigning `struct`s.Additionally a declared array such as `int arr[5]` does actually have the type `int [5]`, that is the array type. In most situations that decays to a pointer to the first element, but not always, such as with `sizeof`. This becomes a bit more relevant if you take the address of an array as you get a pointer to an array, Ex. `int (*ptr)[5] = &amp;arr;`. As you can see the size is still there in the type, and if you do `sizeof *ptr` you&#39;ll get the size of the array."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Everything I wish I knew when learning CBy far my biggest regret is that the learning materials I was exposed to (web pages, textbooks, lectures, professors, etc.) did not mention or emphasize how insidious undefined behavior is.Two of the worst C and C++ debugging experiences I had followed this template: Some coworker asked me why their function was crashing, I edit their function and it sometimes crashes or doesn&#39;t depending on how I rearrange lines of code, and later I figure out that some statement near the top of the function corrupted the stack and that the crashes had nothing to do with my edits.Undefined behavior is deceptive because the point at which the program state is corrupted can be arbitrarily far away from the point at which you visibly notice a crash or wrong data. UB can also be non-deterministic depending on OS/compiler/code/moonphase. Moreover, &#34;behaving correctly&#34; is one legal behavior of UB, which can fool you into believing your program is correct when it has a hidden bug.A related post on the HN front page: https://predr.ag/blog/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-u... , https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33771922My own write-up: https://www.nayuki.io/page/undefined-behavior-in-c-and-cplus...The take-home lesson about UB is to only rely on following the language rules strictly (e.g. don&#39;t dereference null pointer, don&#39;t overflow signed integer, don&#39;t go past end of array). Don&#39;t just assume that your program is correct because there were no compiler warnings and the runtime behavior passed your tests."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks decent, but I&#39;m (highly) opposed to recommending `strncpy()` as a fix for `strcpy()` lacking bounds-checking. That&#39;s not what it&#39;s for, it&#39;s weird and should be considered as obosolete as `gets()` in my opinion.If available, it&#39;s much better to do the `snprintf()` way as I mentioned in a comment last week, i.e. replace `strcpy(dest, src)` with `snprintf(dst, sizeof dst, &#34;%s&#34;, src)` and always remember that &#34;%s&#34; part. Never put src there, of course.There&#39;s also `strlcpy()` on some systems, but it&#39;s not standard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel sorry for the retail investors caught up in yet another crypto scam. Let me try to articulate my view of what’s actually going on with these seemingly endless scams, in hopes of saving future retail investors some pain:Prominent venture capital firms like A16Z, Sequoia, etc have discovered a new get rich quick scheme: they raise a fund and invest it in a some shitcoin like FTX, SOL, etc. the shitcoin founders use the cash to market and shill the coin, hiring public figures like famous NFL players. Retail investors FOMO into these tokens, boosting prices and attracting more retail investors. Once the market cap of the shitcoin exceeds the VC/investor cost basis, they cash out and let the rest ride. Eventually the shitcoin implodes, but by this time the firms are already onto their next fund and another token.  A16Z is on their 4th fund now and it’s $4.5B[0]. There’s an entire political strategy at play as well, where shitcoins are employing folks in DC and lining pockets to further the scam.All of this is possible because there is no regulation on crypto tokens. In reality these are unregulated securities and these large VC firms are exploiting a loop hole for profit. This goes for literally every token starting at ETH and below.[0]: https://a16zcrypto.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With projects like blockfi, users get all the disadvantages of the centralized traditional financial system without any of the regulatory protections that have built up over centuries. Terrible for the people with assets in blockfi but extremely predictable. The point of defi is that you can use financial services without a centralized counterparty. People who can’t handle their own keys should be using traditional banks, at least until the technology is improved. Compare to Aave and other actually decentralized lending protocols which are not at risk of bankruptcy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; In the Chinese app store market [there are] five to ten commonly used app stores, and yet even the largest has less than a majority market share. Most Chinese people have more than one app store on their phone, so there is no monolith there, whereas “outside of China, Apple and Google control more than 95 percent of the app store market share”.

And the charm of having almost no electronics[1] on the car control is that if something is wrong, you will know it by the sounds it makes, and you will have a lot of times to fix it before it&#39;s completely toast. I have heard of horror stories about newer cars with electric ABS accumulator that stopped working on the high way, not with my FZJ80[2].[1] The so called &#39;emission computer&#39; unit on the car is a simple pulse counter/comparator that activates a VSV on the carb to reduce backfire while descending downhill with the foot off the throttle.[2] My brake booster is leaking a little bit, but at least it won&#39;t suddenly gives up on me while I&#39;m riding, still looking for a replacement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is cool and a worthwhile thing, but how is this different than the many (b/x)hyve clones and others based on QEMU that use MacOS’s virtualization framework to run a minimal Linux for containers? What’s the differentiator that makes this better (hopefully?) from what’s come before?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case anyone from the US reads this, BSPP and BSPT fittings are rare and incredibly frustrating here, as our NPT (National Pipe Taper) threads are different and the selection of BSP(P/T) fittings is extremely poor in comparison.Also, I work with NPT fittings quite a lot:&gt; For what it’s worth, I tightly wrap the tape 10 times round the male thread and get an enraged mountain gorilla to tighten it up.This is a WTF NO!!! for NPT and I’ll assume a WTF NO!!! for BSPT as well. You need about 1.5 wraps of PTFE tape to seal a fitting. Any more is wasteful and asking for leaks (or damage, if you’re using plastic fittings). It helps if you use the correct tape width for the fittings (1/4”, 1/2”, and 1” for me) and develop a wrapping method that keeps the tape under tension at all time and in such a direction that threading it into the fitting doesn’t unwrap the tape.Also, in my experience, when someone inexperienced first learns what pipe tape is, they try to apply it to everything. 20 wraps around a tapered pipe? Wrap a Swagelok fitting? Try to make a butt joint or an adapter for two pieces of plastic tubing? I’ve seen it all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article doesn&#39;t touch much about why plumbing is hard. I&#39;m from Poland so I&#39;m not only IT but also a plumber ;)Plumbing is hard because it is not forgiving. It&#39;s as binary as IT except you can learn the outcome with some delay, once you learnt about a damage caused by a leak. Either you do a pressure tests right or repair can be expensive. And bugfixing is always tricky.Water also goes down whether you like it or not. Think about all possible leaks inside the shower cabin. Or what is even more impressive that under a pressure the water goes everywhere possible.Plumbing is similar to electrical engineering, except it usually doesn&#39;t kill immidiately (though working with gas is tricky anyway) but requires similar strict mental model to do right.And when you see a plumber it seems like this person is just a physical worker. So work status misconception must be leveled with money..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve helped out with some plumbing work in an older house, and it&#39;s pretty fascinating to see the progression of technologies.100 years ago, most drain pipes in the US were massive cast-iron pieces with no threads at all. They were mated together, then the joint was filled with a compound called oakum. To really hold it together, the plumber would pour molten lead on top of the oakum. Just taking that stuff apart is a lot of work. I can&#39;t imagine putting it together as well, especially for 40 hours a week.I agree with the author&#39;s dismay about threaded fittings, but 100% disagree about PTFE tape versus thread sealant. PTFE tape is garbage. If you use thread sealer the way it&#39;s supposed to be used (put on a decent amount, then thread the pieces together with the &#34;nudge and a grunt&#34; technique instead of cranking down on it with a huge amount of force), it will seal perfectly almost every time, and any minor leaks can usually be fixed by tightening the joint slightly. If that&#39;s not enough, just take it apart and redo it. I&#39;ve rarely had to try twice, and never three times.Not sure about British threaded pipe, but NPT threaded pipe actually doesn&#39;t benefit from being tightened beyond a certain point because of the way the threads are designed. I redid the seals and some of the fittings[1] on all the antique hot water radiators in a house because no contractor within a day&#39;s travel would work on antique hydronic heating systems. Good quality thread sealant, no garbagey PTFE tape, no leaks, even in constant use.That having been said, modern pipes and fittings make things dead simple. PVC (or ABS, but PVC is nicer IMO) for drains, push-to-connect fittings for water lines (I like PEX, but I know opinions vary). No lead, no torches. Easy to cut with hand tools. Lightweight. Anyone who&#39;s interested can probably do at least basic work with modern pipes.[1] https://youtube.com/watch?v=MeHiE-j1KuQ"</p>
