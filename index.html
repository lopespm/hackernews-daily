								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In Case You Didn&#39;t Know:Big Sur on M1 (and possibly on Intel) maintains a persistent, hardware-serial-number linked TLS connection to Apple (for APNS, just like on iOS) at all times when you are logged in, even if you don&#39;t use iCloud, App Store, iMessage, or FaceTime, and have all analytics turned off.There&#39;s no UI to disable this.This means that Apple has the coarse location track log (due to GeoIP of the client IP) for every M1 serial number. When you open the App Store app, that serial number is also sent, and associated with your Apple ID (email/phone) if you log in.Apple knows when you leave home, or arrive at the office, or travel to a different city, all with no Apple ID, no iCloud, and no location services.This has always been the case on all devices using iOS, too.This change is essential for blocking such traffic, and I&#39;m glad for it, but there is a long way to go when it comes to pressuring the pro-privacy forces inside of Apple to do more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I&#39;m glad they fixed it (upgrading past Catalina was not going to happen), It&#39;s going to take me a LONG time to trust them again.The fact that they could rationalize their own thought process to think this was a good idea or even anywhere close to acceptable, at best leads me to doubt their judgement. At worst, well it&#39;s best to assume incompetence over malice but you can see what doors this would open in the future.
Now we know they CAN do this without it being obvious to most users, which is a new dimension of risk regardless of intent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This firewall issue isn&#39;t the only privacy feature strip from Big Sur release. Unfortunately no big media care about other huge problem Apple introduced.My only hope they will also fix full disk encryption in this update. Since Big Sur broken installation of macOS on passphrase-encrypted disk partitions.I bought into M1 hype and now it&#39;s end up that you no longer able to have separate password for the disk encryption."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I went through a phase a while back of holding down keys to see what they did.Back when I was a gamedev at EA, one of the things QA would do is button-mash test the games. Just smash as many buttons as they could at the same time at all sorts of random points in the game. This was a constant source of bugs. It was surprisingly easy to get the game into a state where it was totally hung because of this.One of the main culprits was transitions between screens in the UI. So much of the UI code assumed that the initial state of a screen is that no buttons are currently pressed. But if you mash a bunch down in the middle of a transition, the screen can end up receiving a button up event that did not precede any button down event. If the screen&#39;s code assumed every up has a preceding down, it could get into a broken state.I never did see any clean systematic solution to this problem. I still think about it a lot when I do UI programming. In the back of my head, I&#39;m always wondering, &#34;what will happen if the user presses X in the middle of this animation?&#34;Programmers are particularly prone to these bugs because we have unconsciously trained ourselves to baby our own software. We&#39;re careful to wait for transitions to complete and only send input when the app is in a known state."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;While I’m not a QA or security professional, I have developed a knack for doing “stupid” things with software which causes it to malfunction.A person after my own heart.I&#39;ve had many a dev go &#34;why would you do that&#34;In which I answer &#34;it doesn&#39;t matter, but if you accept my input it&#39;s your job to ensure the app doesn&#39;t crash&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was and still is a website called The Daily WTF about discussing especially funny bugs and programmer&#39;s mistakes. In 2012 I registered on it as a user &#34;undefined&#34; to make a comment about JavaScript oddities under one of their articles and almost forgot about its existence, then they migrated their comments and forums to Discourse and in 2015 I got a bunch of email notifications about people mentioning me as suddenly all &#34;likes&#34; in the forum were linked to my profile:https://what.thedailywtf.com/topic/17637/undefined-liked-thi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience is in quant hedge funds, where sometimes you get some guys who develop the strategy and some guys who put it into production.Yes, I do admit there can be some specialization in terms of time spent on science vs engineering.But you really need people who understand both. Particularly if you have a strategist who thinks his job is just to dream up profitable models, he ends up carving that role out in a way that&#39;s detrimental to the rest of the team. You get people who just don&#39;t appreciate that there&#39;s other work to do than finding models, and that models depend on that other work to function.You also get a huge prestige gap, because inevitably management will think that there&#39;s a magician and a blacksmith. One guy needs to be paid a lot, and the other guy needs to be paid enough.These effects feed each other. Magician will say &#34;where&#39;s my data&#34; and expect blacksmith to make it, promptly. He won&#39;t do it himself, because spending time on mundane stuff makes the magic disappear. And not doing it yourself, or taking the time to understand it, will eventually lead to problems with the magic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Preach!The data lifecycle is waaay overpopulated with Data Scientists who are not empowered or knowledgeable enough to work with product designers and engineers to do everything that empowers Data Science and ML.We need more Data Engineers involved at time zero in projects to help:1. Plan out what data should be produced/captured by the product2. Instrument systems to actually generate data consistently and effectively3. Build ETL pipelines and data management systems4. Manage enterprise data sharing and resiliencyetc...What ends up happening is you have a bunch of Data Scientists just handed a pg_dump or flat file from some ops team. That is typically missing data or poorly formatted and they spend 90% of their time cleaning it up then running some basic regression with numpy or whatever.Need better understanding of the data lifecycle by organizations and investment in instrumentation and data management."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t recommend the Data Engineer career enough for junior developers. It&#39;s how I started and what I pursued for 6 years (and I would love doing it again), and I feel like it gave me such an incredible foundation for future roles :- Actually big data (so, not something you could grep...) will trigger your code in every possible way. You quickly learn that with trillions of input, the probabily to reach a bug is either 0% or 100%. In turn, you quickly learn to write good tests.- You will learn distributed processing at a macro level, which in turn enlighten your thinking at a micro level. For example, even though the order of magnitudes are different, hitting data over network versus on disk is very much like hitting data on disk versus in cache. Except that when the difference ends up being in hours or days, you become much more sensible to that, so it&#39;s good training for your thoughts.- Data engineering is full of product decisions. What&#39;s often called data &#34;cleaning&#34; is in fact one of the import product decisions made in a company, and a data engineer will be consistently exposed to his company product, which I think makes for great personal development- Data engineering is fascinating. In adtech for example, logs of where ads are displayed are an unfiltered window on the rest of humanity, for the better or the worse. But it definitely expands your views on what the &#34;average&#34; person actually does on its computer (spoiler : it&#39;s mainly watching porn...), and challenges quite a bit what you might think is &#34;normal&#34;- You&#39;ll be plumbing technologies from all over the web, which might or might not be good news for you.So yeah, data engineering is great ! It&#39;s not harder than other specialties for developers, but imo, it&#39;s one of the fun ones !"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Also embarrassing:https://www.vice.com/en/article/n7vqew/the-hacker-who-archiv...&gt; donk_enby had originally intended to grab data only from the day of the Capitol takeover, but found that the poor construction and security of Parler allowed her to capture, essentially, the entire website. That ended up being 56.7 terabytes of data, which included every public post on Parler, 412 million files in all—including 150 million photos and more than 1 million videos. Each of these had embedded metadata like date, time and GPS coordinates—unlike most social media sites, Parler does not strip metadata from media its users upload, which, crucially, could be useful for law enforcement and open source investigators."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I personally don&#39;t find their ability to remain online that surprising.The Pirate Bay and other torrent networks were built by people with a passion for building, maintaining and hacking things. People who, even without a solid CS background, would spend hours a day learning new things, developing distributed protocols, evading DNS blocks and hosting their content wherever they could to make it accessible - included the small server in their own garage if needed. And they are used by people who don&#39;t mind learning a new protocol or how to use a new client to get the content they want.I don&#39;t see the same amount of passion for technology and hacking among the Parler users, nor its maintainers. Those who believe in conspiracy content are people characterized by a psychological tendency to take shortcuts whenever they can in order to minimize their efforts in learning and understanding new things. So when the first blocker hits they usually can&#39;t see alternative solutions, because it&#39;s not the way their brains are wired. They always expect somebody else to come up with solutions for them, and they always blame somebody else when the solution won&#39;t come. And even if they decided to migrate their content to the dark web or on a Tor network, not many people will follow them - both because they don&#39;t have the skills, and because they don&#39;t want to acquire those skills. Plus, they&#39;d lose the &#34;viral network effect&#34; that they get when posting click-bait content on public networks, the new censorship-proof network will only attract a small bunch of already radicalized people.And even if they wanted to hire some smart engineers to do the job for them, we all know that engineers tend to swing on the other opposite of the ideological spectrum. Those who have built systems for escaping REAL authoritarian censorship would rightfully feel disgusted if asked to apply their knowledge to provide a safe harbour for rednecks to vomit their conspiracy-theories-fueled hate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got the sense while crawling data from their API that the engineering quality is poor at Parler. Dates were represented as strings in &#34;YYYYMMDD&#34; format (so today would be &#34;20210113053923&#34;) instead of UNIX timestamps, certain fields were duplicated for no reason (e.g. every object would have an identical &#34;id&#34; and &#34;_id&#34; key), counts of impressions/comments/etc would be the display strings rather than raw numbers (so &#34;2k&#34; or &#34;5m&#34;), and various moderation flags were in place like a boolean &#34;sensitive&#34; which was always false, even for posts that had been downvoted significantly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did some quick math, and the 240k acres it says they own comes out to about 378 square miles, which if condensed down to a square would be 20 miles by 20 miles.On the one hand, that&#39;s a lot of land. On the other, it&#39;s not really anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bill Gates is the wealthiest person in the world (or arguably Arnault).You might say, no, Musk and Bezos are worth 50% (or ~60 billion) more. On paper yes, but that&#39;s not a great metric. When I think of wealth, I think of what you can reasonably acquire.If you multiply Musk&#39;s shares in Tesla times the current share price, sure you get 180 billion. But if he tried to sell a large number those shares, they&#39;d plummet in value as he was selling them. Without Musk, I&#39;d be surprised if Tesla is worth 20% of its current valuation. To a lesser extent, this is true of Bezos too, although Amazon without him is still a very valuable company.On the other hand, Bill Gates owns 1.6% of Microsoft, which I believe is his biggest holding, followed by Berkshire Hathaway stock. I&#39;d bet he can sell both of those holdings completely without a huge hit to either stock price (but definitely some hit). Same with his farmland and other alternative assets. On top of that, having already sold his Microsoft shares, he&#39;s not subject to as much capital gains tax as Bezos or Musk, each of whom pretty much owe 20% of their total net worth the second they want to sell.So on paper, Musk and Bezos are wealthier, but if all of them decided to Scrooge McDuck it and put all their money into a gold filled vault tomorrow, Bill Gates&#39; vault would be the fullest.EDIT: typo above... Originally said that Musk owns 180 bn in Amazon stock :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is another article that isn&#39;t just about farmland, but about land ownership in general: https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2019/11/25/these-people...Of note, the Gates don&#39;t even appear on this list. At first I thought it&#39;s because OP is only talking about farmland, but in the USA Today article the Simplot family apparently owns more than 400k acres for potato farming in Idaho, but doesn&#39;t even appear in the OP. I&#39;m not sure what to make of the discrepancy.Also for the sake of comparison, 240k acres is a good amount, but (as another commenter mentioned), it&#39;s also not. There are some cattle ranches larger than that. And for an example of non farm/ranch use, Bezos apparently owns over 400,000 acres in West Texas to be used for the Blue Origin launch facilities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some good points in the article, but I disagree with the tone and the conclusion.&gt; we’ve rewarded and lauded incremental researchers as innovators, increased their budgets so they can do even more incremental researchThere isn&#39;t a scientific field where every single paper is groundbreaking. It&#39;s a Brownian motion of small incremental innovations, until eventually we stumble upon something big (like deep learning). In no way is machine learning unique in this. Sounds like the author is simply disappointed that, like in any other profession, day-to-day of a researcher is a slog and not a perennial intellectual festival. We&#39;ve been in an exciting deep learning craze for a while, but it&#39;s silly to expect it to last forever. Back to the grind now.&gt; Machine Learning Researchers can now engage in risk-free, high-income, high-prestige workNot sure what author means by &#34;risk-free&#34;. Yes, if you&#39;re not publishing enough you&#39;re most likely not going to starve. Is that a bad thing? Is the survival instinct the only good motivator for doing good research?I would argue that there&#39;s plenty of risk, in that people who don&#39;t publish good research don&#39;t get very far in their academic careers, which in my view is good enough motivation. &#34;They must do good research or starve&#34; is a rather cynical take, especially from someone who seems to not be doing too badly for themselves.I&#39;d rather more fields provided similar benefits. Maybe then going into science wouldn&#39;t be associated with so much sacrifice, so more smart people would choose science over investment banking or such, and we&#39;d make more scientific progress faster.&gt; CNNs use convolutions which are a generalization of matrix multiplication.A nitpick: CNNs are most definitely not a generalization of matrix multiplication. In fact, the opposite: you can view CNNs as a matrix multiplication with a particular matrix structure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is dead-on, but I think it is missing a fairly large segment of where ML is actually working well: anomaly detection and industrial defect detection.While I agree that everyone was shocked, myself included, when we saw how well SSD and YOLO worked, the last mile problem is stagnating. What I mean is: 7 years ago I wrote an image pipeline for a company using traditional AI methods. It was extremely challenging. When we saw SSDMobileNet do the same job 10x faster with a fraction of the code, our jaws dropped. Which is why the dev ship turned on a dime: there&#39;s something big in there.The industry is stagnated for exactly the reasons brought up: we don&#39;t know how to squeeze out the last mile problem because NNs are EFFING HARD and research is very math heavy: e.g., it cannot be hacked by a Zuck-type into a half-assed product overnight, it needs to be carefully researched for years. This makes programmers sad, because by nature we love to brute force trial-and error our code, and homey don&#39;t play that game with machine learning.However, places where it isn&#39;t stagnating are things like vibration and anomaly detection. This is a case where https://github.com/YumaKoizumi/ToyADMOS-dataset really shines because it adds something that didn&#39;t exist before, and it doesn&#39;t have to be 100% perfect: anything is better than nothing.At Embedded World last year I saw tons of FPGA solutions for rejecting parts on assembly lines. Since every object appears nearly in canonical form (good lighting, centered, homogeneous presentation), NN&#39;s are kicking ass bigtime in that space.It is important to remember Self-Driving Car Magic is just the consumer-facing hype machine. ML/NNs are working spectacularly well in some domains."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a nice talk by Yann LeCun where he goes on to explain really well why deep learning has such fast progress. [0]He goes on to explain how theory always comes later.I thought that information theory came before practice but turns out it also came after. (there was a bunch of heuristics for sending messages with teletypes)A nice example is Roman technological advances in architecture and materials that predate the use of geometry or mathematics completely. All advancements a result of tinkering and heuristics.[0]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG5NCkMerHU"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My time to shine!Hazelnut Choc Chip cookies, designed for Aquafaba.NB. You can switch out more of the hazelnut/almond meal to adjust the taste, but don&#39;t go much below 1/2 cup of almond!https://imgur.com/a/G2M1QoE    1 &amp; 1/4 cup almond meal
    1 &amp; 1/4 cup hazelnut meal
    1/2 cup dark chocolate chips
    2/3 cup flour (gluten free blend works fine)
    2/3 cup raw sugar
    1 tsp baking powder
    1/2 tsp salt (ideally fine)
    
    Mix above together, set aside.
    
    1/2 cup aquafaba
    
    Separately, whisk aquafaba until fluffy
    
    6 tbsp coconut oil (liquid)
    1 tsp vanilla extract
    
    Add to aquafaba, whisk until combined
    Add dry ingredients from above
    Mix until tacky dough forms
    Place in fridge for 30 minutes
    
    Preheat oven to 190C
    
    Form a ball from about 1.5 tablespoons of dough.
    Place ball onto baking paper lined tray.
    Bake in oven for about 15 minutes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used aquafaba in cooking a lot, mostly to avoid using so many eggs in baking. And while I&#39;ve had great results for a few specific recipes, I&#39;ve also found that it&#39;s not a universal egg replacement, and it&#39;s hard to tell which recipes it will and won&#39;t work in.I bake a lot of gluten-free and grain-free breads and biscuits, and aquafaba is a great egg replacement in these. Sometimes it even produces a better texture. But in other recipes, like cookies, it doesn&#39;t work at all; the dough loses its shape completely and deflates into a puddle.I&#39;ve also read about using aquafaba to make meringue or mousse, but I haven&#39;t had good luck with that so far. The chickpea taste is strong, and does not go with sugar at all.I haven&#39;t tried using any beans other than chickpeas. Maybe it would work better with different beans."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aquafaba is amazing. But since we&#39;re talking about egg replacers, here&#39;s one even more remarkable:Carbonated water.No joke. Carbonated water can seamlessly replace egg in almost all things where the egg provides some rising / fluffy texture (not so much binding, like aquafaba does). It won&#39;t be stepping in your quiche any time soon, but cookies, brownies, cupcakes, anything with a fluffy inside.1/4 cup of water equals one egg. Try it, you&#39;ll be amazed.https://iambaker.net/egg-substitutes/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So is Google going to throw them out of the Play store? What&#39;s the argument for banning one social media and not another. Where do you draw the line that manages to keep Facebooks app available, while still being able to defend the removal of Parler.I know many will think I&#39;m defending Parler, I&#39;m not. I just don&#39;t see why Facebook is continuously given a free pass for all the horrible stuff on their platform. Is it just because Facebook has other uses, because they&#39;re bigger or because an app store that doesn&#39;t have a Facebook app will experience a huge backlash from consumers?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somebody from Facebook recently told me they developed the best system to flag radical/violent content in the world, I pointed out they first developed the best system to spread it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a side-note, I hate how Facebook sticks to their real name policy and does not allow for the creation of multiple accounts (I&#39;d want one for my startup / work etc. and another for my personal use case for my friends / family etc.).That said, all the mainstream social media apps - Facebook and Twitter had a hand and if Parler was de-platformed with that reason, then they should be as well.I mean, if a 700B and a 50B company can&#39;t solve this issue, than how can we expect a much much smaller company like Parler to tackle it?But it&#39;s obvious that these companies don&#39;t give a damn about the insurrection - This was entirely to pacify the dems by giving them a &#34;Win&#34; considering they have the House, Senate and Presidency.It&#39;s funny because the company I&#39;m currently consulting for a company that has a ~1B/yr account with Amazon and we&#39;ve decided to slow our cloud migration projects. We run a major media site and if AWS decides to capitulate to the pressure from essentially people on social media or the wrath of the US Govt, what&#39;s stopping them from doing the exact same from Govts of other countries?"</p>
