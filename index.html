								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I LOVE Proton. About 85% of my Windows games just... work. And probably 75% of the 15% that fail initially only require a little tweaking to make work.My only complaints are that steam uses arbitrary numbers instead of human readable labels for emulated AppData folders. It can be time consuming to locate a save game file. Also Streaming cross platform isn&#39;t a pleasant experience yet but it&#39;s getting better and I really appreciate the feature. My final gripe is that when adding media to a Steam chat on Linux the file open dialog does not cache the last folder you visited and doesn&#39;t support multiple files. This compounds the first problem I listed making it EXTREMELY time consuming to share multiple game files with friends quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proton is the reason I moved from a Windows + MacOS machine to GNU/Linux full time. I understand the concern that some hardcore enthusiasts might have about it making devs lazy when it comes to developing native ports but to be honest I don&#39;t care. I am just glad to have a simple method of gaming on GNU/Linux. Proton plus Lutris and the slew other tools that have come out in recent years has made the transition to GNU/Linux very easy and has opened the door for many who were curious but scared of the learning curb."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My problem with Proton is that they are not strict enough with their ratings. I see a game has &#34;platinum&#34; or &#34;gold&#34; support and think &#34;great, this will work well!&#34; but then I discover it crashes after alt-tab and multiplayer doesn&#39;t work at all, which I consider critical bugs.To me, the levels should be:* Paltinum - the game works as well as it does on officially supported platforms* Gold - the game works almost as well as on supported platforms but with minor niggles that don&#39;t significantly affect the experience* Bronze - the game works in some form, but major things might be broken. It would not ship in this state on official platforms.However, the project is a great start and I look forward to what they do next!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have deep aversion to &#34;Open source projects should run office hours&#34; title.Maybe &#34;Office hours may be a good idea for open source projects&#34;? This would not suggest obligation.In general, fact that someone created or maintains or supports open source projects should not be considered to create any obligations beyond lack of malice and abuse.I am not obligated to support any bugs, create any features and it is perfectly fine to delete all my repos at any time (unless I declared otherwise).I am also not obligated to support anything, help with anything, there is no guarantee of uptime, office hours, resolving issues or anything else.If you want obligations, guarantees or anything like that - feel free to hire a given developer.Many such things are good ideas and some people may decide to promise them (if you describe something as secure then you declared to handle security issues timely). But I reject idea of being obligated to do any of above."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a lot of the comments are concluding from the title that open source maintainers should be working on the projects during office hours.That is not what the article is suggesting.From the article -&gt;&gt;  anyone can book a 25 minute conversation with me on a Friday to talk about the project. I’m interested in talking to people who are using Datasette, or who are considering using it, or who just want to have a chat.&gt;&gt;A challenge of open source is that it’s easy to be starved of feedback. People might file bug reports if something breaks, but other than that it can feel like publishing software into a void.&gt;&gt; Hearing directly from people who are using your stuff is incredibly motivational. It’s also an amazing source of ideas and feedback on where the project should go next.I think that&#39;s really a fantastic suggestion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had massive success with this in ML. My twitter DMs have become almost-daily office hour sessions with people trying to solve hard ML problems. The last fellow was so happy he venmo&#39;d me $250 after I merely asked for &#34;pay whatever you thought that was worth.&#34;Apparently putting &#34;DMs open&#34; in your twitter bio is an excellent way to meet new people. Also, tweet (often!) about what you&#39;re working on. Post lots of questions, notes to self, and screenshots or videos.To get followers, you&#39;ll need to go inject yourself into conversations. That seems to be the most reliable way to get noticed.We also run an ML discord server and do informal office hours for people working on various ML products. It may sound cheesy, but I try to emulate what pg would do in a YC office hours session. It seems to keep them pretty focused.So, yes! Glad to see office hours are becoming mainstream. Try it out; you&#39;ll probably be surprised."</p>

So you can open Windows Update and it will say &#34;fully updated and secured&#34;, but you&#39;re not. Complicating matters, Cumulative Updates for Exchange 2019 have to be done from the licensing portal, with a valid logon.So maybe you have a perfectly capable 24x7 tech team, but the guy who manages license acquisition is on leave today.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The competitive advantages of owning both the application and the data are so high that don&#39;t see widespread BYOC ever happening without government intervention.I&#39;d like to see an enforced separation in law between commercial application providers and storage providers. So, if someone writes an app like Google Docs, they can&#39;t just store the data opaquely on their own cloud servers. They legally have to integrate with a separate storage provider. And that storage provider has an obligation to make my data accessible and manageable by me.This wouldn&#39;t be a panacea, but it at least makes it theoretically possible to write a replacement client for Google Docs that could be a drop-in replacement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This idea suffers from the same problem federation does. It&#39;s harder to move a whole ecosystem. Makes it harder to innovate. Leads to centralized platforms outperforming these BYOC/federated/open options. Basically how Reddit replaced Usenet with upvotes and basic spam filtering.There&#39;s more on this from &#39;moxiehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nj3YFprqAr8https://signal.org/blog/the-ecosystem-is-moving/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The funding is going to a mix of cable, fiber, and fixed wireless providers, plus SpaceX&#39;s Starlink satellite network.I think cable providers should be left out. They were already gifted many billions of dollars in the past for this same basic purpose but they pocketed the money.  They can just use the free money they&#39;ve already been given.  Instead, the funding should go to existing munipical fiber ISPs to expand their coverage.  Give money to people with a proven track record of doing what you want, not people with a proven track record of keeping the money for themselves.I&#39;m on municipal fiber and it&#39;s amazing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imagine how good our network technology policy would be if the Senate weren&#39;t run by septagenarians and octogenarian.I fear that data caps for home internet will become standard. There is no technological reason for these caps. For wireless, they could be defended by arguing that companies only get to use so much spectrum because of FCC laws. But the only limit for home internet is the ISP&#39;s willingness to deploy equipment and install cable/fiber runs. That&#39;s exactly what customers are paying them to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lets try and suss out some of the multiple issues with US internet:-regulating ISPs as a free market is, to be hyperbolic, a disaster. there is effectively a monopoly in most parts of the country.-25/3 Mbps is a very reasonable speed for most people. the issue is that its provided on a best effort basis that is never maintained for long, if at all. netflix says thats enough to stream UHD[0]-FTA: &#34;Those data points likely undercount the number of unserved Americans because the FCC lets ISPs count an entire census block as served even if it can serve just one home in the block&#34; hilarious - what else is there to say.-FTA: &#34;The senators are also frustrated by differing standards across agencies. [...] the FCC defines [...] Alternatively, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines&#34; why is this the federal government&#39;s job again? the internet is clearly not an enumerated power. is this the interstate commerce clause that keeps on giving in action again? i think decentralizing federal power would help alleviate a lot of the existential dread vis a vi corruption that many americans are feeling.all in all, this reeks of regulatory capture to me. if we&#39;re gonna have a serious discussion about internet infrastructure, i think the starting point is how we classify ISPs and where in the city-state-federal hierarchy the responsibility lies. changing a 25 to a 100 is a cool bullet on a resume, but i dont think this is the low handing fruit here.[0]https://help.netflix.com/en/node/306"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just don&#39;t get it why developers like Scrum.
The whole thing was designed to give non-technical people more power over the ones who spent a lifetime honing their craftmanship. Standing around a table in the morning like assholes is not my idea of fun. Same for the &#34;product owner&#34; concept. If I develop something, I am the owner. I generally hate being micromanaged and being assigned microtasks that gives &#34;them&#34; total control over my workday while I have no idea what &#34;they&#34; are doing the whole day. 
Scrum was the reason why I left my last company and I&#39;m much happier now in my new company, where we do not have any process at all, just a common goal. Instead of standups, the team gathers for a coffee in the morning. If I want to spend 3 days learning a new framework that might do the product good, nobody cares. The only thing that counts is the endresult. That means we are beating the product into submission until its good, even if it means rewriting the thing three times and missing deadlines.
So no more Scrum for me. Never."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think you need to separate Agile from Scrum to be honest.Agile is at is core just some suggestions for teams to work well together. There are no stand ups or sprints or whatever.Scrum was created by one of the creators of the agile manifesto as a way to see consulting/training around the &#39;Agile&#39; idea (timeframes may differ a bit, but they were linked). There is an interview/article by one of the creators of the agile manifesto (Kent Beck maybe?, will try to dig it up and edit the answer if I find -&gt; was Robert C. Martin, see below) where he explains a bit the story and compares it to Agile (and basically says scrum has nothing to do with the original agile manifesto)On a personal level, I hate scrum. The stand ups, the sprints, the retros or grooming or whatever they have nowadays. It is literally one of the first questions I ask in an interview about their processes and excuse myself from the process if I see if they follow it. It may work for others, but for me personally, I hate it with a fervour.Though I agree with the Agile manifesto though, unfortunately it isn&#39;t very &#39;manager&#39; friendly so you usually get scrum instead.Edit: link to a reference to the article, can&#39;t find the original but found this: https://www.aaron-gray.com/a-criticism-of-scrum/#scrum-strai..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What’s so funny to me is what you’re describing is the nightmare that’s become scrum as opposed to actual agility. Agile is about ditching managers, bureaucracy, and estimates in favor of empowering the team itself.Agility is just what it says: a philosophy of flexibility and adaptiveness.Heirarchies, heavy processes, etc are by definition inflexible. They are not agile. You do not do agile. You are agile. You are agile because your company has a culture that is agile and you cannot achieve that unless the company is structured to be flexible.I think actual agility is really, really a great way to build software efficiently... but unfortunately most programmers will only experience the cargo cult forced upon them by certified scrum masters... and this is just as bad, perhaps worse, than old fashioned waterfall.More than anything, working in an agile environment is a very pleasant thing to do from a human standpoint. But most companies are incapable of the kind of equality and empowerment necessary to achieve agility, so they will force the terrible cargo cult version upon us."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who&#39;s just written about the &#34;small web&#34; [1], this warms my heart. The lite version is probably a little too bare-bones for most people&#39;s tastes, but it sure is tiny -- great for people on very slow or flakey connections. Some numbers:HTML homepage transfers 34KB (94KB uncompressed) over 6 requests. HTML search results page transfers 133KB (248KB uncompressed) over 31 requests.Lite homepage transfers 13KB (11KB uncompressed, ha) over 4 requests. Lite search results page transfers 21KB (43KB uncompressed) over 5 requests.In all cases, all requests are to *.duckduckgo.com, which was very good to see from a privacy perspective. Nice work, DDG![1] https://benhoyt.com/writings/the-small-web-is-beautiful/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Up until not long ago, Google search result pages worked well without JS, and if you sent a suitably old UA header, you&#39;d get the &#34;original&#34; version without mangled URLs or any of the other bloat. Then in 2019 or so, in what I consider to be an extremely hostile move, they started redirecting (using meta tags) to a horrible dumbed-down mobile-ish version and using styles-removed-by-JS to &#34;hide&#34; the actual content of the &#34;full&#34; version (which has the &#34;modern&#34; mangled URLs) if you managed to reach it anyway, so all you&#39;d see was a blank page. It&#39;s almost like they were deliberately trying to make something that only worked in the latest version of Chrome or whatever few other &#34;modern&#34; browsers exist today, and decided to force non-JS users to a worse experience than they had had for the past decade or more. Nothing a filtering proxy can&#39;t fix (and I brought back true URLs at the same time), but I was absolutely incensed when that happened.I don&#39;t think a search engine should ever require JS to be usable. The existence of search engines[1] predates the existence of JS, and of course the HTML mechanism of form submission and displaying a list of links predates both of those.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JumpStation"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks really good! At first glance, this seems like probably the best Electron alternative I&#39;ve seen posted on HN.Apart from the consistent GUI layer, I think an underrated reason that many teams stick with Electron is the mature tooling for cross-platform builds and upgrades. It&#39;s pretty painful to DIY.It looks like NodeGUI doesn&#39;t currently support cross-compilation--is that something that&#39;s on the roadmap? How about upgrade/auto-upgrade tooling? Code signing?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some problems that Fukushima had: 1950s vintage design, active cooling system, backup power at sea level in a seismically active area.  This kind of failure was not just predictable, it was predicted.People travel to Japan from around the world to learn how to build earthquake resistant structures.  Their nuclear engineers are top-notch.  It was the bureaucracy that failed, not the talent.In short, the problems were human not technical.  People get complacent and greedy.  They use every procedural tool they have to delay upgrades, maintenance, and improvement.  I think that is at the core of most nuclear skepticism.  Does anyone honestly think the United States has institutions sound enough to safely manage nuclear power over multiple decades?  Or will they neglect basic maintenance and upgrades?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The key thing to remember is that power sources like coal and other fossil fuels have a very real health cost. A large number of people die every year. However a nuclear accident is much more &#34;exciting&#34; news and sticks in people&#39;s mind. People dying of cancer, asthma and other conditions are not as direct or as dramatic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real trouble with the light water reactor is not the nuclear part but the steam turbine it is attached to.Unfortunately people have a way of driving while looking in the rear view mirror and much of the discussion around nuclear energy revolves around issues of the 1970s.In the 1970s coal burning power plants were the cost king of power plants.  There was some concern about making them cleaner,  but by the 1980s gas turbine power plants with 10 times the power density (e.g. 1/10 the capital cost)  were becoming widespread and people quit building coal plants.(A big literature got left behind about how to drive a gas turbine from coal,  on paper it would be lower capital cost than a conventional coal plant,  but the technology never got developed at full scale.)Even if the heat was free it would be hard for a steam turbine based power plant to compete with gas turbines.Now it should be possible to build a nuclear power plant based on the brayton cycle using helium or carbon dioxide or some similar gas as a working fluid.  You then need to use helium or sodium or lead as a coolant because the pressure would be too high with water.Fast reactors are the best developed option,  followed by the prismatic HTGR,  then the thorium reactors.  Pebble-bed HTGR looked pretty good until an expose came out that a German pebble bed reactor had a difficult time...  Turns out pebbles that slide past each other just fine in air will get stuck on each other and crack in helium.When Bill Gates and others go around saying we have to get over the safety issue they are continuing the stigma.  Nuclear power is not going to get out of it&#39;s funk unless it has a cost story that looks good when everything goes right -- which is not the case with the LWR."</p>
