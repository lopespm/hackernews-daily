								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I haven&#39;t seen mentioned here is that Homebrew forced people use Ruby to write formulas (ie packages), whereas MacPorts forced people to use Tcl. This one decision, plus hosting formulas on Github, was a major contributor to their present success.As much as I sympathize (deeply) with all the criticism of Homebrew here on this thread -- I used to use MacPorts religiously and love it -- I don&#39;t think Homebrew took the field purely through sneaky marketing or n00b decisions alone. They leveraged the momentum of a lot of new devs coming to OS X and provided an easier path for people wanting to help out.I hate to say it, but if this was a race (?), Homebrew won. Thankfully we all still have the choice to use MacPorts if we want, but there&#39;s no point in being mean about Homebrew at this point either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dear Homebrew maintainers,one simple effing thing: thank you! For all the hard work and the sheer pleasure Homebrew adds to the experience of developing software on a Mac."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The majority of the ports and software I want installed are essentially Unix/Linux/GNU environment tools.Macports has always seemed to me to be a more &#34;unix-y&#34; way of doing that, and it works politely with Apple&#39;s ways on top of the Unix core (eg locking down the system volume).It also has a very nice &#34;select&#34; and &#34;variants&#34; system that allows you to have multiple versions of a package as well as packages with more or less functionality (eg integrating with the MacOS keychain etc).When I first got into Macs (only around 5 years ago), I looked at both homebrew and macports and as soon as I saw homebrew blasting stuff into /usr/local while macports neatly put everything in /opt, I was convinced to go with macports. I also had previous experience with the BSD&#39;s port systems, which helped push me towards macports.But I&#39;m open to being convinced about homebrew, although I&#39;ve never needed something that it had that macports didnt."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s always interesting to watch other companies give presentations in their attempt at Apple style. Google comes to mind as being the worst.It’s like everyone has analyzed or identified certain little nuggets of a good presentation and then sprinkled them in... versus truly and innately understanding how to deliver a cohesive performance to an audience. The most famous example of this is the way everyone started to use “we did x y and z and you’re going to love it!” which was thrown around like peanuts on a domestic flight.Richard Feynman’s quote on cargo culting comes to mind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the most insightful Q&amp;A&#39;s about Steve that I&#39;ve read.  I especially appreciated the part about the risers for the gumdrop iMacs not working perfectly smoothly: he was pissed even though the audience couldn&#39;t possibly see the stuttering risers and even though the keynote was successful.One might think Steve Jobs was an arrogant, perfectionist prick.  But you realize in this small story, that the whole keynote could have been torpedoed, could have gone sideways and been ridiculed, if those mechanical risers had failed.  The big moment for this product that could (and did) save the company, might have been a laughable sad trombone even though Steve had warned Wayne that it was a problem that needed to be fixed.The work of hundreds of people, and hundreds of millions of dollars, were pitted against shitty mechanical hand-cranks -- that&#39;s why small details matter, and why Steve was pissed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Title should probably have [Advert] prefix or something.That said, I deleted my Disqus account as part of a general cleanup and I&#39;m glad I did.The web needs to shift more to a model where people pay openly for services; ideally with micropayments or a Spotify-like subscription to ensure a large user base. Free products are ok as a gateway to the paid product, but not if the business model relies on selling data (either directly, or as in Facebook&#39;s case selling the processing of data)."</p>

You control the data, your users choose where they want to be signed up, and the system will not disappear overnight because a company decides to discontinue it. And of course there are no trackers/pixels.This is a hobby project that we&#39;re launching in three weeks. If you are interested, come talk to us on matrix (https://matrix.to/#/#cactus:bordum.dk) or keep an eye on our (for now dummy-) landing page: https://cactus.chat/, https://gitlab.com/cactus-comments"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author of the post runs a competitor called Hyvor Talk (he discloses this at the end). I&#39;ve had hyvor talk for more than a year. I don&#39;t run a blog thats very popular, but it has been quite easy to integrate (I use React, Gatsby/ static side generation, and Hyvor Talk has a react component). An example of the system is at the bottom of that blog post. There used to be a free tier, but now there isn&#39;t. I am only still using it because existing customers have the free tier and haven&#39;t bothered to look for alternatives. Unfortunately, you can&#39;t get it free anymore. I would love to see free tier reintroduced.I did find some bugs with the React component itself, but it wasn&#39;t bad enough to make me stop using it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love this book (the first edition), project, and course.It is incomplete, but I thought I would share my implementation of the software stack in F#. Currently, only the assembler is implemented, but in my personal opinion, I think it showcases the beauty of F# for domain modeling. When I return to the project, I hope to restart the VM implementation and continue adding to the FPGA implementation as well. My eventual goal is to have the entire software stack built using F# that can than be run on an FPGA implementation of the CPU.https://github.com/bmitc/nand2tetrisTypes to model the instructions and source file expressions: https://github.com/bmitc/nand2tetris/blob/main/dotnet/Nand2T...The full assembler, mainly consisting of the parser and translator: https://github.com/bmitc/nand2tetris/blob/main/dotnet/Nand2T..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As others have commented, the original book was one of those little gems that once you read, you realise how blind you were before, and it is extremely accessible.Often material is either too abstract or far too detailed, ECS managed to find the perfect balance where someone with a CS background can drill down to transistors and come back upwards again and really understand where they are going on that journey."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an impressive amount of hubris. Does the author assume that all the certifications and testing stages were for show?I don&#39;t hold the highest view of LessWrong and the whole rationalist shtick. This post exemplifies why. Underneath this post is the assumption that the author is so much smarter than everybody else because they are Rational with a capital R and can therefore harness the power of science to make a vaccine[^1]. Again, that&#39;s an incredible amount of hubris. If there&#39;s one universal truth about science, it&#39;s that it is extremely specialized. Just because someone knows a lot about chemistry doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re qualified to talk about biology. There is no magic Rationality that can have amateurs making vaccines a good idea. Unless you are an expert in vaccines a priori, you cannot suddenly become one in a few weeks.Heck, I&#39;m skeptical of doctors who are not infectious disease experts giving advice. I still hear a lot of  &#34;well my sister&#39;s neighbor&#39;s brother is a pediatrician and he said XYZ&#34;. Doctors are certainly more educated than the average person, and if this was a minor medical problem I&#39;d certainly take a random doctor&#39;s advice. But this is a pandemic with a novel disease. Listen to the infectious disease experts.[1]: Quite honestly this feels like a plotline from Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there is one thing I certainly wouldn&#39;t just play around with it&#39;s the immune system. It&#39;s incredibly dangerous and easily capable of causing all kinds of harm to yourself up to killing you outright.A vaccine is designed to produce an immune response of the right magnitude. Too low and it doesn&#39;t work, too high and it&#39;ll cause damage. At least one of the vaccine candidates in development was put back to the drawing board because the immune response wasn&#39;t strong enough. So this is not an area that is entirely predictable, you have to carefully test this to know if it works.I&#39;d also be very careful about the inhalation route. Inhalable insulin is a well-known failure, in part because of side effects due to the inhalation. And that is a protein that isn&#39;t designed to activate your immune system.I also hope the synthesized peptides were carefully purified, you really don&#39;t want to inhale e.g. residual trifluoracetic acid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TLDR: I attempted to make a COVID vaccine. It was cheap. I have no proof that it worked. Other risks are unknown.The story reminds me of Barry Marshall, but with less science behind it. https://jamesclear.com/barry-marshall"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those defending this practice, consider carefully the implications of what you are advocating.On one hand you have a government deciding who can and cannot refer to themselves as adherents of a particular religion (by declaring that Ahamadis cannot call themselves Muslim).On another hand you have Google and Apple, yet again, being the complicit chokepoints of “free speech”, with regard to app developers.These may seem fair to you, but that may be because these practices have not negatively affected you...yet.But consider: Would it be fair if England declared Catholics “unChristian” and banned their use if the term?  Or what if the USA declared hasidic jews “Unjewish” and banned their use of the term. Or what if Apple caved to pressure theoretical from Israel to ban Jehovah’s Witnesses from using the term “Jehovah”?What next?  Government declaring who is and is not “white”?Oh wait......"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I keep thinking about infamous Telegram &#39;war&#39; with russian cenrosship agency, RosKomNadzor. Telegram was blocked via russian ISPs, but was never removed from Russian sections of Google Play and Apple Appstore.We now see that Apple and Google, time after time, easily submit to the will of local governments and remove questionable apps. Yet, Telegram was NOT removed. Russian media agencies claim that RosKomNadzor asked Google&amp;Apple to suspend the app, but the source for all media publications was always the same press-release by RKN. So it keeps me thinking: what if the world was played and all this &#39;blocking&#39; scandal was just a publicity stunt to raise Telegram&#39;s profile as a service that does not give up data to authorities?Does anyone know if we can confirm via Google &amp; Apple that they were asked to remove Telegram from play stores (and refused), or... they weren&#39;t really asked at all?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just another reason why you don&#39;t want companies like Apple and Google to be the gatekeepers. Technology can set you free, but only if you let it. If you don&#39;t, it can easily become a new tool of oppression."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; We believe privacy is paramount and free speech essential, especially on social media.this, from their &#34;technical difficulties&#34; notice, should have been enough for him to be fired on its own.  requiring some users to provide government identification, building such weak security that anyone can read and archive private messages, and not stripping out damaging meta-data from media posts are three ways to not provide privacy.if this was truly their mission, then their platform was already doomed, and a full housecleaning of most of the leadership should probably be done, not just the CEO.I don&#39;t care what side of a political spectrum you come from, or whether you support the site&#39;s mission or what it became, these failures should be unacceptable in any company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Odd dynamic there as unfortunately, standing on principle means getting martyred, and the quote from the former CEO of, “Over the past few months, I’ve met constant resistance to my product vision, my strong belief in free speech and my view of how the Parler site should be managed” is not CEO level strategic.His investors and board hired him to win, not to pick a principled hill to die on. Martyrs are cheap and nobody making investments can afford cheap things. The irony is Parler positioned itself as less radical than Gab, and it was that very position of bargaining with its platforms is what killed it. How can 4chan, Gab, and the even darker parts of the internet manage to persist online with hardly any money, but someone with Mercer level backing can&#39;t keep a site online? The lesson is an example of things we already know, which is that anyone who needs platform permission do to a disruptive startup is already dead.We absolutely need alternative platforms, and our societies need tools that can survive popular histrionics. Getting owned by some sanctimonious prick at Amazon is not pro level play."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Parler was poor quality because it was a product of extreme political grift. People who work in politics unfortunately don&#39;t understand the mindset of actually high quality products or services. What they&#39;re interested in is quick and loud splashes to attract a huge amount of attention, pull in a bunch of capital/resources, and then underdeliver in the extreme in the hopes that the attention of the crowd will move on and ignore the failures.This is of course a bipartisan trend, but as far as I can tell affects Republicans more.It was absurdly poorly run--literally on Wordpress with very little security and obviously no bug bounty program. They probably have never even heard of the concept of a bug bounty.All around disappointing. The next iteration, if it is to work at all, will require a complete mindset switch."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just do away with tips. It&#39;s a terrible and stupid system. If you want to do it as a customer, go ahead, but it should never be considered as part of the employee&#39;s compensation. If people aren&#39;t willing to do the job for the hourly wage alone with no tips, raise the wage until they are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The FTC alleges Amazon changed the way it paid drivers in late 2016, lowering the hourly rate and then used customer tips to make up the difference. Amazon continued to tell drivers they were receiving all of their tips, even after receiving hundreds of complaints from drivers, the agency said.How is this not simply theft? Why does this attract civil charges and not criminal ones?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Previous: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26003836I appreciated samizdis’ comment, which I’ll just copy in full:FTC Commissioner Rohit Chopra has also put out a statement [1], titled Regarding the Deception of Delivery Drivers by Amazon.com Commission File No. 1923123Some extracts:&gt; In total, Amazon stole nearly one-third of drivers’ tips to pad its own bottom line. ...&gt; ... Amazon executives chose not to alter the practice, instead viewing drivers’ complaints as a “PR risk,” which they sought to contain through deception. ...&gt; Today’s order provides substantial redress to the families victimized by Amazon’s anticompetitive deception. However, this cannot be the only action we take to protect workers and families from dominant middlemen. ...&gt; I also agree with Acting Chairwoman Slaughter and Commissioner Phillips that preying on workers justifies punitive measures far beyond the restitution provided here, and I believe the FTC should act now to deploy dormant authorities to trigger civil penalties and other relief in cases like this one.[1] https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/documents/public_statements..."</p>
