								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently bought a framework laptop for a daily driver when I&#39;m not on my desktop. For context I was running NixOS on an old 2014 macbook air, and I work on the glasgow haskell compiler in my day job so I do a lot of CPU heavy tasks.I&#39;ve got to say, as long as these things are being produced I&#39;ll never go back. They are just too good and I cannot recommend them highly enough. One of the things that didn&#39;t occur to me before I bought it was that _because_ of the modular design I can switch the side the power port is on. That may not seem like much but it was a revelation the first time I sat on the couch and thought &#34;huh I really wish this was over on that side....wait a minute!&#34;.I&#39;ve also had absolutely no problems with NixOS on my machine, even my apple earbuds easily connect via bluetooth, something that I never quite got working on my macbook.10/10 This is damn close to my dream laptop and I&#39;m excited a new version is on the way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently received my first framework laptop after being a loyal Thinkpad user for years. I am loving it so far. I run Ubuntu 22.04 daily and have not had any issues with battery life or the lid (but I do typically leave it plugged in during lunch and overnight). The expansion cards are brilliant and the keyboard is comparable to my old t-series. The aspect ratio is great for coding and I&#39;m happy to see upgradeability is being taken seriously as promised. If I can get 5-10 years out of it like my old ThinkPads (all while upgrading piecewise along the way) I will be a fan for life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m happy to answer any questions around this!  We&#39;ve been working on this since update since we launched the product last year, so we&#39;re excited to be able to share it today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Imo, Vangelis brought the synthesizer from an experimental novelty to an instrument for composition. The two sounds I associate with him are the long  brassy triangle with a steep envelope that we know from both Blade Runner and the accompaniment to the piano in the Chariots of Fire theme, and his effective use of chimes.I have tickets for Olafur Arnalds next week, and there is a younger generation of composers like Arnalds, Frahm, Richter, Tiersen, Aphex/James, and even Reznor/Ross, who could not have avoided Vangelis&#39; influence marrying the synth with classical techniques. He was a big part of what inspired me to start making synth music and more than a few of my tracks have homages to his work, and this note triggered a memory of playing the Chariots theme on piano as a really young child and it seemed to be everywhere at the time. A loss, but hard to mourn such an exceptional contribution as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He was a very unique, visionary talent. To back that up, beyond his scores, take a look at the following video to get a glimpse of how he worked.https://youtu.be/GWggDMDhwIAThere used to be some forum posts detailing the custom MIDI controllers and setup more, but it looks like a lot of it has been deleted or removed.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My memory holds that magical feeling, when in the mindnight darkness and quietness of home, suddenly heard a gentle stream of silver bells and a beautiful, maybe melancholic, melody from a tiny radio speaker... with no announcement of the author or name of the song. It was then just used as a last song of the day.Took me a veeery long time and other side of the globe to hear it again, again by chance, but with attribution in that case. Then some hours trying to locate the recording...La Petite Fille de Merhttps://m.youtube.com/watch?v=P6qoTPhhv9wTruly as if having a chanceful glimpse of a Mermaid.Thank you for the magic, Master Vangelis.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They’re just one of several shiny fintech apps/websites running the same scam, a modern two-and-twenty on a ponzi — but with really nice UI.Alice (alice.co / @alice_finance) is another prominent one that may have lost customer funds, which was also using the Anchor protocol. It’s unclear how much they lost, but it’s interesting that Do Kwon’s name is still an actual logo listed on their home page.And Vertex Protocol (vertexprotocol.com / @vertex_protocol) recently raised $8.5m to launch a trading platform based on the Anchor protocol, but because their Phase 1 beta had just closed and the open launch was not planned until this summer, it looks like they may have just barely dodged the bullet?What I’m really curious about are the new and (of course) unregulated “insurance” products meant to cover catastrophic crypto depegs, as happened to Terra/Luna. Unslashed (https://app.unslashed.finance/cover) is supposed to kick in after fourteen days, I believe. We’re not quite there yet, it’s barely a week so far. But I’m sure with this kind of implied loss reserves, it’ll be fine…https://mobile.twitter.com/CurveFinance/status/1416392630754..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The last few weeks (months, really) has highlighted an incredible lack of discernment in the VC-verse wrt the thing we call web3. Now. I have no experience doing what YC does and don’t claim to, but the jig here was so transparent that the smallest drop of “street smart” should’ve been enough to set off some alarms.We’re approaching a point where being passed over for “culture fit” is a compliment. Hopefully the embarrassment is enough to expand the founder vetting checkboxes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dont like the idea of replacing the time spend compulsively procrastinating with &#34;learning a new language, getting a pet, going to the gym&#34; is the right way.I see the root cause (for me atleast (used to read HN and blogs for 4 hours everyday)) is that i cant stand being with myself.During the last two months ive been trying to not panic when i&#39;m idle. And not take out my phone or read the nearest material i can lay my hands on.Instead i try to accept the necesity of &#34;falde i staver&#34; (danish for &#39;falling out of presence&#39;). When i was a kid i would often just fall into this state and just defocus with my sight and let daydreaming take over.Basically i have a war going against effectiveness. I hold unto my right as a mammal to be inefficient and sit drooling looking at trees.My advice on &#34;doing something&#34; when you have day without plans is the following:
Bike in the forrest, coffee from thermos near the ocean, read newspapers at the library, talk to people at trainstations (the frequent hangouts are always open for conversations)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like OP isn&#39;t necessarily an addict: they have ADHD.Half the article was them complaining about poor working memory, and the rest about getting stimulation/dopamine from unhealthy sources.Everyone has &#34;a little ADHD&#34;. We all occasionally, forget things, hyperfocus on things we are excited about, etc. ADHD is the disorder of having those struggles so often it&#39;s debilitating. It stems from having an underdeveloped frontal lobe that doesn&#39;t feel dopamine as well as neurotypical brains do, meaning an ADHD brain needs more stimulus to feel healthy.Because of the deficit in stimulus, people with untreated ADHD are statistically much more likely to have a substance abuse disorder (SAD); but in many cases, treating their ADHD (with medication and cognitive behavioral therapy) has the side effect of treating their SAD.Addiction, in the public consciousness/vernacular, is more abstract than SAD: it can mean anything from chemical dependence to unwanted habits. I suspect most people tend to make a false equivalence between the former and the latter. I see all the time people struggling to change a simple habit and immediately labeling themselves &#34;addicts&#34;. I think that&#39;s a unhelpful characterization.I think the point people tend to miss is that in order to change a habit, you don&#39;t just &#34;stop doing it&#34;: you must replace it with an alternative dopamine source. This is especially tricky with untreated ADHD."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It scares me how much this reminds me of myself. I don&#39;t know how I was able to keep my job (and keep the roof over my family&#39;s heads) with my habit of not being able to concentrate on work at all because the minute I need to think a bit harder I immediately switch to reading news, HN or watching YouTube, only to finish my work late in the evening to save my ass (on good days)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This “default alive” advice is repeatedly shared.One thing it obviously does not address is the human element of who you cut and whether they will be “default alive” unemployed in a recession. A huge amount of YC advice in general positions founders as protagonists and employees as NPCs then are shocked people pick Google over their startup offer.Funny thing is I’ve seen this exact advice destroy a company. In March 2020 they did deep layoffs and cited the need to be “default alive.” Then their main market surprisingly quickly grew in the rest of 2020 , they wanted to capitalize on that, but they had laid off too many engineers who knew their infra and had enough outages and slow product development that they lost to their competitors and are now way underwater on their valuation.They decided to be serious and prudent and go “default alive” which ironically killed them. Of course if 2020 had gotten worse maybe they would look smart but the takeaway is there’s no easy answers.I would just like to see the human impact of layoffs at least lightly considered in these conversations which it rarely is. And it’s bad for business to as Im sure many people are hesitant to join companies that will have a gut reaction of doing 70% layoffs. If you even think about doing 70% layoffs you clearly over hired and are not making good leadership decisions leading up to the layoff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dagnabit. Here we go again - this is a fantastic, pragmatic amendment to those notes -&gt;https://dalton.substack.com/p/letter-to-myself-in-late-2008?...For a taste:&#34;Doing multiple small layoffs is a form of cascading failure. Do one layoff, but much much deeper than seems correct. Do it decisively. Do it so that you get profitable. In your case that is something like a 70% cut, not a 5-10% cut. Yes you read that right: a 70% cut. Cutting once and cutting hard allows you to reassure the people that are still here that you are truly profitable and won’t need to do it again. Doing a layoff and remaining unprofitable and counting on fundraising to save you is a stupid plan.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bleak.&#34;No one cannot predict how bad the economy will get, but things don&#39;t look good.&#34;Clif notes:- Plan for the worst ... cut costs within 30 days... get to Default Alive[0]- Get money if you need it, and if you can- With or without money you must survive 24 months- VCs are people too, and subject to the same downturn. Adjust your fund raising expectations in the same direction. Expect lower valuations, lower rounds and many fewer deals.- Disproportionate impact on international, asset heavy, low margin, hardtech, high burn, long road to revenue companies- If you get a meeting, don&#39;t take that as a good sign, we still take a lot of meetings.- Future fundraises will be much more difficult than they have been in the last 5 years.- Don&#39;t expect more money until you demonstrate product market fit.- If you planned on raising money in the next 6-12 months, we recommend changing that plan, or you may be tryng to raise at the peak of the downturn- If you survive, and your competitor does not, you may pick up significant market share.[0] http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This is a superficial complaint, but I found Rust syntax to be dense, heavy, and difficult to readI&#39;m a huge Rust fan, but sort of agree. First, I dislike C-style syntax in general and find it all very noisy with lots of unnecessary symbols. Second, while I love traits, when you have a trait heavy type all those impl blocks start adding up giving you lots of boilerplate and often not much substance (esp. with all the where clauses on each block). Add in generics and it is often hard to see what is trying to be achieved.That said, I&#39;ve mostly reached the conclusion that much of this is unavoidable. Systems languages need to have lots of detail you just don&#39;t need in higher level languages like Haskell or Python, and trait impls on arbitrary types after the fact is very powerful and not something I would want to give up. I&#39;ve even done some prototyping of what alternative syntaxes might look like and they aren&#39;t much improvement. There is just a lot of data that is needed by the compiler.In summary, Rust syntax is noisy and excessive, but I&#39;m not convinced much could have been done about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like I&#39;m on the minority here, but I generally like Rust&#39;s syntax and think it&#39;s pretty readable.Of course, when you use generics, lifetimes, closures, etc, all on the same line it can become hard to read. But on my experience on &#34;high level&#34; application code, it isn&#39;t usually like that. The hardest thing to grep at first for me, coming from python, was the :: for navigating namespaces/modules.I also find functional style a lot easier to read than Python, because of chaining (dot notation) and the closure syntax.Python:    array = [1, 0, 2, 3]
    new_array = map(
        lambda x: x * 2,
        filter(
            lambda x: x != 0,
            array
        )
    )

Rust:    let array = [1, 0, 2, 3];
    let new_vec: Vec&lt;_&gt; = array.into_iter()
        .filter(|&amp;x| x != 0)
        .map(|x| x * 2)
        .collect();

I mean, I kind of agree to the criticism, specially when it comes to macros and lifetimes, but I also feel like that&#39;s more applicable for low level code or code that uses lots of features that just aren&#39;t available in e.g. C, Python or Go.Edit: Collected iterator into Vec"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This is a superficial complaint, but I found Rust syntax to be dense, heavy, and difficult to read.I&#39;m not sure this is a superficial complaint. People say the hard thing about learning Rust is the new concepts, but I haven&#39;t found that to be true at all. The concepts are easy, but the combinatorial explosion of syntax that supports them is untenable."</p>

Nothing is more frustrating than working with peers you know aren&#39;t carrying their weight.Do you want to be an engineering leader? This is what you are, regardless of your official title at your company. Engineering leaders are judged by how much better they make everyone else. You may hear the term force multiplier used. Say you are really a 10x engineer, how much more effective are you if you could improve the efficiency of 350 developers by 10%? Mentor, teach, help establish culture, make systemic changes to help your peers become more effective.Regardless, I think you&#39;re a bad fit for your current company and its culture. And yes, many of us have worked in environments, like a startup, where we knew we were critical to success. Fail to deliver and a funding round wouldn&#39;t go through and people would lose their jobs. It&#39;s stressful, but I hope you&#39;re adequately compensated."</p>

You say you&#39;re big on self-improvement, but are you only focused on improving your work-related skills? All areas of life need attention, and it sounds like you&#39;ve only been focusing on the work part of work/life balance (work/life balance is so much more than just what hours you work)."</p>

You have two choices – you can choose to stay in the same company but define yourself a different role/responsibility that would be personal growth for you and grow into it or you can leave your current company and try a different place.Based on some elements in your description – POC, Architectural discussions, code reviews, code stats etc. – I think your organization may not be very bad. They seem to care about reasonably good things and they seem to have recognized your contributions and pull you into discussions and enable you to contribute and expand your influence. You can take a goal for yourself to uplevel the people around you and also help hire better talented/skilled people.Also, if you simply spoke with your manager about your feeling of having to pull the most weight in the team, you may get more information – it may be as per your perception or you may get a new perspective. Best of luck."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Love this!Unrelated, but reminds me of another story featuring Chess and a Duck, and also relevant to the HN audience, which relates to the old videogame Battle Chess: https://bwiggs.com/notebook/queens-duck/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Chess is a matter of delicate judgement, knowing when to punch and how to duck”Indeed: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_boxing"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems like a pretty simple addition but that probably has profound effects on end-games. Also the fact that it&#39;s a duck is pretty adorable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I first started programming I was pretty lucky to get a job at a games company. My first lead was a veteran who had shipped a lot of AAA titles and he loved his war stories. He was personally interested in performance and he would often cite hardware timings for specific cpu instructions.One story he told a couple of times was about some grey beard who was before his time. The grey beard was once a legend in the company, often helicoptered into projects at the last minute to help them squeeze out the last bit of performance. His secret was he had a mental library of assembly language tricks applicable to the hardware of his day. But every few years his tricks were less and less relevant as hardware changed and compilers advanced. One day the grey beard was helicoptered into my leads project and everyone expected him to get them some gains. However, this was new hardware and none of his old tricks worked.I think of this story whenever I see jQuery popup on Hacker News. There is always a strong contingent of devs who swear by this library. But to me, they are like the old grey beard who didn&#39;t update his knowledge as the times changed. At one time jQuery allowed them to be the hero and &#34;Get Things Done&#34; faster than their competition. But times have changed.Argue with me if you must but take stories like this one for what they are worth. The writing is on the wall for jQuery. I was writing websites before jQuery existed, during the reign of jQuery and still today. If some candidate mentioned proficiency with jQuery during an interview I would be polite but internally I would note that the person might be out of touch. Not a red flag, but a yellow flag that I would follow up on. Nothing worse than bringing on a guy who claims to be senior/experienced and it turn out his old tricks won&#39;t work because they are no longer appropriate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangential, but sometimes I see people say that jQuery is dead/failed. While it&#39;s not as popular anymore, I think that&#39;s actually the perfect evolution for it. jQuery was making up for browser API shortcomings, and now many of those shortcomings have been addressed and been incorporated into browser APIs (not everything, but quite a bit)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Javascript has become so nice, now that browsers support modules.I use a module &#34;dqs.js&#34; for all my query needs. It contains only these two lines:    export const dqs  = document.querySelector.bind(document);
    export const dqsA = document.querySelectorAll.bind(document);

And use it like this:    import { dqsA } from &#39;lib/dqs.js&#39;;

    for (const rabbit of dqsA(&#39;#rabbits .green&#39;)) {
        ... do something with all green rabbits ...
    }"</p>
