								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everyone here is commenting about overautomation, but this isn&#39;t an overautomation problem. It&#39;s a secondary sanctions problem. The developer isn&#39;t being banned for breaking Google&#39;s rules, he&#39;s being banned for having hired someone else who later broke those rules; and then that ban was transitively applied to their personal account as well.This is beyond the pale. Google should not have the power to decide who you are and are not allowed to hire. It both goes against the basic concept of a limited-liability corporation, and harms worker rights."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Once again, the resolution of this problem will come down to either the OP knowing a Google employee or a Google employee happening to see this and feeling pity. For the vast majority of people who deal with Google support and don&#39;t have access to Google employees how many of us on HN do, when the hammer strikes: they are completely out of options.I have such little trust in Google&#39;s automation for banning accounts that I don&#39;t even bother commenting on Youtube or uploading videos anymore. Who know when some innocuous footage that I have will trigger a cascade of copyright strikes and ban my personal GMail? It&#39;s like walking around glass."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will say this once again: App Stores are too important in the current world to be left to the mercy of some big Internet company. I agree they should get a cut due to them being both the creators and maintainers of their platforms, but their ability to regulate what&#39;s in them should be left to a third party or government agency, just like trade is not left to its own devices and has regulators. Apple and Google are way too powerful for their own good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve recently had to deal with the medical profession a lot more than in the past and I&#39;m finding this sort of thing everywhere. OTC medicines that by current standards would not be made OTC, surgeries that are extremely common but have never had quality  randomized trials, official sounding diagnoses that on inspection are actually defined as &#34;we have no idea&#34;, lack of consensus about how to treat some of the most common conditions in the human population (e.g. back pain), medical device approvals abusing the shortcut of being &#34;substantially similar&#34; to an existing device to evade regulatory scrutiny, the complete lack of enforcement of what goes in supplements... I feel like my entire understanding of the medical system in the US was a lie. We&#39;re constantly touting that we have the most advanced technology but if you have a complex condition you are likely to fall prey to multiple kinds of grift."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My drug of choice for colds is NyQuil. It&#39;s always been great for opening up my nasal passages enough to let me breathe easily and then knocking me the fuck out so I could sleep off most of the cold.I remember several years ago when all of a sudden NyQuil stopped doing anything useful. I had no idea why but I directly observed that it was like it had been replaced with a non-functioning placebo.Only a couple years later did I make the connection that this was right when they passed the law restricting pseudoephedrine. I got my hands on some NyQuil D and everything was back to normal and I had a functioning cold remedy again.Phenylephrine is completely useless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This twitter thread is pretty bad and the comments here aren&#39;t much better.IIRC the Ubiquiti &#39;hack&#39; was an insider attack from an employee lying and intentionally breaking things while pushing his lies to the press to hurt his employer. Krebs was wrong and tricked by the employee. I don&#39;t know if that justifies this legal action, but it&#39;s not the normal going after someone who reported a breach. This one is more complicated.I&#39;m pretty sure Corey is wrong on the facts in this case (and so was Brian). I also felt a lot better about Ubiquiti once the dust settled and the details about Sharp came out.Edit: I missed this comment thread which basically says the same thing: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30850793"</p>

But, if &#34;Adam&#34; (original informant) and Sharp are the same person[1] and Sharp is in fact the person who perform the breach such that this is an inside job instead of an external hack.IANAL and while I&#39;m not sure of the merit to this lawsuit itself, there&#39;s still a lot of problems if your informant is the person performing the illegal activity.[0] https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-b...[1] https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/12/ubiquiti-developer-charg..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People always struggle or avoid doing pair programming, and people always think it means that the developers&#39; time now costs twice as much, but this is a total lie. When I worked at a place that did 100% pair programming with rotation every day, a new developer could hit the ground flying. Sitting next to someone who knows the system and can answer your question immediately means you get up to speed millions of times faster than screwing around by yourself. Pointed-haired bosses and accountants will never understand this. If you pair and rotate, the inexperienced person becomes experienced quickly, and it&#39;s viral if you also do rotating pairing. A team with one expert and pairing is now a team full of experts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Relevant to this article is Peter Naur&#39;s paper on Programming as Theory building: https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Naur.pdfHe argues that the biggest determinant on whether maintainers on a system they did not build will succeed is whether they will have access to the original developers: &#34;The conclusion seems inescapable that at least with certain kinds of large programs, the continued adaptation, modification, and correction of errors in them, is essentially dependent on a certain kind of knowledge possessed by a certain group of programmers who are closely and continuously connected with them.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience, the biggest obstacle in understanding the system is that the underlying business process is not properly documented. A technical system is only as good as the business system it&#39;s implementing. Knowing the business process makes it much easier to understand the technical implementation, especially if you&#39;re trying to find bugs in the technical system since you can more easily see the mismatch between business and technical processes.But hey, that&#39;s just me. And it seems clear that most businesses do a poor job, or don&#39;t care at all, when it comes to documenting their processes. So I guess I&#39;m the odd one."</p>

Zuckerberg et al and their incessant lobbying for that TikTok ban basically vaporized that guy’s pull within China, which eliminated a super-valuable asset for the West.So, yeah, Facebook continues to be the single greatest threat to Western society outside of Russia. These are serious issues with serious consequences."</p>

What&#39;s the point of making &#34;Republican&#34; so prominent in the article? Is it just to use the negative connotation most WP readers have about the Republican party to malign Facebook a little more? It seems like we&#39;re just spectating an op-ed war, and discussing this article as if there&#39;s any meaning to it other than to malign Facebook."</p>

I think it&#39;s a poor choice for anything performance or memory sensitive, especially a database. I know people would disagree (hence all the DBs written in golang these days, and Java before it), but I think C/C++/Rust/D are all superior for that kind of application.All of which is to say, I don&#39;t think it matters.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dig this! Since you&#39;re full-text indexing blogs with an eye towards content discovery, can I tempt you towards building out a reverse link index function to enable me to browse by thread?My use case: often times blogs will respond to other blogs, linking to the original post in the process. The nature of linking means it&#39;s very easy to follow threads backwards in time, but given the original post it&#39;s often hard to discover the responses and ongoing conversation to follow things downstream. I&#39;d like that downstream browsing to be easier.My hope would be that such a tool could unlock higher-quality discourse. As a reader, this would let me hijack my natural tendency to follow comment threads, and redirect that attention towards slower-paced, more nuanced, more focused writing.Edit: hmmm... though looking further, maybe this goes against your MarketRank philosophy."</p>

The idea that Intuit is The Reason tax filing is painful, and not that the GOP is systematically undermining the IRS as a way to convince people that taxes are bad, seems unlikely.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at TurboTax. They are really good at separating employees into two groups.Group 1, which is by far the largest group, really wants to make it easier for people to get their taxes done.Group 2 makes sure that the govt doesn&#39;t make any progress on making it easier for people to do their taxes. Make taxes even more convoluted, so that you need TurboTax (not just personal but also their software for CPAs). Make sure there isn&#39;t any actually free way to easily do your taxes. Get laws passed making sure of it. Act like you have a free version but make it nearly impossible to use it without paying for other stuff.Intuit goes to great lengtsh to make sure that group 1 (which is most of the company), doesn&#39;t know about the existence of group 2. I only knew about group 2 because I knew of it before I worked for Intuit. A lot of people there were very surprised when I shared the truth with them about group 2.I didn&#39;t end up a fit for this garbage and quit after 6 months."</p>
