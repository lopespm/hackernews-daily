								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the compassion section has the most wisdom in it, especially the reasoning behind the recommendation:82. Call your parents when you think of them, tell your friends when you love them.83. Compliment people more. Many people have trouble thinking of themselves as smart, or pretty, or kind, unless told by someone else. You can help them out.84. If somebody is undergoing group criticism, the tribal part in you will want to join in the fun of righteously destroying somebody. Resist this, you’ll only add ugliness to the world. And anyway, they’ve already learned the lesson they’re going to learn and it probably isn’t the lesson you want.85. Cultivate compassion for those less intelligent than you. Many people, through no fault of their own, can’t handle forms, scammers, or complex situations. Be kind to them because the world is not.86. Cultivate patience for difficult people. Communication is extremely complicated and involves getting both tone and complex ideas across. Many people can barely do either. Don’t punish them.87. Don’t punish people for trying. You teach them to not try with you. Punishing includes whining that it took them so long, that they did it badly, or that others have done it better.88. Remember that many people suffer invisibly, and some of the worst suffering is shame. Not everybody can make their pain legible.89. Don&#39;t punish people for admitting they were wrong, you make it harder for them to improve.90. In general, you will look for excuses to not be kind to people. Resist these."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;8. When buying things, time and money trade-off against each other. If you’re low on money, take more time to find deals. If you’re low on time, stop looking for great deals and just buy things quickly online.&#34;I&#39;m finding, as I&#39;ve gotten older, that almost every time I&#39;ve chosen money over time I&#39;ve made a bad decision.And I see this among my family and friends, too.  There&#39;s a mentality that emerges when exchanging time for money that somehow makes it so you waste your time and you end up spending almost or more money than you originally would have.I&#39;m known for saying, &#34;There is a professional person for that...  Let&#39;s get one,&#34; instead of trying to fix the water heater ourselves or get transport 2 tons of gravel.  Others in my family would have dragged the old trailer out of the barn.  Oh, it has a flat.  Fix that.  Oh, the trailer hitch doesn&#39;t fit the new truck, oh, get a new hitch (we&#39;ll use it someday again, surely).  Or get the old truck working, or the older truck working (cause they keep buying cheap used trucks that break down and sit on the property for eternity).  Then go get whatever, and deal with not knowing what they&#39;re doing.  Me, just get it delivered.  Maybe more money, waaaay less hassle.  In the saved time I&#39;ve polished up my CSS skills...Time really is the most precious resource you have.  Think hard before you trade it for anything else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When it comes to buying things I find my satisfaction is much higher when I spend money to remove an irritant rather than get something completely new.Our home has a long run from the water heater to basically anywhere it is used (This is in the USA where storage heaters are typical).  When it died I had its location moved and got a model with a circulating system that loops around to the downstairs locations (kitchen/bathroom).  Now what took 20-30 seconds to get warm water is 2-3 seconds.  I spent a lot (for me) and it was worth it.I replaced the 2 DIN radio in my car with an android head unit.  Driving became much better with my personal audio selection rather than over the air radio (What&#39;s that?).  A few years later I upgraded the unit and reduced the start time from 20-ish seconds to 2 seconds.  Both changes removed irritants and noticeably improved my quality of life.Previously I would wonder if getting a new car, or bigger TV, or going to Hawaii would improve my life.  Now I am more inclined to seek out irritants and try to find ways of applying money or effort to reduce them.  I&#39;ll still make the occasional new/splurge purchase, most recently Ring video cameras - they&#39;re fun, but that comes second and I&#39;m happier for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Okay this is a bit meta, but the whole cluster of &#34;everything old is new again&#34;, &#34;the pendulum of fashion has swung&#34;, &#34;nothing new under the sun&#34; takes is ignoring what tends to drive this sort of change: relative costs.The allure of xmlhttprequest was that over connections much slower than today, and with much less powerful desktop computers, a user didn&#39;t have to wait for the whole page to redownload and re-render (one can argue that focusing on better HTTP caching on the server and client might have been smarter) after every single user interaction. This was also much of the draw of using frames (which were also attractive for some front-end design use-cases later re-solved with CSS).As apps got more complex, clients got more compute, bandwidth grew, and as web audiences grew, offloadingl much of the page rendering to the client helped to both contain server-side costs and increase or maintain responsiveness to user interactions.Now, as desktop client performance improvement slows down (this isn&#39;t just the slowing of computer speeds, computers are also replaced less frequently), average bandwidth continues to grow, app complexity and sophistication continues to grow, but as server compute cost falls faster than audience size grows, shifting rendering to HTML back to the server and sending more verbose pre-rendered HTML fragments over the wire can make sense as a way of giving users a better experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve never seen one of these &#34;logic in html-attributes&#34; systems take error checking seriously. In stimulus they start to mention it in &#34;Designing For Resilience&#34; (though only for feature-checking), but in &#34;Working With External Resources&#34; where it uses calls network/IO bound calls they never mention how to handle errors or if the framework just leaves it up to you. Stimulus is also where you need to write your own js code, so I guess you could handle it yourself but in turbo when I skimmed the handbook I find no mentions of what/how to handle errors (or even what happens when turbo gets one), and when loading stuff over the network that is pretty much crucial.From the turbo handbook: &#34;An application visit always issues a network request. When the response arrives, Turbo Drive renders its HTML and completes the visit.&#34; Using the phrase &#34;When the response arrives&#34; begs the question of what happens if it doesn&#39;t arrive, or if it takes a minute for it to arrive, or if it arrives but with a faulty status code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As others have noted, seems reasonably similar to LiveView, Livewire and Blazor. I’m somewhat bullish on these approaches - server side rendered monoliths (Rails, Django, etc.) are SO productive, at least for the first few years of development, but lack of interactivity is a big issue, and this solves it well.However, another big issue is the dominance of mobile. More and more, you’ve got 2-3 frontends (web and cross-platform mobile, or explicitly
web, iOS and Android), and you want to power them all with the same backend. RESTful APIs serving up JSON works for all 3, as does GraphQL (not a fan, but many are). This however is totally web-specific - you’ll end up building REST APIs and mobile apps anyways, so the productivity gains end up way smaller, possibly even net negative. Mobile is a big part of why SPAs have dominated - you use the same backend and overall approach/architecture for web and mobile.I’d strongly consider this for a web-only product, but that’s becoming more and more rare."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another great win for the EFF. We shouldn&#39;t forget how much time and effort fighting this kind of thing takes, and we are very lucky to have an organization who&#39;s willing to put in the legwork from which all of us are huge beneficiaries. (Edit: just donated.)I guess it was implied by the article, but wasn&#39;t perfectly clear to me: does this mean that .org just stays with its current holders, ISOC? (Internet Society)As much as ICANN and Ethos Capital acted maliciously in this whole debacle, it&#39;s very possible that the most malicious actor of all was ISOC. In 2002 they were granted the management of a public good (the .org registry), with the idea that they&#39;d administrate it responsibly and fairly. In return, they were well compensated as they managed .org registrations over all these years, which is more or less a license to print money.However, it&#39;s obvious with this attempted sales that ISOC never considered themselves to be a higher-minded steward doing anything for the greater good. To them, .org was an asset to be pumped and dumped at the first, best offer that came along. They were well aware that Ethos had plans to turn .org into a major profit center with a captive audience of all existing .org holders, to the detriment of tens of thousands of non-profits (and many others) worldwide, and enthusiastically agreed to the plan anyway. It was money in their pocket, and the money was good.What would it take for the ICANN to claw back the .org registry and grant it to a more ethical caretaker? (CCOR for example [1].) It seems to me that &#34;easy come, easy go&#34; is a perfect ethos for this situation, and the ISOC shouldn&#39;t be allowed to take another dime from .org.---[1] https://www.ccor.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason you can’t buy a good webcam is the same reason you can’t buy a high quality monitor outside of LG’s unreliable apple collab.The lazy conglomerates who sell these peripherals often don’t actually produce the parts in them. They simply rebrand commodity cameras and IPS panels in a crap plastic housing and slap their logo on it.Then they give the product a hilariously user-hostile product name, like “PQS GRT46782-WT” as an extra f-you to the user.They don’t care about you because they have no ongoing relationship with you, and their executives mistakenly see their own products as commodities.Combine this with the fact that most home users don’t care about good quality or even know what it is, and you have the current situation.A friend once described the peripheral market as “Assholes selling crap to idiots.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you are looking here to improve your webcam because you started to do remote work, don&#39;t.First try to improve lighting and audio.Any camera will look bad in bad lighting. It is always better to first improve your lighting before you invest in a new camera. Use high CRI lightbulbs and ensure even source color temperature in your room (ie. all lightbulbs should be emitting same color temperature).Audio is also very important. It is processed by different parts of brain and we don&#39;t put so much attention to it but the quality will influence the other person, subconsciously. Also, audio is how the information is being passed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real reason is buried in the article:You can’t buy a good webcam because the number of people willing to pay a lot of money for a high end webcam is very small.At the lower end, people are satisfied with their built in laptop parts or a cheap webcam that sits on top of their monitor.At the high end, people go down the rabbit hole of buying a do-everything mirrorless camera that they can use for so much more than just a webcam.A high end webcam would have to be cheap enough that the first group doesn’t mind spending a bit more, but not so expensive that the enthusiast target audience just decides to buy a full-featured mirror less camera instead.Granted, there is a lot of room for improvement in that budgetary middle ground, but how many people actually care? Common webcams actually perform decently when given proper lighting conditions. We’re not streaming high-bitrate 1080p H.265 on our 5-person Zoom calls. After compression and denoising the extra sharpness and low noise of a high end camera doesn’t add much benefit.Enthusiasts are a difficult group to market to because they have extremely high expectations. They’d also rather spend weeks scouring the Internet for the perfect deal on a used mirrorless camera than to spend a dollar more than necessary to buy a high-end webcam."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t really get these modern async APIs. In languages like Javascript I thought they only made sense because JS interpreters are (historically) single-threaded, so you really have no choice but async to express some concepts. Fine.But in Rust you can just spawn threads, share data through channels or mutexes, use OS-provided async IO primitives to poll file descriptors and do event-driven programming etc...I tried looking into Tokio a little while ago and I found that it led to some incredibly complicated, abstracted, hard to think about code for stuff I usually implement (IMO) much more simply with a basic event loop and non-blocking IO for instance.I&#39;m sure async can get the upper hand when you have a huge number of very small tasks running concurrently because that&#39;s generally where OS-driven parallelism tends to suffer but is it such a common scenario? That sounds like premature optimization in many situations IMO. Unless you actually think that async code is more expressive and easy to read and write than basic event loops, but then you must be a lot smarter than I am because I have to take an aspirin every time I need to dig into async-heavy code.I guess I&#39;m trying to understand if it&#39;s me who&#39;s missing something, or if it&#39;s web-oriented developers who are trying to bring their favourite type of proverbial hammer to system development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has criticized Rust for the small standard lib and lack of stability in the ecosystem I&#39;m very, very happy for this. This is one of the biggest milestones for Rust. Rust itself is great enough. The lack of a de facto async runtime and libs for your standard networking needs were a real barrier for non-enthusiasts environments. It will help its adoption in general purpose business apps, I guess and hope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone explain to a non-rustacean what Tokio introduces that&#39;s not part of Rust? It looks like Rust provides the async/await semantics, so I&#39;m guessing this is an event loop and dispatching system?"</p>

Plus it always feels worse and more obvious when you struggle with or fail to properly answer the tech questions.What I did is I prepared 10 different stories about my career experience and then tagged them with a bunch of prompts.  For example I have a story about one project that had dual PMs that experienced a lot of scope creep and eventually fizzled on release.  I can now use that story to answer a broad range of questions from failure to various project management approaches.  Overall I now have prepared stories to answer probably 50-75 different questions immediately.Another benefit is that I have also told these stories multiple times in interviews now and I get better telling them each time. Even if the answer isn&#39;t 100% relevant, I feel more confident and likely come off better launching immediately into a detailed story about my experience rather than trying to awkwardly come up with an answer on the fly.  It is also easy to drop irrelevant parts or expand on specific details when the basic framework of the story is already something that feels natural.I will even have the document with all the prompts and story bullet points open whenever I am doing phone or remote interviews.  I could probably even create a cheat sheet to use for in person interviews since I usually would bring an executive style notepad with me anyway to interviews to jot down notes about the company.Maybe this is obvious advice, but I think I am relatively smart and never done it previously or even seen this approach recommend so I am guessing there are other people who could use this tip."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One additional tip on recruiters: have a cheat sheet ready (web page or public Google doc) that answers the basic questions they&#39;ll have for you and makes clear your expectations.Here&#39;s the info I ask them to provide:- Job Title and Salary- Job Description- Company Overview and Location- Steps in Hiring ProcessWhenever I&#39;m emailed by a recruiter, I politely thank them for reaching out, paste the link to the cheat sheet, and invite them to review it and write back if they still think I&#39;m a good match. It quickly separates the professionals from the wannabes. (You usually don&#39;t hear back from the wannabes.) The ones who do write back often thank me for it.I&#39;m pretty cynical when it comes to recruiters. So I find it interesting that 3 of my last 4 jobs have come through one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Keeping those skills sharp even when you’re not job hunting.Can I just add &#34;Leetcoder&#34; as a part time job on my resume? It is amusing how in this industry, your ability to interview will not at all be improved by spending time doing your job unless it is algo heavy. It is a separate job entirely."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This title is misleading:&gt;The Protecting Lawful Streaming Act would apply only to commercial, for-profit streaming piracy services. The law will not sweep in normal practices by online service providers, good faith business disputes, noncommercial activities, or in any way impact individuals who access pirated streams or unwittingly stream unauthorized copies of copyrighted works. Individuals who might use pirate streaming services will not be affected.This affects platforms, not users. Illegal streaming will not be a felony. Creating a for-profit platform with intent to do illegal streaming will be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">" - Everyone discussing this law should really read the textThe difficulty in doing so is a big part of the problem.  As per AOC&#39;s comments on twitter yesterday, at 2PM Members of Congress got 5000 pages of bill dropped on their desk with a vote call at 4PM.The whole thing needs to be much more transparent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since most if not all of these platforms are based in countries more friendly towards infringement it’s really not going to do much of anything other than be another law that gets selectively applied and abused."</p>
