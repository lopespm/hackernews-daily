								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For people wondering about how they get access to these systems, it feels like they use the weakest human link in the chain.I checked their telegram group and I can see that they specifically recruit people with access to VPNs/internal support systems. This okta breach seems to have happened through similar means. The group has made specific calls for access to gaming companies, hosting providers, telcos, call centers, and bpm providers. They offer payment.It doesn’t feel difficult to see how some overworked, underpaid support agent (or even a well paid disgruntled one) might decide to go with this. Just takes 1 well placed agent to give creds and this group has access to a huge attack surface instantly. This might sound like an overreaction, but corporations in the future might need to make least privilege access and access logging everything a priority from day 1.https://t.me/minsaudebr/162 (Link to the recruitment message)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And this explains how the LAPSUS hacker group was able to breach Microsoft, NVIDIA, and countless others. Apparently, they have been inside of OKTA systems for nearly 2 months now.[1] https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/21/microsoft_lapsus_brea...[2] https://www.wired.com/story/lapsus-hacking-group-extortion-n...[3] https://analyticsindiamag.com/lapsus-hack-leaves-nvidia-in-a..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Okta&#39;s CEO just released a statement. And it&#39;s very tiny. Unsure what to make of this. Waiting to see LAPSUS$ response&gt; In late January 2022, Okta detected an attempt to compromise the account of a third party customer support engineer working for one of our subprocessors. The matter was investigated and contained by the subprocessor. (1 of 2)&gt; We believe the screenshots shared online are connected to this January event. Based on our investigation to date, there is no evidence of ongoing malicious activity beyond the activity detected in January.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder how much of this is part of a genuine attempt to bring a safe product to market, and how much is to pressure the German government (and soon thereafter, the EU) into making this sort of promise mandatory for all car manufacturers, including those that are ahead of Mercedes in the self-driving space. I.e. to create a legislative moat in an area where they&#39;re behind.While I don&#39;t agree with Tesla&#39;s strategy of playing it fast &amp; loose, I&#39;m afraid that risk aversion will lead us to demand perfect instead of the good enough.A car manufacturer might not be willing to accept 100% liability, but their system might still be a lot safer than a drunk driver returning home from the bar.Realistically we&#39;re not going to be able to pick &#34;well, don&#39;t drive drunk then!&#34;, it&#39;ll happen. By demanding that these system are that reliable before they&#39;re in common operation we&#39;ll have incurred a net loss in terms of safety.I don&#39;t know what the right solution is, probably some mixture of the two. Clearly you don&#39;t want manufacturers to be incentivized to ignore the risk associated with their systems, but you also don&#39;t want these systems not to be offered when they&#39;d be a net gain in safety.The point at which they&#39;re a net gain is not the same point that they become financially viable to the manufacturer from a liability point of view."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Handing over driving responsibility completely requires extremely particular circumstances. Right now, Drive Pilot can only engage at speeds under 40 mph (60 km/h in Germany) on limited-access divided highways with no stoplights, roundabouts, or other traffic control systems, and no construction zones...The system will only operate during daytime, in reasonably clear weather, without overhead obstructions. Inclement weather, construction zones, tunnels, and emergency vehicles will all trigger a handover warning.Those are some big caveats that mean that you won&#39;t be able to use this in most situations.  It is basically only good for stop and go highway traffic which is a situation that other driver assist features handle pretty well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mercedes is perhaps the only auto company that is both supremely innovative and supremely respectable at the same time.Tesla is innovative, but they get ahead of themselves, and Musk is a glorified internet troll who bullies and arguably lies.The Big 3 are respectable in that they don’t really overhype or misrepresent, but Mercedes will probably out-innovate them in self-driving like they’ve out-innovated them (and pretty much everyone else) in just about every other aspect that matters over the past century.Disclaimer: I drive a Toyota Sienna and a Subaru Outback. But I’ve seen a few Mercedes up close (and sometimes driven them) over the years. The only really crappy one in my experience was the ~2006 G500."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very sorry to hear that.You need to consult with a lawyer to decide the way to go from here. He/she can tell you what your odds of winning are, and what the best strategy is. As someone not emotionally involved with the case, and having access to all the details, an impartial person is the best one to trust. I don&#39;t think you should see this case as revenge or closure for the death of your son, because you will be disappointed one way or another. You also don&#39;t have the personal responsibility to fix the failings of such a huge company.Personally, the only advice I can give you is that the way you are living is unhealthy. It is an unimaginable tragedy what happened to you, but you have to somehow gather the strength to rebuild your life again. Your reaction is understandable. However, try to think of the way forward as much as possible. You are likely relatively young, and you have the possibility to start over. There is no way to change the past, only the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They offered to settle because they&#39;ve been forced to pay out for similar cases before. Just last year, Republic Services (who is almost certainly who you&#39;re referring to, if not WM, but RSC is closer to $40B) was found responsible in a similar case in Nevada and the mother was awarded $38 million by the jury: https://www.reviewjournal.com/local/local-las-vegas/jury-awa...It doesn&#39;t bring your child back, but working with an accident attorney who is compassionate and may be able to wage the battle without too much direct involvement from you may get you more of what you feel is justice in this case.I&#39;m so deeply sorry for your loss, by the way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I stopped working so that I can go to the cemetery to stay with my son everyday. It&#39;s been almost two years.Hey, this is quite concerning. The pain must be unimaginable. And the atmosphere around you (understandably) is also not in a position to help themselves, let alone help others. But, if you do read this, please, get help. Somehow, someway. There is always a solution.This is a good first step. Seek for help like you sought help here, friend. Best of luck."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My company runs without containers. We process petabytes of data monthly, thousands of CPU cores, hundreds of different types of data pipelines running continously, etc etc. Definitely a distributed system with lots of applications and databases.We use Nix for reproducible builds and deployments. Containers only give reproducible deployments, not builds, so they would be a step down. The reason that&#39;s important is that it frees us from troubleshooting &#34;works on my machine&#34; issues, or from someone pushing an update somewhere and breaking our build. That&#39;s not important to everyone if they have few dependencies that don&#39;t change often, but for an internet company, the trend is accelerating towards bigger and more complex dependency graphs.Kubernetes has mostly focused on stateless applications so far. That&#39;s the easy part! The hard part is managing databases. We don&#39;t use Kubernetes, but there&#39;s little attraction because it would be addressing something that&#39;s already effortless for us to manage.What works for us is to do the simplest thing that works, then iterate. I remember being really intimidated about all the big data technologies coming out a decade ago, thinking they are so complex that they must know what they&#39;re doing! But I&#39;d so often dive in to understand the details and be disillusioned about how much complexity there is for relatively little benefit. I was in a sort of paralysis of what we&#39;d do after we outgrew postgresql, and never found a good answer. Here we are years later, with a dozen+ postgresql databases, some measuring up to 30 terabytes each, and it&#39;s still the best solution for us.Perhaps I&#39;ve read too far into the intent of the question, but maybe you can afford to drop the research project into containers and kubernetes, and do something simple that works for now, and get back to focusing on product?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at WhatsApp, prior to moving to Facebook infra, we had some jails for specific things, but mostly ran without containers.Stack looked like:FreeBSD on bare metal servers (host service provided a base image, our shell script would fetch source, apply patches, install a small handful of dependencies, make world, manage system users, etc)OTP/BEAM (Erlang) installed via rsync etc from build machineApplication code rsynced and started via Makefile scriptsNot a whole lot else. Lighttpd and php for www. Jails for stud (a tls terminator, popular fork is called hitch) and ffmpeg (until end to end encrypted media made server transcoding unpossible).No virtualized servers (I ran a freebsd vm on my laptop for dev work, though).When WA moved to Facebook infra, it made sense to use their deployment methodology for the base system (Linux containers), for organizational reasons. There was no consideration for which methodology was technically superior; both are sufficient, but running a very different methodology inside a system that was designed for everyone to use one methodology is a recipie for operational headaches and difficulty getting things diagnosed and fixed as it&#39;s so tempting to jump to the conclusion that any problem found on a different setup is because of the difference and not a latent problem. We had enough differences without requiring a different OS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Grooveshark didn&#39;t use any of that. We were very careful about avoiding dependencies where possible and keeping our backend code clean and performant. We supported about 45M MAU at our biggest, with only a handful of physical servers. I&#39;m not aware of any blog posts we made detailing any of this, though. And if you&#39;re not familiar with the saga, Grooveshark went under for legal, not technical reasons. The backend API was powered by nginx, PHP, MySQL, memcache, with a realtime messaging server built in Go. We used Redis and Mongodb for some niche things, had serious issues with both which is understandable because they were both immature at the time, but Mongodb&#39;s data loss problems were bad enough that I would still not use them today.That said, I&#39;m using Docker for my current side project. Even if it never runs at scale, I just don&#39;t want to have to muck around with system administration, not to mention how nice it is to have dev and prod be identical."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Never start coding (making a solution) unless you fully understand the problem.While I agree with this in general, I find that to reall fully understand a problem, I need to attempt to code, or at least formulate, a solution to it.a) because when I break down a problem into its code-able component parts, I learn a lot about itb) because in the process of then actually implementing these parts I often discover edge cases or undefined cases (especially in naturally grown business-logic)c) because what the problem actually IS, is often not that clear at the start of the problem. Yes, in an ideal world, changing requirements would wait until the next version, however, sadly that&#39;s not what happens in the wild."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s one more from me: count your liabilities.1. Code is a liability. No code? No bugs. The best commit is one that removes unnecessary code. This includes dependencies.2. State is a liability. Multipliers for: hidden or non-obvious state, shared state, externally (by actors you don&#39;t control) accessible state, concurrently accessed/mutated state. Often the worst offenders are environment settings/configuration, such as Windows Registry, environment variables, installed dependencies, daemon services, etc, scoring full points.3. All publicly observable behavior is a liability. Also known as Hyrum&#39;s Law: &#34;all observable behaviors of your system will be depended on by somebody&#34;, or https://xkcd.com/1172/. Huge multiplier for systems with a long expected lifespan, and another huge one if you guarantee backwards compatibility to paying customers. Program under this assumption, and if you can hide or control your internal behavior, do it. E.g.: maybe don&#39;t output results reliant on a HashSet order - sort them.None of these are hard &#39;rules&#39;. Often the liability is necessary, or worth the saved effort or gained feature. But be aware of them, and minimize them where possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Listing Performance as the lowest value bugs me. I understand that most software isn&#39;t performance-critical, you can probably afford to use a garbage collected language for most use-cases. But putting performance last contradicts the high priority of Usability in the list, because Usability strongly depends on performance.Your product might still work if it has a second of lag after every operation, but I won&#39;t want to use it. And if there aren&#39;t any decent alternatives, I am going to experience irritation and sadness on a continuous basis.Jonathan Blow said[0] (5 minute interview) that software authors have an ethical responsibility towards their users. How many people use YouTube, or Windows? The time wasted might be small on an individual scale, say a minute a day, but multiply it by a billion people (eg. YouTube or Windows) and that&#39;s 16 million man-hours per year.I&#39;d argue the same responsibility exists just as strongly even if you have one user! Do you want to frustrate her, constantly waste her time? Of course not! She is not going to be very happy with you if you do that :)[0] Jonathan Blow on Success and Ethics in Software Development https://youtube.com/watch?v=k8gIJOy0c2g"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The report points out (Image 8) design choices that contributed to a raging fire, once the fire started:* no emergency electricity cut-off device, an &#34;economic strategy choice of the site operator&#34; - the electrical room where the fire started was hot, 400C at the door (measured by thermal camera), with meter long electrical arcing from the door, thundering deafening sounds. Making access of utility technicians &#34;difficult&#34; - it took them 2 hours to cut incoming electrical service from the utility. On site UPS devices also had no cut-off, so they kept supplying.* emergency water network provided only 70m3/h at the site. A firefighting boat arrived, Europa 1, was called, supplying 14.5m3/min max flow rate.The freeflowing air cooling design, a good design choice as it saves on operating costs for cooling, contributed to nourishing the fire."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a great thing for startups that OVH provides servers at such an amazing low cost. Yes, there is always a risk that someone will make a mistake in the building design. There&#39;s a chance that eliminating some redundancies increases the possibility of a failure. There&#39;s always a chance that something bad will go wrong.However, this isn&#39;t just a matter of Hanlon&#39;s razor (incompetence vs malice), but more of a matter of an intelligent guesstimate of risk versus a lack of knowledge in some areas (wasn&#39;t this OVH&#39;s very first datacenter?), and a strong focus on reducing costs. Perhaps the latter went too far, and definitely some obvious mistakes were made by not having a universal power cut off of some sort, but dealing with the amount of power on tap in a datacenter is always dangerous, even when there is no fire at all.I&#39;m not saying we need to give OVH a complete pass on this. I&#39;m just saying that there are a lot of extenuating circumstances and, except for the power cut off, it&#39;s not clear that OVH made any choices due to extreme negligence or cost-cutting. In other words, they didn&#39;t do anything immoral. At worst, it appears that (even from the most anti-OVH party here), this was just a mistake in the design of a new (at the time) style of datacenter, and it did work properly for many years before there was a problem. Making a mistake is not immoral."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone interested, I maintained a server within the affected DC.OVH provided 3x the price of the service for the downtime. But for the recovery we needed to buy a new server from them as our backups were only accesible from dedicated machines...
At the end we basically received 2x the price of the server when discounting the temp machine. 
Communication during the downtime was not bad from OVH side, taking into account the huge amount of affected servers.
At the end, as a small customer I cant do or ask for much more. As it&#39;s not worth neither the money or the time. 
IMHO, 3x is not covering any business loses for anyone. We got our own backups within the OVH network and it took 3 additional  days to be able to access them as the network was a mess after the fire. That for some business is going to be a huge sum."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This leads me to wonder about the microprocessor shortage.So many computing devices such as Nvidia Jetson and Raspberry Pi are simply not available anywhere.  I wonder what&#39;s he point of bringing out new products when existing products can&#39;t be purchased?  Won&#39;t the new products also simply not be available?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"NVIDIA continues to vertically integrate their datacenter offerings.  They bought mellanox to get infiniband.  They tried to buy ARM - that didn&#39;t work.  But they&#39;re building &amp; bundling CPUs anyway.  I guess when you&#39;re so far ahead on the compute side, it&#39;s all the peripherals that hold you back, so they&#39;re putting together a complete solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it&#39;s just me, but it&#39;s just cool to see the CPU market competitive again for the first time since the late 90s."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m kinda confused why Unity keeps doing this - they keep putting out high-end demo after high-end demo, but that&#39;s not where there core userbase is. Their main users are people who build games for phones and indies, with basically zero usage in the AAA space. And Unity&#39;s performance/stability is still not that great afaik.It seems to me that they are trying to prove that they are a serious &#39;AAA&#39; engine, but these demos aren&#39;t that convincing to me - AAA is a lot more than putting fancy shaders on high-poly models, it&#39;s about handling huge amounts of objects in a dynamics situation, displaying large worlds via streaming, having a workflow that accommodates every creative professional, and offering great performance and visuals  even on very complex scenes.I&#39;ve hear that even these highly impressive demos are fake - they built a ton of custom code for each one they rebuild core Unity features, meaning if you wanted to replicate this for yourself, you&#39;d be in for a ton of development.Comparatively UE5&#39;s Nanite demo showed off a tech that&#39;s ready to go for production."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is indeed rendered in realtime, but one thing to note is it&#39;s a &#34;4D&#34; capture, more-or-less meaning each frame of the animation is its own asset. This makes it possible to reproduce subtle physics like the lips sticking together slightly when the actor opens her mouth. The amount of storage space, alone, makes this impractical for anything other than demos. Unity claims they will be able to achieve this level of fidelity using a deep learning-based compression that will allow stuff like this to appear in game cutscenes, but all the movements will still be pre-baked. The only interaction possible will be moving the camera. At that point the technology will be very useful, but it&#39;s still a ways away from having such a realistic character that can react to you dynamically.(Though whether that&#39;s just a couple years of software technology progress, or a decade+ for hardware progress, who can say?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Look at our demo of a hyper-realistic human character!&#34;eighteen million things happen around the character to distract the viewer&#39;s attention from the human character throughout most of the videoNot the most confident tech demo.  Looks like a reasonable degree of evolution, but as they start to get up toward turn-of-the-century movie CGI in games, now you run into the same issues that you see in mocap for movies--including that a lot of details of an actor&#39;s expressions and movements actually aren&#39;t captured, so you have to have animators go back and laboriously add all those lost details back in to have something that looks convincing.(Mind, I say turn-of-the-century, but man, the fundamental techniques for rendering skin convincingly have come a long way, even in current game engines.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the maps really helped sell the world to me as a kid. There&#39;s such a distinct, foreign style to them. Of course every fantasy series now has a map, but the Tolkien maps are still embedded deep in my brain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I saw this exhibit at the Morgan Library &amp; Museum several years ago.  It was a great experience, not just see the art but explore how deep Tolkien went into building the world of Middle Earth.  Truly amazing when someone devotes that much time and effort into their craft."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My cousin and I crafted our own fictional adventure on some scratch paper when we were kids. We usually started by drawing a fantasy/sci-fi map, chose a starting point, and then improvised the story as we &#34;travel&#34; in this world purely out of imagination.Now thinking back this experience is interesting as it sort of reflecting what Tolkien said, &#34;I wisely started with a map, and made the story fit.&#34;"</p>
