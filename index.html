								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Remember, companies will always look after themselves before anyone else. If Upwork is the middleman here providing a payment platform, then I&#39;d expect them to swallow the cost of card fraud, not the freelancer. I suspect individual freelancers have a theoretical dollar value in their calculations and it&#39;s never going to be bigger than the company accepting a financial risk.I do wonder why the author is still on Upwork, their rating &amp; exposure on there must be worth more to them than working several weeks for free, but personally I&#39;d walk. I also don&#39;t understand why the pay back is not pro-rata instead of full time, allowing freelancers in this position to earn some money to pay the bills whilst paying back the chargeback (although they shouldn&#39;t be paying it at all). If the author is in the same country as the client then they should also be taking legal action to reclaim the money (which again, Upwork should be doing)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The freelancer&#39;s story seems a little suspicious to me.&#34;Let me translate this. Robin has been using someone else’s credit card for two years...&#34; followed by &#34;I’m on very good terms with Robin.&#34;Clearly, &#39;Robin&#39; is a thief and it is entirely possible that Robin and the freelancer are one and the same. That the freelancer is not asking Robin for the money even though he knows him personally is telling.  Does the freelancer wonder what his good client Robin thinks about the fact that Robin ran up a 12K credit card bill(payable to the freelancer, ultimately) that Robin never paid?(And we know the bill was never paid or there would be no need for the claw-back)And I did not see any mention of where Upwork contacted Robin.  Strange considering he was the one with “a credit card connected in his account that wasn’t actually his”. Is he still on the platform?And then he sent two years worth of work to Upwork to substantiate his claim to the money. But how could Upwork know that the work he sent was legitimately related to the transaction?  Could he not have created a project request for something he had already built?Then he apparently logs ALL of his &#39;time&#39; outside of the system. He said that this time was for &#34;a brainstorming session and a few meetings&#34; with Robin. 230 hours worth!?  I notice that dates of the charge-back transactions were not provided. Was this 230 hours the entirety of the project or just a very small  slice. He wrote that he had made more that 100K on Upwork and that he had other clients.  That leads me to think that this 12K represented all or most of the billing on Robin&#39;s project. Was there any billing for actual implementation, or is it all brainstorming and meetings?This story does not add up to me.edit:  I see in the graphic that apparently the work on Robin&#39;s project was for 1533 hours, so the 230 hours would have been just a portion.  It makes me wonder what/how many other credit cards were used to pay for those other hours.  Hard to believe Robin was above board for the first 1303 hours and then started paying with a stolen credit card."</p>

This is enough money that i would not eat it.
You cannot, in fact, be forced to work for free and forced to eat the cost of fraud.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Should be be worried that the author of Accelerando complains about things going too fast?Future is complex, and not only &#34;good&#34; developments happens and start changing everything faster than ever before, bad ones does too. And we aren&#39;t rational enough to avoid the bad ones.Anyway, I&#39;m more worried about the consequences of climate change that are not the slow rise of the global sea level than about COVID. That is a general area where things are happening faster than predicted, and where we act slower than predicted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; low-lying coastal nations like BangladeshAnd lots of other places. About 1 billion people live along coastlines at 20 meters or less above sea level, and 200 million at 5 meters or less. I live in a wealthy country but well within the 5 meters range and am already having to think about whether it wouldn&#39;t be more prudent to sell my house today, now that it&#39;s still worth something, and emigrate to somewhere with a more future-proof elevation.Worst case if Greenland&#39;s ice sheet melts, that adds 7 meters to sea level, and Antarctica&#39;s another 60 meters. I won&#39;t see that in my lifetime but my children might."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding spacex in this, my starlink terminal recently hit a milestone of 0.00% ICMP loss to terrestrial ISP things in the pacific northwest. Averaged over 5, 6 hour periods. 20 icmp pings every 60s, basically a default smokeping install set to once a minute.Previously it was running somewhere around 0.15% to 0.60% which was still totally usable...  if you put a similar test setup on a noisy/oversubscribed coaxial cablemodem DOCSIS3 segment in a randomly chosen house in a suburb somewhere, you might also see an average of 0.50% loss in many cities.For anyone who has seen packet loss, jitter and transfer quotas on deeply oversubscribed consumer geostationary services, this is amazing.The next big thing will be to see if they can really get satellite-to-satellite laser links working so that starlink service area and coverage is not limited by having multiple moving LEO satellites in line of sight of both the CPE and a regional spacex earth station at the same time. for instance if people wanted to put a working starlink terminal somewhere really difficult to reach like socotra, yemen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This and more.  The Sail version of TeX is mentioned, but everything else had a usable prototype, too: An early version of Metafont in Sail, an early version of Web (called Doc, though I don’t recall what the names of the Tangle and Weave equivalents were), and an early version of Computer Modern fonts in the early Metafont language.Though fully documented and available via anonymous FTP on the Arpanet, all of these prototypes were experimental proofs-of-concept and were completely discarded, along with the languages they implemented, with the “real” versions rewritten from scratch by Knuth (each first by hand on legal pads, then typed in and debugged as a whole.)And you missed one more obscure but instructive example: To get the camera-ready copy for ACP Vol 2, Knuth purchased an Alphatype CRS phototypesetter. And, unhappy with the manufacturer’s firmware, he rewrote the 8080 code that drives the thing.  Eight simultaneous levels of interrupts coming from various subsystem: the horizontal and vertical step-motors that you had to accelerate just right, while keeping synchronized with four S100 boards that generated slices of each character in realtime from a proprietary outline format, to be flashed into the lens just as it was passing the right spot on the photo paper. (Four identical boards, since you had to fill the second while the first one did its processing; times two for two characters that might overlap due to kerning). Oh, and you had to handle memory management of the font character data since there wasn’t enough RAM for even one job’s worth (see our joint paper).Fun times. I did the driver on the mainframe side, so got to be there for the intense debugging sessions that used only the CRS’s 4x4 hex keypad and 12-character dot-matrix display.Thanks for the DVI shout-out, btw."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think, though, that there was nothing preventing him from developing TeX in Fortran or something, and leaving it at that.  He is just somewhat easily distracted.  He nerd-snipes himself possibly.Yak Shaving is the frustrating work we do because of impedance mismatch in the system.  Libtool is a huge yak shave, for example.  But so is writing a custom CSV parser because an input file is just not quite accessible by the standard, and you could just use python to make the translation, but your environment won&#39;t let you use python in that spot, etc.  Days later nothing is really accomplished, you hate programming, and you can finally start work on the real problem after losing the motivation you had when you started.But I like the idea of a patron saint for this, and Knuth is as good as any.  Perhaps Dijkstra could be the patron saint of Unused Better Solutions.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a litany of things that could use saints in this field."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I follow the folks over at 100 rabbits (https://100r.co) and I think they’ve sort of developed yak shaving into a lifestyle.I don’t want to go too far into it cause the website is a treasure trove and exciting to explore on your own but if you follow some of their latest stuff, they’ve built a stack based virtual machine, and a whole set of software around it and it truly feels like they are just exploring every avenue that interests them without rushing themselves. Truly the embodiment of my grow a beard and learn Haskell dreams."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Hell, eleven percent of the energy that America currently uses, according to Saul Griffith’s excellent book Electrify, simply goes to finding more energy.That&#39;s a pretty shocking stat too!The energy transition is about to thrust us into a world where for long periods of time, we have massive energy abundance of zero-marginal cost energy generation. It won&#39;t be free to transmit that energy, and the intermittent nature of the abundance will play hell with most capital intensive uses (eg crypto mining), but I&#39;m super curious to see what new capabilities that people figure out for humanity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The scoop: by tonnage, 40% of what is transported by sea is oil, coal, and LNG.By switching to local sources of energy (renewables mostly), humanity can seriously lower the impact of ships on the oceans, and stop burning as much fuel to move them, too.I&#39;d like to add that all these fuels are very energy-dense. Producing as much energy locally would not be an easy or inexpensive enterprise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My nitpicking brain immediately stumbled over these two consecutive sentences:&gt; something very close to forty percent of all the shipping on earth is just devoted to getting oil and coal and gas (and now some wood pellets) back and forth across the ocean.Wood pellets are not fossil fuels though...&gt; That’s a remarkable snapshot: almost half of what we move around the seas is not finished products (cars) nor even the raw materials to make them (steel), but simply the stuff that we burn to power those transformations, and to keep ourselves warmed, cooled, and lit.Oil is also a raw material, e.g. to make plastic. Not sure about what percentage is used as raw material vs. how much is used for fuel..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I understand it, or at least as the narrative goes, printer manufacturers subsidise the cost of the printer by expecting people will buy genuine cartridges. It brings down the RRP of the printer, thereby making it look more competitive than it really is.It is a risk that users might not buy your cartridges. That is a risk these manufacturers accept when they sell their product below market value.Loading up your printer with DRM is having your cake and eating it. It is anti-competitive and ought be outlawed. Either sell the unit at the real price you want to get from it, or accept the risk that your get rich scheme might not work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The US policy response has been far more costly and destructive than it needed to be.The pandemic response completely ignored the costs of shutdowns.  There has been little or no consideration of their impact on physical health, mental health, education, business, employment, worship.  It has been as if COVID was the only risk and the only negative, and any other matter was necessarily secondary.  To even mention these matters was considered obtuse.We have also exaggerated the risks.  The disease has a 0.3 risk of fatality, still less for Omicron, and its fatalities largely occur among people with known risk factors.  Children are essentially immune from serious effects, but this has been ignored by policy.ETA: At some point we need a serious reckoning of how we, as a society, mishandled this so badly.  I think we&#39;ll find the mistakes we&#39;ve made aren&#39;t made on COVID only."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This pandemic is very strange mental-wise, all my doctors note that. The US, as far as I understand, has huge lockdowns and that may be the factor, but in my country it&#39;s called &#34;an advisory self-isolation&#34; and everyone basically lives their life like before, except wearing masks in public places and mandatory vaccination to visit a mall or a restaurant (also &#34;manageable&#34;).I&#39;m not a social person (age almost 40), and I ought not to feel any consequences of that, cause even a strict lockdown wouldn&#39;t change my life too much. And I have a friend who isn&#39;t particularly stress-prone (a former warzone guy, 4 kids, a strong mindset).And guess what, we both experienced numerous acute panic attacks in 2020, without realizing what it was. We both have called an ambulance and thought this is the end of me, only to learn later what panic attack is. And we both never got covid. Doctors say that it is a very common phenomenon to observe. Idk about him, but my mental state I find pretty questionable now, because something induces anxiety in it non-stop from the spring 2020. I don&#39;t watch TV, neither read on pandemic situation consciously. Visited therapist for a whole last year.I can imagine what all that does to regular people, and probably can&#39;t imagine what teens may feel about it.Can anyone share similar observations, or am I just a coincidence?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not even a parent, but I&#39;ve been incredibly distressed by this trend. Several of my good friends have had their daughters attempt suicide (luckily, none have succeeded, although 2 extremely close calls). It&#39;s been utterly gut-wrenching to watch these talented, kind, ambitious girls spiral into shells of their former selves.Luckily, all my friends are fellow techies who are upper-middle class, and can afford medication and therapy (and in one case, out-of-state long-term hospitalization.) But even with insurance, they&#39;re looking at many thousands of dollars of treatment.It makes me sick to my stomach to think of all the lower-class parents who are terrified of their kids killing themselves, but can&#39;t afford therapy or psychiatry visits, and can&#39;t get pro-bono help (apparently the wait lists are several months long in many cities.)It&#39;s past time the West reckons with our mental health crisis. Why is it that we&#39;re the wealthiest nations in the world, yet our kids are more stressed and depressed than kids in third-world countries? I think society will only become more and more unstable until we spend time seriously addressing that question and adjust our culture accordingly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I absolutely love Sneakers.  Whenever folks talk about Hackers or the Matrix or any movies or shows that feature tech I argue that Sneakers is the best movie about hacking.  I feel like a crazy old man ranting about it to some of my younger coworkers.  It makes me sad that my handle (mother) on a lot of gaming services is much more likely to elicit a comparison to Danzig than Dan Aykroyd&#39;s character."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Loved Sneakers when it came out, it was one of the few computer/technology movies that seemed to make an effort to get things right. Or, at least as close to right as you can in a movie.Side story, the article mentions the Universal backlot and the tour buses that come through.  Years ago I was working with Universal on a security project. I&#39;m being driven around with my sales guy on a golfcart. We&#39;re in the back seat, facing backwards, with a guy from Universal, and my sales engineer in the front seats. The driver and my SE are dressed super casual, the sales guy and I both have sport coats and are dressed just well enough to look &#34;important&#34;. Tour bus comes by with the driver doing their spiel and I see a few people looking at us trying to figure out who we are.  I wave to the bus and smile, a couple of people point, and then about 30 people all point their cameras at us and start snapping pics.  It&#39;s worth mentioning that the overall makeup of the group looks like a lot of people here on vacation from other countries. I can only imagine those people going back and looking at their pics and trying to figure out who they took pictures of."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great read.&gt; Years later I ran into Phil at the symphony. I asked him I how he was able to come up with such a great script. He blushed and said he had worked on it for nine years. I know spending a long time writing something doesn’t guarantee success. But not giving up on a good idea almost always does."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A number of moons ago, I switched from a company that used IRC for its internal, real-time, ephemeral communication needs to an enterprise shop that used Microsoft Teams to do that (and of course other communication stuff, as the boundaries for what was better kept in Sharepoint, Confluence, Email/Exchange, the legacy Wiki, and/or Teams were never quite clear :)) there.In the old shop, we eventually had all kinds of important subsystems hooked up to our internal IRC server: Monitoring and alerting. Source control and Wiki activity. The deployment pipeline. Ticket activity reports. All these services were pretty much effortlessly set up to provide useful, real-time status information broadcast to topic-specific channels users could idle in. Everyone could stay informed on topics of their interest, in real time, with no barrier to entry. It was really good, and the implementation completed in a few hours total, for all use-cases, due to irc&#39;s incredible simplicity.Due to the benefits I had reaped from that setup before, I tried to implement parts of it on/for the MS Teams platform at the then-new job. Getting the Teams Python SDK to implement a bot-like entity running alone proved to be a days-long ordeal, and whatever followed wasn&#39;t much more pleasant.In the end, we let someone set up two email-to-teams-channel-forwards which kinda worked, but suffered from obnoxious, multi-minute relay delays.As a consequence of the tedious bringup and the latency shortcoming, the &#34;effortless notification&#34; initiative never really got traction.Not only because of this particular experience I am a firm believer that software/system simplicity is a virtue that can neither be overstated in importance, nor substituted by anything else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s a real shame how difficult programming is. I don’t mean that it is difficult to write difficult things, but that it is difficult to write simple things. Once upon a time, one could download visual studio, click about to make a new project in (e.g.) Visual Basic, draw a gui in the gui editor, and click the run button. One could then start adding simple functionality (e.g. working through a book). Or even longer ago when a computer might dump you practically straight into BASIC when you turned it on or you might get access to a mainframe/minicomputer with programming tools already set up. Nowadays, an ‘easy’ introduction could involve the horrific process of installing and setting up python on windows (where it is hard to do things other than input/output text) or editing some html/JavaScript files where there are more easily possible interactive things but lots of things are difficult like ‘just drawing things’ or anything that requires a server side.P.S. if you, like me, were wondering what Libera Chat is, it’s the moral successor of Freenode with Freenode now being a shell of its former self."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an aside, can I just say how refreshing this website is? It&#39;s 100% content, just text. Now view the html source, and be amazed. I daresay the author actually wrote the html by hand. I suppose it could be a very conservative and conscientious site generator that even respects line length, but I&#39;d be surprised. Short css file for minimal style tweaks, and readable markup. Fitting that the article is about simplicity. When I first learned html (late 90s) this is what it looked like. Very nice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I actually use Vim like this, in fact I wrote a plugin to go all the way and make it a completely &#34;normal&#34; editor [1].It&#39;s endlessly surprising to me that still to this day Vim is most commonly considered through the lens of its keybindings. It&#39;s sooo much more than that! It&#39;s a lightweight terminal editor with one of the largest, if not the largest ecosystems of pioneering extensions. It really shouldn&#39;t be weird that you&#39;d want to take advantage of all that without having to submit to the religion of modal editing.1. https://github.com/tombh/novim-mode"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the help pages[0] to help you navigate in this mode:&gt; These Insert mode commands will be useful:&gt; - Use the cursor keys to move around.&gt; - Use CTRL-O to execute one Normal mode command.  When this is a mapping, it is executed as if &#39;insertmode&#39; was off.&gt; - Use CTRL-L to execute a number of Normal mode commands, then use&lt;Esc&gt; to get back to Insert mode.&gt;These items change when &#39;insertmode&#39; is set:&gt; - when starting to edit of a file, Vim goes to Insert mode.&gt; - &lt;Esc&gt; in Insert mode is a no-op and beeps.&gt; - &lt;Esc&gt; in Normal mode makes Vim go to Insert mode.&gt; - CTRL-L in Insert mode is a command, it is not inserted.&gt; - CTRL-Z in Insert mode suspends Vim.I was going to call you out for plagiarizing an idea from a Reddit post[1] as your own, but it turns out you&#39;re the same person, so carry on :)[0]: https://vimhelp.org/options.txt.html#%27insertmode%27[1]: https://old.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/rxedpj/vim_prank_alias..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another one I like is &#34;alias vim=&#39;exec vim&#39;&#34;.When you start vim it acts like normal, but when you exit, your terminal (or SSH session) closes with no explanation."</p>
