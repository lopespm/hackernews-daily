								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The headline in a domestic newspaper reads &#34;There are some product placements that influencers do not need to label as ads&#34;https://www.zeit.de/digital/internet/2021-09/bundesgerichtsh...:Dit&#39;s all about framing"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whether or not these influencers should have to label ads is one thing.But... I&#39;ll note how &#34;little guy&#34; regulation works relative to major players.You don&#39;t see court, legislature decisions, or such upending the business model of a FB, Google or whatnot. Every word will be negotiated, Google and/or FB will have control over implementation. Often, the regulation will be a net positive, given that it can slow small competitors down. The process will take years, the roll out will be gradual....&#34;Influencers&#34; or really anyone selling content via platforms can have rules slapped onto them by either the state or the platform without notice, lots of potential for revenue disruption... 
It&#39;s easy to belittle the little, and this article kind does it too: &#34;The court said one fitness influencer should have been clear she was advertising when she was paid to promote a brand of jam.&#34;Meanwhile.. FB, Adwords and such got decades of lead time. Extreme tolerance of various dubious practices as regulation designed to be business friendly at the cost of timeliness &amp; effectiveness was slowly formulated. No parliament demands Fast and Furious post little notices, nor have they over decades."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hope they don’t get rid of the symbol entirely! It’s useful to know what resin a product is made of.Things like PLA (which is kinda sorta compostable) are not often recycled, but they can be. If you don’t know what resin the plastic is, then it’s even harder.Keep the resin symbol. Remove the arrows on it. We get better with recycling stuff over time, so eventually more resins could be recycled.But. Part of me wonders if it is actually BETTER to not recycle.Imagine if we made plastic by pulling CO2 from the atmosphere (which we do for PLA!). If the cost were the same and the processing energy the same, wouldn’t it be better for the climate to bury that plastic (sequestering the carbon) instead of recycling it? That is, after all, how we got fossil fuels and reduced the CO2 to preindustrial levels! Burying a bunch of waste carbon from dead algae or trees before fungi evolved that could efficiently break down lignin. Recycling that carbon would’ve meant higher CO2 levels today.And the waste in river thing is primarily about what happens to plastic BEFORE it ends up in a bin (trash OR recycling). Things like water satchets, which really are a compensation for having crap tap water."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would much rather incentivize non-plastic alternative packaging. Consumers should have better options for metal cans, glass bottles, etc for mainstream goods, as those materials are far more effective targets for recycling. But they&#39;re no where near competitive with plastic because the production cost doesn&#39;t account for the total lifecycle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a waste of time.Now we will spend a decade arguing which plastic is really recyclable, and if you can recycle it once is it enough, or should be 2 times? or does it degrade on its own? bio plastic (which turns out sometimes is worse than current common plastic) and etc.Coca Cola&#39;s &#39;Please Recycle&#39; on the caps makes me boil with rage, how about &#39;Please Don&#39;t Make it&#39;?There must be supply chain changes, probably 95% of my plastic is from the supermarket, it is increasingly more difficult to buy without plastic.This must be banned, it will take decades until the free market regulates itself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is a tough feeling to see someone else&#39;s design for a library that would be literally perfect for my needs, but I&#39;m unable to use it because of the license, so I have to spend weeks implementing my own inferior version while carefully avoiding making the code too similar to what I happen to remember.I&#39;m past believing that I&#39;m smart enough to always be able to come up with/reimplement a competent enough solution for all my needs by myself every time. But copyright still has to be respected.When I&#39;m forced into that situation from licensing issues, it really makes me feel like my skillset primarily revolves around gluing together other people&#39;s well-designed code, and being left to my own devices exposes my weakness in implementing something from scratch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t blogged about this yet, but we saw a 1000x fold speed-up doing several things around symbolication. The more optimal approach we found was to use the gimli crate[1] directly &amp; carefully optimize it to read in the data structures for the executable(s) you are symbolicating upfront &amp; then issuing in-process queries. They also have a drop-in replacement of addr2line that outperforms it (both in symbolication speed &amp; memory usage).I am curious about how that compares with libbfd since that wasn&#39;t under consideration for us as it uses GPLv3.[1] https://github.com/gimli-rs/gimli[2] https://github.com/gimli-rs/addr2line"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Students at Portland State are not being taught to think. Rather, they are being trained to mimic the moral certainty of ideologues.They have been taught the magnitude of their outrage makes them righteous. And their outrage is never satiated. These people are toxic and sometimes evil. They&#39;ll eventually come for you too no matter how much you generally agree with them.Some of them are certainly sincere.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think university departments that teach Philosophy, esp where edgy ideas are discussed should have some protection where the teacher is not harassed.Some of his experimental papers where he talks of &#34;dog rape&#34; were perhaps borne out of his outrage at his situation - I am not sure if they are wise decisions on his part - instead seen as extreme measures to prove a point.A liberal college by definition should allow diversity of opinion.  A literal interpretation of the word &#34;liberal college&#34; reflects the reality that many places are liberal bubbles of thought, where there won&#39;t be a safe space for researchers to pick apart and look closely at conservative views of a subject. It&#39;s the sad reality that the authorities are not remotely ready to be proven wrong - the anti-thesis of rational inquiry in an educational setting.Outrage Politics has pervaded everything.  But his outrage is real and maybe justified, where he seems to be the victim (being &#39;coached&#39; i.e. akin to a PIP )"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting that &#34;broken access controls&#34; made it into the top spot. Not sure if this anecdotal but recently I&#39;ve seen many &#34;hacks&#34; of apps built with external BaaS &amp; auth providers that rely on some kind of token-based authentication, either via JWT or opaque tokens. What happens is that often the providers offer good support for role-based access control but developers just plain ignore it and e.g. include tokens with global read permissions into the app code, or do not properly restrict the permissions of individual tokens, making it possible to e.g. read the whole database with a normal user token. The researcher collective Zerforschung [1] e.g. has uncovered many such incidents. That might have to do with the fact that in my experience those BaaS frameworks and other low-code tools are mostly used by teams with a strong focus on product and UI/UX, which don&#39;t have deep security expertise or the right mindset. I think overall outsourcing of aspects like authentication can be beneficial, but only if teams adopt or retain a healthy security awareness as well.[1] https://twitter.com/zerforschung"</p>

XXE&#39;s aren&#39;t misconfiguration (in any sense that a myriad of other vulnerabilities aren&#39;t &#34;misconfigurations&#34; of libraries), and deserialization bugs aren&#39;t software update bugs (I don&#39;t even know what CI/CD is doing in that description).The OWASP Top 10 is rapidly losing coherence.It&#39;s important not to take it too seriously. For all the pantomime about survey data, there&#39;s not much real rigor to it. It&#39;s mostly a motivational document, and a sort of synecdoche for &#34;all of web app security&#34;.The best part of this is the end, where they say &#34;we have no data to support having SSRF on the list, but &#39;industry people&#39; tell us it&#39;s too important not to&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems like with the flurry of support behind mRNA tech, right now is quite an exciting time to be in biotech. It&#39;s early days, but from what (little, admittedly) I&#39;ve read there seems to be a lot of promise behind it. If it lives up to even 10% of its theorised promise, we&#39;re potentially going to see a lot of amazing treatments in the coming couple of decades."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a pretty exciting part of the mRNA field. There are some mutations that cause cancer (like G12D, G12V, G13D or G12C in KRAS) which allows you to make a single vaccine that can be used by anyone with those mutations. There is also a push to do personalized cancer vaccines where you sequence a single person&#39;s cancer and find the top 30 or so mutations in any gene that are different from their normal cells.The biggest issues IMHO with cancer vaccines in the past has been your bodies natural ability to prevent your immune system from attacking itself. With the discovery/invention of checkpoint inhibitors like Keytruda, we may finally have a way to allow your immune system to attack yourself by co-administering Keytruda with the vaccine against your cancer cells [1].Another reason cancer vaccines may finally show promise is mRNA inherently has the ability to drive an immune response (see BNT162b2/Comirnaty) that elicits T-cell specific to the protein you&#39;re coding for. It is believed that cancer-epitope CD8 T-cells specifically are critical for anticancer vaccines, but even if you get good CD8 cells, the second it binds the cancer cell it gets shutdown by the checkpoint proteins on the surface of the cancer cell. If you add a CPI, boom, you don&#39;t prevent the CD8 from shutting down and you get cell killing![1] https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03948763"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the HN crowd, it may be especially interesting to note that this was pretty much a software discovery.The dataset here was DES, the Dark Energy Survey. It’s a big dataset that has been around for a few years, and probably thousands of astronomers have worked with it. But its just a huge amount of data, covering a lot of the sky.Bernardinelli’s software discovered a blip in that big pile of data. He crunched through the dataset and got a weird answer for the size of the solar system (basically - its a bit more complicated). Almost everyone, when they get something like that, tweaks the parameters of their analysis code: “I must have the threshold for object detection set too low.” The real discovery comes from trusting the software and pursuing the question.This is a lot like software developers and their persistence. When your production service has a mysterious error in the logs, do you shrug and say “well, probably some transient network bug, it won’t matter” or do you dig in to understand what’s going on? Both approaches are reasonable, and it takes a balance of pragmatism and curiosity to be effective.But anyway - there is an increasing demand for applying rigorous software engineering techniques to astronomical datasets. A problem that we are facing in astronomy software today is that the datasets have gotten way too large for astronomers to just pull up images in DS9 and eyeball stuff to make sure it’s right, so they need software that is much more trustworthy and bug-free than before.—-Edit to add: DES data is completely public access: https://www.darkenergysurvey.org/the-des-project/data-access..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is super cool. I studied comets for a while when I was in academia, and my favorite was one called Humason [0]. There are other great photos of it, some in google images, though the ones I had in the research lab in a a few books about comets were even more surprising. It had a very odd tail appearance because the comet tail is primarily created by an interaction with the solar wind / magnetic field, and at distances far from the Sun, that field is much weaker, so the tail becomes less straight, and this effect is even more pronounced when the comet is very large, as smaller comets just don&#39;t have an easy to detect visible tail from such great distances from Earth.Humason is less than half the size of this comet and is considered abnormally large.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comet_Humason"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My understanding is that this old article is no longer the simplest/easiest way of doing this. For that, see https://marcusnoble.co.uk/2021-09-01-migrating-from-docker-t.... tl;dr:    $ brew install podman
    $ podman machine init
    $ podman machine start
    $ alias docker=podman

If you&#39;re on an M1 you may run into https://github.com/containers/podman/issues/10577 (which is WIP, and may have been resolved by https://github.com/containers/podman/pull/11451)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any practical benefit of Podman over Docker on a Mac? Virtual machine is still needed, so any performance issues are likely to persist (well, maybe Docker for Mac is a bit more buggy, but we can manually setup Docker instead of Podman in a similar way).Also, I think we are losing here access to the Docker socket on the host (inside the virtual machine it can be emulated using docker-podman)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This feels like the whole industry is now all going through the same motions…I tried podman; two hurdles I haven&#39;t figured out: 1/ sending the context is incredibly slow on podman, compared to Docker+Buildkit. It&#39;s definitely trying to send literally the entire context, like Docker without Buildkit does, but even more slowly… 2/ private registry auth. Haven&#39;t really tried too hard, but it&#39;s not just &#34;a drop in replacement&#34;; I think I need to somehow auth with podman specifically. (Part of this is our external registry is ACR, and we auth with `az`, but I think `az` is presuming Docker…)"</p>
