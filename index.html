								<p class="story__comment_others">"MMM deserves all the attention it gets, but there&#39;s more!1. I&#39;ve got to track down the source of the quote (it may be the linked video), but Brooks has said that the most important architectural decision he made was to have an eight bit byte rather than the cheaper 7 bits (Edit: 6 bits) being considered for the IBM 360. To call that influential is an understatement.2. And he has said the most important management decision was sending Ted Codd to graduate school, where Codd laid the foundation for what became relational databases.3. A paper [0] he co-authored with Amdahl and Blaauw introduced the term &#39;architecture&#39; to computer hardware, later borrowed for software. From the first page:  &#34;The term architecture is used here to describe the attributes of a system as seen by the programmer, i.e., the conceptual structure and functional behavior, as distinct from the organization of the data flow and controls, the logical design, and the physical implementation.&#34;He gave an interesting talk at the 50th anniversary of the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) a few years ago, [1][0] &#39;Architecture of the IBM System/360&#39;, Amdahl, Blaauw, Brooks.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StN49re9Nq8"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My one email exchange with Brooks had nothing to do with Mythical Man Month.In the 1990s I was was the junior co-founder and, for a while, main developer of VMD, a program for molecular visualization. I wanted to include molecular surface visualization, but me being me, would rather integrate someone else&#39;s good work.I looked around and found &#34;Surf&#34;, a molecular surface solver written by Amitabh Varshney when he was at the University of North Carolina. (See &#34;Computing Smooth Molecular Surfaces&#34;, IEEE Computer Graphics and Applications, https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/310720 .)Brooks, you may not know, heard Sutherland talk about using the screen as a window into another world, which got Brooks interested in VR. Back in the 1970s, at UNC, they started experimenting with head-mounted displays. Brooks worked on VR for the rest of his career.The UNC VR group worked on many different VR approaches, including haptic (tactile) feedback. As I recall, the first was a used hydraulic-powered robot arm. People had to wear a lab coat and helmet when using it because it would leak, and had a tendency to hit people.One of the experiments, the NanoManipulator, hooked up the VR and haptic feedback (not that same robot!) to an atomic-force microscope, so people could feel the surface and move nanoscale objects around. http://www.warrenrobinett.com/nano/ .Brooks felt that VR would be very useful for molecular visualization, and developed the GRIP Molecular Graphics Resource. Quoting https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/ADA236598.pdf , some of its early achievements were &#34;the first molecular graphics system on which a protein was solved without a physical model&#34;, &#34;using remote manipulator technology to enable users to feel molecular forces&#34;, and &#34;Real-time, user-steered volume visualization of an electron density map&#34;.As that document points out, their goal was to &#34;wildcat radical new molecular graphics ideas to the prototype stage. Winning ideas are spun off to the thriving commercial industry or into autonomous research projects.&#34;Surf fit very well in those lines, as VMD was an &#34;autonomous research project&#34;.My exchange with Brooks and UNC was 1) to get permission to distribute Surf as part of the VMD distribution, and, 2) a few years later, to provide numbers about how many people had downloaded VMD with Surf."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a previous thread, I had this at &#34;more than 10 years, less than 60&#34; (yeah, that&#39;s an easy bet to make!). The core driver of the sentence is probably the guidelines 2B1.1 table, which scales sentencing levels by economic losses. She was convicted for something like $140MM in fraudulent losses, which by themselves ask for a 24-level escalation (the table maxes out in the mid-40s).By the numbers, the court was probably quite lenient here. Not to say that&#39;s an unjust outcome; the &#34;lenient&#34; option for sentencing on serious federal felonies is still quite harsh.EditI tracked down the prosecutor&#39;s sentencing memorandum; they asked for 15 years. So I guess maybe not that lenient.Later editThe PSR (the court&#39;s own sentencing memorandum, which the prosecution and defense respond to) had Holmes at level 43. I hereby claim that I called this. :PBut the PSR looks at the guidelines level table, which suggests 960 months for level 43, and instead recommends 108 months. So the court imposed a sentence higher than the PSR, lower than the prosecution asked, and all parties asked for much lower than the guideline maximum for the level.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29790880Later later editI&#39;m doing the math wrong; the guidelines range at that level is 240 months per charge (usually served consecutively). Still much higher than the ultimate sentence."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Maybe I have a fundamental misunderstanding of how Tailscale works, but I always feel like there is a disconnect in how it is received on HN.Usually people are pretty critical/cynical of sending sensitive data to a closed source third party server, no matter how strong their claims of &#39;being the good guys&#39; are (eg see Telegram).But somehow we&#39;re all meant to be happy giving full control of our entire network to a commercial company running a closed source command and control server?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is huge. One of the last major missing features from Tailscale IMO. I maintain a list of tunneling solutions[0]. Personally, I think the future of p2p networking and selfhosting may be through tunneled, SNI-routed TLS connections (exactly what Tailscale just announced). It solves IP exhaustion, NAT, and IP privacy at the cost of an extra hop and no UDP.The big question is going to be pricing. The current top player in this space is Cloudflare Tunnel, which is a loss-leader product that technically forbids selfhosting anything other than HTML sites.Selfhosting media can use tons of bandwidth. Any service that doesn&#39;t charge per GB is incentivized to limit your speeds.[0]: https://github.com/anderspitman/awesome-tunneling"</p>

The ingenuity, reliability, polish, and speed of feature delivery are unparalleled in software.I&#39;m eager to get rid of needing DDNS and open ports just for web hooks.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2015 I was working at a &#34;fintech&#34; company and a leap second was announced. It was scheduled for a Wednesday, unlike all others before which had happened on the weekend, when markets were closed.When the previous leap second was applied, a bunch of our Linux servers had kernel panics for some reason, so needless to say everyone was really concerned about a leap second happening during trading hours.So I was assigned to make sure nothing bad would happen. I spent a month in the lab, simulating the leap second by fast forwarding clocks for all our different applications, testing different NTP implementations (I like chrony, for what it&#39;s worth). I had heaps of meetings with our partners trying to figure out what their plans were (they had none), and test what would happen if their clocks went backwards. I had to learn about how to install the leap seconds file into a bunch of software I never even knew existed, write various recovery scripts, and at one point was knee-deep in ntpd and Solaris kernel code.After all that, the day before it was scheduled, the whole trading world agreed to halt the markets for 15 minutes before/after the leap second, so all my work was for nothing. I&#39;m not sure what the moral is here, if there is one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Currently software has to be built to accommodate leap seconds. They happen frequently enough that you&#39;ll find out within a few years whether your software breaks when time suddenly skips forward or backward.If we kick the can down the road such that eventually we&#39;ll need to add a leap minute, we&#39;re going to end up with software that was never written to expect time to change in such a way, hasn&#39;t had a real world test of the change for decades, and will have no one working on the software who ever had to deal with such a change.It&#39;s going to be much worse for software reliability to have a leap minute on the order of once a century than a leap second every few years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hot take…Storing anything as UTC was a mistake and we should be using TAI for all storage and computation, only transforming into more human friendly formats for display to end users. This never needed to be a problem except we decided to make it harder to use TAI than UTC and so everything got built up off the backs of legacy bios level hardware supported UTC style clock behaviour, when we should have been using TAI from the start. Yes I know it would have been harder, but we got off our collective asses and decided to fix our short sighted decision making for Y2K date storage, why not this… if it truly costs as much for everyone to endure a leap second why wasn’t it just fixed from the bottom up and rebuilt correctly!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a vegetarian for well over a decade, I&#39;ve always said the same thing. Meat isn&#39;t nearly as egregiously unhealthy as it&#39;s panned if at all. Processed foods, excessive simple carbohydrates and sugars are the main evils in the kitchen, but there are a variety of reasons to eat less meat too.There&#39;s nuance in all of this. People sympathetic to American consumption patterns will probably see science and explanations like this as some kind of endorsement of their diet. Nutritional science is still in its infancy and we&#39;ll be waffling on the specifics for decades to come, especially if food companies have a vested interest in funding studies.Another data point. Just eat minimally processed whole foods as often as possible, diversify your plate and moderate your intake. I think people are too hyper focused on the &#34;super&#34; and &#34;evil&#34; quality of foods and we end up stuck in the margins bike-shedding the minutia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The partisan tone of this article is very grating and makes it hard to take it seriously. It is full of brash, opinionated statements which are not backed up by the actual study [1] the article is based on.I have to conclude that it&#39;s being upvoted here because people enjoy eating red meat and want to continue to do so, not because it has any particular merit on its own terms.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-022-01968-z"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This title seems like clickbait. The linked article seems like mostly blogspam that&#39;s talking about a new meta-analysis with some specific claims, but it also sprinkles in a quote from an unrelated professor that makes some stronger claims.Specifically, the study it leans on most concludes:&gt; We found weak evidence of association between unprocessed red meat consumption and colorectal cancer, breast cancer, type 2 diabetes and ischemic heart disease. Moreover, we found no evidence of an association between unprocessed red meat and ischemic stroke or hemorrhagic stroke. We also found that while risk for the six outcomes in our analysis combined was minimized at 0 g unprocessed red meat intake per day, the 95% uncertainty interval that incorporated between-study heterogeneity was very wide: from 0–200 g d−1. While there is some evidence that eating unprocessed red meat is associated with increased risk of disease incidence and mortality, it is weak and insufficient to make stronger or more conclusive recommendations. More rigorous, well-powered research is needed to better understand and quantify the relationship between consumption of unprocessed red meat and chronic disease.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I use scientific language models professionally. I skimmed the paper and was immediately disappointed.- They benchmarked against general models like GPT-3 but not well-established  specific models that have been trained for specific tasks like SPECTER[0] or SciBert[1]. Specter outperformed GPT-3 on tasks like citation prediction two years ago. Nobody seriously uses general LLMs on science tasks, so nobody who actually wants to use this cares about your benchmarks. I want to see task-specific models compared to your general model, otherwise whats going to happen is I either need to run my own benchmarks or, much more likely, I shelve your paper and never read it again. If you underperform some that&#39;s fine! If you don&#39;t compare to science-specific models all you&#39;re claiming is that training on science data gives better science results... thats not exactly an impressive finding. Fine-tuning is a separate thing, I get it, but pleeeeeease just give the people what they want.- Not released on huggingface. No clue why not. On the back-end this appears to be based on OPT and huggingface compatible, so I&#39;m really confused.- Flashy website. Combine 1&amp;2 with a well designed website talking about how great you are and most of my warning lights got set off.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love softcore FP (immutability, first-class functions, etc), but I always get the impression that hardcore FP, like in this article, is about reimplementing programming language concepts on top of the actual programming language used.The pipe feels like a block of restricted statements, `peekErr` and `scan` recreate conditionals, the Maybe monad behaves like a try-catch here, etc.Of course there are differences, like `map` working on both lists and tasks, as opposed to a naive iteration. That&#39;s cool. But this new programming language comes with limitations, like the difficulty in peeking ahead or behind during the list iteration, reusing data between passes, and not to mention the lost tooling, like stack traces and breakpoints.I&#39;ve written many (toy) programming languages, the process is exactly like this article. And it feels awesome. But I question the wisdom of presenting all this abstract scaffolding as a viable Javascript solution, as opposed to a Javascripter&#39;s introduction to Haskell or Clojure, where this scaffolding is the language."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One take away from functional programming that I have incorporated into my Java (and C#) code: If/When possible, never (ever ever!!!) re-assign a local variable.  (Rare exception: Classic C-style for-loop iteration with mutable `i` integer variable.)  Really, really, I am not trolling / not a joke.  How / Why?  How?  All primative parameter value must be final, e.g., `final iint level`, and local variables must always be final.  Why?  Final vars are significantly easier to &#34;reason about&#34; when reading code, as compared to non-final (mutable) vars.  If you are using containers, always, always, always use immutable containers from Google Guava unless you have an exceptionally good reason.  Yes, the memory overhead will be higher, but big enterprise corps do not care about adding 4/8/16 extra GB RAM to host your Java / C# app.  Yes, I know that any `Object` in Java is potentially mutable.  As a work-around, try to make all `Object`s immutable where possible.  On the surface, the whole thing / exercise feels like a terrible Computer Science nitemare.  In practice, it becomes trivial to convert code from single-threaded to multi-threaded because most of your data classes are already &#34;truly&#34; final."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sure this is a wonderful intellectual exercise in computer science and math, but if this is to be the advertisement in favor of functional programming, I wouldn&#39;t consider myself a customer.You start out with code that will not win any beauty awards but it gets the job done. It&#39;s easy to understand by programmers of any seniority, it&#39;s simple to debug and reasonably easy to put in an automatic unit test.Next, you add all kinds of vague, poorly named meta utilities that don&#39;t seem to solve any tangible real world problem. You even mess with built-in JS methods like map. The code is now harder to understand and more difficult to debug.A massive pain is added for some theoretical purity that few even understand or will benefit from. I&#39;ll double down on my rebellion by stating that the portability of code is overrated.Here we&#39;re writing code to format notification objects. In our overengineering mindset, we break this down into many pieces and for each piece consider reusability outside this context to be of prime importance.Why though? Why not just solve the problem directly without these extra self-inflicted goals? The idea that this is a best practice is a disease in our industry.Most code that is written prematurely as reusable, will in fact never be reused outside its original context. And even if it is reused, that doesn&#39;t mean that outcome is so great.Say that the sub logic to format a user profile link turned out to be needed outside this notification context. Our foresight to have made it reusable in the first place was solid. Now two completely different functional contexts are reusing this logic. Next, the marketing department goes: well actually...you need to add a tracking param specifically for links in the notification context, and only there.Now your &#34;portability&#34; is a problem. There&#39;s various ways to deal with it, and I&#39;m sure we&#39;ll pick the most complicated one in the name of some best practice.After 20 years in the industry, you know how I would write the logic? A single method &#34;formatNotification&#34;. It wouldn&#39;t weirdly copy the entire object over and over again, it would directly manipulate the object, one piece at a time. Error checking is in the method as well. You can read the entire logic top to bottom without jumping into 7 files. You can safely make changes to it and its intuitive to debug. Any junior would get it in about 2 minutes.Clear, explicit code that requires minimum cognitive parsing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Worked for AWS for just under a year and a half; this mirrors my experience exactly.Poorly designed, failure-prone, brittle internal tooling was a time and energy sink to the point where even the most trivial deployment change was a nail-biter. Automated tooling and tests that were ostensibly created to make life easier were the number one pain point and constantly failed in obscure ways that required cutting tickets to teams responsible for the automation.More often than not these tickets would be ignored and issues would persist for weeks beyond what&#39;s reasonable.I&#39;d actually force myself to write even trivial code on weekends to ensure my ability to develop didn&#39;t atrophy as a result of lack of use.That, paired with the awful corporate culture and constant fear of PIP/job loss forced me to finally leave.Generally a very unpleasant experience all around, sans the compensation and name on the resume."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; but also a job that made me feel more unhappy than any other job I’ve ever had.I can relate. I worked for many years for one &#34;those&#34; companies that is a household name. The pay wasn&#39;t outstanding, and the job was not one that gave me much fulfillment, but it was at a marquee brand. My business card opened a lot of doors.When that job finally ended (after almost 27 years), I started looking at working for other companies. I would have been a particularly good fit for startups, as I was financially secure (thus, didn&#39;t need to be paid too much), and have a huge arsenal of skills and experience, that can be quite useful to any small outfit that has &#34;many hats&#34; employees.What I found, is that us older folks are quite unpopular, and got tired of slamming doors and passive-aggressive insults.So I just decided that I was in early retirement.Best decision I ever made.I would have liked having the extra money, but the soul-sucking aspect would have probably killed me, by now.I am in a good position. I have enough set aside to be OK, but not at an exorbitant level, and I get to write awesome code every single day. It&#39;s basically, my &#34;dream job.&#34;I feel terrible for over-leveraged young folks, having to deal with this kind of thing, early on. I feel even worse, for the ones that have &#34;crossed over&#34; into &#34;old,&#34; and are still over-leveraged. They won&#39;t feel old, but they will be treated as such.It&#39;s really humbling and infuriating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience has been similar at other large companies (MSFT, Google). My advice is to look for founder-led teams (not companies). If there are plenty of founders still on the team, they will likely care a lot about the product and code and hold everyone to high standards which make the work easier in the long run. On the other hand when I&#39;ve been on teams where all the original founders left, it&#39;s been a constant struggle to make anyone care about anything. At that point there is no ownership and most people are there for a paycheck. Lots of sloppy code gets shipped, everyone approves anything that looks like code, and eventually adding a single line anywhere feels like playing Russian roulette. Extreme short term thinking takes hold and no one cares that in 2-3 years the code will be unmaintainable because they don&#39;t plan to be on the team by then."</p>
