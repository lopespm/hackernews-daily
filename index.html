								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Why the duplication? I have not yet observed Metal using different programs for each.I&#39;m guessing whoever designed the system wasn&#39;t sure whether they would ever need to be different, and designed it so that they could be. It turned out that they didn&#39;t need to be, but it was either more work than it was worth to change it (considering that simply passing the same parameter twice is trivial), or they wanted to leave the flexibility in the system in case it&#39;s needed in future.I&#39;ve definitely had APIs like this in a few places in my code before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Yes, AGX is a mobile GPU, designed for the iPhone. The M1 is a screaming fast desktop, but its unified memory and tiler GPU have roots in mobile phones.PowerVR has its roots in a desktop video card with somewhat limited release and impact. It really took off when it was used in the Sega Dreamcast home console and the Sega Naomi arcade board. It was only later that people put them in phones."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I strongly feel that the spammers thing is smoke and mirrors.The deal at $54.20 was maybe OK for him a month ago (it was great for Twitter because nobody else was interested at that price). Since then, Twitter reported disappointing numbers for the past quarter, and the entire market took a nose dive, with tech hit especially hard.TWTR stock price was in the mid-30s before Musk&#39;s offer. Without the offer, and with the disappointing numbers, and with the recent market development, one could reasonably assume that the stock would be below 30 today.Musk should just pay the break fee of $1bn, and renegotiate for $42.69 or whatever meme number he fancies. Why pay $42bn total for something when you can get it for $30bn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt;Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of usersHe is asking for proof that spam and fake accounts are less than 5% of total users. He obviously believes the number is much higher[1]. This does not seem to be a deal killer - he is just calling their bluff[2]. Maybe they are right. Maybe not. We will see. Interesting times![1] https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1517215066550116354[2] https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-estimates-spam-fa..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well this certainly makes what Parag did make sense. The market conditions have essentially dictated that Musk is now massively overpaying for twitter, and he&#39;s doing it from a weak position with the value of Tesla dropping. It would be insane for him to close at this price, and the other people who bought in to finance it will also be very hard to keep on board. So Musk needs to walk away at this price. The question is whether he can either find an out that doesn&#39;t involve paying the break up fee, or bully Twitter&#39;s board to accept a lower price. Given how Parag is behaving I think that&#39;s unlikely.It&#39;s important to remember though, if Musk walks away and then comes back with another offer it&#39;s going to be extremely hard to convince of a new deal, since Musk no longer has any credibility.The other thing to consider is that no one else wanted to buy Twitter for $45Bn. But let&#39;s say Musk walks away and Twitter drops back to where it should be at around $25 per share. Now you could easily see someone coming in and picking it up for $35-40 per share."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work for non-tech generating 100million+ in revenue. Cushy job, fully remote, good pay and full autonomy with flexible hours working as an IC.I recently talked to a startup, similar pay, culture would be a better fit since it was mostly techies and I&#39;m a nerd by nature.....but things just got awkward as soon as I asked about their revenue....they were bleeding money and I was told they were being acquired by a big corp. Also, the tone worried me, the confidence the CEO presented early in the call disappeared.I also tried digging deeper into their business and what they were selling, as I have interest in that space due to my hobbies. I literally didn&#39;t see a need for their startup to exist. But I&#39;m just an average developer what do I know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been a long time coming.Back in the day, there was an inherent understanding that a stock price is supposed to reflect &#34;the fundamentals&#34; - present value of the company + future earnings. And of course there was some amount of speculation around future earnings, but for the most part companies at least tried to be profitable.But if you look at the share price of like, Tesla - it&#39;s completely insane. There is no way your slice of the company is worth that much. The stock market has been behaving like a pyramid scheme, where everyone assumed there will be more money entering than leaving any given stock.Tech is a pretty egregious sector because of how many business models basically boil down to &#34;we don&#39;t actually need to make money if we have a desirable stock&#34;. In the long run, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be worse off if the next generation of software companies actually focuses on making products people want to buy rather than play games with DAU and user acquisition and etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(Former AI researcher / founder here)It always surprises me at the ease at which people jump on a) imminent AGI and b) human extinction in the face of AGI. Would love for someone to correct me / add information here to the contrary. Generalist here just refers to a &#34;multi-faceted agent&#34; vs &#34;General&#34; like AGI.For a) - I see 2 main blockers,1) A way to build second/third order reasoning systems that rely on intuitions that haven&#39;t already been fed into the training sets. The sheer amount of inputs a human baby sees and processes and knows how to apply at the right time is an unsolved problem. We don&#39;t have any ways to do this.2) Deterministic reasoning towards outcomes. Most statistical models rely on &#34;predicting&#34; outputs, but I&#39;ve seen very little work where the &#34;end state&#34; is coded into a model. Eg: a chatbot knowing that the right answer is &#34;ordering a part from amazon&#34; and guiding users towards it, and knowing how well its progressing to generate relevant outputs.For (b) -- I doubt human extinction happens in any way that we can predict or guard against.In my mind, it happens when autonomous systems optimizing reward functions to &#34;stay alive&#34; (by ordering fuel, making payments, investments etc) fail because of problems described above in (a) -- the inability to have deterministic rules baked into them to avoid global fail states in order to achieve local success states. (Eg, autonomous power plant increases output to solve for energy needs -&gt; autonomous dam messes up something structural -&gt; cascade effect into large swathes of arable land and homes destroyed).Edit: These rules can&#39;t possibly all be encoded by humans - they have to be learned through evaluation of the world. And we have not only no way to parse this data at a global scale, but also develop systems that can stick to a guardrail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not sure how to word my excitement about the progress we see in AI research in the last years. If you haven’t read it, give Tim Urbans classic piece a slice of your attention: https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revol...It’s a very entertaining read from a couple of years ago (I think I’ve read it in 2017), and man, have things happened in the field since then. If feels like things truly start coming together. Transformers and then some incremental progress look like a very, very promising avenue. I deeply wonder in which areas this will shape the future more than we are able to anticipate beforehand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is today the day?Date Weakly General AI is Publicly Known:
https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/date-weakly-general...(I really like the framing of &#34;weakly general AI&#34; since it puts the emphasis on the generality and not whether it&#39;s a superintelligence)Edit: Probably not today, but mostly because 1.2B parameters isn&#39;t enough to get it the high winograd scores that PaLM etc have. But it seems pretty clear you could scale this architecture up and it will likely pass. The question is when someone will actually train a model that can do it"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wanted wired Ethernet in my office but didn&#39;t want to punch holes in the wall. Luckily I have an old &#34;central vacuum system&#34; that as far as I can tell has never been even powered on, many years before I bought the house.I tied a ping pong ball to a piece of string and used a vacuum cleaner to suck it through the pipes, then used the string to pull a stronger rope and then the Ethernet cable. So now my Ethernet goes from my office to the wireless router via the vacuum ducting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah, I&#39;ve never really seen the appeal.  Wires are just so reliable.  I am always in meetings with &#34;sorry, my headphones died, can you repeat that&#34; or people mysteriously vanishing because their laptop can&#39;t charge as fast as Zoom draws power and their computer just dies.  I have a wired mic, headphones, and power, and it just never breaks.Wireless is just temporary, if you have wireless headphones, you have to plug in a wire to charge them.  If your computer has a battery built in, you have to plug it in every day to charge.  So it&#39;s just an extra chore that makes your life worse.  Not that exciting.Maybe everyone fantasizes about being a digital nomad.  I do not.  I have a great desk, chair, keyboard, and 3 monitors.  I couldn&#39;t work without them.  If I want to see the world, I&#39;ll go do that without bringing my computer.  A vacation with your computer is just work.A question I&#39;m asked is &#34;what if there&#39;s a power outage&#34; but we have had about 10 total minutes of power outage here in Brooklyn in the 10 years I&#39;ve lived here (during Hurricane Sandy).  My thought is I just won&#39;t do any work if there isn&#39;t any power.  We waste an hour a day dealing with wireless not working, 10 minutes every 10 years is no big deal.  (&#34;But what if it&#39;s the big one!?&#34;  Then my ISP&#39;s backup batteries will also be drained and I still can&#39;t work.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one reason why I&#39;m still down on Apple&#39;s decision to remove 1/8&#34; audio jacks from iPhones: they took away a decades old &#34;just works&#34; standard that wasn&#39;t subject to interference or battery or latency issues and replaced it with something that fundamentally is. Their efforts at filing down the sharp edges here with the airpods (and they have done as well as anyone could expect and more) don&#39;t change the fundamentals.&#34;Get a dongle&#34; -- maybe I will when I finally give up my original iPhone SE, but I&#39;m not going to be cheerful about paying an extra $30 for the privilege along with the overhead of keeping track of an additional thing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Bravo. Soon, developing point-and-click, drag-and-drop apps will be almost as easy as it was in 1998 with Visual Basic 6.I (mostly) jest, but yeah, this is marvelous. I&#39;m developing a small React app this weekend, I&#39;ll use this and make sure to report any bugs or issues along the way.Thanks a lot for making something that makes other people (me!) excited!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t shown in the video, but does your editor comes with pre-set &#34;styles&#34; or is it something that you would import yourself ?My experience is that typing the code for components nesting inside components is not really the big hurdle when designing React views ; rather, it&#39;s getting the &#34;layout&#34; part of the css right.The big value in the video seems to be the simple fact that you have a &#34;Form&#34; parent component where adding a child gives it roughly the right look.But maybe I have Stokholm syndrome, and forgot how simple it was to hook up in GUI in VB3 back in the days !Nice work !"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good luck, looks great already!I spent years of my life on the problem of generating useful multi-platform code from a GUI tool and integrating it into designer and developer workflows. Before giving up I made React Studio (https://reactstudio.com) which is owned by my co-founders now.It&#39;s insanely difficult. Nobody&#39;s needs are exactly the same, and nobody can agree even on the basics of how a web app is structured: where does CSS go, how do you update your global data, etc.The abstractions I had to build to handle that then increased the learning curve to such levels that it became more like a CAD tool where you&#39;d practically need to train teams into a new way of thinking for them to become productive. Having traction with a few customers never seemed to translate into something scalable. (Maybe with an actual sales team an enterprise strategy could have worked.)My original version of the product was a mobile-only UI tool that generated native code for iOS and Android. In retrospect that was a better product than trying to expand into full-blown web apps. In native, a button is a button and a tab bar is a tab bar (with small differences between UIKit and Android); in web anything can be anything, and it&#39;s a point of pride to reinvent the basics constantly, so a tool must somehow adapt to the shifting tides of how CSS must look this year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is going to be a polemical comment, but I feel compelled to share it:It&#39;s my opinion that a great deal of the blame (if not the outright majority) for this state of affairs can be levied against suburban culture (and, by extension, car culture).The communities that hand-wring the most about predators and risks to children tend to be middle class, suburban, and white. They drive their children everywhere, and thereby are (somewhat) alienated from the idea of a &#34;local community&#34; beyond the immediate neighborhood (which can only be entered or exited by car.) Things like childcare are purchasable services, not kindnesses that you or your neighbor do for each other when the other&#39;s in a pinch. When this is your bubble (or, for the rest of us, the dominant cultural metaphor for responsible parenting), it&#39;s hard not to see the world as a foreign and scary place, with unknown levels of unknown danger."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Friend of mine runs a local eatery.  She told her 9-year old son to walk across the street - literally to the candy shop where she knows the owner, and told the kid to do some homework for an hour.  Police brought her son back and threatened to charge her with endangerment or abandonment or something similar.  This was... 2018 IIRC.They live about 1.5 miles from the eatery.  She would let her 9 year old walk home sometimes in good weather - low crime with actual tree-lined suburban streets.  Police apparently threatened her over that as well - that&#39;s somehow endangering the child too much, and she might be charged with some misdemeanor.I don&#39;t get it.  Really.  As someone who grew up in the 70s/80s... I can&#39;t say &#39;nothing bad ever happened&#39;.  Obviously it did.  But the pendulum has swung far too much the other way now."</p>

She has been on a crusade against overprotected children since then [1].I always found her advice extremely reasonable, but then again, I don&#39;t have children.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenore_Skenazy"</p>

I know many Kickstarter projects (and hardware startups in general) end up aggressively compromising on features and construction to meet deadlines and cut down on BOM costs, so I was very pleased to see no evidence of that with the Flipper Zero. It’s one of those products where you can immediately tell that a very passionate team invested a ton of time and took special care with the engineering and design process."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Glad to see progress in this space.I couldn&#39;t find anything describing the paradigm used for the JavaScript frontend. From the video, it looks like things are fully server side rendered, i.e. no client side routing as-in SvelteKit or Next.js? Are the Svelte components hydrated+interactive after page load? In my experience so far with SvelteKit and other SSR+SPA frameworks, there are too many tradeoffs with hydrating then opting to CSR for subsequent navigation. I like the browser&#39;s built-in implementation of navigating between pages because it preserves things like mutations to the document and scroll position out of the box, with no additional JavaScript. If you collapse a comment in this thread, navigate back to the home page, then use your browser&#39;s back button, the comment you collapsed should still be collapsed. In my experience with SPA CSR, you&#39;ll need to track and restore the JavaScript state driving that collapse on your own (a combination of the window.history object and CSR hooks), since navigating back to the page is a full client side re-render of the page.I&#39;ve found Svelte+React have good support for TypeScript, especially for guaranteeing the types of props passed to components, are there plans to support this? With controllers in Go and Views in Svelte/React, is there any way to help with correctness of data passed as props to the Svelte components?"</p>

It&#39;s a full-stack web dev starter kit for Go, rather than a framework with any strict patterns or lock-in. It leverages Echo (web) and Ent (ORM) but they can be easily swapped out, if desired.It also has HTMX [1] integration to create slick/modern UI behavior without writing any JS.[0] https://github.com/mikestefanello/pagoda

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. Working at a tech company as a developer vs working at a non-tech company are very different.These two types of roles were called line vs staff when I took a business school class and I think the differences between these two types of roles have a big impact on what the job is like, even if doing the same type of work. It&#39;s a bit confusing because it overlaps with &#39;staff software engineer&#39; term.I recall hearing stats before that the vast majority of developers work at non-tech companies, but I almost never hear their stories. They are the dark matter of software developers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related to this article: The owner of a company (non-startup, but growing and profitable) I used to work for gave me great career advice. He said to always focus on things that produce revenue. If you aren&#39;t doing things that produce revenue, try to move into those areas if possible.His view was that revenue can soar 100%, 200%, 1,000%, 10,000% or however high. Cost savings, on the other hand, can only go down to a maximum of 100% (but obviously much lower in practice). So in his mind, a business-wide focus on growing revenue is always better than a focus on cutting costs. If you are in the second boat, it means the company is struggling and maybe it&#39;s time to get out.Obviously, a rational CEO would see $1m cost savings the same as a $1m gain in profits, but CEO&#39;s are not rational beings (nor is any human) and understanding that they usually prefer higher revenue to lower costs is fundamental to understanding how they value different parts of the company. It&#39;s not fair, it&#39;s just truth (at least in many companies).There&#39;s something refreshing about some hedge funds where portfolio managers are rewarded exclusively on their own performance. For example, if the fund loses money, but you continue to bring in great revenue, you can bet that any sane hedge fund will pay you a lot to stay around, regardless of how they are doing overall. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), profit in most companies isn&#39;t directly attributable in the way it is at hedge funds. But the same truth holds. If you are bringing in good profit, it&#39;s hard to get rid of you (or not pay you well) regardless of how the company is doing overall. Try to be in one of those profit centers, if you can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been both staff and line at various companies.The biggest downside to staff IME is that you are almost constantly reminded that you are a cost and at danger of being cut.OTOH, the biggest upside is the domain knowledge, and in particular, how companies (ie customers of the line engineers) really deploy and run their systems, which IME is often very different from how the line engineers think they run them.Line engineers tend to gloss over the myriad of external influences that affect how easy their systems are to deploy and integrate (eg how many FTEs doe it take to operate your systems, how long is an acceptable maintenance window for applying fixes, how long does it take to roll back if a fix fails, etc).An experienced staff engineer introduced to a line team can be a huge asset, and will ask the right kind of questions, ie those that the customer is often most interested in."</p>
