								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yep, there&#39;s a premium on making your architecture more cloudy. However, the best point for Use One Big Server is not necessarily running your big monolithic API server, but your database.Use One Big Database.Seriously. If you are a backend engineer, nothing is worse than breaking up your data into self contained service databases, where everything is passed over Rest/RPC. Your product asks will consistently want to combine these data sources (they don&#39;t know how your distributed databases look, and oftentimes they really do not care).It is so much easier to do these joins efficiently in a single database than fanning out RPC calls to multiple different databases, not to mention dealing with inconsistencies, lack of atomicity, etc. etc. Spin up a specific reader of that database if there needs to be OLAP queries, or use a message bus. But keep your OLTP data within one database for as long as possible.You can break apart a stateless microservice, but there are few things as stagnant in the world of software than data. It will keep you nimble for new product features. The boxes that they offer on cloud vendors today for managed databases are giant!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our industry summarized:Hardware engineers are pushing the absolute physical limits of getting state (memory/storage) as close as possible to compute. A monumental accomplishment as impactful as the invention of agriculture and the industrial revolution.Software engineers: let&#39;s completely undo all that engineering by moving everything apart as far as possible. Hmmm, still too fast. Let&#39;s next add virtualization and software stacks with shitty abstractions.Fast and powerful browser? Let&#39;s completely ignore 20 years of performance engineering and reinvent...rendering. Hmm, sucks a bit. Let&#39;s add back server rendering. Wait, now we have to render twice. Ah well, let&#39;s just call it a &#34;best practice&#34;.The mouse that I&#39;m using right now (an expensive one) has a 2GB desktop Electron app that seems to want to update itself twice a week.The state of us, the absolute garbage that we put out, and the creative ways in which we try to justify it. It&#39;s like a mind virus.I want my downvotes now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; However, cloud providers have often had global outages in the past, and there is no reason to assume that cloud datacenters will be down any less often than your individual servers.A nice thing about being in a big provider is when they go down a massive portion of the internet goes down, and it makes news headlines. Users are much less likely to complain about your service being down when it&#39;s clear you&#39;re just caught up in the global outage that&#39;s affecting 10 other things they use."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m fascinated by how much this is exactly like working with a human artist who doesn’t really understand the domain that you are wanting to represent with an image. Iterate, iterate, iterate.It seems like the most valuable thing this could do is get some of that early exploration out of the way faster and easier than a human can do it, get to two or three concepts that feel like they’re in the neighborhood, and then let a human expert take over and turn it to something final quality. That’s pretty cool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This blog post proves that Dall-E 2 will not make human taste and design ability obsolete. The final image he ended up with is a lot uglier and more complicated than most of the intermediate steps. I think generative art AIs will have a similar effect on design as compilers have on software development, and will not put artists out of a job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not sure if this will be considered off topic, my apologies if so.The article says that octopi is the plural of octopus, but it&#39;s actually octopuses. Octopus is originally Greek, not Latin and thus does not get the Latin plural -i, but instead would get the Greek plural -odes. Since it ends in a way English can deal with, the commonly accepted usage is octopuses (English) over octopodes (Greek) with octopi being the least correct.https://qz.com/1446229/let-us-finally-resolve-the-octopuses-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find this stuff fascinating, and this article is way above average for online posts about proprietary/algorithmic/quantitative/low-latency trading (very leaky Venn diagram there). I have a few nitpicks but overall it&#39;s informative and it&#39;s an interesting format: viewing an industry through the lens of a particular firm, especially one as fascinating as Jane. Anything that develops literacy in modern finance amongst the lay public is a good thing in my book.If this stuff floats your boat I&#39;d also recommend any of Carl Cook&#39;s talks, e.g. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NH1Tta7purM. Optiver is AFAIK in a somewhat different business than Jane, but they&#39;re also players (or were last I had any inside baseball).Too many people got their worldview on this industry from &#34;Flash Boys&#34;, and I say this as a Lewis fan, is criminally stupid at best and in bad faith at worst (if you want a well-researched, accessible alternative: https://www.amazon.com/Trading-Speed-Light-Algorithms-Transf... is about a zillion times better).It&#39;s a pretty short list of places I&#39;d ever go through some grueling and semi-arbitrary gauntlet to work for, but Jane is on it for sure.I hope the author(s) do Medallion next."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;the winners get a job from which people routinely retire rich in their 30s, and the losers... don&#39;tHonestly, I find this ridiculous. Firstly, Yes, working at Jane Street is a well paying job and you&#39;ll do well out of it. No. People aren&#39;t routinely retiring in their 30s. I don&#39;t understand where this absurd idea comes from. Look at all the rich people in the world, look at how old they are, and ask, are they retired? No! People who are driven and smart don&#39;t suddenly earn their first $5m go off and buy an annuity. They&#39;re more likely to go off and found their own trading shop at 30 than they are to retire.Secondly, you know what happens to people who don&#39;t get hired after their internship at Jane Street? They go to HRT, to G Research, to Jump, to Citadel, to Optiver, to IMC, to XTX, if they&#39;re really unsuccessful they&#39;ll go to Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta. These are not people desperate for a job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Generally good article that delves into how a market maker functions. Couple points:Re EA: quoting my boss, EA isn&#39;t really a dominant thing in the market maker space, it&#39;s pretty much only espoused by a couple high profile individuals (mainly, SBF).Re strategy: point about how there&#39;s little strategy involved in being a market maker is off-base. Everything is ultimately strategy: do I continue to pour resources into a strategy that is losing money in the hopes of eventually seeing pnl? What markets should I focus on? What is the best use of time for each employee that maximizes pnl/head? etc etcOne thing that I thought article got right is that most work involved in market making is about avoiding trades, not making them. Capturing the bid ask spread is conceptually easy. The hard part is avoiding trading with toxic counterparties.Part about put options is especially apt. Market making during a crash / recession (like right now) is especially difficult because all the non-toxic counterparties have stopped trading as much (people like to trade a lot more during a bull market than a bear one). By setting up a structure such that you profit during a crash (either by buying puts, leaning net short, or through some other method), you introduce an uncorrelated return stream that can really help."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The truth is that a majority of tech companies don&#39;t need 50%+ of their employees.Google could lay off vast swathes tomorrow and be immensely more profitable without any loss in revenue.The 2010s will be remembered as the golden era for tech employment. The second we start getting industry wide layoffs, the insanely high wage inflation we&#39;ve seen will kick into reverse much faster than you probably believe possible.Further, tech employees will be the first to suffer in a high inflation environment due to rising discount rate. Yet tech is such a small portion of the labor force that layoffs here basically mean zilch when it comes to the unemployment rate/inflation, and thus there&#39;s a long way for it to fall before the Fed adjusts policy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s brutal.  We just laid off a couple hundred people last week, only five from our department (which is 190 people) but two of them were from one of my teams.  Demoralizing, and in the case of that team, absolutely devastating to productivity in the short term.Cutting almost 1 in 4 employees is beyond anything I can imagine.  I think I&#39;d feel like I was rearranging deck chairs if I survived the cut and stuck around.  I&#39;d be putting out my resume right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The people I know who are still inside (Google) seem optimistic that maybe the company is taking a pause to deal with some of its bureaucracy and internal politics issues and with people&#39;s complaints about perf. I suppose that&#39;s good.From my perspective: They&#39;ve got way too many people doing a lot of meh work and feeling really ... important about it. And it&#39;s on the whole asphyxiating the industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As several of these statements blatantly contradict one another, I went back to the data and ran the same sanity check that I did with Facebook above. In other words, what if Google is using the hiring freeze as a smoke screen and only continuing with the strongest candidates, while keeping the rest on the bench?An actual hiring freeze sends a very strong negative signal to employees and investors. To employees it says &#34;the ship is sinking.&#34; Layoffs are right around the corner and that is absolute poison to morale. To investors it says &#34;technical or not, we&#39;ve hit a recession.&#34; Brace yourselves for impact. Google and Facebook are both advertising companies, so they are tightly coupled to the business cycle. When business spending starts to falter, they&#39;ll feel it first. And they have.So it&#39;s not surprising that the companies themselves are far from clear about this, sending mixed messages. I expect them to continue to do so for as long as they possibly can.The bubble has inflated so far for so long, I get the sense that even among cynical young employees and &#34;investors&#34; there&#39;s a sense of permanence in the positions of both companies. The thing is, those with fewer than 10 years experience have never seen the ferocity of the other side of the business cycle. When it turns, that mofo turns. Those in top management positions have seen it, and they&#39;re going to do everything in their ability to deny and evade it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google has always recruited and interviewed independently of whether they actually have roles open that make sense for you. Earlier this year, I passed the interview and spent six weeks in &#34;team match&#34; before I gave up and took a role with another company. Had a friend who did the same for months for a PM role.Just bc you&#39;re getting contacted by Google recruiters this week or interviewing doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;ll ever find a team or get a real offer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to see that they also adopted the current industry standard of automatically banning people at random, not telling them why and not giving them any way to rectify it. But then, well, I mean, it&#39;s Oracle. What did you expect?Normally something like this would put them on my &#34;will never use any of their products nor work with them&#34; shitlist, but it&#39;s Oracle, so they were already there since, like, ever.Also, obligatory: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zRN7XLCRhc&amp;t=33m"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a similar experience. Recently my account got suspended for no reason. I have been logging in and reading up on the tutorials / documentation to see how to use Oracle Cloud and I hadn&#39;t even started using any of the free resources yet, but my recently created account got suspended nonetheless. Unless my account was hacked (which I would like to be notified of) I cannot have violated any ToS. I got the same non-response when I asked why my account was removed.To me it looks like Oracle isn&#39;t being honest about their &#34;always free&#34; tier and they just shut down non-paying accounts to cut costs if they don&#39;t foresee them converting into paying customers any time soon. If it were a bug / mistake, then I would have expected better support (restoring the account or providing a new account if that&#39;s not possible), but being ghosted by a big corporation when you know for a fact that you did nothing wrong is pretty frustrating.I have not had such a bad experience with any cloud company ever. I sincerely hope Oracle changes, but as it stands I will never spend a dime with Oracle and I will dissuade anyone from using their services, because of how unreliable they have demonstrated themselves to be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a pattern in technology companies and user reports of them:* User does thing that appears to be fine.* User is banned* User has no way of fixing this, ask for redress, they are just cut out now.I think this pattern is something that should be held in contempt and is eventually thrown away.  If I had to guess, though, it won&#39;t be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading this I can&#39;t help feeling that Python puts the &#34;simplicity&#34; in all the places that don&#39;t matter. Simplicity is the reason given for not having useful language features like pattern matches as expressions, or lambdas with multiple expressions, but I&#39;ve never seen these features[1] cause problems in other languages. And then we have this... Surely semantic simplicity is the simplicity that actually matters, but the way the simplicity argument is used in Python is often to enforce arbitrary syntactic and semantic complexity.[1] It&#39;s almost ridiculous to call these features as they&#39;re just a consequence of the underlying language model. E.g. if you have expression blocks you have lambdas with multiple expressions with no extra work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a 50+ greybeard (literally) and here&#39;s my story: I once figured I could improve my chances of getting a job if I shave my beard. I knew I looked much younger without it, people would get my age wrong by some 10-15 years. And so my 6 months-long search for a job that time ended in success on the first interview after I shaved it. The first one! I remember the faces of the guys who hired me when they saw my personal data on some tax form that I filled later, after the contract was signed.Ageism in this industry is real. I think the root cause of it is investors, it&#39;s where the origins of this phenomenon are. They prefer younger entrepreneurs who in turn hire people like themselves, and so it propagates down the hierarchy as the company grows. It&#39;s transitive. In fact this is true for all types of discrimination.I switched to entrepreneurship and feel the same effects here. Good luck raising money or even finding a co-founder. It&#39;s tough. Not going to shave my beard though.I have no idea what could be done here other than for the aging tech people to unite and form their own companies, investment funds. Just like the other discriminated groups do - women, then racial and other minorities.Edit: I should add, I was talking about a hands-on engineering job, not management. I love coding and not going to quit it because of ageism or pay or other circumstances."</p>

The &#34;grey beards&#34; I&#39;ve worked with have all been incredibly technically proficient and a joy to work with.The skill and ability and depth of experience held by my older coworkers makes me grateful to have the opportunity to work with and learn from them.To any older individuals here still working in tech, please don&#39;t feel unwanted. Your experience is needed and appreciated, especially by the juniors who get to work with you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My thoughts: It keeps getting better and better.You stop reinventing wheels. You know where most of the holes are and
can laugh when the kids fall in them. You know the hype cycles and can
spot the fads and fashions. With 10 or 20 languages behind you, code
becomes separate and &#39;above&#39; languages, so you can think in structures
and abstract algorithms. Enjoy standing up for principles, you&#39;re the
man now, and there&#39;s not much left to &#34;look up to&#34; (especially in this
morally declining business). Not having something to prove means you
can know your limits, like when to quit trying to fix someone&#39;s &#34;poor
little thing with a broken wing&#34; that ain&#39;t ever gonna fly. You&#39;ve
time to read all four volumes of Knuth and really (almost)
understand. Also, you&#39;re not going to win that Turing award now, so
enjoy not having to try.Things to watch out for.Look after your eyesight and posture. Spend more time thinking about
code while out walking. Shout at clouds less because you realise that
dumb ideas will die of their own accord in good time. Enjoy the new
toys the kids make, even if they aren&#39;t &#34;production ready serious&#34; -
they will mature in time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The other Apple Silicon tidbit today from Linus Torvalds in his Linux 5.19 release notes:&gt;On a personal note, the most interesting part here is that I did the
release (and am writing this) on an arm64 laptop. It&#39;s something I&#39;ve
been waiting for for a _loong_ time, and it&#39;s finally reality, thanks
to the Asahi team. We&#39;ve had arm64 hardware around running Linux for a
long time, but none of it has really been usable as a development
platform until now.Not that I&#39;ve used it for any real work, I literally have only been
doing test builds and boots and now the actual release tagging. But
I&#39;m trying to make sure that the next time I travel, I can travel with
this as a laptop and finally dogfooding the arm64 side too.https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wgrz5BBk=rCz7W28Fj_o02s0X..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Part of why it is so difficult is that these C-level executives have mastered the art of sounding good with minimal set of accomplishments. Sometimes I listen to these presentations and it feels like a solid story and presentation, but there is nothing behind their rodeo when you sit back and dig deeper. A fucking mirage.It&#39;s not the person who does excellent work that gets promoted or climb up the corporate ladder, but the person who knows how to sell their work, as sad as this is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s because you shouldn&#39;t hire them but you should grow them internally. Outside hires for executive positions are usually a great way to de-stabilize your company, early hires tend to be loyal to the founders and if you then hire some &#39;suit&#39; to sit between them and you you risk them breaking off.So the solution to this problem is to ensure that your early hires are all top notch with the potential to eventually build out to become your C-suite, and to treat them as generously as you can when it comes to equity.And if you&#39;re really smart you stick to that mantra: hire quality over quantity, it will allow you to push back the typical organizational struggles until you&#39;ve achieved an order of magnitude or more in revenues (assuming product market fit)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked for a large, late stage, Softbank backed company. They brought in some C-suite execs while I was there. A CTO paid several million annually with large, public company experience. They were totally clueless, and the engineering org was almost revolting within 6 months, trying to stage a coup to the CEO. No technical experience, no leadership, installing cronies, speaking in opaque platitudes.I&#39;m not angry about it, though they did oversee us being on the cusp of a promising IPO to a pretty bad outcome that cost me a lot of money, but I&#39;ll say that any illusion that you have to be competent to be a C-suite exec, and any imposter syndrome I ever had, went out the window after that. Ironically it increased my personal confidence, if these idiots can do it I certainly can.I think the old saying &#34;nobody gets fired for buying IBM&#34; kinda applies to some execs maybe, like nobody gets fired for hiring some stellar resume exec with lots of experience, but they may get fired for taking a chance on an upstart."</p>
