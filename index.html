								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really think for the Oculus side of this, they should be on the hook for refunding a significant portion of the cost of the user&#39;s Oculus library when they ban the account.This would put the cost of a ban to Facebook for real users in the order of hundreds of dollars which is more than enough to have a support person do a realistic evaluation of the situation. It also reflects the non-recoverable portion of the cost to most users - you can sell the headset, but you can&#39;t transfer the value of the library to anybody. That is a straight up and very significant financial loss.While other aspects of the ban policy are obviously still very problematic, the fact that an arbitrary ban that is caused by actions outside the user&#39;s control can result in hundreds of dollars of losses sits at a whole different level and should be legally problematic for Facebook."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I want to start by pointing out I use two-factor authentication just about everywhere and Facebook is not an exception.I wish he&#39;d mention what kind of 2FA. The reason you _really_ should use U2F/WebAuthn is because it does origin binding which, unlike entering a TOTP, a code from your hardware token/authenticator app on your phone/SMS/etc is not phishable, i.e. you can&#39;t enter it by accident on accounts.google.com.totallylegit.ru and then have them enter it on real accounts.google.com. This is so because the U2F/WebAuthn security key signs a request, sent by your browser, which embeds the requesting page&#39;s domain, so a signature on attacker.com will not pass victim.com&#39;s verification checks, whereas a code from your authentication app is trivially copied."</p>

It&#39;s handy to put on Linux/POSIX-based appliances like F5s, where the only prerequisites are Bash, cURL, and OpenSSL (and standard Unix tools like sed, grep, etc):* https://devcentral.f5.com/s/articles/lets-encrypt-on-a-big-i...* https://github.com/EquateTechnologies/dehydrated-bigip-ansib..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can this one provide wildcard certificates without having to update DNS entries every three months?That is the one pain point I have with Let&#39;s Encrypt.PS: Yes, you can automate the DNS updates. That is the paintpoint I am talking about. It is one more moving part. One more dependency on a third party. One more thing to set up. One more thing that can break. One more thing that will rot (APIs always change at some point in time).Many people seem to solve the &#34;automate DNS&#34; by putting their DNS credentials on the server which serves their website. This is the worst thing from a security perspective. Now someone who breaks into your application can take over your DNS, point your domain to wherever they like and get any certificate for it they like. This probably enables them to also overtake your email and then escalate further from there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seen this thread going around, but it seems like it skips over the important bit.&gt; So why the rule changes? Because last December the New York Times published an opinion piece by Nick Kristof caller “The Children of Pornhub” that accused the site and its parent company of profiting off revenge porn, child porn and sex trafficking.How do you get from &#39;opinion piece in a newspaper&#39; to &#39;gigantic transnational financial infrastructure company changes its rules&#39;? In my experience, huge companies do not make changes like this purely on the basis of newspaper columns.Was there legal advice? Political pressure? Regulatory pressure? All of those would be much more material than a piece in a newspaper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At least this explains why normal porn sites keep living on perfectly well using MasterCard and Visa. They already have to follow regulatory requirements to demonstrate they are complying with age and consent laws, each video includes a front-matter frame saying where you can get the documentation of their compliance, and many include behind-the-scenes extra content showing all of the performers presenting government-issued IDs and signing consent forms.This brings this conflict out of the realm of adult entertainment and into a broader conflict between incumbent central providers that are held to regulatory standards and apps providing a platform for individual contractors that don&#39;t follow those requirements. It&#39;s in the same field as people arguing AirBNB is only able to exist because it&#39;s allowing people to operate hotels without having to comply with hotel regulations, and Uber allows people to operate taxi services without complying with taxi regulations. OnlyFans was giving individuals a way to produce adult films without having to comply with adult film regulations related to age and consent verification of the performers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aren&#39;t the payment processors not abusing their dominant position, like what happened a decade ago with Wikileaks? At least at that time they had the excuse they were pressured by the US government. What&#39;s motivating them this time? Do we need some sort of liability safe-harbor for payment processors?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey everyone! I have a home server that runs some apps, and I&#39;ve been installing them directly, but they kept breaking on every update. I wanted to Dockerize them, but I needed something that would manage all the containers without me having to ever log into the machine.This also worked very well for work, where we have some simple services and scripts that run constantly on a micro AWS server. It&#39;s made deployments completely automated and works really well, and now people can deploy their own services just by adding a line to a config instead of having to learn a whole complicated system or SSH in and make changes manually.I thought I&#39;d share this with you, in case it was useful to you too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been knee deep in deployment space for post 4 years. It is pretty hard problem to solve to the n-th level. Here&#39;s my 2 cents.Single machine deployments are generally easy, you can do it DIY. The complexity arises the moment you have another machine in the setup, scheduling workloading, networking, setup to name a few, starts becoming complicated.From my perspective, kubernetes was designed for multiple team, working on multiple services and jobs, making operation kind of self serviced. So I can understand the anti-kubernetes sentiment.There is gap in the market between VM oriented simple deployments and kubernetes based setup."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My anti-kubernetes setup for small single servers is docker swarm, portainer &amp; traefik. It&#39;s a setup that works well on low powered machines, gives you TLS (letsencrypt) and traefik takes care of the complicated network routing.I created a shell script to easily set this up: https://github.com/badsyntax/docker-box"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built a small Go web app to do some security testing. When a user registers for an account, I generate a 128-bit secure token and email it to the address they provided (as a URL). Token URLs look like this:/validate/email/1d00a5c2648c211befd33f5a8a7cbfabThe token is cryptographically strong and disappears after access. It can&#39;t be guessed and no one but the email account holder should click it, but I am seeing the URL accessed multiple times from multiple IPs, so I investigated.Turns out, if the user provides a Gmail or Gsuite email account during registration, Google clicks the link. I was curious if others on HN had encountered this and how they dealt with it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All URLs sent to any major email provider are &#34;clicked&#34; because they are scanning the page to see if it is phishing or otherwise malicious (desktop antivirus and other things will also prescan URLs). It also protects privacy by defeating click tracking on marketing emails.Google will also pre-load all the images in your email too.You shouldn&#39;t take any write action to your database just based on a URL being visited. Take them to the verification page and ask them to sign in or submit a form with the token pre-filled."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s about time. When I learned that applications like YNAB (You Need A Budget) use services like Plaid to connect to my bank account, and that these services literally take my username and password and impersonate me to get my banking data, I was a little sketched out. I use YNAB every day, and having it connected to my bank account is incredibly useful, but if something goes wrong and Plaid loses my money somehow, is there any recourse?Hopefully individuals will be able to use the Open Banking APIs to access their own data directly, but it looks like accreditation will be required, so probably not.Here&#39;s the full text of the report: https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/consult..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a developer living in a country that has fully implemented &#34;Open Banking&#34;, here&#39;s a quick setting of expectations for Canadian developers so they don&#39;t get too excited as I did when this was first being introduced.Open Banking is not, in fact, open in almost any sense of the world. It is standardised and the standards are freely available (&#34;open&#34;), but other than that, you still need to have an official &#34;blessing&#34; to actually access a production API endpoint (even for your own account), you need a legal entity that has some highly specific and entirely meaningless certificates that are hard (and potentially expensive) to get and even after all of that, you&#39;ll still need to negotiate access with each bank individually.What I imagined when I first heard of &#34;Open Banking&#34; was a public OAuth2 endpoint where I can grant my custom script access to just my bank balance and transaction history (possibly with a change webhook) and have it update my finance tracking database.The &#34;open&#34; part is only relevant to the banks, since they don&#39;t have to pay royalties for the standard implementing the APIs. For the rest of us, it might as well be SS7."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This may be driven by TD&#39;s suit against PlaidFrom this source https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=8f56092c-ab40...&#34;Users have complained that after connecting their bank accounts, Plaid stores their credentials and uses them to collect 5 years’ of transactional data and continues to track users’ data in future. Users further claim that the data-gathering scheme is not incidental to Plaid’s business model and is, in fact, its “very purpose.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went from being a quite a bad procrastinator to making quite strong progress in running and learning the piano. One of the secrets was setting specific times to do these things such that I can&#39;t wriggle out. For example I run on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings rather than the more vague &#34;three times a week&#34; which gives wiggle room on a given day. I also set modest goals of two 5ks and one longer run (up to 10k). For piano, I aim for twenty minutes a night minimum, five nights a week minimum after dinner (week nights but sometimes I have to be flexible and drop a weeknight and do a weekend). I won&#39;t be an Olympic runner or Mozart but I&#39;m heck of a lot fitter and better at the piano after a surprisingly short amount of time.My &#39;secrets&#39; are rather boring; schedule specific times, keep it achievable and don&#39;t overdo it in the early days. Little and often works wonders and you build the ritual / habit that way. You can then scale the frequency and length of time per session accordingly.Strangely, having kids made me much better at this too. When I had loads of free time I wasted a lot more of it. Now my free time is very limited, it&#39;s much more precious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A major technique mentioned by the author is omitted from the article’s headline: co-working. She writes about benefitting greatly from logging on to a muted Zoom room with hundreds of other people to work at a set time. It’s interesting how this is effective for some people; for another anecdote, blogger Alexey Guzey wrote about a similar system [0] with a smaller group.Psychiatrist Dr. David Burns writes at length about more techniques on addressing procrastination (called “do-nothingism”). He has a chapter on the subject in his book “Feeling Good,” and he wrote a similar passage online in an article for his podcast [1]. The methods he writes about that work best for me have been breaking down tasks into sequence of simple steps. This helps greatly for straightforward tasks, though it is less effective for difficult tasks that involve uncertainty and learning. These harder tasks require persistence and preferably time.Separately, a personal technique I use is to really sell myself on the value of completing a task. The phrase, “discipline matters more than getting motivated” is thrown around a lot on the web, and though it has merit, I find motivation crucial to sustaining projects in the long-term (and also figuring out when it’s worthwhile to exit from a method or approach).[0] https://guzey.com/co-working/[1] https://feelinggood.com/2017/09/18/053-ask-david-i-dont-feel..."</p>
