								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is very nice!For reasoning about tree-based data such as HTML, I also highly recommend the declarative programming language Prolog. HTML documents map naturally to Prolog terms and can be readily reasoned about with built-in language mechanisms. For instance, here is the sample query from the htmlq README, fetching all elements with id get-help from https://www.rust-lang.org, using Scryer Prolog and its SGML and HTTP libraries in combination with the XPath-inspired query language from library(xpath):    ?- http_open(&#34;https://www.rust-lang.org&#34;, Stream, []),
       load_html(stream(Stream), DOM, []),
       xpath(DOM, //(*(@id=&#34;get-help&#34;)), E).

Yielding:       E = element(div,[class=&#34;flex flex-colum ...&#34;,id=&#34;get-help&#34;],[&#34;\n        &#34;,element(h4,[],[&#34;Get help!&#34;]),&#34;\n        &#34;,element(ul,[],[&#34;\n       ...&#34;,element(li,[],[element(a,[... = ...],[...])]),&#34;\n   ...&#34;,element(li,[],[...]),...|...]),&#34;\n        ...&#34;,element(div,[class=&#34;la ...&#34;],[&#34;\n   ...&#34;,element(label,[...],[...]),...|...]),&#34;\n    ...&#34;])
    ;  false.

The selector //(*(@id=&#34;get-help&#34;)) is used to obtain all HTML elements whose id attribute is get-help. On backtracking, all solutions are reported.The other example from the README, extracting all links from the page, can be obtained with Scryer Prolog like this:    ?- http_open(&#34;https://www.rust-lang.org&#34;, Stream, []),
       load_html(stream(Stream), DOM, []),
       xpath(DOM, //a(@href), Link),
       portray_clause(Link),
       false.

This query uses forced backtracking to write all links on standard output, yielding:    &#34;/&#34;.
    &#34;/tools/install&#34;.
    &#34;/learn&#34;.
    &#34;https://play.rust-lang.org/&#34;.
    &#34;/tools&#34;.
    &#34;/governance&#34;.
    &#34;/community&#34;.
    &#34;https://blog.rust-lang.org/&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Once upon a time I was using pup[0] for such thing as well as later I changed to cascadia[1] which seemed much more advanced.Comparing the two repos, it seems pup is dead, but cascadia may not be.These tools, including htmlq, seem to sell themselves as &#34;jq for html&#34;, which is far from the truth. Jq is closer to the awk where you can do just about everything with json. Cascadia, htmlq, and pup seem closer to grep for html. They can essentially only select data from a html source.[0] https://github.com/EricChiang/pup

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello, I’m Cameron and one of the two people working on the Bonsai web browser.We’re focused on making a web browser for programmers to improve their workflow. It helps you look up docs and search information. You can toggle it on with a hotkey and it can overlay on your IDE. Tabs are grouped by domain for easy organization. The history data structure is a tree which shows how pages are back-linked to each other and to spatial workspaces. Both open tabs and pages in your workspaces are just pointers to a node in your history tree!You can watch a 2 minute video walkthrough here https://www.loom.com/share/93c7c0012f514c37b58a42fa65badc88 or download it from our websiteHow did we end up here?Initially we wanted to make a citation manager because myself and a friend had an unconnected workflow moving research articles from Chrome -&gt; Zotero -&gt; Emacs org-mode. After talking to some other PhDs/postdocs the takeaway was that everyone has very different ways of doing research. This would mean that it would be impossible to make a citation manager that everyone would want to use.Later, a friend in industry mentioned that he had a hard time finding ‘cloud documents’ as part of his job. We then considered making a spotlight application to find and organize these documents. It turns out that this already been done and it seems that people actually just pull up their documents once at the beginning of the day anyway.We now think that the main problem is that web browsers are actually not currently suited for doing research. The current mixing of research type browsing with web-documents creates a mess and makes people think they want a ‘cloud file search’.What’s different?Instead of an add-on solution to Chrome which would create more noise, we are creating a fully functioning, organized way of managing information overload and keeping you on task as you go through your work day.What’s next?We are fixing up our Linux and Windows versions for public use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love it, this is the most innovative thing in the browser space for a long while. It&#39;s baffling to me how boring most &#39;new&#39; browsers are - most propositions are &#39;like X but with less friction on these 2 or 3 things&#39;.I hate that it&#39;s only for Mac so far, but glad to see others are on the way. I&#39;ve been thinking about picking up a cheap older mac for development work, though, and this is one more reason in favor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks really great, something I could use and would pay for when polished but there&#39;s definitely a few issues for me at the moment:* Why go fullscreen and modal? I want to drag in links from docs, email, other browsers, have it side by side while reading PDFs etc. etc. this stops me from doing any of that* Please let me change the shortcut! I already have Option-Space bound.* Let me put the browser window anywhere I want when it&#39;s in the single page non-fullscreen mode, don&#39;t levitate it to where you think I want it* Unless I&#39;m missing something the process of opening a page then adding it to a workspace seems to be three clicks - open page, hit + (plus) button, select workspace, select workspace/inbox - need to make this one click, maybe just show the inboxes? This also seems clunky, I&#39;d much rather browse, drag that page to the workspace/inbox, continue browsing and adding further pages, then arrange all the pages in the workspace after i&#39;ve added all the links. Seems a faster workflow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Be careful when companies market themselves as Swiss or that due to them being located in Switzerland means there is some extra layer of security or privacy.Sure, it&#39;s a more stable country than many other countries in the world, but not much different from most EU countries for example. And privacy wise there is no difference.Be also aware of the fact that many companies market themselves as Swiss, but all it means is they have a head office in Switzerland due to tax reasons. In one example, it&#39;s a cloud storage company, they say on their marketing page and their about page that they are based in Switzerland and under Swiss law, but if you look at the legal pages the company you sign up with are actually based in Bulgaria. Their servers are based in Texas, USA and Luxemburg, Europe and their development team in Bulgaria."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ProtonMail guys always said that unless they were 20 miles  from the littoral, in the sea side, they had to abide by national laws. So it was bound to happen.What makes me sad is how flimsy their entire premise (not necessarily &#34;promise&#34;) turned out to be: all it took was some minor rascal in France to hug the wrong tree (so to speak), and ProtonMail is in the open saying they can&#39;t even protect the IP address of their customers. From there, all it takes is for somebody to change a law in Switzerland and end-to-end encryption of the messages themselves will only be &#34;by default.&#34;I think there is a market for datacenters in open seas."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The expectation that Proton would be able to disobey the legal requests of their local authorities with impunity is unrealistic. Protonmail makes certain claims about privacy, particularly about encryption. They don&#39;t make any claims that they have the intention, or ability for that matter, to defy local authorities at their peril. Like Grugq said in one of his presentations (paraphrased): &#34;Don&#39;t expect your VPN company to do your jail time for you&#34;. I&#39;m neither for nor against Protonmail. I don&#39;t think they&#39;ve been dishonest. I think people have an unrealistic expectation of the service they offer. They offer additional privacy, not legal indemnity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I run an Alexa top-2000 website.  (Mangadex is presently at about 6000.)  I spend less than $250 a month.I have loads and loads of thoughts about what they could be doing differently to reduce their costs but I&#39;ll just say that the number one thing Mangadex could be doing right now from a cursory glance is to reduce the number of requests.  A fresh load of the home page generates over 100 requests.  (Mostly images, then javascript fragments.)  Mangadex apparently gets over 100 million requests per day.  My site - despite ostensibly having more traffic - gets fewer than half that many in a month.  (And yes, it&#39;s image-heavy.)A couple easy wins would be to reduce the number of images loaded on the front page.  (Does the &#34;Seasonal&#34; slider really need 30 images, or would 5 and a link to the &#34;seasonal&#34; page be enough?  Same thing with &#34;Recently Added&#34; and the numbers of images on pages in general.)  The biggest win would probably be reducing the number of javascript requests.  Somehow people seem to think there&#39;s some merit to loading javascript which subsequently loads additional javascript.  This adds a tremendous amount of latency to your page load and generates needless network traffic.  Each request has a tremendous amount of overhead - particularly for dynamically-generated javascript.  It&#39;s much better to load all of the javascript you need in a single request or a small handful of requests.  Unfortunately, this is probably a huge lift for a site already designed in this way, but the improved loading time would be a big UX win.Anyway - best of luck to MangaDex!  They&#39;ve clearly put a lot of thought into this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve done things at scale (5-10K req/s) on a budget ($1000 USD) and I&#39;ve done things at much smaller scales that required a much larger budget._How_ you hit scale on a budget is one part of the equation. The other part is: what you&#39;re doing.Off the top of my head, the &#34;how&#34; will often involve the following (just to list a few):1 - Baremetal2 - Cache3 - Denormalize4 - Append-only5 - Shard6 - Performance focused clients/api7 - Async / background everythingThese strategies work _really_ well for catalog-type systems: amazon.com, wiki, shopify, spotify, stackoverflow. The list is virtually endless.But it doesn&#39;t take much more complexity for it to become more difficult/expensive.Twitter&#39;s a good example. Forget twitter-scale, just imagine you&#39;ve outgrown what 1 single DB server can do, how do you scale? You can&#39;t shard on the `author_id` because the hot path isn&#39;t &#34;get all my tweets&#34;, the hot path is &#34;get all the tweets of the people I follow&#34;. If you shard on `author_id`, you now need to visit N shards. To optimize the hot path, you need to duplicate tweets into each &#34;recipient&#34; shard so that you can do: &#34;select tweet from tweets where recipient_id = $1 order by created desc limit 50&#34;. But this duplication is never going to be cheap (to compute or store).(At twitter&#39;s scale, even though it&#39;s a simple graph, you have the case of people with millions of followers which probably need special handling. I assume this involves a server-side merge of &#34;tweets from normal people&#34; &amp; RAM[&#34;tweets from the popular people&#34;].)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many manga fans have a love/hate relationship with mangadex. On one hand, it&#39;s provided hosting for countless hours of entertainment over the years. Their &#34;v3&#34; version of the site was basically perfect from a usability point of view, to the point that the entire community chose to unite itself under its flag.On the other hand, directly because of the above, their hasty self-inflicted take down earlier this year nearly killed the entire hobby. Many series essentially stopped updating for the ~5 months the site was down, and many more are likely never coming back again.The decision to suddenly take the site down for a full site rewrite feels completely inexplicable from the outside. (A writeup the above or the previous one[1], both of which read like they were written by a Google Product Manager, especially don&#39;t help as they conspicuously avoid any comment to the one question on everyone&#39;s mind: &#34;leaving aside the supposed security issues with the backend, why on earth also rewrite and redesign the entire front end from scratch at the same time?&#34;)[1] https://mangadex.dev/why-rebuild/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I launched my former bitcoin casino in 2011 (it&#39;s gone, but it was a casino where all games, even roulette tables were multiplayer, on a platform built from scratch starting in &#39;08), I handled all web requests through a server in Costa Rica that cost about $6/mo. Where I had a shell corporation for $250/year. Once the front end -- the bullet containing the entire casino code, about 250kb -- loaded, from Costa Rica, and once a user logged in, they were socketed to a server that handled the gaming action in the Isle of Man. Graphics and sounds were still sent from the Costa Rica server. I didn&#39;t have a gaming license in the IoM, though - that was around $400k to acquire legally. So I found a former IoM MP who was a lawyer, who wrote a letter to the IoM gov&#39;t stating that we didn&#39;t perform random calculations on their server, thus weren&#39;t a gambling site under IoM law. Technically that meant that no dice roll or card shuffle leading to a gambling win or loss took place on that server. So the IoM server handled the socketed user interactions, chat, hand rotation and tournament stuff. Also the bitcoin daemon and deposits/withdrawals. But to avoid casino licensing, I then  set up a VPS in Switzerland that did only one thing: Return random numbers or shuffled decks of cards, with its own RNG. It was a quick backend cUrl call that would return a fresh deck or a dice roll, for any given random interaction on the casino servers. The IoM server would call the Swiss server every time a hand was dealt or a wheel was spun; the user was still looking at a site served from a cheap web host in Costa Rica. And thus... yeah, I guess I handled millions of requests a day over a $6 webserver, if you want to count it that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People tend to severely underestimate how fast modern machines are and overestimate how much you need to spend on hardware.Back in my last startup, I was doing a crypto market intelligence website that subscribed to full trade &amp; order book feeds from the top 10 exchanges.  It handled about 3K incoming messages/second (~260M per day), including all of the message parsing, order book update, processing, streaming to websocket connections on any connected client, and archival to PostGres for historical processing.  Total hardware required was 1 m4.large + 1 r5.large AWS instances, for a bit under $200/month, and the boxes would regularly run at about 50% CPU."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s the point of this post? OP is serving a file at 50req/sec. There is not even mention of a dB query. How is that able to relate to any kind of normal app?I guess that the post was written as an answer to the mangadex post [1]. Mangadex was handling 3k req/sec involving dB queries. It was not just a cached Html page.50req/sec for a Html file is super low which shows that a $4 month server cant do much actually. So yes this is enough for a blog, but a lot of websites are not blogs[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28440742"</p>

The tech and VC crowd seemed to get off on the size of a funding round, or how tight they were with the founders of Atlassian, or if they knew some guy from America with a “successful exit,” or other complete nonsense.With a dynamic like that, the law enforcement people are always going to point to the tech and venture people and say to politicians, “are you going to take orders from these clowns, or are you going to listen to us?” And now that you’ve got the climate activists antagonizing the mining companies, who are responsible for a very significant percentage of the economy, you’ve got two extremely savvy and powerful groups working together.If Australian tech people want their government to take them seriously, they’re going to have to act in a manner that is as professional as those at the AFP, and they’re going to have to hit people with an economic hammer that can match the force of mining. Yes, it’s not fair that things are this difficult, but that’s life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Linux Experiment is probably my favourite linux-focussed YouTube channel. Nick has been doing absolutely fantastic work and his channel being permanently deleted would be an absolute travesty and a clear mistake. He is producing high quality, thoughtful, inoffensive content. Here&#39;s to hoping the channel is rightly reinstated ASAP, along with an apology and explanation from Google.Also, if you don&#39;t know the channel and want to check out his videos, you can still watch them on Odysee - https://odysee.com/@TheLinuxExperiment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It appears to have been banned when the author offered an illegal sweepstakes.Contests and sweepstakes are carefully regulated in America, with slightly different regimes in all 50 states.  You should not run one unless you have gotten legal help with it!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of the 2019 Canadian federal election. There was a new party in that election led by a man named Maxime Bernier called the People&#39;s Party. They&#39;re a far-right populist party and generally awful. Bernier himself was running in Beauce, Quebec, which he had represented through the Conservative party since 2006 before he had created the People&#39;s Party.But then the Rhinoceros Party, a satirical political party, announced a new candidate for Beauce named... Maxime Bernier. When asked about the confusion, the Rhinoceros Party&#39;s Maxime Bernier said, &#34;If you&#39;re not sure, then vote for both!&#34;.https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/maxime-bernier-rhino...The Conservative candidate won with 22817 votes, the People&#39;s Party candidate came second with 16772, and the Rhinoceros Party candidate came last with 1072 votes and another 1147 were rejected. This left the People&#39;s Party with no seats in parliament."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Young men get little help, in part, because schools are focused on encouraging historically underrepresented students. Jerlando Jackson, department chair, Education Leadership and Policy Analysis, at the University of Wisconsin’s School of Education, said few campuses have been willing to spend limited funds on male underachievement that would also benefit white men, risking criticism for assisting those who have historically held the biggest educational advantages.”So this is a direct result of the move away from color blind policies, to race based policies.&gt; Keith E. Smith, a mental-health counselor and men’s outreach coordinator at the University of Vermont, said that when he started working at the school in 2006 he found that men were much more likely to face consequences for the trouble they caused under the influence of drugs and alcohol.This is exactly what black students report as racism in school.Seems like evidence that race based policies are just racist.&gt; In 2008, Mr. Smith proposed a men’s center to help male students succeed. The proposal drew criticism from women who asked, “Why would you give more resources to the most privileged group on campus,” he said.
Funding wasn’t appropriated, he said, and the center was never built.Obviously white men are not in fact privileged on university campuses.“Female students in the U.S. benefit from a support system established decades ago, spanning a period when women struggled to gain a foothold on college campuses. There are more than 500 women’s centers at schools nationwide. Most centers host clubs and organizations that work to help female students succeed.”Men are failing because it is the policy not to support them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of this is driven by narratives—A narrative that college isn’t worth it anymore. A narrative that (white) men are uniformly privileged and life is just easy for them. And a narrative that those men aren’t wanted by society any more.I’m not convinced that all those men need to go to college, but they clearly need something. They need to feel like they’re part of society. Nothing good can come of an entire generation that feels lost, without purpose, and unwanted."</p>
