								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow very comprehensive &amp; well done.If mechanical watches tickle your fancy, there is a ton of watch repair video on YT. I particularly enjoy wristwatch revival (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCD80T1s2Za4K682CQDGwEKQ).A warning though, if you consider to get into that hobby. I tried, it&#39;s really hard, expensive (I spend close to €1k and that is with b-quality stuff. Good stuff is 5-10x more expensive.) and can be rather frustrating. Finding parts to buy can be complicated depending on your locale, loosing parts is very easy and destroying parts, even when gentle and careful is par for the course.I hat to put my repair hobby on halt after running out of practice pieces. All now have broken or missing parts. your milage may vary ofcourse :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tailscale has a fantastic product, I’ve been extremely happy from day one. If you’re waiting for a weekend to have a few hours to try out Tailscale, don’t, it takes 15 minutes to get every device you own up and running and talking. This is the lowest friction personal VPN to ever exist, and once you see how easy it is for your own devices, you’ll wish you had it at work.The biggest risk that this company has is that Cloudflare  (in all reality) should just buy them or reimplement it. It’s the type of product cloudflare would make, that’s for sure. Being based on open source wireguard, and being just a STUN/TURN server at its core… I’m sure that Tailscale will be the first but maybe not the best.I’ve been dreaming lately of a tor-like network that’s based loosely on the idea of tailnets. Rather than blockchain bullshit, you’d have a direct ring of trust with friends, and then you could set up access policies to forward packets for people you don’t trust, but who know someone you do trust.Web3 happens when people can host stuff on their phones, and Tailscale is something that lets you host things on your phone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With such a huge investment comes the obligation to eventually pay it back. Is this another one of my favourite tools going the way of Dropbox, 1Password and all other companies that were formed around what should be a platform feature, which took on way too large investment sums and were eventually forced to become the everything, losing sight of their core values?I sincerely hope not, but there&#39;s so much bad precedent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone else who wonders wtf tailscale is:&gt; Tailscale is a VPN service that makes the devices and applications you own accessible anywhere in the world, securely and effortlessly. It enables encrypted point-to-point connections using the open source WireGuard protocol, which means only devices on your private network can communicate with each other.It seems to take care of key distribution, nat-traversal, authentication etc etcNeat! No sure how that is &#39;fixing internet&#39; exactly, but really cool anyway"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My main goal is to replace cloud services so I can be Google-free.  I&#39;ve also got LineageOS + MicroG on my phone.  This is all running in docker containers on NixOS (other than OPNSense), with automated restic backups to a NAS as well as Backblaze. One of my goals is to be able to deploy all this again from scratch with minimal effort, and I think I succeeded, though haven&#39;t had to test it yet.Nextcloud - for caldav and carddav calendar, contacts, and tasksXbrowsersync - sync bookmarks across deviceSynchthing - backup data from my phone. I use Neo Backup to take a snapshot of all apps, so the phone should theoretically be restorable from scratch.Jellyfin - Spotify replacement. The Finamp app is fantastic.Home Assistant - automate my media center, as well as control outdoor lights and door locks, and check if any doors or windows are open or unlocked when I&#39;m away.OPNSense on a protectli box - amazing open source gateway software that does everything.AdGuard Home (on OPNSense) - DNS based ad blockingWireguard (on OPNSense) - allows me to have an always on partial tunnel VPN on my phone and laptops that allows access to home services while remote, and also allows me to use my Ad Guard DNS.HAProxy + LetsEncrypt (on OPNSense) - setup to provide subdomains for each of the services at home. Only a couple are public (contacts and calendar), but the rest become available when the VPN is on.Smokeping - use it to collect data to rub into Spectrums face when they go down.Pintry - Pinterest clone"</p>

Literally everything can be achieved via portainer.example.com in this setup.I just recently made my setup public so here&#39;s the repo if you&#39;re interested. https://github.com/tomwojcik/homeserver-traefik-portainer"</p>

  When Sam Littlewood designed BRender, he didn’t write the code. And then document it.  
  The way most things were built at the time.
  First, he wrote the manual.  The full documentation
  That served as the spec.  Then the coding started."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve managed to get it to build about half way;1. In linux2. Install wine 7.5 (other versions may work, this is what I used)3. Create a 32-bit wineprefix on a *case-insensitive* ext4 drive (https://www.collabora.com/news-and-blog/blog/2020/08/27/usin...)4. Download MSVC 2.0 (https://winworldpc.com/product/visual-c/2x), extract and install it into the 32-bit wineprefix

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is awesome on so many levels.   The bottom part of the read me says Jez San of Argonaut agreed to MIT the BRender part of it.Argonaut rang a bell, and sure enough - Jez developed Starglider, one of my all time favourite games on the Amiga.I can still remember it today, nearly four decades later: It was the first time I visited a new friend, who was the first in our neighbourhood to get the Amiga. He fired up Starglider- and I was simply blown away.My C64 didn&#39;t cut it anymore - I just had to get the Amiga. An involvement in the Norwegian demo scene followed. This later had a big impact on my career as a SWE; thanks very much for this, Jez, if you&#39;re here!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent over 9 years at Google. Got promoted 3 times. Was a manager.Google is absolutely bonkers when it comes to promotions. At every opportunity to provide feedback towards upper management, I had one consistent refrain:Everyone needs to chill the f### out.The stakes (seem) too high. The amount of time invested is too high. The amount of discussion, rehashing, tinkering, rejiggering, and calibration is just too high. It&#39;s off the charts how obsessed seemingly everyone is about it. It&#39;s off the charts how much company time was blown on it and psychological stress people were subjected to. IMHO, the process at Google doesn&#39;t need to be readjusted or tinkered with, but somehow de-escalated; like it needs to not be such a huge f&#39;ing deal.One positive development ~5 years ago is that promotion to levels L5 and below were mostly moved out of the IC&#39;s hands and into their manager&#39;s. Despite being a manager at the time (and creating more work for me), I thought this was great. It reduced the bias in the system from ICs writing up their own packets, which disadvantaged poor writers and poor self-promoters less. It got employees thinking less about promotion, since there was less they could control or do. There were other biases that crept up, but it helps the psychology of day-to-day life to not be stressing over the frantic ladder climb."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It gets worse than promo-driven development.Recently we had a chat with a lead from another team. Their product has a lot of similarities with ours so we sync up every now and then to bounce ideas off each other. They recently release a big change that we thought didn&#39;t provide much value, so we asked him about it.His candid answer was &#34;you know how it works, we have a service running in production, so we need to make changes&#34;. This sounds simple, but the implications are deep. Unlike individual engineers, moving entire teams around is difficult. If you have a team, you need to &#34;justify&#34; their existence. Is not enough to keep the lights on or slowly polish the product, you need grand roadmaps to keep yourself busy the next year or two. Ideally you want to justify that you need extra headcount to keep the product expanding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The other perverse incentive is that you will end up with engineers trying to extract as much value from other engineers as possible, because it becomes part of leveling up: how much you make other people deliver. Even as an IC.The other problem is that it becomes this game where nobody dares giving bad feedback to one another, because you know they could retaliate which could damage your chances to get a promotion. Everybody becomes &#34;fake friend&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Decades ago, in the days before uber, my employer would fly in candidates from college campuses as part of an onsite interview. The candidate would fly in the night before and we relied on a taxi service to bring the candidate to the hotel. Then in the morning the same service would bring them to the onsite and of course bring them back to the airport at the end. It was a whole curated process.Little did the candidate know - we knew the driver quite well and he knew many people in the firm. More than once there would be a candidate who thought they could be rude and disrespectful to the taxi driver because ... you know... its just an immigrant taxi driver with a distinctive accent. Oops! Cost them an offer. But just as well. Avoided some arrogant jerks in the process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I interviewed at Google in 2006, one of the interviewers asked me to write code for solving a particular problem.  I replied along the lines of &#34;ok I need to think about this, it&#39;s not obvious how to solve it&#34; and started thinking.  Time ticked away.  Five minutes.  Ten minutes.  Fifteen minutes.  The interviewer started reminding me that he needed me to write some code and if there wasn&#39;t anything for him to copy down into his interview notes I wasn&#39;t going to pass the interview.  (Why interviewers were all transcribing the whiteboard rather than taking photos I have no clue.)Eventually I ran out of time, having written no code on the whiteboard.  I asked my interviewer &#34;ok so what is the algorithm for solving this&#34; and he admitted that he had no idea.At the time, I thought he just meant that he had no idea what the solution was; but in hindsight I wonder if the real test was to see if I would crumble under pressure and write code I knew didn&#39;t work.(I got a job offer, but turned it down to start Tarsnap instead.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I interviewed with AWS, half the loop interviews were with remote staff.  I was shown to a videoconferencing room and asked to wait.  There was a pile of VC equipment but it wasn&#39;t connected.  With five minutes before we were due to start, I decided this was part of the interview and plugged stuff in myself, powered it on, and clicked through some boot-time screens, guessing at the right inputs.  A few minutes later a call came in and the interviews themselves proceeded normally.To this day I still don&#39;t know if it was a test."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny thing is, making cities more green isn&#39;t even _that_ difficult. I see above conversations on living closer to nature, or mountains vs parks - but the vast majority of time spent is walking and driving in the cities. So it seems a no-brainer that before everything else, before thinking about taking a 2 hour drive to hike, or making the time for a weekly visit to the park, we should first make sure the places people actually walk through and live in every day are as green as possible.There is no one solution, of course, since at the very least climates and budgets can be wildly different, but a good start is making sure every street has a green canopy above, starting with the largest. After that, take every space you can and put something living on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the sort of thing I think about when the pro-urban/pro-density/anti-car people talk about their vision for the world. I live in a city now, and the lack of substantial nature is suffocating to the extent that I plan to move. The idea that we should all live this way to conserve space—a resource which is only scarce in these urban places—seems excessive to put it mildly.EDIT: A lot of urban folks are rebutting my “substantial nature” complaint with references to their city’s parks, which is amusingly illustrative of our differing perspectives. I was thinking “mountains and forests”, not just green spaces scattered amid the concrete.EDIT 2: A lot of urban folks are talking like the suburbs are swallowing up the countryside. I’m sure they’ve grown, but it’s still a big world out there people. I can’t recommend a cross-country road trip enough. Y’all need to leave your cities once in a while and see the world that you have such strong opinions about! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of the studies in the linked APA article have all the hallmarks of the replication crisis:- Small sample sizes (O(100))- Low correlation coefficients- Everybody is predisposed to believe the conclusion (what kind of monster doesn&#39;t like nature?)- There is zero incentive to report a negative findingAnd even if some of the studies do replicate, the response variable is often either self-reported, or performance on some written test or survey: so it&#39;s not really clear what we are even measuring. What is the unit of &#34;general connectedness&#34; ? How about &#34;eudaimonic well-being&#34; ? These are not legitimate scientific concepts.Nature is great. I find that a long walk in the woods is a good way to clear my head. But I&#39;m not convinced that these studies add anything to my common sense intuitions about the matter. And by using weak methods to justify something we all already believe (or want to believe), we risk degrading trust in science that will be greatly needed when scientists reach a conclusion that isn&#39;t politically convenient."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was surprised to see `$()` missing from this (otherwise quite extensive) list. There are a few commands listed which employ it, but it absolutely deserves its own entry.That and `readlink -f` to get the absolute path of a file. (Doesn&#39;t work on MacOS; the only substitute I&#39;ve found is to install `greadlink`.)And `cp -a`, which is like `cp -r`, but it leaves permissions intact - meaning that you can prepend `sudo` without the hassle of changing the ownership back.I never see `lndir` on these lists either. It makes a copy of a directory, but all of the non-directory files in the target are replaced with symlinks back to the source while directories are preserved as-is. Meaning that when you `cd` into it, you are actually landing in a copied structure of the source directory instead of the source directory itself, as would be the case if you just symlinked the source folder.Once inside, any file you want to modify without affecting the original just needs you to create the symlink into a file, which you can do with `sed -i &#39;&#39; $symlink`. There you have it: effectively a copy of your original directory, with only the modified files actually taking up space (loosely speaking).Looks like I have a few pull requests to submit."</p>

Watch out, that&#39;s a Linux-ism and macOS&#39;s sed will cheerfully use the thing after it as the backup expression; as far as I know, the absolute safest choice is to always specify a backup extension &#34;sed -i~&#34; or &#34;sed -i.bak&#34; to make it portable, although there are plenty of work-arounds trying to detect which is which and &#34;${SED_I} -e whatever&#34; type sillinessMy contribution (and yeah, I know, PR it ...) is that I get a lot of mileage out of setting the terminal title from my scripts:    title() { printf &#39;\033]0;%s\007&#39; &#34;$*&#34;; }

and there&#39;s one for tmux, too    printf &#39;\033]2;%s\007&#39; &#34;$*&#34;;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Easy to accomplish (at least for me). One word: Dog. I walk daily 90 minutes at least. There was a time (and another dog, but thats not the reason) where it was more like 120-200 minutes a day outside. I live in a fairly populated town in east Germany. We have a solid forest and lots of lakes around. Its great and like 20 years+ later I know most of them, but not all.My coworker and I worked like a year together at my place. He came around, we drank a coffee together and started working. Like 3-4 hours later, depending on schedule, we took a good 60 minutes+ walk with my dog. We talked project related things sometimes, but it felt never like &#34;we have to talk about work&#34;, We were kind of friends so we had lots of other topics. Then back at my place we continued for 2,3 or even 5 hours. We had no issues stopping after 2 hours, but did often way more. We were very productive.We were a good match, but those breaks outside enjoying life (forced by my habits to go at least 60minutes outside with the dog) helped a lot not burning out and making room in the brain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the anti-backpack mindset interesting, because I started urban walking after getting wilderness backpacking experience. I can&#39;t imagine walking around without a daypack, and I often bring it with me even when it&#39;s empty. On my morning commute today it held a Kindle, a spare set of headphones, and a plastic bag for when I buy more groceries than can fit in the pack. I&#39;m probably not going to use any of those before I get home, though.Backpacks are magic for longer trips. Food, water, coffee, all go in. Unsure about the weather? Layers layers layers, all in the pack. I also use LL Bean&#39;s PrimaLoft Packaway (I own two, one black and one orange), and have a shell for rainy/snowy weather. Unless it&#39;s both cold and rainy, one of the two goes in the backpack.I&#39;ve also never worried much about pocket preferences on my shorts and pants. I instead care about pockets on my packs. My current big pack is an Osprey Exos 58 (but the newer version doesn&#39;t have hip belt pockets or a shoulder strap pocket), and my daypack is an REI Flash 22 (with easily accessible side pockets, and a top pocket that you can reach with an awkward shoulder movement).Edit: The big floppy hat comment was absolutely spot-on"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After walking to and from work for 5 years along the same route, I found that I prefer walking without listening to anything on headphones.Just thinking increases awareness of my surroundings, allows me time to process existing thoughts as opposed to consuming more inputs, and connects me to the people I would inevitably see on a semi-regular basis.Personally, I have found that 1 hour + is a good threshold to aim for for some really quality thinking. After about an hour I&#39;ve already processed normal stuff about family or work and have moved on to deeper topics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The longevity of his employment is likely a result of the company&#39;s willingness to promote him instead of hiring externally, despite his start at the entry level. This is not likely to happen anymore, at least nowadays.From the article: &#34;After getting his first position as a shipping assistant, Walter showed outstanding skills and willingness to learn, always doing more than expected. [...] Shortly after, he was promoted to a position in sales. Then, he became a successful Sales Manager.&#34;I once spoke with a professional baker who started off as a machine operator for a bakery in his late teens, then earned promotion to become a production supervisor and then distribution manager. He then moved companies to become a plant manager, and later an operations director involved in baking formulation, until becoming an account manager (sales) for large baking firms.The commonality between these stories is that loyalty and hard work at a job has historically enabled people to earn a good quality of life. Nowadays, it intuitively seems like internal promotions from the very entry level are harder to come by, as many firms prefer to hire people with degrees for management or hire externally.Instead of promoting internally like in the past, I read and heard from managers they prefer to recruit externally for management positions. They perceive that internal candidates lack &#34;leadership qualities&#34; from past interactions with them, and/or perceive that they produce more value in their current positions. When asked how they account for these people changing jobs for promotions to lead elsewhere, the response was that they would say they understood the former employees&#39; positions and would wish them well (without openly reconsidering whether they were under-weighing the value of internal promotion)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s quite an achievement, and I&#39;m even more impressed he was able to do so in the textile industry that suffered so much in the mid-nineties in the region.Context: I&#39;m from the Itajaí Valley (where Brusque is located), which has a strong textile industry - one of the main drivers of the local economy. It used to be much stronger until the disastrous Collor government caused a number of them to go bankrupt or severely reduce their production due to some serious mismanagement of the Brazilian economy.Edit: His original employment contract can be found here (in Portuguese, a bit difficult to read): https://www.brusquememoria.com.br/acervo-imagem/2057"</p>
