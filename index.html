								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two feedback points:* Password field for creating new sends should be named differently, as by default Firefox autocompletion puts there my account&#39;s password there. Potentially should be exposed from OPTIONS panel. Alternatively it can be generated by default, and then once the message is created, will be shared to the creator - or stored in options menu of my sends* Missing an option to expire message after first opening. It&#39;s like a self destroyable notification that can be read only once. Why? For the instance if I share some confident information with someone that I know is going to open very soon, then once he/she opens the message it will be destroyed, so that if somebody accesses either my or my friend&#39;s machine, it will be impossible to read the secret message. Another aspect is that if my friend will try open the secret message, and it will show that message doesn&#39;t exist / was destoryed - then we know that message was compromised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A very interesting addition indeed to Bitwarden. I still personally prefer my own setup as I&#39;m guaranteed not to run any risks of being siloed but I&#39;ve started pointing others towards Bitwarden because of this and their strong commitment so far towards Open Source [0][0] https://github.com/bitwarden"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perfect timing. Just used this to send personal information across email. I still included the password in the email, but the expiry date means my personal data won&#39;t be collected through passive email logging. Also added max 2 read attempts: one for me test it, and another for the accountant.And of course, the accountant at my company still insists on passing personal information through email. Another example, Monese bank asking me to submit all sorts of pdf scans of personal documents to close an account with them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Charles Taylor, the philosopher, covered much of this about twenty years ago with far less snark and buzzwords. I strongly recommend reading The Ethics of Authenticity. It’s all about the trend of individualism and how it precedes social media by...centuries.https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674987692Social media is no longer authentic so you’re seeing a  slowly growing backlash against it.https://seoulphilosophy.wordpress.com/2015/06/19/charles-tay..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is the biggest takeaway for me:&gt; We saw this dynamic metastasize in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, when well-intentioned claims of “silence is violence” (recalling the powerful 1987 ACT-UP “Silence = Death” campaign) spiraled into calling out individuals with even a small following who hadn’t come forward with a timely public statement of solidarity or remorse. Yet public posts were subject to popular scrutiny and judged based on sincerity, originality, and tone. Not surprisingly, many people defaulted to posting a somber plain black square. But this generated criticism of its own by clogging the feed with an informational blackout during a moment when community resource sharing was critically important. Amid a chaotic time, the platform functioned exactly as designed: amplification of emotions, uptick in user interaction, growth in platform engagement and data cultivation. Cha-ching, the platform cashes in.In other words, any large movement or discussion on &#34;clearnet&#34; spaces gets subverted by the algorithms and profit motive of the platform they live on.However, where I disagree with the author is considering mainstream &#34;dark forest&#34; platforms like reddit or 4chan to be countercultural. In fact, I&#39;d argue that mainstream social media can never be countercultural. While there may be no &#34;algorithm&#34; controlling the narrative you see on 4chan (or a straightforward and ostensibly fair one on a site like reddit), the content you see (and by extension, the narrative) is shaped by profit motive: From well-compensated marketing teams, to hordes of self-interested proselytizers (see: bitcoin), to propaganda teams looking to influence public opinion, mainstream dark forest sites simply shift the balance of power from the platform itself to the most motivated and well-funded members of the platform"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You can&#39;t censor it away completely, but you can help the redeemable extremists __know__ they&#39;re indulging in extremism by forcing them to go to fringe websites rather than allow them to stay on Twitter and Facebook as if nothing is wrong. As for the &#34;deplorables&#34; who know what they&#39;re doing and will never question it or feel any remorse, we should not be giving them a megaphone.sources[0]: I was susceptible to extremist thought (not actions, fortunately) when I was younger. The sense that I might get into trouble if I participated in fringe websites kept me from going further down the rabbit hole. I kept reading mainstream news and sites, and while I would give a lot of things an extremist spin in my mind, eventually the narrative stopped making sense.sources[1]: https://twitter.com/iyad_elbaghdadi (can&#39;t find the specific Tweet, but he went through a similar experience, and almost became a full-blown extremist Muslim, before the sites he used to frequent were taken offline)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My reading from the outside is, the left needs to realize (I&#39;m sure it applies to the right equally as well) that scolding people into guilt is not a viable approach to affect action or to change perceptions when you&#39;re dealing with adults.Neither does boxing people into this, that and that category do any good. Like if all you want to do is dehumanize those guys so you can happily insult / hurt them without hurting your conscience, go ahead, that&#39;s choice.. you have different goals.. but remember that instinct that wants you to scream at this-this-this type of person is a confrontational approach that deep down falls in the pattern of, eliminating the other tribe.. if you choose to do something about it and what you do is your responsibility and problem.I just think the solution should lie in :
1) dialog 2) lawsI think beyond those 2 lie some really wrong answers.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you cannot censor away opinions, if suppression of ideas doesn&#39;t work then why in exactly these kinds of articles do people bemoan it as dangerous?I may agree that most censorship is wrong but it does work. It worked for centuries to help maintain systems of inequality.It worked for centuries to maintain familial control and enforce sexual monoculture in many countries. Information control works so well, it prevents people from even understanding themselves or what they really want in the face of ideologically imposed values.We are steeped in a culture of Hollywood telling us what the lessons of history are about. One of the off repeated &#34;hopeful&#34; messages we are fed is that you can&#39;t kill an idea but my reading of history has led me to the other conclusion entirely. That controlling the conversation, its constraints and determining the status quo are profoundly powerful tools."</p>

Every few years we get a tourist that confuses that with Sydney, New South Wales, Australia.They generally realize something is wrong when they switch planes in Halifax from a Jet (Boeing 737, Airbus 320, etc) to a 19 person turboprop for the last few hundred kilometers to Sydney.News Articles:http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/2172858.stmhttps://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/italian-tourists-...https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/mar/31/teen-accidenta...Wikipedia Link:Sydney, Nova Scotia, Canada https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney,_Nova_ScotiaSydney, New South Wales, Australia https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sydney"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first job was at a Staples office supply store in a town known for its tourism and glitz and glamour. Several times in my 15 months at that store, a German tourist would be seen wandering around the store, clearly lost. More than once they asked, in broken English, &#34;where is the Milk?&#34;staple
/ˈstāpəl/
plural noun: staples
1. a main or important element of something, especially of a diet. &#34;bread, milk, and other staples&#34;Considering that the Office Supply store was called Staples, and the local grocery stores were Alpha Beta, Vons, and Ralphs, one could understand their confusion!"</p>

SQLite already ships with a fairly large suite of JSON tools, which are optional to compile into the library, so there&#39;s precedent.Datetimes are of those things which is incredibly annoying to get right, and really belongs inside the database. RFC3339 timestamps are already well designed, since if you stick to UTC (and if you don&#39;t store timezone data separately you deserve those problems), lexical order is temporal order, but queries which would be rendered in English as &#34;return all accounts where last payment is ninety days prior to `now`&#34; isn&#39;t really possible with string comparisons.Also, with the JSON library, you can use a check constraint to fail if a string isn&#39;t valid JSON, another affordance I would love to have for datetimes.Grateful for what we just got, though!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Literally every time you see a startup release a product that seems trivial it&#39;s because that&#39;s not the full story. You&#39;re judging without complete information. For example, the public face might be a simple Mac calendar widget, but that could be the gateway to calendar sharing, native office apps, meeting booking, event management, ticket sales, corporate flight sales etc.Building an audience with a cheap tool that solves a tiny pain point for a lot of people is a great way to build a direct relationship with a market that you can then sell other services to.I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s the case here. Maybe their business is actually a widget. I&#39;m saying that most businesses do far more than you can see from the outside."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jesus Christ people. Give it a break. I hate this Reddit post. You&#39;re not going to build the next Apple today by making your first product a full fledged competitive modern computer.Remember that Microsoft started with a BASIC interpreter. Apple themselves started with a niche computer back then that sold to less 500 hobbyists at a hobbyist computer shop. The next Apple would also have to build something extremely niche that no one is paying attention to. Something like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"2 observations:- I happily paid for a very similar product about 10 years ago (it was full screen width and  had a brilliant timeline feature but otherwise very similar. It was broken when Snow Lion or something was released. I still look for an equivalent.)- Monthly payments forever for standalone apps is a big no no in my book. I get annoyed even just writing about it. Monthly payments for feature upgrades, perpetual license for last pud release (and some discount to encourage people to not jump on and off) is however totally OK with me. In this case however I think the price is generally too high anyway - for now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting read, especially as someone poking w/ writing a parser in zig for fun :)One area of improvement worth mentioning in this area is that currently zig errors cannot be tagged with extra information, which tends to be important for surfacing things like line numbers in parsing errors. There was a proposal[0] to improve this and it&#39;s not the end of the world for me anyways (as a workaround, I&#39;m toying with returning error tokens similar to what treesitter does)On a different note, there&#39;s another cool zig thing I found recently that is mildly related to parsing: a common thing in parsers is mapping a parsed string to some pre-specified token type (e.g. the string `&#34;if&#34;` maps to an enum value `.if` or some such so you can later pattern match tokens efficiently). The normal way to avoid O(n) linear search over the keyword space is to use a hashmap (naively, one would use a runtime std.StringHashMap in zig). But I found an article from Andrew[0] about a comptime hashmap where a perfect hashing strategy is computed at comptime since we already know the search space ahead of time! Really neat stuff.[0] https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/2647[1] https://andrewkelley.me/post/string-matching-comptime-perfec..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love parser combinators, and years ago I did a huge rewrite of my compiler compiler so that it&#39;d have the easiest possible parser combinators: simple string concatenation. grammarA + grammarB = grammarC. You can play with that here (https://jtree.treenotation.org/designer/). You still need to make a line change or two (good design after all, requires some integration), but it just works. Haven&#39;t seen anything beat it and not sure if that&#39;s possible. (Note: I do apologize for the crappy UX, and it&#39;s high on the priority list to give the app a refresh)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see a lot of articles posted on HN about Zig. What&#39;s so special about Zig, and how does it fill its own niche with other languages like Go and Rust?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t want to minimize the geopolitical issue here but wanted to ask about microsatellites and the ISS.How do you put the satellite onto its intended orbit, like are only satellites intended with a polar orbit capable of this approach?Do you need booster rockets to get in the right orbit?Can we go the other way and use the ISS as like an orbital garage to capture and fix satellites?This is the first I&#39;ve heard if the ISS holding onto satellites, I thought satellites are deployed by the launch rocket and just put into orbit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The politics around a decision like this are fascinating. I assume they&#39;ve already paid in part or in full for the launch, and regardless, they did R&amp;D on a satellite which is itself an asset that is now difficult to return to the owner!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can anybody tell me the resolution of the cameras on this satellite? Would it be better than the resolution of the images available from Google Maps? How much resolution is needed &#34;to monitor agriculture and fisheries&#34;?"</p>
