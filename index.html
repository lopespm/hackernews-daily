								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Holly mother of God. Mitchell was still on HN yesterday, as he was replying something about Backblaze IPO and its business. Today it is his IPO,$259 million revenue. 2100+ Customers, 1500+ employees, $10 Billion Valuation.........I mean I felt it wasn&#39;t that long ago Vagrant was &#34;the&#34; tool for the job.How it all started, the submission on HN [1], quote:&gt;This project has been the love child of myself and John Bender (nickelcode.com) for the past 6 weeks. We&#39;re both daily HN readers and would like to use this as a starting point to show Vagrant to the public. Specifically, I&#39;d like to open up to any questions and feedback, so that the HN community can get to know Vagrant. Your feedback is extremely valued. Thanks!&gt;A bit of background on this project: I work at a development company (citrusbyte.com) in LA. I see new projects almost every couple months, and I&#39;m often working on multiple projects simultaneously due to work, freelance, and personal projects. Managing the development environments between many projects on a local machine became a huge burden and a coworker once mentioned developing in a virtual machine. I thought this was a great idea, and Vagrant was eventually born from it.Really amazing achievement in such short space of time. Congratulations!Edit: I wonder how many company started or partially started on HN that went on to IPO. I know Dropbox is one. Do we have a list somewhere?[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1175901"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Absolute legend, rocket ship human Mitchell Hashimoto.
I still remember the excitement from Vagrant back in the day (which I think started it all). Here&#39;s the 1.0 announcement in 2012. [1]The tools and vision they created after, just amazing coming from a small scrappy startup crew. Which, IMO, is totally wild given the offerings clearly tend to target bigger Enterprise who have bigger teams/apps/ops demand.Then to walk away from $50MM barely older than drinking age. [2]Seriously congratulations to them and the Hashicorp team. Will likely invest and hold for a long time.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3672149[2] https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/1357445215259250689"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The impact Vagrant has had on my business is nearly immeasurable (and for free, no less). We&#39;re a small startup, and I haven&#39;t had the time (or motivation) to learn what Docker, Kubernetes, containers, etc are. Seems overly complex.But, virtual servers I can understand. I&#39;ve been using Vagrant since 2013 and it ... just works. We&#39;ve built our own custom box to standardize our development environment as well.If there is one company and person I&#39;d like to mimic, it&#39;s Hashicorp and Mitchell. Work to build an amazing product or products, get it ready for a sale or IPO, and then transition into an IC to continue doing what I love: hacking.Congratulations on the success!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was the person who first deployed Python at Goldman Sachs. At the time it was an &#34;unapproved technology&#34; but the partner in charge of my division called me and said (This is literally word for word because partners didn&#39;t call me every day so I remember)    Err....hi Sean, It&#39;s Armen.  Uhh.... So I heard you like python.... well if someone was to uhh.... install python on the train... they probably wouldn&#39;t be fired.  Ok bye.

&#34;Installing python on the train&#34; meant pushing it out to all the computers globally in the securities division that did risk and pricing.  Within 30mins every computer in goldman sachs&#39;s securities division had python and I was the guy responsible for keeping the canonical python distribution up to date with the right set of modules etc on Linux, Solaris and Windows.Because it was unapproved technology I had a stream of people from technology coming to my desk to say I shouldn&#39;t have done it.  I redirected them to Armen (who was a very important dude that everyone was frightened of).The core engineers from GS went on to build the Athena system at JP and the Quartz platform at BAML.//Edit for grammar"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m seeing a lot of people speculating about which bank this might be; I think the point is that it&#39;s all of them. I could loosely describe a previous job as implementing Morgan Stanley&#39;s Walpole and integrating more source code management into Minerva (even though that system wasn&#39;t actually Python-based).Having a global view on everything is large banks&#39; value-add, it&#39;s why they haven&#39;t been outcompeted by their more nimble competitors. Being able to calculate the risk of the whole bank isn&#39;t just a cool feature, it&#39;s the core value proposition of this platform.Being able to just upload your code and run it is really cool, and if you squint it looks a bit like what the outside world is trying to set up with serverless/lambda-style platforms - just write a function, submit it, and there, it&#39;s running. (But it&#39;s worth remembering that Python is not a typical programming language; python build, dependency and deployment management is exceptionally awful in every respect, this isn&#39;t as big a pain point in other languages). Obviously there&#39;s a tension between this and having good version control, diffs, easy rollbacks etc. - but because Minevera is already designed to do all that for data (because you need that kind of functionality for modifications to your bonds or whatever), doing it this way strikes a much better compromise than something like editing PHP files directly on your live server.What this article calls data-first design has a lot in common with functional programming. I hope that as the outside world adopts more functional programming and non-relational datastores, Minerva-style programming will get more popular. It really is a much better way to write code in many ways. The difficulty of integrating with outside libraries is a shame though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I&#39;ve mentioned that programmers are far too dismissive of MS Excel. You can achieve a awful lot with Excel: more, even, than some programmers can achieve without itThis is one of the most underrated topics in tech imho. Spreadsheet is probably the pinnacle of how tech could be easily approachable by non tech people, in the &#34;bike for the mind&#34; sense. We came a long way down hill from there when you need an specialist even to come up with a no-code solution to mundane problems.Sure the tech ecosystem evolved and became a lot more complex from there but I&#39;m afraid the concept of a non-tech person opening a blank file and creating something useful from scratch has been lost along the way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The first thing that jumps out is Sweden has a national identity system, BankID. The APIs appear to be protected using those credentials. With that in mind I have two questions:1. Who owns the data?2. Should public funds be used for the creation of private APIs that manage the data?The answer to (1) has consequences for (2).I think many HN readers, including myself, and certainly these parents would argue that the data is the property of the parents. If you see the data as being the property of the parents then you would see the APIs as being the means for retrieving and manipulating your data - data that&#39;s protected by this national BankID identification.It appears the school system believes the data is their data, and not the parents&#39; data. Therefore retrieving the data through any other means than the &#34;official&#34; app is a potential data breach.So who is right? Think about the data we manage on behalf of our customers, for example. Who owns that data? What rights do our customers have in accessing and managing that data?This is a really interesting case and hopefully will force the answer to these questions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In some cases, people’s personal information could be accessed from Google searches.SEO providers should take a note here.&gt; It warned parents to stop using the app and alleged that it might be illegally accessing people’s personal informationIf your API allows data extraction, it probably isn&#39;t a fault of any client. Perhaps they meant that creators could steal credentials. A problem with any software.I think this digital child managing system sounds moderately dystopian to be honest. I would have hated to give my parents access to anything like this. Kids will of course learn from how their parents behave...An open API is a must in my opinion, but the rest of the App should be open source too.That said, I don&#39;t really see the Swedish strategy as a model for other countries to follow. You don&#39;t need to give children chromebooks to learn. These are skills they have already mastered far better than their parents. They will learn about domain specific apps and there are indeed some really good ones, but such platform can also limit creativity because they are essentially sandpits. Depending on age that might be appropriate, but kids may have greater ambitions than their parents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every edutech platform I&#39;ve ever had to use (UK, with 3 kids going through school) is an abomination, the whole sector needs disrupting. My current nemesis is Iris Parentmail [0], a convoluted jumble of javascript that presents the user with a challenge - try to read the apparently important message the school has sent you before Parentmail crashes your browser. If the message is particularly long, then there&#39;s an end of level boss where you have to try to read the whole thing before the laptop gives you third degree burns. HNers, please, disrupt the hell out of this sector because it&#39;s nothing but chancers, consultants and chancer consultants.[0] https://www.iris.co.uk/education/engagement-suite/iris-paren..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m pretty addicted to &#34;Not Just Bikes&#34; youtube channel which seems to be either directly or indirectly related to stongtownshttps://www.youtube.com/c/NotJustBikesIt&#39;s frustrating. Even though I&#39;m currently in SF, SF still doesn&#39;t feel remotely as nice as many other places outside the US. Public transportation is slow and although the muni is okay the busses are kinda gross compared to good non-US cities. There are 10 or so walkable neighborhoods but they&#39;re missing something. Not sure what it is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everybody wants walkable cities, but nobody wants to live in tiny-ass flats.I&#39;m a European and if you look at the size of housing here (perhaps excluding the few cities that have low population density) it&#39;s tiny in comparison to most of the USA (except for NYC).So as always there are pro&#39;s and con&#39;s - would you want to live in a city like NYC? Would you like to raise a family in those conditions?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really enjoyable article. There&#39;s a thread that&#39;s running through it - that places that are rare and desireable are expensive. While this article talks about a specific kind of place, the pattern is true on general. It&#39;s another way to say &#34;supply and demand&#34;Whenever we talk on HN about high rents or house prices, we need to keep this in mind - what makes a place &#34;affordable&#34; is that either not that many other people want to live in a place like it, or that there&#39;s a lot of other places like it that exist. I am not implying policy but simply that this is the baseline of all real estate conversation whether we want it to be or not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good tips... but in reality if you&#39;re working full-time (especially in a software related role), you may find yourself depleted before you get to the keyboard.It took us 5 years to finish our game (everyone started from 0 knowledge on how to make games, so it was a rocky road), and for the last 1.5-2 years my life was absolute hell.I&#39;d push hard at work for 9 hours a day, eat, then push hard on the side project for 8-9 hours a day, sleep, wake up, and just keep going. One day a week maybe I&#39;d just sleep. Not having &#34;pure energy&#34; for the side project meant that everything suffered.We had to learn-by-trial virtually _everything_, I don&#39;t recommend ever doing a big project that way.If you want to finish a game, choose a small game. Start doing game jams. Practice _finishing_. You can do more and more later.Or, go for it, do it our way, all in to win (win is subjective, the pride is real, the monetary result didn&#39;t really do anything meaningful for so much investment). I wouldn&#39;t do it this way again, but I understand people who do.All that said, the joy of doing something for us by us is not something I&#39;ve encountered in my 15 year career yet. So... if you&#39;ve never built something (and truly finished!), but you want to try... go for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not discussed in the article: You have to have the support of the people in your life this will impact. For example, the 7-9am timeslot for working, as listed in the article, will impact my family, as that is when I&#39;m getting the kids up and off to school. OK, so I could move it to 5am to 7am, but that would mean I&#39;d need to go to bed earlier, which eliminates important evening time with my wife. Similarly, I could do it from 8pm to 10pm, but that also affects my relationship with my wife, and my social life in general.This isn&#39;t to say that people with a family can&#39;t do these things, but that you need to acknowledge the impact it will have on other people, and plan with them to make it work. For example, I often make the time for my wife to work on her novels between 7pm and 9pm. I get the kids to bed and do some cleaning, while she writes, and we still get to connect before sleep."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here are my side project tips:1) As the article states, work on your side project first in the morning before your work. You will be too tired after work. Yes, this means your not really giving 100% at work. Hopefully your good enough at your job that this is OK.2) Create little task lists, with short little tasks... Then knock those tasks out one by one. If you find yourself procrastinating about some task do another little task first, then later make a quick spur of the moment decision to go do the procrastination task.3) It&#39;s OK to dream about the best case scenario, but also have realistic side goals: &#34;worst case scenario, I&#39;ve built a cool engine for my next project.&#34;4) DO create the right amount of tests (too little and your going to be creating buggy crap code, too many and you&#39;re bogged down updating your tests constantly)... get a feel for what your right amount is.5) Don&#39;t type so much, think more... think through designs... use paper, be messy and redraw... all of this is faster than building the wrong thing.6) I think its OK to be quirky. Make the thing YOU want to make. This is another way to monetize: your mental health is worth a lot and personally I find bringing shit that I want to exist into the world just the way I want them to be is a good trick for staying happy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I see a number like $21 billion, I can&#39;t help but think of all the economic and social good from drugs being regulated, like Cannabis, Tobacco and Prostitution.That&#39;s a lot of taxation money lost, a lot of policing wasted, and a lot of lives lost needlessly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, what a fascinating article. It still blows my mind that annually his organization made seven times more than the Sinaloa Cartel. I think the last paragraph says it all:&gt;What gave traditional organized crime its strength in the past—the violence, the control of territory, the ethnic loyalty and defined hierarchies—are the heart of its weakness in the present. Tse had a better system. Instead of ethnic loyalty, transnational and inter-organizational co-operation. Instead of territory, logistics. Instead of hierarchy, metrics. Instead of centralized control, connections. Tse Chi Lop is easily the most significant criminal in Toronto’s history, and he represents, in an entirely diseased way, a perverse triumph of the city. His vast criminal organization flourished through open-mindedness and entrepreneurship, by creating markets and exploiting them in a spirit of eager globalization and cosmopolitanism.Imagine how much money criminal syndicates could make if they took notes from this guy and all worked together."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a National Geographic documentary series called Drugs, Inc. [1] that I find fascinating.Let&#39;s set aside what an abject failure the so-called War on Drugs has been in the US and the violence of the drug trade and just appreciate the market economics for a second.One episode listed all the stages coca leaves took to becoming crack cocaine. Processing in jungle labs, transportation to smugglers, further processing, flying to Mexico, entering the US and distribution. And each stage there is loss to law enforcement, rival gangs, theft, etc and that loss rate is reflected in how the price jumps at each stage.In another, it detailed how meth (IIRC) entered the US primarily in Phoenix. As a result, Phoenix has (so the show said) the cheapest meth in the US. For every 1000 miles you radiated away from Phoenix, the price doubled.To me it was fascinating to see people who generally had little education, came from terrible backgrounds and grew up amidst crime and violence talk about the math of distance and price and how it impacted his distribution organization. It&#39;s sad to see someone who actually has a talent for hustling and basically sales be lost to the drug world.This is yet another reason why I think the &#34;are you a felon?&#34; question should basically be outlawed in the US.Additionally you  see how organizations have evolved to insulate themselves from disruption (from rivals or law enforcement). Most people know very little and certainly not the big picture. Merchandise frequently changes hands.I don&#39;t know what the solution here is. I fully support legalization of recreational cannabis in any world where alcohol consumption is legal. I certainly don&#39;t think we should be sending people to prison for possession.At the same time, you have cities like Seattle, Portland and San Francisco that are literally being destroyed by non-policing of drugs and small property crime.But the US prison industrial complex is and always has been a direct attack on the poor and minorities.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drugs,_Inc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"These tables and charts are filled with events, but remember that for almost all of history, nothing happened. Billions of years and effectively nada. Even if you lived during the Cambrian Explosion, I doubt you would notice anything happening.....If you want an up-to-date, authoritative, useful guide to geological history, you want the International Chronostratigraphic Chart. I&#39;m impressed that this is kept updated and is so well done.https://stratigraphy.org/chart"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"How many people even register their graphics card (or really anything else) online on the manufacturer&#39;s website? And considering it is impossible for people to buy cards from legit sources, what exactly do you expect them to do?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If 20 years ago a cyberpunk author pitched a story to me about thieves that steal a truckload full of AI-grade processors in order to profit off a digital gold rush I&#39;d say &#34;cool story bro but it doesn&#39;t make sense technically&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How does this work though?If I would buy a card on eBay for example, I paid for it, install it and during registration I learn it is stolen, am I just basically f-ed? I mean, will anyone reimburse me the money I paid for it?I would assume EVGA won&#39;t (since it was stolen from them), police won&#39;t, seller won&#39;t, eBay will say that it is between me and the seller.How something like that gets resolved?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From https://luau-lang.org/typecheck&gt; Luau’s type system is structural by defaultI think that makes it the second (production-ready) language to have a primarily-structural type system, after TypeScript/Flow(/and Closure to some extent) for JS. I wonder if it will follow in their impressive footsteps or if it will tread new territory.One of the things that Flow gets right that TypeScript doesn&#39;t yet support is switching to nominal type-checking between class instances. In TypeScript you can assign an instance of one class to an instance of another as long as they have compatible fields. Compare:Flow: https://bit.ly/3jZx4rBTS: https://tsplay.dev/mZaL1NTypeScript doesn&#39;t have any understanding of prototypes or prototypal inheritance, which is a big gap considering that it&#39;s a fundamental aspect of JS.I&#39;m really hoping Luau will come to do the right thing with tables and prototypes. Perhaps it already does, but unfortunately there doesn&#39;t seem to be a Luau playground to try in the browser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If any of the Luau devs are watching this, please flesh out the metamethods. I&#39;d switch almost everything to Luau if they were improved.They&#39;re the biggest PITA right now as designed in PUC-Rio, and I see that while you&#39;ve improved upon __eq, other metamethods are still lacking.In PUC-Rio, boolean equality operators FORCE a boolean result, regardless of what you return. Ideally they would allow returning any result type, which then can be coerced to boolean later (e.g. by an `if` statement), just like the arithmetic operators do.Further, `__neq`, `__ge` and `__gt` do not exist. They should.The lack of a proper metamethod design means that binding to e.g. Kiwi[0] is impossible without some incredibly fugly hacks. It has been a long-standing annoyance with Lua in an otherwise beautiful little scripting language (that I use frequently).This looks quite nice - lots of attempts in this space but nothing that attempts to match Lua to this degree.[0] https://github.com/nucleic/kiwi"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Heck yeah.I don&#39;t know what this fork changes, but I love how many game engines will take lua and expand it to fit their exact needs like this.Very few scripting languages make it as easy to do as lua.This is an interesting related project:https://moonscript.org/It compiles down to lua, and really beefs everything up. Interface is super nice too. You just put `require &#34;moonscript&#34;` at the top of the file and you&#39;re done, now just write your code in moon script."</p>
