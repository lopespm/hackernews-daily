								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason the banks, and through the banks OnlyFans, attack sex is because they are accountable, and don&#39;t wish to take risks unless they are very profitable risks.The real danger of platforms and banks is how happy they are to censor for the government, or simply the loudest, richest mouth, in order to keep the profit flowing. If you want to fix it, you put in legal protections for people to do business, rather than this informal and/or ad hoc regulation through the shifting influence and agendas of arbitrary special interest groups.&gt; The financial and tech industries’ prudishness is unfortunately increasingly reflected in government policy, typically under the guise of protecting children and other vulnerable communities.This is the Guardian getting causation extremely wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article completely misses the causes of the rule changes. Banks and payment processes pushed new rules because they were being held accountable. The changes were all implemented in response to hugely influential NYT opinion piece on PornHub in December [1] that specifically called out payment processors, and preempted a BBC investigation into OnlyFans that was hinted to do the same [2].The conversation here should about how rulemaking via media outrage is a problem given the public has conflicting morals.[1] https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/04/opinion/sunday/pornhub-ra...[2] https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-58255865"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case any Discord employees are reading this: please don&#39;t remove the ability for bots to read message_content , or make me jump through verification hoops either. Reading raw messages is absolutely crucial for moderation bots and, well, just about every other fun and interesting bot.I don&#39;t write discord bots so you can type a slash command to do a thing. That&#39;s boring. Good bots can read messages. Discord will be very &#34;not dope&#34; and &#34;not cool&#34; if bots are forced to become a sterilized pick-list of interaction options."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m always very thankful that we even have people that work so hard towards FOSS libraries to begin with. It must feel pretty bad to receive those responses from employees telling him about the things he should do that are &#39;um&#39;, &#39;easy&#39; and &#39;dope&#39; when there&#39;s clearly been many longstanding feature and communication issues already (as if being the person working on a FOSS library for no compensation in your spare time that empowers a company whose employees&#39; are getting 7-8 figure exits within a few years wasn&#39;t already bad enough).My general pessimism with this situation is how proprietary everything has to be to begin with; the idea of a single company storing the full history of everyone&#39;s messages and interactions is already bad enough without them requiring the government ID of their users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meanwhile, I see fleets of user-bots happily chugging along under the radar hoovering up data.  Just like the post author said:&gt; the crux of malicious bots were, and still are, user-bots.Seems almost laughable that Discord is making hoops for legitimate bot developers to jump through while taking little action against user-bots.I suspect that Discord wants to get a chunk of the big money that game bot developers are making, and are pushing bot developers into a more rigid API that will eventually include in-app-purchases.  The article author also said:&gt;  No longer will bots thrive with a sandbox limited only by your imagination, but instead Discord is now the sole gatekeeper of approved use cases. The future of Discord bots relies solely on the interaction system; things have to be explicitly written and supported by Discord employees"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny how two people can hack two separate home phones to run DOOM without realizing it until after the fact. For perspective, I posted a blog article about modifying a CaptionCall phone to run DOOM at the same time [1] as this was posted! What a unique coincidence!1: https://joshumax.github.io/general/2021/08/11/running-doom-o..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Around 10 years ago i worked in a company that had lots of software and physical VOIP phones. One of the models of phone had a pretty nice colour screen on it. I forget the brand .. it might have been polycom.At that time I was very much into nmap&#39;ing everything and noticed that these devices had all sorts of interesting ports open including telnet and ftp. FTP was read only for anonymous but it was trivial to download and crack the passwd file and discover that the admin password was something like 1234. My colleagues and I only got as far as showing images on the screen to surprise people but my imagination was running wild with the surveillance possibilities (let alone doom!).This was one of my first glimpses as how bad security on commercial embedded devices can be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a line that resonates with me, and the one which some negative comments might overlook (3 hours in, at least):  &#34;What can you say in this language that would 
  be impossibly inconvenient to say in others? 
  In the process of learning how to say things 
  you couldn&#39;t previously say, you&#39;ll probably 
  be learning how to think things you couldn&#39;t 
  previously think.&#34;

This is one of the value propositions of language. It&#39;s one of the ways we learn new things, and thus become more capable of doing valuable work as people.Criticisms of this essay in comments so far have seemed to fall into these buckets:  1. Lisp? Macros? Boo. (Not novel/too weird/etc)

  2. Languages are solved, not important; I build systems.

  3. I don&#39;t like the tone of this essay.

(1) and (3) are side points, unrelated to thesis. (2) is the interesting one, and at the heart of what the essay talks about.I&#39;ve always been in the pg camp on this one. Sure, systems are the thing, we can&#39;t be purists, etc -- but saying that languages don&#39;t matter, for us, would be like rocket engineers saying that materials don&#39;t matter.If you&#39;re building a table, you can make it out of almost anything; a table is a solved problem. Wood, carbon fiber, steel.But at the limits of what&#39;s possible, like a rocket, the material&#39;s properties, limitations, and weaknesses in extreme circumstances matter.You can definitely imagine that important things are happening, in the maker&#39;s mind, when they start working with a new material, seeing what others are able to do with it, seeing how the making process is easier, or what steps are unimportant/unnecessary now vs. in their usual materials. And that informs their thinking, going forward, about what&#39;s possible in systems they might build."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Pick a language that most programmers consider weird but whose median user is smartI think this heuristic fails, with my poster-child counter-example being Nock and Hoon, the languages used to implement Urbit.  Those languages are unquestionably weird, and I think their median user is pretty smart -- you have to be pretty smart to use those languages because they are intentionally designed to be difficult to use.  But I don&#39;t see any merit whatsoever in Nock and Hoon, at least not with respect to giving you any leverage in programming.  C++ is another example.  It&#39;s not considered weird, but I think it would be if it were not so widely used.  Again, to use C++ you have to be smart because you have to know the locations of a zillion and one hidden land mines.  But the appeal of these languages is not the leverage they give you, it&#39;s the barrier to entry.  Once you invest the time to learn them you become a member of an exclusive club.  In the case of C++ at least, being a member of the club gives you leverage and opens up employment opportunities.  But that doesn&#39;t make C++ a good language."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Putting aside the other controversial things that Graham says in this post, I think we could find common ground and have some fun technical discussion by focusing on this angle:&gt; What can you say in this language that would be impossibly inconvenient to say in others?The first experience that comes to mind for me was XSLT.  Early on in my technical writing career, I needed to convert the Doxygen output of a C library to a more barebones HTML output (so that the reference docs would have the same branding as the rest of our site). I used XSLT to extract only the bits of HTML that I needed and I transformed them into nice, straightforward, semantic HTML. It took me a while to wrap my head around XSLT&#39;s flow but I was amazed to find that a task that would have taken probably 50-100 lines of looping and condition checking could be accomplished in literally 1-3 lines of XSLT.Would love to hear other&#39;s experiences along these lines (i.e. concrete examples)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"How do you deal with data loss if there isn’t a perfect match between the data models? For example, if I’m looking to migrate from GSuite to Microsoft Office365 (or vice versa) and there’s not a 1:1 mapping. Or if the behavior of the same spreadsheet formula is slightly importantly different? These are complicated examples obviously and maybe you’re not tackling them yet, but I think I see (at least as an external observer with limited visibility) a lot of the internal teams really focusing on those corner cases where the data loss path and other migration challenges rather than the happy easy-to-automate piece.Similarly, how do you see this service scaling beyond a boutique consultancy or outside of a handful of cases where it’s easy? If you’re successful, do you think vendors won’t do everything to make your access more difficult or cut you off completely? If you see it more as a “we force the vendors we integrate to sign a mutual agreement” kind of strategy, how do you see yourselves not becoming a gate keeper and velocity bottleneck for feature development (ie company wants to roll out feature X and now they need to involve you first so that you can write migrations to …?)It’s an interesting idea so curious to hear your thoughts about the challenges."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wix is an interesting choice.  I remember during the recent feud between Matt Mullenweg (Wordpress founder) and Avishai Abrahami (Wix CEO), Matt said this:&#34;They are so insecure that they are also the only website creator I’m aware of that doesn’t allow you to export your content, so they’re like a roach motel where you can check in but never check out.&#34;So I guess there&#39;s probably demand for a nice export tool there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a $100M SaaS in a different space but the underlying tech is identical. I had this idea ~10 yrs ago when we first started writing our own import logic to move users over from competing services.The engineering challenges to make this work flawlessly is going to be substantial to say the least. I GET from ~70 data sources right now...I couldn&#39;t imagine having to GET,POST, CHECKPOINT and DIFF with all the edge cases that appear.Best of luck but this is a very hard problem to solve. Would love to see someone see this through!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.htmlQ: I&#39;m a student of visual communications and asked myself why links are blue. I found some answers that might be, for example blue is a color of learning, but I&#39;m not sure what is right. Is there any reason, why links are colored blue ?A: There is no reason why one should use color, or blue, to signify links: it is just a default. I think the first WWW client (WorldWideWeb I wrote for the NeXT) used just underline to represent link, as it was a spare emphasis form which isn&#39;t used much in real documents. Blue came in as browsers went color - I don&#39;t remember which was the first to use blue. You can change the defaults in most browsers, and certainly in HTML documents, and of course with CSS style sheets. There are many examples of style sheets which use different colors.My guess is that blue is the darkest color and so threatens the legibility least. I used green whenever I could in the early WWW design, for nature and because it is supposed to be relaxing. Robert Cailliau made the WWW icon in many colors but chose green as he had always seen W in his head as green.One of the nicest link renditions was Dave Raggett&#39;s &#34;Arena&#34; browser which had a textured parchment background and embossed out the words of the link with a square apparently raised area.[See also https://www.crazyegg.com/blog/why-hyperlinks-are-blue/ which links to the answer above but also contains a few other references.]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given the author&#39;s &#34;conclusions&#34; about Windows&#39;s influence here, it&#39;s probably worth mentioning that Windows 3.x (including both 3.0 and 3.1) used green for hyperlinks in its help system by default (which was hypertext but not HTML):  https://i.imgur.com/ZjX5xIW.pngGreen hyperlinks stuck around in the Windows 95 help system, and were eventually replaced when Windows 98 switched to Microsoft&#39;s new HTML Help system which defaulted to blue hyperlinks (inherited from Internet Explorer)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mosaic was the first browser I used, and the first I wrote websites for (I still only test in one browser ;) ).Something the article doesn&#39;t touch on is the fact that there wasn&#39;t really such a thing as hex colors like &#34;#0000ff&#34; back then. You could use them, but no one did because they weren&#39;t guaranteed to work properly. There was a list of 256 &#34;web safe colors&#34; that you could use that were the 8 bit palette that most computers supported in VGA graphics (at 640x480 resolution), and then a further list of HTML colors that could be used if the user had a graphics card that could use 16 bit SVGA graphics. Using 24 bit hex code colors didn&#39;t come along until a little later, when computers were likely to display them properly.In other words, links weren&#39;t #0000ff. They were &#34;blue&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s a damn shame it took until this article for me (and it appears some others) to learn about the console and the debugger; those seem like massive time savers! My own biggest helper has been to use &#34;ANSIBLE_STDOUT_CALLBACK=yaml&#34; wherever &#34;ansible-playbook&#34; is called (https://jpmens.net/2021/03/12/alter-ansible-s-output-on-debu...). It makes the verbose output much more readable and is especially handy for tasks that can spew thousands of lines at ones (e.g. &#34;apt update/upgrade&#34;)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m using ansible for some years already. The biggest game changer for me was ansible molecule [0].I integrated it to the repo, where I store my code and it just runs all the test cases for my code. It saved me a bunch of hours of investigation in test environments before I even released the code. Highly recommend to try it even for a small project.Apart of that play with ansible strategies if you have more than one server to apply the role. It really might save you some minutes of a runtime.[0]: https://molecule.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ansible is abysmal. I don&#39;t know why anyone still chooses it. It&#39;s a mess of yaml and what feels like a million yaml files that is always extremely hard to follow. Honestly writing some python, or bash is a lot easier to follow, read, and understand. The only thing it has going for it is the inventory system. I wish ansible would die already.The tips mentioned in the article are helpful, but still beyond the initial development of roles, maintaining roles is a pain no one can alleviate. It is the perl of automation. I wish people would stop using it. I&#39;ve yet to start a job where people haven&#39;t regretted going towards ansible."</p>
