								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a fantastic read; thank you for sharing.I saw escorts for a couple of years.  It was often weird, when I just didn’t click with the woman, but I met a few really awesome people.There are other down sides to escorting.  One of the women I had seen a couple of times, was later murdered. They ended up catching the killer- another escort, I don’t know why.  It was hard to grieve; we were not real close; her family probably didn’t want clients showing up at the funeral or any other reminder like flowers.I ended up falling in love with one of the women I met and we dated for a while.  It was a serious emotional roller coaster being in love with someone who was having sex with other men until she was ready to “go exclusive”.  But in the end we got married after she retired.Now it’s ten years later. We have a son and are still happy as can be.If you’re thinking about seeing escorts, remember that since intimacy with other people is involved, there are often strong emotions as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fantastic article: informative, well-written, thoughtful, human, and funny. And it’s especially interesting to see it posted here at HN, because while reading it I kept thinking there are some solid lessons here about entrepreneurship, sales, and product pricing that could certainly be applied to your average start-up SaaS.I mean, anchoring your price high, to better capture the businessman/enterprise market? And that this market also happens to be less likely to be time-suck jerks about little issues, or constantly asking for product changes/features? Literally better b̶a̶n̶g̶ ̶f̶o̶r̶ ̶y̶o̶u̶r̶ ̶buck for your bang.And it’s right out of the classic @patio11 essays, too. Charge more, indeed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually read the entire thing. It was worth it imo. Some stand outs were her kind words about her clients (almost strange to see men as a class described with such positive words). She is clearly a very rational and intelligent person and this is a business to her like any other. Yeah I really don’t get why this stuff is illegal, even though I have no interest myself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very cool stuff.I remember being at Build 2018 and asking the PM on the Live Share team if they had any plans to bring VS Code to the browser. Maybe do managed environments for labs and companies (what GitHub code spaces now is), would be great for education. Lots of students (especially non-CS nerds, like the physics kids with a CS requirement) find environment setup to be one of the hardest parts. He seemed to think I was a piece of shit for not ‘getting’ what Live Share was all about and how those other offerings (code spaces, running in the browser without install) were bad ideas not worth considering.I think the moral of the story is, if you’re a PM, don’t treat your most enthusiastic customers like shit. Or maybe do, because it won’t actually have business impact."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems really cool, and seems like it took a lot of man hours to put together.However, I&#39;m not sure who this is for. Downloading and installing an application is not a particularly big ask for the type of people who use VSCode. The browser version will always be a compromised experience, given the inherent limitations of browser applications. Even if it works 99% of the time, that 1% would add enough friction to make it more of a hassle then it&#39;s worth.The post gave some use cases involving hardware that can&#39;t easily run Desktop VSCode (e.g. iPads and Chromebooks). I just don&#39;t see that being much of a use case though, except in desperate circumstances where a more capable dev machine isn&#39;t available.If there are some use cases I&#39;m missing, I&#39;d love to hear about them! This is a pretty new concept, and I certainly don&#39;t know how everyone likes to code. But from my perspective, I struggle to see any situation where someone would choose to use this, and few situations where someone would have to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve been using Brave search for several months now. I switched the day that it was announced. The quality is fairly good, but I’m having troubling telling whether it’s just my own halo effect or if the initial quality that experienced has started to slip a little as it indexes more widely or something. At first I was impressed with how little spam ended up in top results, but lately exact queries for Python functions or prominent API functions have lots of spammy content above the actual documentation. Talking about sites that just republish GitHub issue threads, republished StackOverflow questions, w3schools-likes, etc.I’m still rooting for them, but in general
I continued to be baffled why such blatant spam can consistently make it into top results on Google, DDG and now Brave. I really wish a search engine would empower me to provide a URL ban list that gets applied server-side instead of filtering on the front end (if anything)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You know what, I welcome a new search provider, even if it&#39;s by a cryptocurrency company. I&#39;d rather see Qwant succeed, but their search is having trouble competing with even duckduckgo.What I don&#39;t see is where Brave gets its image search results from. After Microsoft blatantly started serving the CCP by blocking queries for &#34;tank man&#34;, which as far as I know they&#39;ve never actually apologised for, just explained it as &#34;a filter with more impact than expected&#34; or some BS like that, I found out that most &#34;competing&#34; search engines bought all of their image search from Microsoft, leading to the same kind of censorship on platforms such as duckduckgo.Brave says it&#39;s using &#34;third parties&#34; to generate the results but I can&#39;t easily see which third party that would be. If they are using Bing like all the others, I wouldn&#39;t trust their image search engine in the slightest.Personally, I&#39;ll just assume they are for now, because they don&#39;t seem to clarify this further anywhere else.From what I can tell, there are four image/video search providers in the world: Google, Bing, Yandex and Baidu. The rest all seem to license their results from one of the big four, mostly from Bing. When I need to pick from those four, I&#39;ll stick with Google; their censorship is relatively mild. I was hoping Brave Search would prove to be an alternative in this area, but that doesn&#39;t seem to be the case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For non-technical searches, mostly stuff relating to news, politics, or Covid, Google is next to useless at this point due to their attempts to combat misinformation. Even their autocomplete functionality guides potential search queries in an entirely unorganic manner. For instance, something may be trending according to google, while simultaneously being blacklisted as an autocomplete option- if it has Any elements of wrongthink about it."</p>

A much different world would have resulted."</p>

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Columbian_trans-oceanic_co...But it is meaningless since they did not write about it nor they stablished commerce. The fact is that before 1492, most civilizations in Africa/Asia/Europe did not know that America existed and that other humans lived there. After 1492, that changed forever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No idea why you would write this up or share it honestly. Call me old fashion but I wouldn&#39;t want to do business with someone who scream irrationally as loud as they can in response to simple questions or during business meetings. Especially since the outcome didn&#39;t lead to anything, just was &#39;something different&#39;. Truly what is the message here?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice story, but I think people here have the wrong takeaways from it. Having an outburst or sharing personal anecdotes isn&#39;t going to help you in an investor pitch. Had it happened earlier in their YC interview things wouldn&#39;t have gone any different, as they make it seem. The fundamental questions and doubts would have all been the same.If you don&#39;t have solid differentiators, growth charts, revenue models a touching story will not help your startup."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is telling about this example is that what seemed to have made the biggest impression was the least rehearsed, thought out, planned answer he could give, but rather the one that was the most sincere and most &#34;down to earth.&#34;I think there is so much about the YC format which really hints at that strategy likely being your best route of success -- the time constraint, the lack of pitch deck, etc. I mean, these are people who quite literally go through thousands of these. I can&#39;t really see any other way to possibly stand out than to try to be radically genuine and sincere, even when that seems (as the author seemed to have thought!) that it is the &#34;less fancy&#34; or &#34;not the thing you are supposed to say.&#34; Quite literally anything else will be something they will have heard, at a minimum, dozens of other times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just can&#39;t figure out what I&#39;m missing on the &#34;M1 is so fast&#34; side of things. For years I worked* on an Ubuntu desktop machine I built myself. Early this year I switched to a brand new M1 mini and this this is slower and less reliable than the thing I built myself that runs Ubuntu. My Ubuntu machine had a few little issues every no and then. My Mini has weird bugs all the time. e.g. Green Screen Crashes when I have a thumbdrive plugged in. Won&#39;t wake from sleep. Loses bluetooth randomly. Not at all what I&#39;d expect from something built by the company with unlimited funds. I would expect those issues from the Ubuntu box, but the problems were small on that thing.*Work... Docker, Ansible, Rails apps, nothing that requires amazing super power. Everything just runs slower."</p>

M1 Max gives 9% boost for single-core and 34% for multicore, with similar or larger (?) TDP -- Intel is 35-45 W, M1 Max is 60W but I assume some of it (a lot?) goes to GPU. Impressive, but probably wouldn&#39;t be called revolution if came from Intel."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got mine down to 160 bytes with some pixel tweaking and converting it to a 16-color indexed PNG. It&#39;s not a lot of work or very difficult (I&#39;m an idiot at graphics editing), but you do need to spend the (small amount of) effort. I embed it as a data URI and it&#39;s just four lines of (col-80 wrapped) base64 text, which seems reasonable to me.Haven&#39;t managed to get my headshot down to less than 10k without looking horrible no matter how much I tweaked the JPEG or WebP settings, and thought that was just a tad too big to embed. Maybe I need to find a different picture that compresses better.I got that 280k Discord favicon down to just 24K simply by opening it in GIMP and saving it again. I got it down to 12K by indexing it to 255 colours rather than using RGB (I can&#39;t tell the difference even at full size). You can probably make it even smaller if you tried, but that&#39;s diminishing returns. Still, I bet with 5 more minutes you can get it to ~5k or so.It&#39;s very easy; you just need to care. Does it matter? Well, when I used Slack I regularly spent a minute waiting for them to push their &gt;10M updates, so I&#39;d say that 250k here and 250k there etc. adds up and matters, giving real actual improvements to your customers.The Event Horizon Telescope having a huge favicon I can understand; probably just some astronomer who uploaded it in WordPress or something. Arguably a fault of the software for not dealing with that more sensibly, but these sort of oversights happen. A tech company making custom software for a living is quite frankly just embarrassing to the entire industry. It&#39;s a big fat &#34;fuck you&#34; to anyone from less developed areas with less-than-ideal internet connections."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The difference between the Apple “precomposed” and standard icons had to do with the gloss effect on icons on pre iOS 7 home screens.When adding a website/webapp to these earlier home screens, the OS would apply a gloss effect over the icon in order to match the aesthetic of the standard apps.
The precomposed icon was a way for the developer to stop the OS from applying this effect, such as if their logo already had a different gloss effect already applied (i.e “precomposed”) or other design where adding the glossy shine wouldn’t look right.
The standard icon allowed the OS to apply the gloss effect - which was a timesaver as Apple did tweak the gloss contour over the years: hence using a standard icon ensured that the website/webapp always matched the user’s OS version."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A friend in the music industry told me about a very cool backblaze moment.They were out touring with an artist in some remote country, I think it was Kazakhstan, when the artists macbook suffered hard drive failure. Everything was backed up on backblaze, but the internet connections they had available was simply too unreliable to get the backup down. They contacted backblaze and for a price that was high (but not insane for a company) backblaze actually flew a guy with a physical hard drive to their location.Saved ~5 gigs from being canceled, and my friend has been a die hard backblaze evangelist ever since."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Backblaze. Kind of surprised they aren’t profitable.&gt;” In the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, our revenue was $40.7 million and $53.8 million, respectively, representing growth of 32%. We incurred net losses of $1.0 million and $6.6 million for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020, respectively”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those looking at the risks, it might sound a little pessimistic, however when compared against other &#39;emergent growth&#39; S-1&#39;s we&#39;ve seen this year, it appears to be an otherwise normal filing with the normal amount of CYA. I hope they do well, and I hope they don&#39;t change too much in the pursuit of a profit. Not being profitable in the SaaS business is not necessarily the scarlet letter that it is in other fields, so I&#39;m optimistic for their future.Also, congrats Backblaze! The next adventure begins :)"</p>

We often (always?) have weaknesses that can/do jeopardize our strength and closing those weaknesses is crucial.The famous Scott Galloway (whom I had as a b-school professor) made this point like this: if you are a great guy, great father, great boss, etc, but once in a while you get violently drunk and hurt people in your life - THAT thing offsets everything else. You won&#39;t become better by &#34;doubling down&#34; on what you&#39;re already good at, but by fixing this flaw.Another case - I used to manage a C++ developer. If you gave him a tight spec, he&#39;d implement it perfectly. But the world we lived in required him to go talk to people to figure out what the real needs are, and he was bad at that. So his code always solved the wrong problem unless someone was helping him with this stuff.Every year, his own developmental goal was to go learn the next C++ standard. And that would have been useless because he was already a great C++ programmer. Going from 97th percentile to the 98th wouldn&#39;t matter. The much bigger bang for the buck would be figuring out how to go sit down with a sales rep and say &#34;OK, what&#39;s our client actually trying to do here?&#34;It sounds simple but I believe this held him back not just in work but in life. I happen to know that he didn&#39;t have great communication with his wife and kids either - solving this thing would make him so much better at all parts of his life.The thing is - we all have glaring things like this - obstacles in our own trajectory that if we fix, our existing strength would really shine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can relate to the “looking at data” as a skill bit, especially the part where he mentions that it’s not a skill most data scientists necessarily have. I have observed that too. (I’m one myself)Many data scientists like to jump into feature extraction and modeling the data with ML/DS tools because for us that’s the fun part. (we might look at some plots and summary statistics but we don’t dwell there for too long.) Few have the patience to just sit with the data for a week just to look at it, checking it against our intuition about the real world and the domain and basically just trying to put 2 and 2 together without models (except a mental model of the world) and just turning the data over in Tableau (or Excel). It’s actually not an easy skill to learn because it requires other meta skills. For one it requires an ability to match numbers to the real world — and for that you need experience and a good intuition of how the world works.My first manager was exceptionally good at doing this. I’ve noticed too that folks in senior management — at least competent ones — tended to be good at looking at data and picking out things too. I suspect this is actually a make or break ability to get to senior management at most companies.Data scientists, not so much. (Unless they worked in the field or came from the business side of things.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The bit about compilers reminds me of this quote about Feyman, but sorry of the inverse where you hold tricks in your head instead of problems.Richard Feynman was fond of giving the following advice on how to be a genius. You have to keep a dozen of your favorite problems constantly present in your mind, although by and large they will lay in a dormant state. Every time you hear or read a new trick or a new result, test it against each of your twelve problems to see whether it helps. Every once in a while there will be a hit, and people will say, &#39;How did he do it? He must be a genius!&#39;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article briefly mentions dumping energy at regular periods without using thrusters. Does anyone know what mechanism they&#39;re using to do this? At first glance I&#39;d assume it would look like rotating/configuring the satellite so the solar wind imparts angular momentum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the interesting things about the telescope on Integral [1] is that it uses a coded aperture mask [2] to image the sky in high energy X-rays to gamma rays, rather than a focusing optic.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/INTEGRAL
[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coded_aperture"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool story! I wonder if the mission engineers do a lot of operational training for incidents like this: for example the SREs at Google do &#34;tabletop&#34; role-playing exercise to practice incident response. Would be cool to hear similarities/differences with ESA folks."</p>
