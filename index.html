After that, you will simply only need to copy the image file such as .iso, .vhd etc on to the drive and you are all set. Check details from the following sites.https://www.ventoy.net/en/index.html

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Windows images that are over 4.3GB(I don&#39;t remember the exact max size) most image burning tools will fallback to NTFS on the USB formatting and some motherboards/laptops don&#39;t like this. (Even on my rather modern Dell laptop)The best solution so far I&#39;ve found is to manually partition the USB into a 1GB FAT32 partition and the rest NTFS. Then you extract the files where needed [0]I learned this method just last year but it seems it&#39;s pretty universal. At least for Win10 ISOs. And I don&#39;t have to boot Windows and wait for its updates![0] https://techbit.ca/2019/02/creating-a-bootable-windows-10-ue..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While it is not my experience at all, I understand that some folks have certain negative opinions of Beyond Burgers, and other fake meat/imitation burgers:- The texture is off
- Maybe they cook strangely
- Potentially less tasteBut the most important thing about them, and the reason I urge everyone to at least _try_ Beyond Burgers, is they require no violence against animals.This is not an argument that fairs well on HN in general, but the fact that we can eat something this similar to a burger but without the slaughter of living, feeling, individual being is so unbelievably important and incredible.Maybe you think the burger tastes different, or has a strange texture, but I certainly won&#39;t try to argue that because it doesn&#39;t matter. No one needed to die for you to eat it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m generally surprised no one brings up the negative health benefits of processed foods.  It is not healthier to get rid of meat only to replace it with high salt chemically processed food that tastes like meat.It seems like we are going backwards.You know what uses less greenhouse emissions, less water and less land?  The orginal plant based food that gets processed into a beyond burger.If you really care about the planet why are you buying processed anything?  That get&#39;s shipped nationwide / worldwide that creates factories, chemical waste, greenhouse gases.  Buying locally and growing locally really helps the planet.  Going to burger king and getting an absolute burger instead of a whooper is just pretending."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am an avid meat-lover but it does play on my conscience that I am in fact eating a former sentient being and potentially contributing to environmental devastation.I would appreciate answers to the following two, albeit simplistic questions that always plaque me when I consider stopping eating meat products:1) Is it really unethical to eat animals when the natural trajectory of most animals lives was likely to be eaten by other animals or die some horrendous death in their natural environment? Isn&#39;t it better for an animal to live its best life on a free range farm being grass fed, then get quickly and humanely slaughtered?2)If I made a personal decision to stop eating meat, would there be any significant impact at all on the overall environment realistically? For example, I recently watched the documentary Seaspiracy which showed the negative effects of commercial fishing. However, the reality is that me (not) eating a bowl of sashimi once a week makes no difference in the context of, say, countries like Japan slaughtering millions of fish daily (regardless of any change in behavior on my part or my small circle of influence)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s nice to see hard evidence of this, but anecdotal evidence is plain to see on Amazon.com reviews. For example, a product gets a lot of 5 star reviews stating that the buyer bought it for their child/relative/friend and they are just sure that they will love it... 5 stars! Or &#34;I just got this delivered yesterday and I haven&#39;t used it yet but it looks really great!&#34;... 5 stars.These are then immediately followed by a 1 star review along the lines of &#34;This is the biggest piece of junk I&#39;ve ever bought online. Will be returning to Amazon. DO NOT BUY!&#34;These aren&#39;t to be confused with the indiscriminate idiots who can&#39;t be bothered to use their brains, who leave mindless reviews such as &#34;This is junk but it was cheap and kinda works... 5 stars!&#34; Right.Most times this trend of 5&#39;s followed by 1&#39;s is seen even in the first page of reviews. It&#39;s a serious problem with the platform. I usually search for reviews written by people who have had the product for a week or two and give the pros/cons along with a less than 5 star rating. That helps me avoid the fakes and the idiots.This makes me wonder why Amazon, in all their analytical genius, isn&#39;t cracking down on this when it&#39;s so blatantly obvious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s gotten to the point where a product with thousands of reviews and an average 4.5 - 5 star rating immediately raises a red flag with me.And Amazon appears unmotivated to do anything about it. As a personal example, I had purchased a mouth guard that had over six thousand 5-star reviews. It was listed as high quality, FDA approved, etc. When I received it, it was a piece of plastic junk with inkjet quality instructions in English and Chinese. Along with it came a note promising a $10 Amazon gift card if I left a 5 star review and emailed them proof of it.I took a photo of the note and forwarded it to Amazon expecting some action - instead I received a canned response about &#34;we take these issues seriously&#34;. A year later, that seller is still there with dozens of products, all with thousands of 5-star reviews."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last year, I posted a negative review of an inexpensive (~$10) electronic device on Amazon. A few weeks later, the seller contacted me with an offer of a $20 Amazon gift certificate to take it down. I didn&#39;t respond. A few days later, they offered $30, then $40, then $50."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is an interesting peer reviewed paper published last month with analysis of existing facts about the origin of covid-19. A part from their conclusion:More than a year after the initial documented cases in Wuhan, the source of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be identified, and the search for a direct or intermediate host in nature has been so far unsuccessful.The low binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat ACE2 studied to date does not support Chiroptera as a direct zoonotic agent. Furthermore, the reliance on pangolin coronavirus receptor binding domain (RBD) similarity to SARS-CoV-2 as evidence for natural zoonotic spillover is flawed, as pangolins are unlikely to play a role in SARS-CoV-2′s origin and recombination is not supported by recent analysis.At the same time, genomic analyses pointed out that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits multiple peculiar characteristics not found in other Sarbecoviruses.A novel multibasic furin cleavage site (FCS) confers numerous pathogenetically advantageous capabilities, the existence of which is difficult to explain though natural evolution...source: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-021-01211-0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;... proponents of lab escape can explain all the available facts about SARS2 considerably more easily than can those who favor natural emergence.&#34;&#34;The natural emergence theory battles a bristling array of implausibilities.&#34;This is a fantastic article, but amazingly almost all of it is year-old news. Most of this was known in March 2020, and nearly all of it by the end of 2020. How does it take so long for the truth to win?I published a meta-analysis covering much of the same ground in November 2020 and this was only after waiting and expecting for several months that someone with a better platform would do so first. The article above covers the most important points but the story does go deeper: https://followtheplot.org/covid19"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the media successfully conflated four separate questions:a) Did it form in nature or in a lab?b) Did it become more communicable via nature or via the lab?c) Did it make it to humans through nature (or wet market) or via the lab?d) If it came from the lab was it on purpose or an accident?as simply &#34;OMG IT CAME FROM A LAB&#34; and then claimed it&#39;s all a conspiracy theory.The media as a whole shot themselves in the foot on this one and we&#39;ll all be worse off for it."</p>

S3 can be cost efficient, but only if you don&#39;t touch data :)Their price calculation doesn&#39;t mention cost of S3 requests, which very quickly adds up and is often neglected.It costs $1 for 2.5M GET requests to S3. They have 180 shards, in a general case query seems to fetch all of them. Presumably they don&#39;t download full shard per request, but download an index + some relevant ranges. Lets say that is 10 requests per shard. So that would be 1800 S3 GET requests = ~1400 search queries cost them $1.Assuming their service is reasonably popular and serve 1 req/second on average, that would be $1,440 per 30 days in addition to advertised $1,000 spent on EC2 and S3 storage.Seems comparable to AWS ElasticSearch service costs:- 3 nodes m5.2xlarge.elasticsearch = $1,200- 20TB EBS storage = $1,638"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this speaks to the power of defaults. 96% of users have not turned this on because they didn&#39;t even know that its disabled, and when an app asks you if they can track you, the response is going to be a strong no. The reality is that FB&#39;s entire business model has been predicated on the default being that tracking is allowed.If this holds, this will be cataclysmic for FB. You can&#39;t have a huge portion of your wealthy user base just disappear and expect advertisers to keep paying what they were paying previously.BTW, this is also why the covid exposure notification apps failed miserably. They should have always been opt-out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why would you enable it? What possible benefit is there in doing so?The ads won&#39;t get better regardless of the data they have on you. They aren&#39;t exactly using ML or AI to help you get better ads. Its really just boring data queries in SQL or some graph language. That&#39;s the sum total of most advertising intelligence. Its not 21st century high tech. Its mostly relational databases with some NoSQL to make that table linking faster and cached. In cases where they do actually bring out that NoSQL it is to reimplement all the relational smarts just with extra steps. Then its at least shiny and cool.The whole thing is really just about storing and gathering a profile on you as part of them building an asset they can later resell. Creepy technology for creepy uses. An asset full of subtle errors about you that can likely never be seen or fixed. Much later they will invariably then leave all or some of it on a usb stick or some poorly protected cloud server. After that your details will end up in the hands of some scammer or other miscreant to enable them to send you endless emails full of typos, lies, emojis and if you&#39;re exceptionally average like the rest of us: an interesting tale about long lost nigerian princes just needing a bank account. If you&#39;re lucky.So, yeah, leave it disabled. There&#39;s really no point in doing otherwise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Based on Apple’s job postings I’m beginning to suspect their stance on ads and tracking was nothing more than a clever ruse to weaken competitors while they build their own a personalized ad business for iOS:https://i.imgur.com/y1s9F4JThey also just hired Facebook’s first ads targeting product manager to work for their ad platform. I don’t think Apple ads won’t be limited to the App Store within a couple years."</p>

It&#39;ll take a private company to provide one single website to explore and find all datasets from around the world, making it easier to look at holistic patterns that are happening around the world, or compare patterns between countries.Though, I would expect a much better UX from Google nowadays. This site has more in common with Google Scholar than Google Search.And ultimately I&#39;d like to see them build something where people don&#39;t need to download datasets in order to make use of the data.I compare the state of open data to the state of mapping software before Google Maps. You needed to download map files and open them on special software that you open on your computer to make sense of the data. And then Google Maps came along and flipped that whole model. Open data needs the same leap forward in order for more people to make greater use of open data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great resource. At Splitgraph, we index ~40k open data sets, and we make sure to include structured metadata for each one, so we show up in these results. (example [0])One cool aspect of this metadata is that it allows a dataset to have multiple sources. So if two sites index the same dataset, there is no duplicate content penalty like there might be with textual content. If you search for a dataset, it will include links to all its sources (whether canonical or otherwise).For most of the data we index at Splitgraph, the canonical source is 
an open government data portal powered by Socrata (e.g. data.cdc.gov). We noticed that Socrata powered a lot of portals, so we wrote a Socrata plugin for Splitgraph, along with a scraper to index the metadata. The plugin basically implements a Postgres FDW so that Splitgraph can translate from SQL to the upstream query language. In this case, the plugin translates to Socrata&#39;s bespoke API language. But for private deployments we also have plugins for Snowflake, Postgres, some SaaS services, etc.If you find some data on Google Dataset Search with Splitgraph listed as a source, please take a look! Our &#34;Data Delivery Network&#34; (DDN) is implemented on top of the Postgres wire protocol, so you can connect with any Postgres client (or use our web editor). All the Postgres query syntax is available to you; you can even JOIN across any of the other 40k+ datasets indexed at Splitgraph. That includes &#34;live data&#34; like Socrata portals, but also versioned snapshots of data called &#34;data images.&#34; Here&#39;s an example of a point-in-time query across two snapshots (basically a diff) [1], and another query that joins across tables at data.cityofchicago.org and data.cambridgema.gov [2].[0] https://www.splitgraph.com/cdc-gov/distribution-of-covid19-d... – &#34;View Source&#34; to see the Schema.org metadata[1] https://bit.ly/3epvxcj[2] https://bit.ly/3f1ll8K(Sorry for the bit.ly links. The URL for our query editor includes the full SQL string, and I don&#39;t want to mess up HN formatting.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can confirm. I’m friends with a group of very smart distributed systems engineers who were excited to launch an actually useful crypto project that gets talked about here from time to time.As much as they’re excited about the technology itself, very few people are actually interested in using it. Instead, their business seems to revolve around the value of the utility tokens for their project.Few people are buying the utility tokens to pay for the service. They’re buying them to horde so they can resell to other speculators when the price goes up. They have a lot of tokens in circulation, but only a small number of them get used to pay for the service. Many of them are sitting in the wallets of exchanges where they get traded back and forth but never come near the blockchain.Investors only care about getting more press releases out so they can pump up the price of their discounted tokens, which have a shortened lockup period relative to something like stocks. It’s almost like a pump-and-dump scheme for investors.Maybe their underlying project will become popular in the future, but the volatility of the token price makes it increasingly unattractive for companies that want to actually use it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 2. You aim to build a community, but in reality 90% of your telegram/discord are scammers and people asking why price is going down/accusations that you and your entire team should go to jail.I&#39;m consistently repulsed by the lack of thoughtful discussion in crypto communities. For a space littered with intriguing technology it&#39;s endlessly frustrating that there&#39;s no HN-like forum. Instead, any community that started off that way is now filled with speculators and shillers.Take your pick for where to source your news: 1. crypto influencers on YouTube who are paid to shill, 2. forums likw Reddit filled with speculators and conmen, 3. pump and dump groups on Telegram.The greed and FOMO on display in the crypto gold-rush is deeply depressing, and for the majority who join the craze at the peak of the bull run, it&#39;ll surely end in tears."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone interested in all of cryptography, I cringe every single time when we call blockchain &#34;crypto&#34;.Sure, there&#39;s cryptography in it. But you don&#39;t call a mail or http server &#34;crypto&#34;. There&#39;s similar tech in git, we don&#39;t call it &#34;crypto&#34;, we call it VCS.Calling this &#34;crypto&#34; is just trying to add a mystic aura for stuff people don&#39;t understand, to further muddy the waters.We have a word for this technology. It&#39;s not &#34;crypto&#34;. It&#39;s blockchain.Sure, it&#39;s your shorthand for &#34;cryptocoin&#34; or &#34;cryptovalue&#34;. Which are again newspeak for blockchain, and we could argue that given its limits and usage of the last years they should be called crypto-investment, at best.Which is still like ordering a pizza and forcefully referring to it only as &#34;food&#34;. I want a pepperoni-food please.Sorry for the rant, but it really feels like it&#39;s just a way to further embellish something with dubious values like the post points out"</p>
