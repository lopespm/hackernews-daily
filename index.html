Some place in some kind of Internet Hall of Fame, an historical archive which shows the only best highlights of what websites were actually capable of presenting. Milestones of web development.This page summarizes pretty good what web technology is capable of, when in the hands of a real professional.---Ok, I just realized this is from Bartosz Ciechanowski, and this reminded me of the Cameras and Lenses [1] article which I&#39;ve seen recently. It was the same kind of quality.This man is a real genius.[1] https://ciechanow.ski/cameras-and-lenses/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few thoughts while reading this:In addition to a deeper understanding of engine manufacturing considerations than I even knew I cared to learn, this article helps me appreciate why people are into engine work.The perfect tolerances and synchronization of these machines makes me a little ashamed to use the word &#34;engineer&#34; in my title of &#34;software engineer&#34;. There is no real comparison of the quality of the result.And then I skimmed the source, and it makes me think the author deserves that title. It also validates my belief in vanilla javascript.edit: And later it occurs to me that Mr. Ciechanowski is a true craftsman of software; handmade and built to 1) Be beautiful (and informative), 2) last for years. (The open web standards are the ones that seem to stick around the longest, for better or for worse. (I&#39;m ignorant of the shader world though))"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was a boy, my dad decided that our &#39;66 Mustang with a straight 4-cylinder engine needed new piston rings.  I helped a bit but mostly watched as he tore down the engine to the barest elements, only the engine mounts keeping the block held up in the compartment. The crankshaft, connecting rods, tappers valves, piston heads, piston rods, all laid out neatly on the garage floor along with all the nuts, bolts, washers, seals, gaskets, belts, and everything else you see in this video.Although I really appreciate the reliability, efficiency, and durability that modern engine design has brought, a part of me is sad that modern cars are all about chips and software, and the average guy in his garage or under a shadetree can no longer break one down to the bare bones of electromechanical parts and put it back together better than it was."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think this is really about making fun of people&#39;s names, or holocaust references. It&#39;s about power.The managers at basecamp were unhappy that their employees asserted power over them in the workplace, and decided to assert their own power in turn over what they view as their personal fiefdom and retract some of the freedoms they had so graciously granted their workers, because those ungrateful workers actually expected them to live up to their words about openness and owning mistakes. At least 1/3 of the staff, when confronted with their true relations with their management, then decided to quit.I did find it amusing they announced this new policy of no personal/political stuff at work on his personal blog on hey.com, not on a company blog, and DHH continues to rant on twitter about a very political and public fight with Apple, one he chose to enter on behalf of the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly the employees who left have the best career prospects.  Entire iOS team, head of marketing and head of product team.The 6 months free money is hard for anyone entering a strong job market to pass up.A lot of comments seem to think 1/3 left because of the no politics policy.  1 / 3 left because it would increase their wealth or give them the summer covid took away last year.How many people would leave your job now for 6 months salary?  How many could get a job tomorrow if they did?A few probably left because they want to change social policy.  Many are probably staying but still want to change social policy.  The head of marketing, products and the iOS team are not leaving because of social policy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of comments around the line of &#34;ok maybe 30% is too much, but we can all agree they offer a valuable service, so what percentage should they take ?&#34;Uhhhh, not a percentage ? Do you imagine AWS billing you a % of your revenue instead of a given price for a given service ?Give a price to be listed in store, to be reviewed, to be downloaded by a user, ... And let company pay what they owe you. Let them pay through the provider they can negotiate and then pay you back the cost they owe you.It&#39;s ridiculous that it doesn&#39;t matter if my app has a 5$ sub or a 50$ sub, I owe them 30% anyway. What they provided is the same in both cases, they should be able to price it out to me. Their current pricing structure is not setup like a fee for services and infrastructure usage, it&#39;s setup like a tax."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unpopular opinion:This was a no brainer. Apple wanted 30% (or was it less for subscriptions?) on any business that used apps, no matter if they used apple infrastructure or not.Just think about it: one company is in practice  entitled to 30% of what any other business makes (in any industry)!!Also,  I think apple brought this to themselves by picking a fight with Spotify (on Watch support)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since this is an EU case, that should mean it&#39;ll actually do something, and won&#39;t take a decade and a half to conclude.The penalty won&#39;t be the big deal here, it&#39;ll be what Apple is prohibited from doing. And it&#39;ll be really exciting if the precedent set blows back on the entire 30%-rent-seeking-platform-industry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article moves the goalposts on what &#34;right to repair&#34; is several times. It generally means that manufacturers should not hide schematics from device users or disallow third party manufacturing of first party parts. However, the author states:&gt; The law doesn&#39;t yet cover smartphones and tablets that she says are getting harder to fix. One problem is keeping older devices updated with new software.Now &#34;right to repair&#34; includes not only designing devices to be easier to repair but also includes legacy software support? Where do we draw this line? If your M1 dies, you can&#39;t fab one yourself or run older software on it indefinitely.Further down, the author writes:&gt; But markets have now become flooded with products that are less repairable.&gt; &#34;It requires laws in place that prevent manufacturers from stopping [supporting] a product too early, or making it pretty much impossible to repair it by design.&#34;Now the author has shifted &#34;right to repair&#34; to mean mandatory first-party device support and design requirements around repair-ability.We must very carefully define our terms here, because requiring someone else to provide on one&#39;s behalf presumes a right to the product of their labor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want to help support right to repair (in US) consider donating to Louis Rossmann&#39;s GoFundMe for right to repair:https://www.gofundme.com/f/lets-get-right-to-repair-passed?u..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PCs and even most laptops have been very repairable for decades. You can still run Windows or Linux on a 10+ (20+?) year old laptop without an issue. The idea that a 5 year old laptop would be unusable or not get the latest version of Windows is unacceptable.Yet phones cost similar amounts and have nowhere near the repairability. A decade ago you could argue that it wasn&#39;t that important - specs were changing so quickly that new phones became obsolete too quickly. But now it&#39;s a maturing technology, older devices are perfectly good and we still don&#39;t have an ecosystem which encourages longevity and re-use.This is eminently doable - phones are essentially integrated computers. The only reason phones are locked and PCs aren&#39;t is historical. If phone manufacturers aren&#39;t willing to do it themselves, we should legislate before even more e-waste is generated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Alright HN, I need your help.Sorry for the approximative English, I&#39;m losing my vocabulary with WFH and I&#39;m pretty sleep-deprived.I&#39;ve been building a game streaming platform for influencers for the past months. We scaled to 9k users in a month.We have android x86 running on QEMU-KVM and there are a bunch of issues I need to address.- virsh (and virt-manager) always add a PS2 mouse to the guest. The issue is PS2 mouses have a relative movement and not an absolute one -&gt; When you use a mouse or the touch screen through VNC you have to move the pointer to a position instead of directly clicking/capturing the mouse- My VM resolutions are 720x1080 but VNC always launches in 1920x1080. I have black rectangles on both sides of the Screen.- Streaming the app viewport with VNC has some (small) latency, any way to fix it?- Can we host an arm android emulator on QEMU? (armeabi-v7 or v8)- We had a sales presentation from Canonical for their anbox cloud solution, but they never returned to us with a proposal. Is there any other way for us to have the Android VMs in K8S? Or even Lxc if possible, we are flexible. Also, the juju charms for anbox is nowhere to be foundIf you want to get in contact, my email is jadiaheno[at]ludexgames.com
I can even show you a demo, we have influencers increasing their revenue with our Beat the boss campaign. We&#39;re not VC backed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Semi-related question... I recently spent an evening trying to familiarize myself with virtualization tooling and my initial impression was that the CLI experience for kvm and hyper-v was rather clunky compared to let&#39;s say docker, gcloud, ignite and kubectl. Also a lot of the learning material seems to be oriented towards GUI. It could be that I just haven&#39;t spent enough time with kvm and hyper-v. I&#39;ve spent a LOT of time on those other tools so maybe I&#39;m just more used to them.Is there good CLI tooling available for virtualization? I would say that I&#39;m looking for the &#34;on-prem&#34; experience where I start by configuring a virtual network, download some unmodified ISOs directly from the operating system vendor, provision my headless virtual machines with a combination of Powershell, Answer files, Bash and Kickstart. I then provide services like DHCP and DNS using my virtual machines rather than the built-in mechanism provided by the virtualization tooling."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article unfortunately doesn&#39;t address the business side of the problem.  Fast food restaurants, or place like &#34;Dale&#39;s&#34; mentioned in the article, make very little profit.  It is most likely below 10%.  Here is an estimate:  https://www.restaurant365.com/blog/what-is-the-average-profi....A 10% profit is very modest.  That&#39;s not the story of the &#34;fat cats getting rich on the back of the workers&#34; that the article is alluding to.The problem for the business is that the financial model is set by the fixed or imperative costs, i.e. the cost of rent, the cost of maintaining the capital equipment, the cost of cleaning to meet codes, insurance, etc.  The cost of labor, for cooks, wait staff, etc. is often the biggest part of the expense budget for restaurants.With such a small profit margin, arbitrarily raising everyone&#39;s wages is likely going to kill the business.  There is no room in the budget.  The only choice is to either automate, which will reduce the labor requirements, or raise prices and hope that customers won&#39;t just go down the street.  But they will, they will go down the street--until everyone&#39;s prices go up and there is nowhere else to go.  And all of this is free market capitalism at work.  It is a continuous process of reinvention.In short, I&#39;m not saying that higher wages aren&#39;t necessary, I&#39;m just saying that both sides of the equation need to be examined, i.e. the plight of the worker AND the plight of the business.  And we need to understand that things will probably get ugly before they get better.  Because that&#39;s how capitalism and free market economies work.But watch out for technology and automation...that is the part of the equation that has been &#34;solving&#34; the labor problem for some time now..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honest question: why do discussions about minimum wage in the U.S. never propose having teenagers having a different minimum to adults?In australia we have a $12.50/hr minimum for 15 year olds. It climbs in increments until about $25/hr.This system allows teenagers to get a foot in the door for low-skilled jobs, and allows adults to get paid a livable wage.The result is that a lot of fast food jobs are performed by teenagers, and they are considered entry level jobs. Adults are then paid more, and take positions where they can add more value that what a teen can provide."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem that is never addressed in these &#34;terrible job&#34; &#34;terrible wage.  wages too low&#34; stories is:Making dual income households the norm was the mistake that has led us to this point.  The reason that a fast food job is so impossible to survive on is that at one point, a single guy living in a small apartment and driving a modest car could afford that because his purchasing power was essentially DOUBLE what it is now.That isn&#39;t an option anymore.  If you want to be single, you need to also have a high paying job to do it.  The other option is poverty, and maybe social services making up some of the costs that for many households is being made up by their spouse.But it actually is a little worse than that, since it&#39;s being burned at both ends.  For instance: I&#39;m married.  My wife and I are both extremely well paid software developers.  This means that we have TWICE the power to buy a house, buy a car, pay for services like cleaners, buy a couch, buy a TV, etc.  So now not only is a single person&#39;s wage lower due to a flood of the supply side, he&#39;s also screwed because the people doubling up on their income have pushed the demand side into the stratosphere.It sucks, and it breaks my heart seeing the world that my single friends have to live in.  Not only are they basically living in poverty, but it makes them unattractive to potential partners who they need to get OUT of that poverty.I honestly can&#39;t really even imagine what the solution is.  We certainly aren&#39;t going to put the dual income toothpaste back in the tube.  Central economic authority forcing businesses to just increase their wages also doesn&#39;t seem to be a solution either, since it obviously doesn&#39;t even try to address the underlying problem (labor economics, mostly)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a brilliant architecture.Everyone here talking about no email clients, IMAP and AWS restrictions is missing the point. Although you could use this as a personal account, or as a company. This fully automated system is a perfect ground layer to a number of applications with a very cleaver API.Say you are a small startup, and you will need some email functionality? Give your web server access to writing to outbox and you can send email. Use the sender with + rules and you get replies with customerId, threadId etc. Need to show email interactions in your service UI? Subscribe to the notification channels. Need customer support platform, it is almost built-in.If you don&#39;t see value in this solution, you probably never tried to setup infrastructure to receive email. In fact, at $work, I developed a very similar architecture and it is running flawlessly for 15 months or so. We just don&#39;t do all this git+lambda craziness, we just had already setup EC2 that we added some routes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great but it&#39;s a bit misleading.It only store email on S3, that mean you cannot read email with your email client.Seem thing with outgoing, you upload email to s3 in a certain format to be send out, not smtp protocolThis is more like an API for sending and receiving. You cannot say generate SMTP credential and drop in your mail client.Also, one of the limitation with AWS SES is you cannot sent FROM or RETURN-PATH to anything, even in production mode, you can only set frm or return-path to verified domain.I have an internal AWS SES/Lambda stacks that I used for email forwarding(only receiving) which use SES to accept email, trigger a lambda and use SES to send a copy to a personal inbox. Plan to cleanup it a bit and release"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A serverless server?It is a great illustration of how the term &#34;serverless&#34; has shifted from literally no server (ex: sqlite database) to &#34;somebody else&#39;s computer&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HN&#39;s second-chance pool is a way to give links a second chance at the front page. Moderators and a small number of reviewers go through old submissions looking for articles that are in the spirit of the site—gratifying intellectual curiosity—and which seem like they might interest the community. These get put into a hopper from which software randomly picks one every so often and lobs it randomly onto the lower part of the front page. If it interests the community, it gets upvoted and discussed; if not, it falls off.We started doing this in late 2014. There&#39;s an old explanation at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11662380, with links back to older ones. We&#39;ve talked about it in comments and whatnot (https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que..., https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...), and have intended to publish the list, but only did so recently. We&#39;re slow.If you see a submission that didn&#39;t get attention and which you think is particularly good for HN, please tell us at hn@ycombinator.com! We love getting those requests and usually add them to the pool. It&#39;s fine if it&#39;s your own article, but we like it best when it&#39;s just something you ran across and recognized as good. That&#39;s more the kind of interest that HN is for.A related list is https://news.ycombinator.com/invited. Those are old submissions that we ran across and thought deserved more attention, so we emailed and asked the submitter to repost it. Yesterday&#39;s top story was one of these (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26982286). They all go into the second-chance pool, but maybe it&#39;s interesting to see them broken out as a subset too. (If you don&#39;t have an email address in your profile, please put one in so we can send you repost invites!)If you read the old explanations I linked to, you&#39;ll see that the original plan was to turn this system into software that anyone can participate in, likely as a new way to earn karma: users who discover second-chance links that hit the jackpot (that is, which interest the community) would get karma along with the original submitter. That is still the plan! We&#39;re just slow.I think that&#39;s about everything there is to say about the second-chance pool. Questions, feedback, ideas, and views are welcome as ever. And please, everybody keep an eye out for obscure, out-of-the-way stories that got overlooked and let us know when you run across them. It&#39;s one of the best things you can do to help make this place more interesting. Best of all are the kind that can&#39;t be predicted from any existing sequence: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sor...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My suggestion would be to automatically add submissions of unique posts to the second chance pool or have a reviewer look at them when they&#39;re for a domain or user with a high hit rate but fall off new. I&#39;m mostly thinking about technical blogs with consistent article quality like https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=ciechanow.ski , https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=raphlinus.github.io and https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=scattered-thoughts.ne...I&#39;m biased on this though, as someone this might impact (https://news.ycombinator.com/from?site=thume.ca). From talking to other technical bloggers the consensus does seem to be that when we put a lot of effort into a technical article it nearly always makes it to the top of https://lobste.rs/ and /r/programming because it starts on the front page there but will sometimes flop off new on HN and maybe only make it months later if someone else resubmits the post."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for all the quiet moderation work you do to make HN so great. I can say that you’ve personally made my life better, and I’m sure many others would say the same."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author of Vite here. I see many people evaluating Vite as a webpack replacement, so I want to clarify the goal of the project here:It is NOT Vite&#39;s goal to completely replace webpack. There are probably a small number of features/capabilities that some existing webpack projects rely on that doesn&#39;t exist in Vite, but those features are in the long tail and are only needed by a small number of power users who write bespoke webpack configuration. Some of the commenters here probably belong in this group. If you do (e.g. you tried to migrate and found roadblocks, or evaluated and concluded that Vite doesn&#39;t suite your needs), use webpack by all means! You are not Vite&#39;s target audience by design - and you should absolutely pick the right tool for the job.However, in the context of the general web dev population, 90% of existing devs and 100% of beginners don&#39;t need or care about these long tail features. This is an estimation made based on years of experience working on vue-cli, which is webpack-based. (context: I&#39;m also the author of Vue.js and vue-cli is downloaded more than 3 million times per month on npm). Vite is optimized for these common use cases, and we&#39;ve heard many success stories of painlessly moving from vue-cli/CRA to Vite.This is also why Vite is a good fit for Repl.it where majority of its use cases overlap with the target use cases of Vite.That said, we are also seeing frameworks like Svelte/Solid/Marko building SSR meta frameworks on top of Vite, projects that were previously webpack-based offering alternative modes running on top of Vite (e.g. Nuxt, Storybook), so we believe Vite does cover quite a lot even for power users.So - try it, and if it doesn&#39;t work for you, stick to webpack (specially if you have an existing project relying on specific webpack behavior). As many people said, webpack 5 has made decent performance gains, and if you are targeting modern browsers, consider replacing Babel/TS with esbuild. These should already get you pretty far."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some stats not mentioned in the post. Create React App (webpack) vs Vite (esbuild) on Replit containers:- 1 second start up time on Vite vs 15 seconds for CRA- React.js hello world project is 234mb on CRA and only 34mb on Vite- 1GB RAM for Vite dev server vs 3GB+ for CRAThis is a perfect example of how fast and efficient tools can be, and I think we can do even better! Super excited about the future of JavaScript tooling ecosystem with more focus on efficiency and speed.In addition to the UX win, and I wish we measured this, but I bet this saved us thousands of dollars in monthly cloud spend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Webdev truly is one of a kind. Not only do you have your source code, you also have your build code, oddly dictating the organization of your source code. For extra fun, some libraries don&#39;t build with build system a, others require build system b, when you&#39;re lucky enough to have a working mix, changing build systems is better to be avoided. Of course periodically the officially blessed build system for your used libraries changes.The webdev ecosystem is so broken, it&#39;s no wonder so many websites deliver assets that are extremely suboptimally optimised, big unused blobs of assets /scripts slowing page load, optimising it all is actually made harder than coding it all."</p>
