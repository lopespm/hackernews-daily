Today you want to watch an Apple show you must go to Apple&#39;s VOD.We could really use laws that force, once again, some sort of separation between production and distribution. Better stuff gets made in this kind of ecosystem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"First, congrats!But second, I&#39;d love to understand the compute vs storage tradeoff chosen here. Looking at the (pretty!) picture [1], I  was shocked to see &#34;Wow, it&#39;s mostly storage?&#34;. Is that from going all flash?Heading to https://oxide.computer/product for more details, lists:- 2048 cores- 30 TB of memory- 1024 TB of flash (1 PiB)Given how much of the rack is storage, I&#39;m not sure which Milan was chosen (and so whether that&#39;s 2048 threads or 4196 [edit: real cores, 4196 threads]), but it seems like visually 4U is compute? [edit: nope] Is that a mistake on my part, because dual-socket Milan at 128 threads per socket is 256 threads per server, so you need at least 8 servers to hit 2048 &#34;somethings&#34;, or do the storage nodes also 
 have Milans [would make sense] and their compute is included [also fine!] -- and so similarly that&#39;s how you get a funky 30 TiB of memory?[Top-level edit from below: the green stuff are the nodes, including the compute. The 4U near the middle is the fiber]P.S.: the &#34;NETWORK SPEED 100 GB/S&#34; in all caps / CSS loses the presumably 100 Gbps (though the value in the HTML is 100 gb/s which is also unclear).[1] https://oxide.computer/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Frenders%2..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m most excited for the treesitter integration and its potential to amplify Vim&#39;s &#34;killer feature&#34;: text editing as a language.Vim&#39;s editing language feels most powerful when I&#39;m using its text objects: &#34;ciw&#34; means &#34;change in word&#34;, &#34;cis&#34; means &#34;change in sentence&#34;, and so on. But Vim&#39;s built-in text objects are not always a perfect match for the code you&#39;re editing. Suppose you want to change the first argument of a function, for example; there&#39;s no built-in &#34;first-argument&#34; text object. But Treesitter integration makes it easy to create text objects that understand the AST. Without much effort, users will be able to make mappings like `cia1` to &#34;change in argument 1&#34;, and these mappings will work across all languages with Treesitter support."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use nvim in the terminal and gvim/macvim on the desktop. I don&#39;t like how the nvim community seems to be throwing themselves wholeheartedly into lua and lua-only plugins (vimscript plugins are better because they work with both vim and neovim). Switching to init.lua also means losing all compatibility with vim, and I cannot fathom why people would want to do that considering that there is nothing that init.vim cannot already do.I also don&#39;t like how there looks to be an upcoming split in the plugin community when Vimscript 9 releases and the neovim community will ignore it while plugin authors in the vim camp (e.g tpope) may start moving their plugins over to it.That said, the built-in LSP for nvim is very good thing and I plan to migrate away from the node-dependent coc.nvim once nvim 0.5 releases."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neovim 0.5 is awesome. It has native LSP support, Lua configuration support that it feels like true revolution over past versions.But, getting into optimal setup in neovim/vim involves lot of configuration.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actually, it&#39;s somewhat worse than the headline mentions. It seems that the script targets channels that merely mention Libera in the topic. The topic of an affected channel I was in said: &#34;See also #foo on irc.libera.chat&#34; (as we hadn&#39;t decided whether or not to move). And everyone in the channel was banned from both the #foo and the ##foo channels on Freenode.Needless to say, Freenode kindly decided for us whether or not we should move to Libera for good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We also got a number of channels totalling a few hundred names  hijacked from chanserv, because of &#39;libera.chat&#39; in the topic. No contact, nothing. We aren&#39;t even a F/OSS project, but a hackerspace. 10 years of a chanserv registration, gone, just like that.The irony is that we were planning on a progressive transition to Libera via bridging to make sure everything went smoothly for everyone and that we didn&#39;t split the community. Now, well, there&#39;s nothing to do but just move cold turkey.Great job, Andrew Lee."</p>

Some of our staff were pushing harder for Libera, and I was concerned it was a bit fervent and sensational, but ultimately went along with it.It&#39;s been sad to see over the last week how quickly they were proven right, and how it only took a few days for the new so-called freenode to deal a killing blow.Had we been still uncommitted to the Libera move, Andrew&#39;s actions this morning would have hurt our community more."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very good to watch a “Hard Sci-Fi” show like the expanse. Not many of these out there.Not just the UI, but The tech is realistic and possible and usually backed up by basic scientific principles.The social scenarios are also quite likely in the future.Even the language makes sense - a kind of hodge-Podge universal accent.And it tangentially originates from Larry Niven’s belter stories just before mankind sent the ram robots to distant stars.The Expanse is everything to like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the most unrealistic things about depictions of futuristic computer systems and UI design is that they almost always do exactly what the character wants with a minimum of hassle. No, technology in the future is going to cause as many problems and as much frustration as it does today. And those problems will be more keenly felt, because in space, your life depends on the technology working properly. There should be episodes where, for example, the main challenge and risk doesn&#39;t come from aliens or hostile humans, but from the fact that the OS running the ship&#39;s engines crashes and needs to be restarted every 5 minutes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a comment by Adam Savge on one of his YouTube videos where he visited the sets. He also had a brief cameo in one episode (as a ceew member of the Arboghast, I believe), sitting at a terminal. He remarks that the terminal screen wasn&#39;t just showing a random animation, but had a fledged out menu system that changed screens on touch input. So he could actually &#34;use&#34; the station while acting instead of just making stuff up.As far as I know, a lot of films had only blank screens on set and the computer display was added in post, trying to match whatever &#34;interaction&#34; the actors came up with on the set."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a bit surprising, but hardly the biggest problem. I’ve posted before about it, but academic has to get away from the infantilism of using KPIs to judge creative intellectual work.Part of the problem is that people seem to want an objective evaluation of a piece of research, and measure the value for taxpayer money. Well, you can’t get an objective evaluation. It’s all subjective. And “impact” as a quantifiable entity in general is nonsense, for one thing the timescales prohibit its measurement at the point where it may be useful.The solution is to use management. Lots of people object here and say “but nepotism, favouritism” and yep that’s a problem, but it is less of a problem that the decline of western universities. You can circumvent it somewhat by rotation, by involving external figures, by a hierarchy that ensures people are not colluding, but ultimately you just have to trust people and accept some wastage.People aren’t in academia for the money. It’s a vocation. You’re not going to have many people milking the system. Things went pretty well before the metric culture invaded the academy. They can go well again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One way forward could be to lower the bar for publications.Once it&#39;s no longer about being in the esteemed and scarce &#34;10%&#34;, they won&#39;t bother because they don&#39;t need to. Imagine a process where the only criteria are technical soundness and novelty, and as long as minimal standards are met, it&#39;s a &#34;go&#34;. Call it the &#34;ArXiv + quality check&#34; model.Neither formal acceptance to publish nor citation numbers truly mark scientific excellence; perhaps, winning a &#34;test of time award&#34; does, or appearing in a text book 10 years later.I&#39;ve been reviewing occasionally since ~1995, regularly since ~2004, and I&#39;ve never heard of collusion rings happening in my sub-area of CS (ML, IR, NLP). I have caught people submitting to multiple conferences without disclosing it. Ignoring past work that is relevant is common, more often our of blissful ignorance, and occasionally likely with full intent. I&#39;m not saying I doubt the report, but I suspect the bigger problem that CS has is a large percentage of poor-quality work that couldn&#39;t be replicated.BTW, the most blantant thing I&#39;ve heard of (from a contact complaining about it on LinkedIn) is someone had their very own core paper from their PhD thesis plagiarised - submitted to another conference (again) but with different author names on it... and they even cited the real author&#39;s PhD thesis!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The part I found interesting was that the author notes that it is well-known that the quality of the work has little to do with its odds of acceptance even when the system is &#39;functioning&#39; as designed. Is it cheating to game a system that is already fundamentally broken? If the quality of your work is inadequate to secure publication and your career depends on it, it wouldn&#39;t be very hard to convince yourself that you can&#39;t cheat a rigged game. What &#39;integrity&#39; is actually being threatened? Perhaps some of the energy devoted to identifying these collusion rings would be better spent developing a review process that is at least somewhat biased in favour of good research rather than the density of the authors&#39; professional network.  Or at least in mitigating the poisonous &#39;publish or perish&#39; rules that lead to this sort of phenomena."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the linked Notion &#34;Receipts&#34; page:&gt; I&#39;ve struggled to understand why so many people have piled on to these absurd accusations without facts.I watched a similar situation play out in real time. A friend had to fire an employee who wasn&#39;t submitting work or even responding to communications. The employe retaliated by using their moderately large social media presence to disparage my friend and her company.Strangely enough, other people with zero experience in the matter were piling on to support the claims. It seemed they felt obligated to amplify and lend credence to the allegations of one of their social media friends.The experience was extremely stressful for my friend, but ultimately the former employee cooled off and deleted many of the posts. It&#39;s hard to tell how much damage was done in the process, but I was stunned at how someone with zero evidence and an obvious axe to grind could rally such disdain for someone else with little more than a few unsubstantiated social media posts."</p>
