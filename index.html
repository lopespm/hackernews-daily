								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a lot of people are choosing to ignore that a lot of companies have done things in the past that were not illegal at the time of action. However, those actions were later decided to be made illegal because the behavior was deemed to be antithetical to our values.For example, Standard Oil did not break any laws in its ruthless consolidation of the nascent oil industry.  In fact, it exploited the law to allow it to grow into the monstrosity that it eventually became.  In response, Congress passed the Sherman Antitrust Act in 1890 which subsequently prevented the actions that Standard Oil had used to consolidate the market.There should be no question, that what FB is doing here, while not illegal, is highly dubious ethically."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t personally use FB and don’t have a very favorable view of their products.I would, however, like to see the same level scrutiny applied to the general American media, especially the news media. FB has come in and started eating their lunch. There’s a deeper problem here, and it feels more like the powers that he want to take down FB.I’m not denying any allegation made against FB, but why is it that Fox News, CNN, MSNBC, and Hollywood get a pass when they’ve been damaging America for much longer than FB has existed?If the government sees a problem and wants to get involved - great. But let’s hold an equal bar."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I highly recommend watching the Senate hearing from today, and I&#39;m a person who normally can&#39;t stand these things. This was totally different from any other hearing I&#39;ve seen -- little grandstanding, no partisan bickering, no evading of questions. Most of the Senators seemed genuinely interested in what Frances had to say, and she gave meaningful insights backed by real data.A lot of what she&#39;s saying is stuff that has been generally known in the tech industry for some time -- that algorithmic content ranking amplifies division and outrage. But the detail she gave about actual research quantifying it goes way deeper than I think most of us were aware of.https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2021/10/protecting%20kids%20..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is silly but sort of relevant.During college junior year (1993) as a physics major I took a class in digital electronics (which included 68000 assembler programming). We had a lab contest to create the fastest sorting routine for a set of random unique numbers between x and y.I won the contest by setting to 0 a y-x register range of memory and then inserting each number into the range based on the number itself (&#34;27&#34; into register 27, &#34;18&#34; into register 18, etc.). Then I printed out all non-zero numbers in the range.The other 20 or so students did versions of bubble-sorting and called my solution a cheat. The professor defended my victory as I had not broken any of the rules of the contest..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"[Edit: I took a quick glance at the paper and got carried away; the rest of this comment is about a different algorithm apparently known as &#34;exchange sort&#34;, and an interesting property of it. The algorithm in the paper is actually different, and indeed more surprising.]Hey! That&#39;s my sorting algorithm! (Well, I&#39;m sure it has been independently discovered many times, but one of those times was by me before I had learned of O(n log n) sorting; I used it many times including in the INOI 2004 programming contest, about which I asked the following question ten years ago in 2011 on math.SE about this algorithm and Catalan numbers, a truly surprising property that is not mentioned in this paper: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/36022/how-do-the-ca...&gt; For situations where a quadratic-time sorting algorithm is fast enough, I usually use the following:    //Given array a[1], ... a[n]
    for i = 1 to n:
        for j = i+1 to n:
            if a[i] &gt; a[j]:
                swap(a[i],a[j])

&gt; It looks like bubble sort, but is closer to selection sort. It is easy to see why it works: in each iteration of the outer loop, `a[i]` is set to be the smallest element of `a[i…n]`.----Also: A few years ago I emailed Prof. Richard Stanley of Enumerative Combinatorics fame asking whether it was related to any of the hundreds of problems in his Catalan Numbers list, and he said he didn&#39;t know a direct connection at the time (so maybe it&#39;s an addition to his list?):&gt; &gt; permutations equal to the product of all their inversions (in lexicographic order) [multiplying on the left]&gt; Example: The permutation 1423 has two inversions (24) and (34), and the product (34)(24) is the same as 1423.&gt; Non-example: The permutation 3412 has four inversions (13), (14), (23) and (24), and the product (24)(23)(14)(13) is 4321 which is not the same as 3412.&gt; Among the permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4}, there are 14 examples (and 10 non-examples).And 14 is C_4, the fourth Catalan number."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"High level description of why it sorts:The inner loop takes an array and an index i in the array, and rearranges the array to put the largest value at index i. This is done in such a way that if the sub-array up to but not including i is sorted, then afterwords the sort will be extended such that the sub-array up to and including i will be sorted.The outer loop says, just call in to the inner loop with i from 1 to n. This will result in a sorted array, because the initial array of a single element is trivially sorted, and then we&#39;ll have by the sort-extension property of the inner loop that the progressively larger sub-arrays of 2, 3, ... up to N elements become sorted.You can see that the inner loop has the sort extension property by thinking about two cases.Case 1: If the i-th element is already larger than all previous elements, it won&#39;t touch any of the elements before i, and will only potentially make the i-th element bigger, thus clearly extending the sort though the i-th element.Case 2: If the i-th element is smaller than one of the previous elements, it won&#39;t touch any elements until reaching that smaller element; then it will start a series of swaps until it reaches index i, at which point the the original value of the i-th elment is left inserted in sorted position into the sub-array up to and including i. So at this moment we have the sort extension property. From there, it may increase the value of the i-th element and change later elements, but of both those will preserve the sub-array sort."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find it weird for a whistleblower to be so &#34;lib&#34;, as the kids say. She said she &#39;loves&#39; Facebook, and wants to fix it, not harm it.I don&#39;t want Facebook fixed and I do want Facebook harmed. I don&#39;t want the government to meddle with what types of things people can say online, I want them to ban the business model of stalking people online and selling intimate details of their lives. If the problem is Facebook choosing profits over public good, then cut off the profits. This is obvious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like to imagine there are a bunch of Facebook Homefeed engineers out there who ran dozens experiments, tuning this-and-that, and found the ones that boosted revenue, and user engagement by X%. No one thought too deeply at _why_ some experiments were successful. Perhaps it was chalked up as &#34;our new ML model is matching users to content they care about more efficiently&#34;. Then they shipped it, and everyone celebrated their success.My theory is that experiment dashboards, data visualizations, and &#34;metrics&#34; allow employees to almost fully disassociate from their product, and the end users. Engineers at large companies don&#39;t need to use, or even be familiar with the products they spend all day building. Yes, leadership and small pockets (researchers) can see the full picture. Everyone else stays willfully in the dark, doesn&#39;t look too closely, and clocks out at 5 happy because their dashboards look good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me this is a fake story being promoted as a way to further a political narrative.Nothing the whistleblower has revealed is shocking or previously unknown.  Yes facebook tweaks an algorithm on your news feed to drive engagement and make money.Yes facebook allows some content that some would consider not to align with mainstream US narratives.My two cents this is an attempt to force facebook to kowtow to the US and follow googles lead in stopping “unapproved” discourse on topics dealing with covid among others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on tax software and have seen these kind of efforts. Noble, yes. Short lived, yes.It’s relatively easy to make a free 1040 file. The real problem comes from all. The. Edge. Cases.1) do you support xyz state?
2) what if I lived in multiple states?
3) what if i…And on and on.And it’s not just one and done. Every year IRS and states are changing their shit so you have to go thru and make all kind of updates and verifications every year.It takes an army to build and maintain.  Generally not the kind of thing for open source (unless they’re paid).  But then what’s the point?  One may say it’s more transparent, but TurboTax etc are transparent with their formulas - you can check every box they fill in for you.I think the only thing that can really disrupt this dynamic are “free” commercial software (like credit karma now cash app), or government provided."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real problem here is that Intuit and other companies lobby millions to maintain their status quo. The right thing to do would be to put every single dollar spent on these corporations into a government program that develops this kind of software or even does the taxes for you (this already exists in many countries in the EU.) Instead, in the US, you pay for Turbotax, they make a profit out if it, and then they use part of the money to lobby and keep the tax code and system rigged for their own benefit. I don&#39;t know if open source software is the solution here -- and as far as I know, the tax forms change every year, so it will be forever playing catch-up -- but it seems to be missing the point entirely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I keep being perplexed by how the Americans do stuff. I am Dutch and my government makes it (relatively) easy to do taxes. We got a website we can go to; it&#39;s filled by the government and we just need to verify that it is filled correctly and then click submit. Some people can make adjustments where needed and if needed. You can also let an accountant do it for you but that is optional; but useful if you have had a turbulent year that makes takes more difficult (like selling and buying a new house). 
When they did not use a website (a few years back) they offered a downloadable application that was available under Windows, MacOS and Linux (GTK). It worked fine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The NVMe hardware in the M1 is quite peculiar: it breaks the spec in multiple ways, requiring patches to the core NVMe support in Linux, and it also is exposed as a platform device instead of PCIe. In addition, it is managed by an ASC, the “ANS”, which needs to be brought up before NVMe can work, and that also relies on a companion “SART” driver, which is like a minimal IOMMU.Stuff like this makes me wonder: why does Apple do this?  If I try to give them the benefit of the doubt, I can assume that these changes are done for performance, cost, power-saving, or maybe even security reasons.  Otherwise it just seems like Apple does these things in order to make it harder for other OSes to run on their hardware.  Which is certainly their prerogative, but it just makes me think less of them.On the other hand, this is really cool:&gt; However, Apple is unique in putting emphasis in keeping hardware interfaces compatible across SoC generations – the UART hardware in the M1 dates back to the original iPhone! This means we are in a unique position to be able to try writing drivers that will not only work for the M1, but may work –unchanged– on future chips as well.... but cynically (or perhaps just realistically), I can easily believe that this isn&#39;t done for reasons of openness, but because this makes maintenance of macOS itself easier for Apple."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s technically not a conflict of interest, as long as the revenue streams roll through different offices or partners. /sOr as McKinsey puts it&gt; &#34;across more than a decade of service to the FDA, we have been fully transparent that we serve pharmaceutical and medical device companies. McKinsey’s work with the FDA helped improve the agency’s effectiveness through organizational, resourcing, business process, operational, digital, and technology improvements. To achieve its mission, the government regularly seeks support from additional experts who understand both the government’s mission and the industries’ practices. We take seriously our commitment to avoid conflicts and to serve the best interests of the FDA.&#34;In practice, just another example of questionable behaviour from McKinsey"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bet McKinsey also never told the Department of Transportation that it was working for both the DoT and major car manufacturers.Executives senior enough to approve hiring McKinsey to study something, whether they&#39;re F500 CEOs or government agency heads, know full well that the top consulting firms are all advising their competitors, counterparties, and regulators/regulatees. The facts reported in this article would indeed be scandalous if they included evidence that the FDA team at McK was tipping the pharma teams on private FDA plans or discussions, but that is not the case. If anything, this case is merely illustrative of why major consulting firms have borderline-paranoid cultural norms around never discussing client work outside of the respective client team, even (and especially) to one&#39;s own colleagues at the firm who are not staffed on said team."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I see McKinsey on someone&#39;s resume, it&#39;s a huge red flag. Similar to &#34;Head of marketing for children&#39;s sales at Phillip Morris&#34;. Sure, all companies do some bad things, but the complete lack of ethics required to succeed at McKinsey is next-level."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Our systems are designed to audit commands like these to prevent mistakes like this, but a bug in that audit tool didn’t properly stop the command.I&#39;m so glad to see that they framed this in terms of a bug in a tool designed to prevent human error, rather than simply blaming it on human error."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting bit on recovery w.r.t. the electrical grid&gt; flipping our services back on all at once could potentially cause a new round of crashes due to a surge in traffic. Individual data centers were reporting dips in power usage in the range of tens of megawatts, and suddenly reversing such a dip in power consumption could put everything from electrical systems ...I wish there was a bit more detail in here.  What&#39;s the worst case there?  Brownouts, exploding transformers?  Or less catastrophic?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems to be a side-effect of Facebook being down, attracting so much attention to HN that it might as well be a DDoS attack.Sorry everyone—there are performance improvements in the works which I hope will make a big difference, but it&#39;s not something we can roll out today.p.s. You can read HN in read-only mode if you log out. Should be way faster."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Edit: way faster if you click logout.Running in anonymous mode (clear browser cache) makes it responsive, but read-only.Edit: I suggest using a private tab or two browsers or two profiles, one where you are logged out to read comments for speed, and if you wish to comment or vote then paste a comment url over to the other. Side effect: you improve responsiveness for everyone!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was my perception 10 years ago that HN was powered by a single threaded process with the entire post history loaded into memory (not sure how accurate this perception was). I am curious how much it has changed.edit: found this https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16076041"</p>
