Dude has a real knack in writing these, clearly describing the problem and the thought process on possible solution. And making it all very interesting so you yourself start thinking how would you address it or what other cool thing could be built instead.Here&#39;s some of his other huge devlogs on TIGSOURCE:1. Papers, Please. https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=29750.02. Return of the Obra Dinn. https://forums.tigsource.com/index.php?topic=40832.0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Haxe is really unusual and interesting, and I don&#39;t think it gets talked about enough.&gt; Haxe can build cross-platform applications targeting JavaScript, C++, C#, Java, JVM, Python, Lua, PHP, Flash, and allows access to each platform&#39;s native capabilities. Haxe has its own VMs (HashLink and NekoVM) but can also run in interpreted mode.Compiling from one language to another isnt particularly unusual, but compiling from one language to so many is very unusual. On first impression it sounds unserious—real compilers output machine code—it&#39;s tempting to denigrate it by calling it a transpiler. But there are a lot of advantages that come with this approach. You always have access to the full capabilities of your target platforms. From a single language you can write code that is massively portable while also targeting specific platforms with just an if statement.The &#34;real&#34; compiler authors spend months working on linkage, calling conventions, runtimes, symbol mangling, allocators, and debuginfo trying to get their native code to link properly to the objective-c frameworks on iOS—and it never feels quite right. If you instead compile to objective-c, a lot of things get easier. It&#39;s a very pragmatic approach."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The blog post is really top tier. Consider how much time some engineers spend considering details when they&#39;re just being contracted to do a job (I&#39;ve work with lots) and how this indie game project is being explained, nitpicked, loved and cherished.The blog post alone makes you want to purchase whatever this person has been working on based on how much passion is oozing off the explanation of how it&#39;s made.Side note... A lot of YouTubers also work like this: pushing the craftsmanship to beyond expectation to almost cause an emotional reaction.In this case though, it&#39;s genuine engineering with high standards."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The biggest problem with graphql is that you have to do a lot of non-obvious work to harden your system against DOS attacks or people that want to fly by and download your whole database. It&#39;s easy to construct a query which puts unreasonable load on your system.The more fine-grained nature of boring REST calls makes it more easy to control client impact on the system.If you want to see the kind of work you actually need to put in to make a graphql API, look at Shopify. They have rate limits based on quantity of data returned. Cursors and pagination. The schema is a huge ugly mess with extra layers that never show up in the pretty examples of GraphQL on the internet.Note that even if you use graphql for a private api to your web client, folks will reverse engineer it and use it for their own purposes. There are no private apis on the web.I&#39;m not a fan of graphql for anything that the public could see. It&#39;s somewhat akin to exposing a SQL interface; it opens up too many avenues of trouble. Keep public communication channels as dumb as possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having worked in big tech and small startups, I think GraphQL is a brilliant way to solve an organizational problem that massive tech companies have.It&#39;s that the team maintaining the API is different from the team that needs changes to the API. Due to the scale of the organization the latter doesn&#39;t have the access or know-how to easily add fields to that API themselves, so they have to wait for the maintainers to add the work to their roadmap and get back to it in a few quarters. Relevant Krazam: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8OnoxKotPQAt a small start-up, if the GET /foo/:fooId/bar/ endpoint is missing a field baz you need, you can usually just add it yourself and move on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whether it was the intention or not, I find GraphQL solved a fascinating problem: it let front end developers move faster by greatly decoupling their data needs from the backend developers.Backend developers describe the data model, expose it via graphql. Front end developers, often ones who never met those backend developers, can see the data model and just use it. They can change what they&#39;re querying on the fly, get more or less as they see fit.It lets everyone move faster.But as a backend developer, I actually fucking hate it, myself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tried splitting a complex arrangement (Chicago by Sufjan Stevens). Drums bass and vocals come out fairly well, though the drums stem seems to lack other percussion elements outside of the core rock drumkit (e.g. tamborine), and cymbals hits are clipped rather than ringing. The &#39;other&#39; stem, the rest of the instrumentation, keeps a fair bit of the percussion and there&#39;s bleed from the vocal melody.The backing vocals seem to have disappeared for the most part, and are only audible in the vocals stem when the lead vocal is present (like they&#39;re reverse-ducked? Been a while since I did any production, the terms have escaped me...).Not much use with complex arrangements to be honest, I was hoping to get things like the strings section separated from the rest of the arrangement.Original: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWX3El-slpYOutput: https://file.io/etpOQt57ziKe"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Old Norse word for Saturday, laugardagr, literally means &#34;washing day&#34;. This custom still survives here in countryside Eastern Europe where many people routinely go to sauna (banya) every Saturday (or Sunday like my family). Before the 20th century,  a lot of Eastern Europe (especially Russia) still lived like they lived in the middle ages: 95% of the country were serfs on feudal property living in traditional wooden houses with no modern benefits of civilization, and the bathing culture was pervasive: there were saunas (banyas) everywhere, and most villages were close to a river so water access was not a problem. Saunas were also a place where people gave birth. I find it hard to believe that Russian peasants were living the same lifestyle for centuries and only recently decided to start bathing. My family comes from Old Believers, a religous group which rejected church reforms of the 1600&#39;s and went into hiding in taiga, they preserved pretty ancient customs and their bathing culture was pretty intricate: for example, there always must be a separate towel/bucket of water for head, body, feet - this wouldn&#39;t have developed without a rich bathing culture before. Those villagers who could not afford their own sauna bathed in... ovens (inside the house). It&#39;s one of the older customs still preserved in some places. The traditional oven was pretty large and a whole person could fit in it. My mother was bathed like that when she was a child in their Old Believer village. However, I don&#39;t know if this was specific to Eastern/Northern Europe or common in Western Europe, too. I remember reading that due to overpopulation and deforestation it was harder for West Europeans to have frequent bathing every week. But here, population wasn&#39;t dense and forests were abundant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its funny that western history distorts the history of the rest of the world.I hear western kids saying no one used to bathe in the ancient times.As an Indian, it was practically mandatory for each and every individual to take a bath at-least two times a day. Additionally the following customs were very prevalent till recent times.  1. Washing legs after coming home from outside.
  2. Washing hands, face and legs before sitting to eat food.
  3. Washing whole body after sex.
  4. Washing legs before entering others homes.
  5. Leaving footwear outside the *gate* of any home before entering it.
  6. A full bath in a river / lake / house tank *before* sunrise and once *before* sunset.

Also, body was supposed to be massaged with oil of sesame seeds (once a week), and greengram flour was rubbed on every part of the body. After sitting in the sun like this for a few minutes, the flour was scrubbed off by hand, and then a hot water bath taken.For shampoo, two traditional herbs are recommended. Kunkudukai and shikakai. Both are used as it is without any processing. Kunkudukai would be crushed and mixed with water to form a liquid and then applied on head. Amazingly, it would form a lather when rubbed on the head. I remember doing this type of head bath every sunday, until about 2005. Any shampoo was forbidden in our home. The items were dead cheap too.[Edit]Kinkudukai is also called soapnut.https://www.stylecraze.com/articles/benefits-of-soapnuts-for...The above site tends to exaggerate the benifits a bit, but it is believed that kunkudukai inhibhits dandruff and is anti-fungal and anti-bacterial.By personal experience, it tastes absolutely vomit inducing bitter and will burn your eyes to high hell if as much as a diluted drop enters it.Its a natural, safe and environmentally friendly way of taking a head bath."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ughh I dislike when pop history takes this smarmy tone and is also not particularly accurate.&gt; In fact soap is a motherfucking medieval invention. Yes. It is. The Romans – whomst I don’t see a bunch of basics going around accusing of being filthy –  did not, in fact have soap, in contrast. They usually washed using oil. Medieval people? Oh you better believe that they had soap.Wait a minute, what about Aleppo soap? I thought the Romans knew of it and Wikipedia alleges the same in their article:&gt; Although it has been claimed that soap-making was introduced to the West from the Levant after the First Crusades, in fact, soap was known to the Romans in the first century AD and Zosimos of Panopolis described soap and soapmaking in c. 300 AD.Citation: https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_History_of_Greek_Fire...Then the OP author goes on to say:&gt; It was first introduced from the East, like most good stuff was at the time, but it took off rather quickly.This contradicts their claim that soap was a medieval invention! It wasn&#39;t a medieval invention. It was adopted technology.That&#39;s not a big deal I guess, but if you&#39;re going to make a rant about historical accuracies, what else isn&#39;t exactly accurate here? It seems the effort is put into the berating imaginary enemies rather than the writing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once was shipped a _very expensive_ server motherboard from Amazon by mistake when trying to buy something cheaper. The customer service agent (Indian non native speaker) failed to understand that Amazon didn’t ship the correct item, and refused the return. I spoke to another agent and they thanked me and I got the correct item exchanged.I previously posted about this on HN and one of the responses was “who cares? Az makes $100k/min”You know what? It matters. Doing the right thing fucking matters. Have some integrity, don’t take what isn’t yours, give back what was a mistake. Don’t fall into the trap of relativism.You don’t know the whole story either... I’d like to think by returning that item I saved someone from getting fired; or a saved a small low margin retailer from losing their shirt. I’ll never know, but at the end of the day I can sleep with a clean conscience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The clothing company LL Bean dealt with this same sort of issue.  It used to be that if you weren&#39;t happy with a purchase, you could return any item you bought from Bean, at any time, for a full refund.One day, the CEO of the company donated some of his old LL Bean clothing to a charity that accepts used clothing.  One of the shirts he donated had his initials embroidered on it.  In less than a month, that same shirt had been returned to Bean, stating the person was unsatisfied with his purchase, and requesting a full refund of the purchase price."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember MySpace being described as &#34;an easy personal website&#34; back in high school.Unfortunately, it&#39;s not easy to make an easy personal website today. Personal sites take so much work to design, and most feel stale because they don&#39;t have dynamic content like posts. About.me used to be great, but it didn&#39;t get maintained.I&#39;m working on a project to make personal websites as easy to set up as a social profile. No designs to pick - just a photo and profile photo. Not static - you have a mailing list and the latest post is shown on the homepage. And, people can &#34;follow&#34; with their emails.Facebook used to be pitched as &#34;the place everybody is&#34;, but that&#39;s no longer true - social networks are getting dis-aggregated. So, I expect personal sites to become a way for people to gain more control over their audiences, and to help move an audience from one platform to another (via a &#34;link in bio&#34; to their personal sites)If you&#39;re interested in trying out my project for your own site:https://postcard.page(Will trade free access for feedback!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When social networks started taking off, in the spirit of the late 00s there was a push to create standards for distributed social networks so that personal websites could replicate a lot of what social networks did. DiSo is one that comes to mind [1].The fact was...people didn&#39;t care. It made building harder...not easier.I think it&#39;s inevitable. Over time, adoption trends towards easy UX, and open standards almost by their nature lag behind silos in their ability to optimize experience.[1] https://diso-project.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The hard part is finding the interesting websites - there is such a firehose of content that we&#39;ve necessitated a separate role for content curators.I get Thinking About Things, which points me to interesting sites on the internet (https://thinking-about-things.com/). Another great one is Findka essays (https://essays.findka.com/). Would love to hear any other recommendations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am using freebsd since version 8 for all my server needs (was using linux, but got repelled by its chaos which I dont care about on my laptop, but it pisses me off on server).Some more points:- bhyve, developed by netapp, they ditched all old technologies support and it works faster on my i5 server than kvm on my i7 laptop. Snapshoting using ZFS is not a feature to discard either.- FIBs, absolute miracle routing tables that you can apply to whatever software, define the routes as fib 1 (lets say it is openvpn) and then use them as simply as `setfib 1 bash` to use them in all child processes- backward compatibility, this is where linux is really horrible, there was an article about compiling binary on freebsd 2 and running it on freebsd 10. Try this on linux, binaries are not compatible even on minor versions.- jails... docker? Really? Jails are 15+ years old implementation, kernel supported, that stood test of time, actually being a security feature. It runs circles around the docker in everything except how much it was adapted by community. I never understood why people rather used an inferior solution like docker.- not to mention all the chaos in linux ecosystem, in next sub-version, the commands can have completely different switches,...I will never understand on what technical merits people are using linux for servers except the support-ability of hardware. Due to the whole show that linux is getting we would prosper as a humanity by ditching the linux. Unfortunately, marketing is worth more than anything.(I do understand that people will not agree due to their preference, but try to use it. I doubt you will prefer linux ever again.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have tried learning FreeBSD occasionally, mostly for nostalgia because I learned Unix on BSD 4.3 (or 4.4?) on MicroVaxes many years ago. But I get stuck on some very basic things:- My wifi card doesn&#39;t work. The installer recognizes it, but the driver doesn&#39;t work.- The console terminal defaults to 80x25, I don&#39;t know how to resize it.- I can&#39;t figure out how to start X Windows.- If I run it in a VM (e.g. VirtualBox), the network bridging doesn&#39;t work so my FreeBSD instance has no internet access.It&#39;s probably my fault, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s in the docs somewhere. But it probably means that I&#39;m not the target audience for FreeBSD, since I don&#39;t have the time and patience to figure out the most basic things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One application where FreeBSD especially shines is as a fileserver to Windows clients: Unlike on Linux, NFSv4 ACLs are supported natively!The NT ACLs used in Windows and SMB are much more expressive than Linux&#39;s POSIX draft ACLs. When a Windows client writes a file to a Linux Samba server, it cannot necessarily express the file&#39;s ACL as a POSIX ACL losslessly. To work around this, Samba&#39;s vfs_acl_xattr saves the &#34;real&#34; ACL as an extended attribute: https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/vfs_acl_xa...This means the ACLs set by clients won&#39;t be enforced for local users on the file server, and that you need special tools to view and edit those ACLs.In contrast, FreeBSD supports NFSv4 ACLs on ZFS, and those are a superset of NT ACLs. Samba saves the NT ACL as an NFSv4 ACL, and this can be viewed or edited using getfacl and setfacl as with any other file on the server."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This one: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19584921 And it wasn&#39;t even my post!A long time ago I found myself teaching Computer Graphics at my alma mater. Over the following years my approach to the subject evolved, and I really got the hang of it. After I stopped teaching, I took my notes, handouts and slides, and made them into a series of articles that I put on my website, where they remained in relative obscurity. Hacker News managed to find it every once in a while, and it was generally well received, but nothing came out of this. Until April 2019, when that post made the HN front page again, except this time it caught the attention of an editor in No Starch Press.Long story short, my materials are now a book, Computer Graphics from Scratch, sold by No Starch Press [0], and also available for free on my website [1].This genuinely wouldn’t have happened without your support. THANK YOU, HN community :)[0] https://nostarch.com/computer-graphics-scratch[1] http://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seven years ago, I started a blog called The Pragmatic Engineer. For three months, I wrote a post every two-three weeks. But no one really read them. So I took a short break, which break turned into a month, then another, another… and I did not have motivation to write. Barely anyone read it, after all.A few months after starting the blog, I saw a small traffic spike - maybe 30 visitors - from this site called Hacker News after a submission [1]. I never heard about HN before but it looked interesting so I started to visit it, and eventually registered to upvote stories I like.Then, another few months later - when I had not published anything for 3-4 months - as I was checking out HN, I could not believe what I saw: a months-old post of mine was on the front page titled “Move Fast Without Breaking Things”. Traffic was so high, my site could barely keep up on shared hosting with MediaTemple, my blog running Wordpress.There were 50+ comments discussing my post, versus the 2 that were on the blog itself (it had a commenting system). The comments were more insightful than I’ve ever seen for any of my blog posts. This was the HN post [2].Now, this post did not “make me money”. But it WAS a turning point where I got validation that strangers on the internet find what I wrote interesting. And it gave me a motivation to write when no one read it, knowing that just because people are not interested in what I wrote today, people might find it interesting months or years later.I kept writing my blog for years. Eventually, this blog served as the basis of The Pragmatic Engineer Newsletter which I launched a year ago, and which is my new fulltime job and one of the most popular technology newsletters with over 120,000 people reading it. More than enough people chose to pay for it to make this a a viable fulltime career on the long run.Thank you, Hacker News, for those first two submissions, all the comments, and the motivation it gave to keep writing. It was a turning point. I still remember how I could barely believe in March 2016 that so many people I never met can be interested in reading thoughts I put in writing.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10692734[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11374221"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This one by user tempsy about /r/wallstreetbets from January 2020: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22186392This comment made me aware of the whole options market and leverage. I didn’t know a thing before reading it.I made €500k by betting that the Corona virus will have more impact than the market anticipated in February 2020 and got it right. Which of course, was kinda naive and quite lucky. I totally cannot recommend to play around with options at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a clear demonstration of the user&#39;s expectation of search having exceeded what&#39;s possible today.From the article:&gt; Lets look at some examples. One of my favorite places in the world is Koh Lanta, Thailand. When traveling, I’m always on the lookout for places that give off the Koh Lanta vibe. What does that mean? Hard to say, exactly, but having tourist amenities without being touristy. Charming, slow, cheap. I don’t know exactly; if I did, it’d be easier to find. Anyway, forgetting that Google is bad at long tails, I search for what is the koh lanta of croatia? and get:This is a near impossible query for human beings, let alone for computer given the state of the AI at this point in time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot of Google hate on HN, and much of it is deserved, but I think this particular trend of blaming Google for the prevalence of useless clickbait articles is a bit much.The real answer to this question is that walled-garden social media took over everything. The much-pined-for &#34;Old Google&#34; worked because people used to actually create content on their own sites, and not just post it on walled garden monolithic social sites like Facebook or Twitter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; What I dream of is Google circa 2006. A time where a search engine searched what you asked for. A time before aggressive SEO. A time before social media, when the only people on the internet had a reason to be there. A time before sticky headers and full-screen modal pop-ups asking you to subscribe to a newsletter before reading the article. A time before click-bait and subscription-only websites which tease you with a paragraph before blurring out the rest of the content.Well, I built sort of exactly this: https://search.marginalia.nu/It&#39;s not great, but it sure has its moments.Should be noted, regarding Koh Lanta, that travel is one of the most aggressively SEO-spammed topics, along with pharma and online casinos. It&#39;s extremely difficult to cut through the noise and reach any sort of signal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google refuses to search for hash-like strings that aren&#39;t well-known across the web.[0] That&#39;s why this search gives no actual results. (It certainly will in the future as this submission gets reposted, breaking the googlewhack)[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31638976(I think Bing also blocks hashes but has an exemption for UUIDs; right now it gives me results for random UUIDs but not random MD5s)Bing and Yandex are both capable of locating OP&#39;s Minecraft account in online databases:https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.google.com/search?...https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://www.bing.com/search?q=...https://web.archive.org/web/0/https://yandex.com/search/?tex...PS: example of an uncommon hash that Yandex finds but not the other two: the MD5 of &#39;Hacker News&#39; (f3e4...), which actually occurs on the web on one site (http://archive.ph/oLgUe http://archive.today/lkyNN http://archive.ph/v3TY5)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Similarly, I once needed some new robust tyres for my folding bike, so I googled &#39;marathon plus 20 inch&#39;.Google helpfully informs me thatmarathon + (20 inches) = 1.00001204 marathon"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s pretty funny. I work for a company that puts 5 alphanumeric characters on physical devices to track and identify them. We are always putting those 5 characters into various google sheets. And every so often one had an E in the middle of all numbers and google would convert by default to something like &#34;1.10E+34&#34; so we had to make SCIENTIFIC_NUMBER_REGEX = Regex(&#34;\\d+e\\d+&#34;) and stop making codes with E&#39;s in the middle."</p>
