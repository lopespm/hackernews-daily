								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something similar happened to my dad (USAF fighter pilot) in around 1961 or 62: He was test-flying a T-33 single-engine jet trainer assigned to his unit after it&#39;d had repair work. The engine quit and wouldn&#39;t restart. He ejected, but his parachute didn&#39;t deploy fully (much the same as in the article) and he got tangled in the shrouds. He said a quick Hail Mary just before crashing head-first in a muddy, fresh-plowed field. The pilot of another plane in the area saw the crash and radioed the tower to send the meat wagon and not the ambulance, but my dad walked away with just a headache — and with his helmet split open like a melon. The impact apparently damaged his inner ear: five years later he started getting vertigo while aloft, and soon afterwards got medically grounded. (That meant he lost the extra flight pay and was reduced to his base pay, with four school-aged kids while stationed in the Washington DC area — to make ends meet, my mother had to go back to work as an RN [registered nurse].)EDIT: What I remember was that when my dad crashed (see above), my mom came to get me from playing with the neighbor kids in their yard. Dad had called her from the flight surgeon&#39;s office and told her about the crash (very nonchalantly, she later said), and that he was OK. So six-year-old me blithely went on playing. Of course, my mom had been living with that possibility all their married life ...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a story of insane luck (and unluck!), the craziest part is definitely this&#34;  He said that if I had had a spleen, it almost certainly would have ruptured when I hit the water, and I would have bled to death. Of the 25 pilots in our squadron, I am the only one without a spleen. It gives me something to think about. Maybe it does you as well.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This happened in 1963.  Planes had only been flying for 60 years at that point; it really is pretty amazing how quickly we progressed on technology during those early years.  We still fly 737s, which are descended from a design that first flew in 1967.  As well as the C130, which was part of this story.  And don&#39;t get me started on B-52s, which are even older.We have made great strides since then, of course, but it does feel like 90% of the fundamental aviation technology we have today was created just in the first few decades."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The IME gets a lot of hate around here, but let&#39;s not get distracted by it: higher-privilege co-processors running code outside the main OS&#39; control is becoming (or already is) the norm everywhere. Intel-based PCs are just one instance of it (and perhaps not even the most egregious one).Most hardware has evolved to effectively run the main OS under a sandbox where it &#34;thinks&#34; it is in control, but isn&#39;t.A nice talk on this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36myc8wQhLo"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Usually when I&#39;m reminded about IME (and whatever the equivalent is in AMD chips), it&#39;s in the context of some strong claims about it being &#34;game over&#34; for security and privacy against mass surveillance, engineered / funded by nation-state intelligence agencies, and rendering all other technical efforts moot. They make it sound plausible, and I think &#34;why isn&#39;t this talked about or investigated more?&#34; The section of the Wikipedia page that discusses the &#34;backdoor&#34; claim is frustratingly thin. I just don&#39;t know what to make of it. Hyperbole about a crappy thing, like the bloatware pre-installed on most new laptops and phones by the vendor? An open secret, with discussion about it suppressed?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As others have noted, they still have an education focused robotics set, it’s just not called Mindstorms:
https://www.lego.com/en-us/product/lego-education-spike-prim...As a now-successful robotics engineer, I was the target age when the first Lego mindstorms set came out. Due to the cost it had to be a combined birthday and Christmas present (still obviously very privileged). The simple scratch-like programming system that kit used was great for me as a tween learning robotics.Today I am designing an open source farming robot as a non profit project! (See my profile)The early history of Lego Mindstorms is interesting. I didn’t realize Seymour Papert was involved but that makes a lot of sense! Especially with the name Mindstorms:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lego_Mindstormshttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mindstorms_(book)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got the original Lego Mindstorms 1.0 kit for my 8th birthday - there was no programming interface, just a way to select one of 256 possible sequences of high-level actions the robot would perform in a loop. I paid for my first car by working at summer camps that taught kids how to use the Mindstorms 2.0 and NXT, and built my first 3D printer with Lejos (https://lejos.sourceforge.io/), Lego Technic parts and a tiny spindle router that could sculpt shapes into floral foam.While I&#39;m saddened by this news for nostalgic reasons, I personally believe that today&#39;s young learners are better served by the proliferation of hobby robotics platforms like Arduino/Raspberry Pi. Every summer camp I worked at would claim that Lego robotics teaches real-world engineering skills, while in reality the students were just happy to stay within the comfort zone of playing with Legos and using a block-based programming environment (one that has quite frankly gone from bad to worse to absolutely horrible with each product cycle). Also, FIRST Lego League does nothing meaningful to prepare students for FIRST - when I donated supplies and a few weeks of mentorship to my former high school&#39;s FIRST team, I was dismayed to see how much dead weight the team was carrying in students who participated in the middle school Lego league, who did not have even the basic coding/engineering skills to make any contribution to the high school team other than paying the membership dues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sad to see this as someone who enjoyed these as a kid and entering robotics competitions based off of them; hopefully the new products will keep the spirit alive.There was even some decent FOSS tooling that developed on top of Mindstorms: I used NXC (Not eXactly C, https://bricxcc.sourceforge.net/nbc/welcome.html) which was a C-like language  for programming Lego Mindstorms. It looks like the last release of NXC was in 2011."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bit tangential but I just got a Tesla Model 3 and paid $6,000 extra for “enhanced autopilot” buying into all the marketing about it, and its one of the biggest regrets of my life and makes me unable to appreciate an otherwise great car. I just feel sick about it. The enhanced autopilot is buggy and doesn’t save me any effort. The summon and auto park don’t really work. I think it’s a scam.  Other than that it’s a great car."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When people say they want career progression, and opportunities, what they mostly mean is they want more money. Unfortunately, most companies have fallen into the trap where if someone has a title of X they can only make up to Y, regardless of how good they are at their job or how long they&#39;ve done it. When that happens then the name of the game is getting a promotion in order to keep making more money. That creates a perverse incentive, and the result is political bullshit that is typically misaligned with the company&#39;s interests which further drives away your high performers.End the perverse incentives. Pay your people well if they&#39;re doing a good job, regardless of how long they&#39;ve been doing the same job or what their title is. Reward seniority and loyalty. Suddenly, you&#39;ll find that employee retention goes through the roof, and you don&#39;t have to worry about hiring new people all the time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Too many times in my career have I seen an employer lose an employee, who has a ton of institutional knowledge and performs adequately or even excellently, only to replace them them with someone that ends up costing much more money, and then takes a lot of time to get up to speed (which also slows the folks who help get them up to speed).It is like they haven&#39;t taken the time to even make a rudimentary calculation on the costs involved in keeping the employee versus replacing them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The hazard of retention is creating dependency. Dependency means, not just high bus factor, but opening yourself (the business) up to being vulnerable to another person&#39;s superior negotiation position. Then CEOs/boardmembers would have to spread their wealth rather than hoarding it all for themselves. Without a way to force CEO/boardmembers to spread their wealth (unions), I think we can expect companies to do what is in their best interest, maintaining a monopoly on power by ensuring no dependencies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I used play soccer regularly, I&#39;d occasionally experience being &#34;in the zone&#34;. It&#39;s a blissful experience where my body is able to execute incredibly complex set of moves in perfect coordination as my mind enters a state of zen-like calm.The sensation is almost like a being spectator in my own body. My brain feels like it&#39;s been relieved of the task of managing the moment-to-moment decision. Instead I start noticing moves 3, 4 steps ahead as time slows to a crawl around me. I don&#39;t know if this type of experience is related in any way to the theory of consciousness, but it feels like the unconscious mind holds a lot of secrets that I&#39;d love to see unlocked in my lifetime."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a rumored experiment called the &#34;precognitive carousel&#34;, supposedly run by Grey Walter, where:(1) Subjects are told to push a button to advance a slide projector carousel, but not told that the button is inert(2) The carousel advances based on electrical signals measured by wires on the subjects&#39; scalp.(3) Subjects supposedly report the uncanny feeling that the projector advances &#34;just before&#34; they were about to push the button -- 300-400 milliseconds before, a pretty long time.I read about this a long time ago in a since-deleted post on an old timey internet forum (everything2).The writer suggested this research supports the idea that your body chooses what to do, then informs your brain, and your consciousness convinces itself that has decided to do what the body is about to do on its own."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I realize that the link between consciousness and quantum effects are far from proven but if you will entertain the idea that they are...Delayed-choice experiments demonstrate the seeming ability of measurements in the present to alter events occurring in the past. eg. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Delayed-choice_quantum_eraserNow I&#39;ll throw out another completely unprovable thought...Perhaps consciousness has the ability to affect how wavefunction collapse occurs, perhaps it even has the ability to influence the observed outcome.I&#39;m not going to try to prove these two ideas but together they can help form an idea that perhaps observations on the past actually influence the past and perhaps despite this &#39;observation after the fact&#39; there&#39;s still free will.It&#39;s not provable but then neither is the &#34;there&#39;s no such thing as free will&#34; arguments that this sort of research leads to. The point of the above is to highlight that there&#39;s still a way out for free will."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. 90% of the Application&#39;s Data are already in my LinkedIN, or my CV / Resume. Why the heck do I have to fill it in again.2. Some companies even / still requires you bring your University Certificate or whatever as proof. For Pete sake. That was decades ago. Can I pay $5 to LinkedIn or whatever so once and for all they can verify it from there.3. The other 8% of the application that I have not included details in my CV/ Resume or LinkedIn could have been reused across all applications. Why do I have rewrite it again.4. You are not fucking suppose to verify or reference check on me before I even had my interview or offer. So now my boss / management knows I am job hunting?5. By the time I get to the end of the application I am already exhausted depending how bad the day I had. And some form of PTSD from previous interview where i had to contain my thermonuclear anger or else going absolute animal against the HR / agent / interviewer. Because I have to be professional.6. My thought on why all these are so bad is because job application, listing site, social network ( LinkedIn ) all work for hiring companies, they are the ones who pay them. And not job seekers. Someone needs to figure out a way where we can turn this around and empower ( I hate this word, but I dont have anything better in my vocab ) employees."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I m one of these, i fill out the form, then i get the memories i had interacting with some of these companies, working at other companies. The Process-Dementia, the hostilitys, the relentless culture of using all things in human interaction as renegotiation ammonition. The relentless pressure, ignoring all social norms and employee health, to complete a task. The shallow friendliness, that ended as soon as your usefullness expired. The internal fights, silos and slightly drunk employees, who hated it there, but couldnt say it, cause big Brother Middle Management is everywhere.Its considered the &#34;good jobs&#34; in my area, as in well paid enough to own a house, but every time im tempted to apply and see the logos, and the memories come back, i abort these applications.Some companies are cesspools and its good to remember that and stay away from them. I also warn others to stay away from them. Some people hack these companies and get the easy life there, which is nice, but for people who actually want to work and not interact with such a culture.. not even as customers, if it can be avoided."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recently I wanted to apply to a company. First they had you read some weird document telling you how they can’t pay high salaries, so you should be modest with your expectations.Then further down the form they require you to record a video introducing yourself and telling them why they should hire you.Ended up closing the form right there.Do these people not realize how annoying their process is and how talented people don’t have to put up with crap like this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Checking for my own “benchmark”, a gameboy emulator in several different languages[0]; it’s CPU-bound but across ~3k lines of code, so slightly more representative of real-world apps than a single-function tight-loop microbenchmark:     zig: Emulated 600 frames in  0.24s (2521fps)
      rs: Emulated 600 frames in  0.37s (1626fps)
     cpp: Emulated 600 frames in  0.40s (1508fps)
     nim: Emulated 600 frames in  0.44s (1367fps)
      go: Emulated 600 frames in  1.75s (342fps)
     php: Emulated 600 frames in 23.74s (25fps)
      py: Emulated 600 frames in 26.16s (23fps)   # PyPy
      py: Emulated 600 frames in 33.10s (18fps)   # 3.11
      py: Emulated 600 frames in 61.43s (9fps)    # 3.10

Doubling the speed is pretty nice :D Still the slowest out of all implementations though :P[0] https://github.com/shish/rosettaboyEDIT&gt; updated the nim compiler flags to build in release mode like most other languages, thanks @plainOldText!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wanted to see what the results for pypy would be.On my machine (very similar, a macbook pro m1 max):    python 3.10: 52s
    python 3.11: 35s
    pypy 3.9.12: 10s

(This test is basically a perfect test for JITs: one loop repeated many times)https://gist.github.com/llimllib/7af8144a92d3c2e1fc58be62988..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really impressed with the performance improvements in Python 3.11.I ran a very basic benchmark against a local web application: I got 413.56 requests/second on 3.10 and the exact same code gave me 533.89 requests/second on 3.11.That&#39;s a big enough increase that I think it&#39;s worth actively upgrading projects. Usually I wait for a few months for things to settle in first."</p>
