								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If anyone actually believed it was &#34;code red for humanity&#34; they&#39;d be pushing nuclear power. There is zero chance of moving off carbon energy sources without causing catastrophic mayhem, unless we use massive amounts of nuclear.For instance, the last 4 years my state has averaged 37% production of total possible installed wind generation capacity. This is a very windy state which is in the top 2 for installed wind capacity and number one per capita. But throughout a day wind power can very from nearly zero to close to max capacity. Those periods of near zero production can last non-trivial amounts of time no realistic battery could provide for.The only solutions are continue with our gas turbine/wind power mix where we build enough gas turbines to handle 100% of the load for when the wind production is bottoming out, or replace everything with nuclear.Nuclear gets us to net carbon zero fastest and with technology easy to export to developing countries in desperate need of plentiful, reliable, cheap electricity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just. Tax. It.We have warmed the earth because we love comfort and money. We will never stop loving those things. So instead let&#39;s use the same systems to fix this (or at least slow things down).As an individual my largest carbon impact is air travel. I like to go places, it&#39;s one of the main things I work to afford. Every single plane ticket I take should have a tax which is used to offset or capture the carbon emissions of my flight. I will pay it. Anyone not willing to pay it will have to fly less. Any airlines that can&#39;t operate under the tax will not operate.Now do the same thing for corporate polluters, packaging waste, etc. If a country won&#39;t do this for domestic goods we can at least impose climate tariffs at borders.The only other thing that could work is some fantastic new technological solution, but let&#39;s not wait for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s just so hard to know what actions have what impact on CO2 production. Some are high-pain, low-gain (switching devices off instead of standby?), some are opposite (cycling instead of driving when possible etc).For that if for no other reason, I’d rather if consumer prices included an explicit CO2 tax. The here can be a rebate for poorer people, or personal allowance, whatever, but there would be a fixed yardstick for measuring your personal impact.Off the top of my head, I have no idea which if my activities generates the most CO2. My car? Energy use? Diet? Going skiing once a year? No idea.Newspaper articles only help a little, they usually present an incomplete picture, and optimising against an incorrect utility function is often counterproductive.I’m imagining something like VAT, where “value added/carbon” adds up over the lifetime of product/service production."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This invasive capability on the device level is a massive intrusion on everyone&#39;s privacy and there will be no limits for governments to expand it&#39;s reach once implemented. The scope will always broaden.From the article:Apple’s choices in this case, though, go in the opposite direction: instead of adding CSAM-scanning to iCloud Photos in the cloud that they own-and-operate, Apple is compromising the phone that you and I own-and-operate, without any of us having a say in the matter. Yes, you can turn off iCloud Photos to disable Apple’s scanning, but that is a policy decision; the capability to reach into a user’s phone now exists, and there is nothing an iPhone user can do to get rid of it.A far better solution to the “Flickr problem” I started with is to recognize that the proper point of comparison is not the iPhone and Facebook, but rather Facebook and iCloud. One’s device ought be one’s property, with all of the expectations of ownership and privacy that entails; cloud services, meanwhile, are the property of their owners as well, with all of the expectations of societal responsibility and law-abiding which that entails. It’s truly disappointing that Apple got so hung up on its particular vision of privacy that it ended up betraying the fulcrum of user control: being able to trust that your device is truly yours."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; . Yes, you can turn off iCloud Photos to disable Apple’s scanning,so, Apple now has the ability to reach into every law abiding citizens personal phone - report them to the FBI when the algorithm makes mistakes (and it will - nothing is 100%, particular in image recognition), AND THEN THE PERPETRATORS CAN STILL GET AWAY BY JUST TURNING IT OFF??!??!?!My goodness, I couldn&#39;t imagine a stupider way to fight CSAM.&gt; Facebook made 20.3 million reports of Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM) in 2020.Were there 20.3 million arrests of offenders?  I don&#39;t think so. I doubt they caught 20 perps from that data.  While it may be a better algorithm, it should be a good warning of how often your&#39; very legitimate and non-CSAM data will be leaked to a &#34;verifier&#34;, and worse, to the authorities.Take a look at how often YouTube channels are taken down by &#34;auto triggers&#34; that are then &#34;reviewed&#34; and you will get a good idea of how often the government is going to screw law abiding citizens.  It&#39;s not zero, and imho, it will be well above a range of &#34;acceptable fallout&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These efforts will evolve and expand over time.I have no doubt they will. Pandora’s box has been opened, and okay, today the scanning is only for images uploaded to iCloud, and only for CSAM. But that is not auditable and subject to change at any time without notice.And today it is only looking at known hashes but the devices already have a capability to analyse images and even run OCR on them, this is not a matter of of these things will be weaponised but when.Can’t believe this is the same Apple that publicly defended the right to privacy for known terrorists by using the slippery slope argument themselves. The mind boggles."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The scary thing about this is that many people have images that look like child porn at home: Family photos of naked grandchildren playing at the sea or in the mud, as well as sexting between consenting teenagers. There is no way automatic classification can distinguish these from real child porn, because they look almost identical and thus many private pictures will be shared with the government. This not only infringes the privacy of those people in the most drastic way possible, but might also lead to lawsuits that can tear families apart (think your father being accused of having CP only for it to turn out months later it was an old picture of yourself). The article mentions that 40% of CP investigations in Germany are started against minors (implied: through sexting), which shows that this concern is not purely theoretical at all.This was not an issue with the old approach of comparing checksums against public CP images, but it will increasingly be if we use more AI algorithms for this.EDIT: Probably Apples neural hashes that are currently in the news won&#39;t be vulnerable to this since they trained specifically to only detect changes in color/cropping/rotation. But we can&#39;t know for sure since the white paper is not that detailed and &#34;naked kid on beach&#34; photos all look really similar usually."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to cry if is see such dangerous things.  
Most European parties send unknown politicians to Strasbourg and let them vote on important topics with low media coverage. Later the local politicians - which act mostly in Bruessels - claim that they have no way but follow Strasbourgs/Bruessels decisions and write even worse state laws upon it.I think we need a new Europe state with a actual parliament in charge, which means the people there are accountable and in power. Without the Commission, Council and Presidency of Council[1]. Instead one actual parliament and one actual government. The Europeans state are integrated part of it, like elsewhere. Next the stuff can be fixed: We just need one army. And one social-security system with one economic policy. And one state department (foreign politics).Most politicians still think of Europe as a economy council but we people expect a sovereign country/state. The former &#34;economy council&#34; could solve economy related issues within Europe in the 1950s. But I think we have much bigger things to do.[1] I don&#39;t know how somebody can seriously use something like a rolling presidency. You can do that with a mediator position or referee."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Privacy is something that people usually only care about on a theoretical level. Practically speaking, they&#39;re often happy to not care so much at all if they get something more tangible in return.---Company: Excuse me, would you mind us profiling you through an accurate survey of most of your everyday purchases?Customer: Heck no!Company: What if we let you collect &#34;points&#34; that will maybe someday safe you a little bit of money on one of these purchases?Customer: Sign me up!---Company: Excuse me, would you mind us recording everywhere you go all day every day and store that information for at least six months?Customer: Heck no!Company: What if you get a pocket computer with fast mobile internet connection in return, the corner stone of modern life?Customer: Sign me up!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really hope there is enough momentum to stop this. It&#39;s definitely the last straw for me in terms of apple products. I haven&#39;t bought a new iphone for 4 years, I&#39;m slowly trying to switch to a lightphone (non smartphone). My mac needs a change but I will probably switch to linux.It&#39;s absolutely ridiculous what apple has become. The exact opposite of what they used to represent, when I loved them. God rest Steve Jobs soul, his 1984 ad is exactly what apple is now. Screwed devs on app store, strongarmed into compliance, cooperation with china, worse and worse UX on phones, and now this...Really disappointing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I was ignorant on the issue and completely against the approach of Apple.Then HN taught me that any company storing images on their infrastructure in the US must report pedophilic images to the US government.At this point, the approach taken by Apple seems like the best one to me, if you don&#39;t want to store pictures in clear on your servers.What other technical approach are people advocating for?Another point it is to try to change the law, but this is beyond the scope of the conversation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“other tech experts“ want to keep Apple from using End2End encryption so they have a reason why they don’t provide it to their customers. With Apple‘s approach Apple can only decrypt Data hosted with them if the (false) positives are over a threshold. It‘s a pretty neat way to implement a usecase so deeply wrong. All other companies protesting now want to keep access to userdata in the clear.Apple‘s approach is the only way to - at the same time - act lawfully regarding to EARN-IT act in the US and provide E2E in iCloud.I really hate these laws, but Apple is not the problem here. Read up on EARNIT and the EU laws currently in the works. All communication WILL HAVE TO BE SCANNED by the provider. Beating the drum against Apple will just lead to E2E encryption being forbidden. What needs to be forbidden instead is any access to communication.https://www.apple.com/child-safety/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting that they started with data. Some of the most interesting discoveries I&#39;ve made have started with me saying &#34;that&#39;s weird&#34; while looking at data. From the article:&#34;Graham&#39;s team was doing an unrelated project on plant genetics and noticed that the western false asphodel had a genetic deletion that&#39;s sometimes seen in carnivorous plants. The researchers started to think about the fact that this flower grew in the kind of environment that&#39;s home to various other insect-eating plants.&#34;And then they have these sticky stems,&#34; Graham says. &#34;So, you know, it was kind of like, hmm, I wonder if this could be a sign that this might be carnivorous.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the technique of testing if it was carnivorous. For the lazy people, they put a nitrogen isotope inside fruitflies and then tested the plant later to see if it was absorbing the nitrogen, and it was."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got a specimen of one of these preserved in a photoalbum from a school project from 10 years ago or so. There was no idea at the time these were in any way carnivorous.For all our knowledge, there really is so much about all the other life around us we just don&#39;t understand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some have speculated that with the introduction of the PSI/CSAM system Apple will enable E2EE backups. Given the lack of an explicit statement on Apple&#39;s part and their history regarding E2EE backups (this article, and other statements). It seems really unlikely to me that Apple will enable E2EE backups.Under E2EE, assuming the device key is randomly generated, if you have one device (as many users do) and you lose that device you would lose all your data. The alternative is the key is derived from your iCloud password, in which case, if you forget your password, you lose all your data.Right now, you can browse your photos online. There&#39;s been no statement that this is going away. Implementing this functionality with E2EE backups seem highly problematic.These are huge changes to iCloud functionality that Apple would surely announce...There are many open questions. And given that there’s no clear statement from Apple, I’m inclined to believe that they retain the ability to decrypt all data."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s likely true, but quite probably even worse.A friend here in NSW Australia told me some years ago, while working at one of the larger coal-fired power plants we have, that emissions are measured on only one of the four stacks, and the results are then extrapolated.Obviously this was ripe to be gamed, which is precisely what happened.   Good coal (black, low-emission, cleaner-burning) was used to power that turbine, the other three turbines got the low-quality / high-emissions brown coal.Either way, studies like TFA rely on the accuracy of the data that different nation states collect and publish, and I seriously doubt the accuracy of much of those data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Misleading title ? Its Global emissions caused by “electricity generation”. Power generation is 25% of overall global emissions.. so this is about 73% of the 25%."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I viscerally hate this title, because the top 5% of power plants probably also account for &gt;50% of electrical generation, and the entire exercise is dominated by how small of a plant counts for the statistics. If all the portable generators sitting unused in people&#39;s garages counted, I bet that 0.1% of &#34;power plants&#34; would be responsible for 99% of emissions, which would make a great headline but still wouldn&#39;t tell you anything meaningful about the world.I would love to know about how efficiency varies with plant size (are bigger plants more efficient?) but this study is _mostly_ just stating that bigger power plants produce more emissions in absolute terms, which should be obvious to pretty much anyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have encountered something similar to this for a submission that I reviewed for a scientific journal.  I will not list any names or give much detail past those generalities, but I pointed out that the authors were misusing a particular technical term. In my review I defined the term and explained it briefly.  I asked the authors to revise their submission accordingly.  The paper was not bad but the authors did not know English very well, so it was quite difficult to read.  That was its main problem.  However, when I received the revised submission, I noticed that the authors plagiarized my definition and explanation almost word for word (from my confidential review). I pointed this out to the editors and they said to just reject the paper with the stated reason being plagiarism, which I did.  The journal ended up rejecting the article, but I discovered it a few years later in a different journal.  The plagiarized section remained, but the authors swabbed out a lot my phrases for these kind of &#34;tortured phrases&#34;.That said, the authors did not fabricate their research (as far as I can tell).  They just did not know English well, so it was easier to just copy things that you know are phrased well than to learn to write English well.  As the saying goes, do not attribute to malice what can be explained by ignorance or laziness. That does not excuse it but it makes it more understandable.I agree with the article that this is probably just the tip of the iceberg.  There are likely many more lesser evils being committed with similar tools that are just much more difficult to spot.  I would not have noticed my particular example if I were not a reviewer for the paper, for example.  It makes me wonder how big the problem really is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Years ago Tomtom was bullied by microsoft on a patent regarding the use of extended file names on fat-based filesystems. Of course, a popular well-designed device running linux instead of windows CE at the time was not in ms&#39; best interest. Tomtom stood by their position as much as they could and, as time passed, microsoft&#39;s bully behavior cooled out.Congrats for your courage Tomtom! If I ever plan to buy a GPS or navigation device, I&#39;ll certainly consider your history."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TomTom provides mapping data to Apple maps, Bing maps and they power many automotive in-dash navigation systems: https://www.tomtom.com/customers/Very likely they use OpenStreetMaps to enrich their data and it&#39;s nice to see that they contribute back."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Worth noting that Steve Coast - the author of this post - was the founder of the OpenStreetMap project in 2004 (he joined TomTom in 2019)."</p>
