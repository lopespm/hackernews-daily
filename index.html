								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh please do.  This seems like the perfect time to bring this up:I had a piece of software that used Discord for support.  They required that users be verified, which requires you to give you phone number to Discord.  I gave them my Google Voice number, which is the only number I have, and they rejected it because they don&#39;t support VOIP numbers.  I asked them if there was any other way to verify my identity.They told me, &#34;Just use a friend&#39;s phone to verify.  As long as they don&#39;t try to verify on Discord in six months it should be fine, we won&#39;t check again&#34;.Their official answer to identity verification was to impersonate someone else!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just wish people would use a system that&#39;s integrated into where the code is. I don&#39;t want to have to register for a forum when GitHub has a perfectly good ticketing system (and now discussions), and yet I have to register at another place where my details can be leaked from because who knows the technical capability of this one single person who may or may not have done any security.If it&#39;s a company, please have the forum integrated into your software.I seriously do not want yet another login unless there is a good reason. It&#39;s ridiculous. I have nearly 700 logins in my password manager and I&#39;d say probably 500 of those items are websites I&#39;ve registered once to ask a question (quite often questions that go unanswered). Half of these forums do not even provide the capability to removing my account without contacting the admins, which is just an unnecessary hassle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Author here. Thanks for submitting!I wrote this a year ago as my employer was starting up their forum[0]. While we have since added slack, the forum is the main support mechanism for our community (people who pay us money get support tickets).I still stand by that choice for:  * SEO
  * durability
  * question quality

I can&#39;t recall the exact numbers, but something like 5-10% of our overall traffic is to the forum.0: https://fusionauth.io/community/forum/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It doesn&#39;t as get much attention, but Aaron was working a lot on a lot of pro-democracy anti-corruption money-out-of-politics activism in his latter years, founding &#34;Change Congress&#34; with Lessig, which later became &#34;Rootstrikers&#34;, an organization focused on eradicating dark money in politics.Aaron Swartz was also a Progressive (having co-founded &#34;Demand Progress&#34;) and a Keynesian (http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/keynes) who believed in taxing the rich in the service of a functioning economy, I wonder what he would have thought about all the bullshit coming from Paul Graham these days in his vitriolic defense of the status quo. He couldn&#39;t be very happy to hear Graham saying we don&#39;t need to tax and spend on infrastructure to get us out of the climate mess."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Bing image search has solved this problem.For each result you can see multiple pages that include the image. It also shows the resolution and file size of each version. I did a test search for &#34;bear&#34; and clicked on the first result. It showed 14 different pages containing the same image with different sizes and possibly slightly different crops. You can also select a subsection of the image to search for that.It makes Google image search feel like an old school internet tool. I know Bing isn&#39;t cool or popular, but their image search is undeniably superior.I don&#39;t think we need to blame Pinterest for having indexable content. This is a failing of Google image search for not showing alternate matches for the same image.Bing has it figured out. I can&#39;t tell if Google just doesn&#39;t care enough about image search to implement it, or if there&#39;s some obscure patent preventing them from doing so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google prioritizes results from higher ranking sites. This is what PageRank was all about. It&#39;s entirely within Google&#39;s power to score Pinterest results lower, pushing them down in the search results. Seems like a Google problem to me, not a Pinterest problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Slightly OT - Isn&#39;t it obvious that NSO must be able to control every &#34;copy&#34; of Pegasus it sells?They wouldn&#39;t sell it unless they were absolutely sure it wouldn&#39;t be used against its own people and they have no problem selling to their arch enemies.NSO&#39;s defense has always been &#34;we just sell the tech and can&#39;t be held responsible for what our clients do with it&#34; (this was clear from the Darknet Diaries episode).If you consider they must be able to control it, and are therefore perfectly capable of monitoring it, then they become much more complicit in what&#39;s being done with it. Same story if somehow 1 license = 1 target. This is something that I don&#39;t think was explored enough in DD."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be fair, it is quite murky to what extent groups like Al-Haq are associated with the PFLP (which, with its history of aircraft hijackings and suicide bombings, is undoubtedly a terrorist group). There is plenty of purported evidence of financial and personnel links out there, and I really doubt HN is the right forum to decide either way (unless someone is an expert)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does this really matter? Australia passed the &#34;Identify and Disrupt&#34; Law, which allows them as well as any government in the The Five Eyes (FVEY) international security pact to access and modify all digital communications - so why would this story even be important? This is our new world, where any government can access and modify any digital information."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me Hot Reload is the most important feature, which will very likely be a reason for me to move a bit from Python over to .NET, which I haven&#39;t touched for 10 years. Back then I really used it a lot (after moving away from OLE/DCOM/ActiveX), in C++, Managed C++, C# and IronPython (no GIL!). I absolutely loved it, but it was limited to the Microsoft ecosystem.Yesterday, while randomly googling for &#34;hot reload&#34; I got aware of the drama which went down around two weeks ago, when Microsoft decided to remove this feature from the release, even after including it in the previews.Here is a good summary https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L9_pzDjw9HQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In .NET 6, in-memory single file apps have been enabled for Windows and macOS. In .NET 5, this deployment type was limited to Linux. You can now publish a single-file binary that is both deployed and launched as a single file, for all supported OSes. Single files apps no longer extract any core runtime assemblies to temporary directories.This is a great! Now I can publish statically linked executables and run it everywhere. I don&#39;t have to tolerate Golang and its quirks just to have cross-compilation and static binaries, even though they will be larger in size."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Supported for three years as the latest long term support (LTS) release.This is the first thing I look for in these announcements.  .NET 6 is the successor to .NET Core 3.1."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So for context I looked at the papers behind the scenarios.- The heart rate sensing is done on a smart watch, not a phone, and needs data from the actual heart rate sensor every couple of days [1].- The breathing rate is determined from a phone put on the breast or the abdomen [2]. Not really a threat vector in that form.- The audio stuff is incredibly impressive [3], but it doesn&#39;t look like they can reconstruct text with meaningful reliability, it&#39;s more about identifying the person or at least the gender of the person on the other end of the line.The location and activity detection scenarios seem the most credible to me, but the for targeted attacks the audio reconstruction might also work. The other two don&#39;t really seem credible to me yet, but good to be aware of them.1: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04667.pdf2: http://www.ijetch.org/vol8/900-M302.pdf3: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.05972.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Facebook reads the accelerometer all the time. Facebook actually shows a support prompt if a shake event is detected across the app. This could be one reason why Facebook reads accelerometer data.No. Shake gestures are handled at the OS level and you only get began/changed/ended callbacks. Raw accelerometer data requires the CoreMotion framework, and it’s a lower level API. They are definitely using it for something else.This is also confirmed by this:&gt;The prompt has an option to switch this feature off. However, switching it off doesn’t stop the app from reading the accelerometer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Now, if this social app is reading accelerometer data on your phone as well as the passenger’s phone, the app can easily figure out that both phones experience the same vibration pattern. ... Don’t be surprised if you receive a recommendation from the app to add this passenger as a friend.Overall I find the article interesting but this quote is borderline tinfoily. Given the amount of noise in the accelerometer data and signal s much closer to the sensor than the bus itself - such as body movements, it would be hardly precise. Moreover the cost of doing all that research and computation as well as data transfer would hardly pay off."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; A futuristic dystopia. A place where the real world sucks. Where people consider talking to someone a chore. Connection, closeness, ambition are replaced by detachment and dogmatic slumber. Society is satisfied with shallow thoughts and the pursuit of artificially created stimuli in an imaginary world.Beautifully written top-notch orwellian poetry. Seriously inspiring.Also as someone who has only ever used social media as a low-level content creator (we used to be called deadbeat artists) I feel like this starts an important conversation about the new problems that develop when you stop consuming and start doing.In my experience over the last  decade there are fewer and fewer ways to find a community and any success as a creator of any kind without getting corralled into social media and furthermore getting corralled into being a daily active user / consumer as to not get shadow banned by any given app.Doing rather than consuming feels much healthier than doom scrolling, but theres a larger dialogue that has to happen about the problems with creating in the 21st century imho."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe that many of you commenting here about the terrible dangers of social media&#39;s addictiveness and so forth more likely than not simply live in a bubble where you yourselves and the circles of people around you are unusually addicted to it.I can spend a few minutes on Facebook or Instagram a few times a day and that&#39;s it, no problem leaving and few problems with self image anxiety because of some influenciar or other people&#39;s profiles. Most of my friends are more or less similar, and if they use their own social media profiles for anything more heavily, it&#39;s because of work obligations, but outside of those obligations, they simply don&#39;t qualify as addicted.Of course, my own story may be coming from a different kind of bubble of its own, and after all it&#39;s no more than an anecdote, but I&#39;d love to see a concrete, empirical study that shows just how many people out of a given population (broken down by age or demographic groups maybe) really do get emotionally crushed by social media addiction, and how many people are more or less casual about using it and don&#39;t take it too seriously. The harping and woeful lamenting that I keep seeing on HN (ironically full of people who benefited financially from and helped facilitate this very technology in their careers) about how social networks are creating an emotional wasteland is no substitute for real data.All the above aside, the big social networks are indeed fully, empirically worthy of criticism for their endlessly parasitical scrounging for personal data and perpetual monetized surveillance of every person they can push into &#34;engagement&#34;. This however doesn&#39;t necessarily mean that they&#39;re succeeding as much as some like to think at the mass emotional manipulation aspect. The two things need not strongly correlate.After all, as many other seemingly contradictory comments on this same site have noted in the past, much of the ad and content suggestions that sites like FB or Insta push on people are often laughably off the mark at guessing interest or preference, yet at the same time, these same faulty algorithms somehow supposedly devastate the self images and belief systems of millions  of people? So, which is it? It could be both, but that seems rather doubtful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This may not be terribly popular, and its admittedly just conjecture, but I&#39;m of the opinion that its less about the quantity of social media, and more how one interacts with it and even more so consumes it.Some platforms are clearly more toxic than others, though I&#39;m increasingly of the opinion that they are all pretty toxic, just different flavors of &#34;world outlooks&#34; to choose from.I feel that those that actively participate (commenting, posting, responding, reacting) are more affected and more caught in the feedback loop. Those that more or less passively read these platforms, rarely interact, and largely work to keep &#34;perspective&#34; seem to have less of a tough time on it and allow it to impact their outlooks and moods less.Those that tend to interact more seem to get caught in a sort of feedback loop. measured/Nuanced/Moderate or considerate takes are generally frowned upon on most of the major platforms these days. Outrage and simplistic viewpoints reign supreme, and most will bury the rest, forcing even those with moderate stances to either &#34;consider a side&#34; when continuing or just outright not partake. And all of these seem to be, relatively speaking, vocal minorities.There are plenty of people that consume stuff and just dont have anything useful to say, or just dont have the energy to say it and defend it etc. Of course this seems to depend on the platform as well, for example I would never post this take on reddit....With that said, I go agree generally, that these are toxic and create unbalanced viewpoints and world views. As Dave Chappelle said, &#34;twitter isnt real&#34;, and to an effect that true. Twitter, reddit, youtube, facebook, dont necessarily pan out to the larger population&#39;s opinion as a whole, at least where its measured (such as in politics and polling)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can we create decentralized library (catalog) protocol, so it can&#39;t be taken down? I&#39;m thinking about libgen/sci-hub/whatcd(RIP), but entirely decentralized, protocol-based. We already have basically all necessary tools: BitTorrent/IPFS to distribute files, magnet links to link them, DHT to discover peers. We just need to combine them together in a smart way and maybe add some bits of missing functionality, like:- categorization and search;- voting for every entry;- maybe reputation system. Where peers regularly publishing good, high quality content get their &#39;karma&#39;[1] upvoted. So when downloading you can choose people with higher reputation. Or when building catalog of materials in certain area of interest, you can filter only peers with certain threshold karma.- incentive for peers to keep seeding whatever they downloaded at least until achieving certain ratio (say, 2:1). Maybe by rewarding with &#39;torrent tokens&#39; that you can spend on downloading, commenting etc.[2]- comments to every entry (published torrent). With means to combat spam, insults, irrelevant stuff etc. E.g. with voting system, where comments with, say, -3[3] votes become collapsed. Or/and with aforementioned &#39;tokens&#39; that you spend when comment.- personal blacklists to block people whose torrents/comments you don&#39;t want to see.Maybe I&#39;m reinventing the wheel here and something similar already exists, but for some reason not popular (since I never heard of it)? In that case we need to figure out why it didn&#39;t shoot and fix it to make it work.[1] Your ID will be a cryptographic key a la cryptocurrency wallet.[2] With rare but sought after torrents rewarding you with more tokens.[3] Personally adjustable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Master Foo and the RecruiterA technical recruiter, having discovered that that the ways of Unix hackers were strange to him, sought an audience with Master Foo to learn more about the Way. Master Foo met the recruiter in the HR offices of a large firm.The recruiter said, “I have observed that Unix hackers scowl or become annoyed when I ask them how many years of experience they have in a new programming language. Why is this so?”Master Foo stood, and began to pace across the office floor. The recruiter was puzzled, and asked “What are you doing?”“I am learning to walk,” replied Master Foo.“I saw you walk through that door” the recruiter exclaimed, “and you are not stumbling over your own feet. Obviously you already know how to walk.”“Yes, but this floor is new to me.” replied Master Foo.Upon hearing this, the recruiter was enlightened.Source:  http://www.catb.org/~esr/writings/unix-koans/recruiter.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t true at all. Its obvious for a senior/staff/principal engineer to claim that their skillset is infinitely transferrable to any job role that needs a staff level skillse, but its simply not true. There are tooling agnostic skills you learn (managing complexity, upleveling team members, how to actually be a technical leader and make improvements that a manager doesn&#39;t explicitly tell you to do) and there are tooling specific skills that you need in an organization (EX: dependency management in java, performance issues in certain DBs, the unwritten/not explicit API issues in different cloud platforms). If I am hiring for a staff engineer, I will be trying to get the combination of &#34;tooling agnostic&#34; staff engineering skills AND &#34;tooling specific&#34; staff engineering skills for my job opening because you don&#39;t end up paying more for an engineer that has a well matched &#34;tooling specific&#34; skillset, but they will be more productive. The net cost to me as an employer is simply time, I might need to source 3x the candidates to get a good fit, but its worth it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I strongly disagree.A senior engineer that has always worked in the backend won&#39;t be able to be up to speed with a complex frontend app quickly and be as effective as a senior frontend.There&#39;s just too much to know about browsers and underlying tech and a myriad it things.Same for a senior frontend starting to work on a complex backend all with god knows how many interconnected technologies.Being able to go from JS to TS? Sure. Being able to go from JS to Rust + Docker + (all your backend stuff here) not so much."</p>
