								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Article makes fun of how slow i2c is compared to the super high speed pairs next to it on HDMI plug.
Well, please note that there is a bus that is literally a thousand time slower than i2c on that same connector. It&#39;s CEC. Contrary to i2c it only occupies one wire rather than two though.
CEC, which is used mainly to power TV on/off or switch sources has a whopping bandwidth of 400bps. No missing multiplier.Maximum device name is 16B. If you have a TV, a tvbox and a game console, simply asking the name of those devices can take more than a second.
I&#39;m in the process of shortening my product&#39;s CEC name, in order to reduce congestion on the bus.Mainline Linux CEC developer jokes that Voyager 1 which is on the other side of solar system, made 40 years prior to CEC, is faster than CEC.Edit: Sorry for the atrocious original formating"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Uh, oh. The work project I&#39;m working on uses an OLED display that uses an I2C interface. And I happen to have a spare one sitting on my desk. And I&#39;m no electrical engineer, so let&#39;s see how fast I smoke this thing. :-)Should I succeed, TFA author will not have the worst HDMI display ever, as the one we&#39;re using is a two-line display looking something like this (it can do rudimentary graphics, though; we display a company logo at boot):https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/Vishay-Dale/O020O002ALP..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I nearly got taken by a scammer because Amazon transferred me to one.  I purchased a set of Reolink cameras on Amazon, (they&#39;ve been great) one of them failed a couple months in.  I contacted Amazon customer support (via my Amazon login and in their interface) and they wanted to troubleshoot with their technical team.  Eventually the (very helpful) Amazon technician suggested contacting Reolink for support and started a 3-way call.  The &#34;Reolink&#34; technician got my phone number and then said they wanted to call me back.They called me back a minute later (now without Amazon recording the conversation) and asked me for my NVR&#39;s serial number so they could connect to my NVR.  I was shocked they had a backdoor into my NVR but I figured I&#39;d let it play out.  A minute later the technician said that he was having trouble connecting because &#34;an internet virus is corrupting my firewall&#34;.  I was extremely confused and thought it must be a translation problem.  Until he kept insisting it was a problem and became belligerent and angry.  He said I needed to pay $300 to have an on-site technician troubleshoot the problem.  I got angry because he was making some weird excuse for their camera not working, and wanting to charge me rather than just ship me a replacement.  I refused and he started mocking me.  I demanded his manager and he ignored me.  Eventually I hung up and called Amazon back.The Amazon technician was helpful and shipped me a replacement.  I contacted Reolink via email to complain about their technician.  They responded that they have no on-site technicians and that it was a scam!I was blown away that Amazon would transfer me to a scammer.  I contacted Amazon again and let them know what had happened.  Hopefully they will figure out how their guy got this scammers phone number and teach him how to find a 3rd party phone number..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s one easy rule that could have avoided all of this - never give out any info on incoming calls. If I get a call or text about fraudulent transactions, I&#39;ll keep them on hold while I log into the bank website. If I get a call about a late payment, I&#39;ll thank them for the info and ask them to stay on while I pay online. If I get an inbound call with a more complex request, I&#39;ll ask them for their employee info and call back the official service number. It annoys the caller sometimes, despite always treating them professionally, but I keep that a hardline rule no matter how real it feels.I heard this from a security guy and was under the impression it was one of the sacred laws of security. If it&#39;s not, it should be - it&#39;s a rule of thumb that would stop 90% of social engineering attacks I hear about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It gets even weirder when your bank acts like a scammer. A few weeks ago I was trying to help my wife add her USBank credit card to Apple Pay and Apple Pay said I needed to call this number to finish setting up the card. So I call the number and the guy is very friendly and asks me for a bunch of identity verification details, which I provide to him, but then he asks us to send a code back that will be coming over text messaging - yes, I initiated the phone call, but I suddenly realize that the number Apple directed me to was not the same number on my USBank card. Being a bit paranoid I tell the guy “Look, nothing personal but I get nervous when people ask for a verification code to be read back to them, I’m just going to call the regular number and go from there, okay?” Instead of being friendly, this guy suddenly gets in my face and is like “Oh, you’ll give me all this other info but won’t read that code back to me? I’m Fraud Prevention dude, good luck getting this done calling the main number. Oh, and just for this I’m putting a block on your card.” I hung up immediately and called US Bank’s main number and asked to talk to a supervisor - sure as hell, it turns out the guy I had talked to did work in their fraud prevention department and actually had retaliated against me by locking my credit card. It was the most incredibly ugly thing I’ve ever seen from a customer service department."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s so much more to CI/CD than the build definitions (e.g. dashboarding, log viewing/retention, access control, manual interventions, secret management, test reporting, etc.) and while some of your points resonate very strongly with me (e.g. local builds), I can&#39;t help but wonder what the endgame is here?You&#39;ve raised $27m to what? Give away a free tool for engineers to define their builds in? While they continue to use and pay for another service to actually run the builds? I assume you intend to replace the CI service at some point and move up the stack to monetize?Without more transparency its easy to imagine something like...Step 1. Drive uptake of your tool by selling people on the pitfalls of &#34;CI lock-in&#34;
Step 2. Introduce your own CI solution, which people can now easily switch to
Step 3. Lock people in"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m highly jealous of teams that can containerize all their build tools.If you deal with proprietary toolchains that are tens of gigabytes (Windows WDK, Xilinx Vivado/Vitis) it’s just untenable, and that’s before even mentioning licensing. Even Azure doesn’t have a great solution for WDK development. It’s hard to feel like we’re not being left behind.Bind mounting the tools into the container is an option but at that point you’re using the container just because that’s what your CI expects, not because it’s any better or more reproducible than a  raw Jenkins shell script."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d like to see more attention put into carving out a subset of Mastodon&#39;s functionality that would allow you to host your fediverse node on a static site, à la blog feeds powered by RSS/Atom.The discovery problem can be handled pretty straightforwardly: if you want notifications of replies to your posts, then that&#39;s just another feed that you subscribe to—a separate service.  You don&#39;t exactly need an always-on &#34;instance&#34; providing an inbox endpoint to relay notifications to you.You give up private channels (DMs), but you gain a lot more flexibility.  It&#39;s a shame that there are so few server (and client) implementations for &#34;the fediverse&#34;.  We should have at least half as many options as we have in static site generators themselves.  (In fact, with this approach, your preferred static site generator could become part of your &#34;client&#34;...)Imagine your corner of the fediverse being reachable at $YOURNAME.github.io.Prior art: Fritter &lt;https://github.com/beakerbrowser/fritter&gt;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Discoverability has always been a hot topic on Mastodon. Discoverability makes or breaks a platform, as there is nothing more important to retain a new user than to let them find something interesting to stay for, as soon as possible. In 3.5, we bring a new explore page which features currently popular posts, news stories that people share a lot, trending hashtags and follow recommendations. Furthermore, for the first time, we attempt to bring people content in their own language.An algorithm to rank posts and people? Did we learn nothing from twitter?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see new updates!I run a mastodon instance [0] (themed to look like Windows XP). Overall I really enjoy mastodon (and the fediverse in general), it gives the user an opportunity to carve out their own niche through their own instance, while still being able to interact with the overall system.There are still some challenges with setting up your own instance (I couldn&#39;t get the docker image working, the documentation for setting up a dev environment could use some improvement, and email confirmation is difficult without using an external service), but think this will improve over time, and there are managed services you can use to run your own instance.[0] https://lunadon.org/"</p>

We also see blog posts with the latest ML approach &#34;doing the impossible&#34; and providing reasonable (not optimal) solutions to 50-city TSPs.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a lawyer, i&#39;ve read this entire filing and it seems like nonsense at a glance.Krebs mentions the person was arrested. Ubiquiti claims first that he doesn&#39;t point out the person he sourced it from what arrested, and that he tries to mislead people by not saying repeatedly that the person is basically felon, and that being arrested makes him an invalid source of evidence, etc.  They also claim he describes him as a current employee.This is all nonsense AFAICT1. Krebs mentions the person was arrested.2. Krebs says &#34;In March, a ubiqitui employee said X&#34;. That was accurate at the time (AFAIK, and ubiquiti cites no real evidence I see that Krebs should have known it was not true).3. Krebs carefully points out the arrested person claims x and y (which is accurate).4. The filing says Sharp made false claims, and spends a paragraph explaining them.5. The filing says Krebs made them too, but ironically, for all of its bluster, doesn&#39;t cite where and when (that I can see), and which exact claims, they are claiming Krebs said that were false.6. The filing cites no evidence that Krebs knew or should have known, in March, that the claims were false.  They get into some weird arguments about their 10-q filing but it&#39;s hard to understand the point they are trying to make. It apperas they are trying to claim that krebs should have known they notified the public but i think that&#39;s kind of a silly argument - krebs is clearly talking about their users, and most users do not read 10-q&#39;s.  Saying you notified the public because you put it in a 10-q is like saying you notified the public because you put it in a classified ad section.  It&#39;s dumb wordplay.7. The December blog post they say he &#34;doubled down on&#34; seems again, carefully written to say what Sharp claims, not what Krebs claims.I could go on.The whole thing is, IMHO, not written very well.  It&#39;s very emotionally written for a pleading, and you will be hard pressed to find a judge who will get themselves worked up over that kind of writing. Instead they mostly roll their eyes and wish that someone gave them a clear and convincing pleading instead.Put another way - if there is a case here, it isn&#39;t visible on this pleading.  This feels like &#34;throw a bunch of emotional stuff at a wall and hope it sticks&#34;, where you really want &#34;here is an open and shut case of why this person defamed us&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The lawsuit, it seems like a grey area. Report on something but then further facts come out and your story is literally outright false. You&#39;ve been misled and abused by your source. I guess that&#39;s the job of a journalist to ensure what you are publishing is true.Flipside, there&#39;s a term named &#34;Krebbed&#34; for a reason. https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=krebbedKrebs has a history of poor journalism to say the least. Frankly, it&#39;s best to ignore Krebs. I stopped reading him years ago.https://itwire.com/business-it-news/security/new-york-times-...https://itwire.com/business-it-news/security/infosec-researc...https://itwire.com/business-it-news/security/ex-wp-man-krebs...3 separate instances where Krebs got it wrong. Seems to happen a little too often.Seems clear to me, Ubiquiti got Krebbed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems pretty close to textbook SLAPP in a jurisdiction - Virginia - that has strong anti-SLAPP laws [correction: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30867948 notes this is federal, and it has not been established if VA SLAPP laws apply] and  and precedent for their use. I am a fan of Ubiquiti gear but I hope they lose, pay Krebs&#39; costs, and pay a multiple of the costs as damages.https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1509374736903507974 is just an example of how well this is going over."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good luck, I hope this works! Here&#39;s my initial feedback.1) The site needs to be much more visually attractive. On my 13&#34; laptop it&#39;s a gray chat box floating in a ton of white space. Not centered, no color, and the logo looks like it&#39;s from 1999. The other icons on the page look like something from an Android demo app. I would never ever land on this site and think this is something new or exciting.2) I asked &#34;Who is in first place in the eastern conference?&#34; and it did correctly infer that this was an NBA question (despite my UK IP address) but the top result it gave me was a mangled table from 6 months ago. The second result was a yahoo sports article which was more helpful.3) I asked &#34;how many covid cases were there in the UK yesterday&#34; and got &#34;the answer is about 16.5 million&#34;.

Bing also returned an instant answer, but their answer is even more wrong (the release was pushed back by a couple of months, Bing claims that the movie would be released at the future date of February 2022).Then I tried [will there be a wheat shortage this year?], and the top result was a lunatic fringe prepper blog, from which you extracted a confident answer that there will definitely be a wheat shortage. Google doesn&#39;t try to answer the question (which I&#39;d argue is correct for something this speculative), and only links to reputable news sources all of which look relevant. Bing is the same, but mixes in some more alternative results at the bottom of the page.Then, since you said that this worked best in a conversational manner I asked [is it due to the war?], obviously referring to the previous question. Rather than keep the context of that previous search in mind, you replied with information on the current local weather. (In Fahrenheit, for a location in Europe).At this point, combined with how incredibly slow the searches are, my goodwill would be gone as a real user."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just wanted to say after trying out a few searches how blown away I am by this.The level of understanding is indeed not there yet to rival directly with competitors, but you’re doing more than a decent job on a lot of requests which is no small feat looking at the competition.Wishing you luck, and curious to see it evolve!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The &#34;STIR/SHAKEN initiative&#34; was supposed to fix this.[1] There&#39;s now a whole system with signed certificates, much like SSL certs, to sign caller ID info. The info is at least good enough to find out which carrier generated the phony data.You should file a complaint with the FCC that your carrier has not clearly not properly implemented STIR/SHAKEN, since they badly mis-identified the source of a call. While calls from outside the US can be unsigned, the carrier should detect that the number is inconsistent with the source.There are &#34;A&#34;, &#34;B&#34;, and &#34;C&#34; level of verification. &#34;A&#34; calls are probably legit. The others, maybe not.If you&#39;re in California, try making a personal data request to your carrier for the detailed STIR/SHAKEN data for that call.[1] https://commlawgroup.com/2021/stir-shaken-robocall-mitigatio..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Your phone company knows the originator info of your calls and texts (or at least enough hops until they reach some even more untrustworthy than normal phone provider). They simply don&#39;t give you that info and instead show you an unverified caller ID that anyone can basically set to anything by whoever is contacting you.Blame your phone company and the FCC for not solving this (and for not providing you with the data to solve it yourself)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The good news is that Verizon has all these grand plans to intercept your browsing data and use it to target ads, but they can&#39;t even implement the most rudimentary spam protection on SMS, so I don&#39;t have high hopes that they&#39;re going to make any money by spying on everyone.One could argue that since the more messages you receive, they more you pay, they have no incentive to reduce spam; whereas with ad tracking, as long as they find some advertiser willing to pay 100 million dollars for a 1% increase on click throughs on their overpriced toothpaste, they&#39;ll have a financial incentive to do a good job.  So maybe we&#39;re actually really screwed.Sad that a cell phone company can&#39;t be just a cell phone company.  They were pretty good at that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My first leadership lesson looked like this: as a junior engineer I had an abysmal quarter or two. My manager asked me what was going on. After I gave them an assessment of the situation, they said that they believed me and went to bat for me.Because of that manager&#39;s trust and belief in me even in the face of irrefutable evidence that I was doing poorly, I immediately became fiercely loyal to that manager and the organization, and I wanted to work harder for them.I&#39;m no 10x engineer, but any time I get frustrated with someone else&#39;s poor output, I think about this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Overworking makes me think of falling into a hero/rescuer mode of the karpman drama triangle[1].Basically the idea is you can really disempower others if you constantly do the work yourself to rescue them from their own mistakes. And the other person can take the role of victim in the relationship, in need of rescuing instead of being responsible the consequences themselves. Or persecutor - blaming and casting out against others.1 - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karpman_drama_triangle"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The main character is trying to do their job effectively, but can’t due to the low performance of a peer. They escalate to the appropriate manager to address the issue, but that manager transforms the performance issue into a relationship issue: it’s not that the peer isn’t performing, it’s just that the two of you don’t like each other.It is quite hard to find the line between performance issue and relationship issue. I ran into this myself when I had a new manager who wanted to institute policies that to the tech leads seemed nonsense, and I chose to not do what they asked. They took it as a performance issue to the +1 but the +1 turned it into a relationship issue and this was the right call. The problem is that by that time we were both so set in our view that the other was obstructing the way forward that we couldn’t find a middle, and eventually it came down to a hard choice which I “won” by pushing them out of the company. In hindsight I could have made more of an effort to build a personal rapport and get on good enough terms to find a middle ground."</p>
