								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So the way I&#39;m reading the post is Tesla swapped out a battery pack for a 60 with a 90 and enabled the 90. Tesla, years later, discovers that even though the hardware for a 90 was installed it should have been software limited to be a 60. (I&#39;m assuming that Tesla only made the owner pay the cost of the 60 battery swap even though they replaced it with a 90). They go and &#34;fix the glitch&#34; and set it back to the 60. Since the new owner bought it thinking it was a 90, because it was enabled to be a 90, presumably paid for it assuming this was the case and is now upset because they don&#39;t have what they thought they bought.Sounds like all around bad decisions. The previous owner shouldn&#39;t have sold it as a 90 or at least disclosed that, &#34;It&#39;s a 60 but Tesla swapped out the batter with a 90 and left it configured as a 90&#34;. Tesla, being notified, should have just enabled the 90 and made the customer happy. How exactly are people supposed to abuse this? Tesla put the 90 in there and they&#39;re the only ones who are going to be doing that. Presumably this cost them a fortune to do it in the first place. Why not get some good will out of it? &#34;Hey sorry about your battery. We only had a 90 so we threw that in there. Enjoy. Tell everyone you know about how awesome Tesla was about fixing the problem and remember that next time you go to buy your next car&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll spare the moral judgements against Tesla for this:The real moral of the story here is that if your business plan and practices is creating occasional weird issues and huge cognitive dissonance in your customers, it&#39;s the wrong business plan.  Also... the number of people this applies to is likely so low that Tesla really screwed up by not erring on the side of the customer.  (They didn&#39;t buy from Tesla, but they&#39;re still a customer buying servicing from them.)  If the bad publicity alone causes even a tiny fraction of the population to choose another manufacturer, the&#39;ve lost their $4,500 and then some.Harmony is a really underrated concept.  When things are harmonious, you don&#39;t have problems like this, and you can still make money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I feel like this is more mundane on Tesla&#39;s part than many are making it out to be.
A mistake was made years ago. An employee recently discovered and &#34;fixed&#34; it. 
Terrible communication and customer service, but nefarious? Nah.&#34;At this point I feel like terrible communication and service is an intentional business strategy for some companies who found that by making support so baroque as to be inaccessible or just eliminating it entirely that they can slash costs accordingly. I do consider it to be nefarious in such cases."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not a good article. At a technical level it&#39;s confused about a whole bunch of things:* SMM has been part of x86 for decades. The Secured Core requirements around SMM actually reduce its power.* The claimed requirement to remove the third party UEFI CA certificate from 2022 Secured Core PCs is entirely unrelated to Pluton (it&#39;s required regardless of whether Pluton is enabled or not, and even whether the CPU has Pluton or not)* Most of the description of Pluton is actually a description of a TPM. You don&#39;t need DICE for remote attestation. TPMs are already a hardware keystore.* System firmware is already being updated via Windows Update. The discussion about Pluton and Windows Update is around Pluton getting firmware updates that way (the existing story around firmware updates for TPMs is largely not good)* Existing TPM-based remote attestation already includes the secure boot stateThe short version: everything that the article is worried about being enabled by Pluton is already possible, and has been for years.But there&#39;s a meaningful point here. Remote attestation can certainly be used to restrict access to resources in ways that are incompatible with general purpose computing, or which reduce user choice. Remote attestation can also be used to give end users confidence that their machine is in a good state without constraining what they do with it. As a technology, remote attestation can be used in both good and bad ways. We do need to keep track of whether anyone is threatening to use it in bad ways and react appropriately.(But tbh remote attestation as an attack on general purpose computing isn&#39;t the really scary thing about widespread remote attestation. Remote attestation ties back to the TPM&#39;s endorsement key, an immutable cryptographic key certified by the TPM vendor at manufacturing time. The straightforward implementation of allowing arbitrary remote sites to trigger remote attestation would tie all of these accesses back to a single piece of hardware, and would be a privacy nightmare.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m completely missing how his example of a Word document that can only be opened by approved users on approved hardware within the corporation is supposed to be a bad thing.Honestly, that sounds pretty fantastic. I&#39;ve been using 3rd party tools/extensions to do this sort of thing in corporate and government environments for years, but having the attestation go all the way down to the hardware level is a big value-add, especially with so much ransomware/spyware/extortion/espionage going on these days.Can someone please explain to me how the author might see this level of security as a bad thing?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing I fear the most with this is &#34;proof that secure boot has never been disabled&#34;. This is just a way to brick your device from accessing services.What if you government&#39;s tax service requires such proof? Or bank? I cannot count how many machines I booted on Linux to rescue a hard drive, or image it, or wipe it, or just to install linux on them. All those devices, boom, paperweight for regular personal use.I hate it so much that Microsoft is alone in this. It&#39;s not because it&#39;s M$, it&#39;s because they&#39;re alone on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have background here and can take a pretty good guess at what happened. You used a Brex card, which Google sees as a “privacy card.” These are often used by scammers trying to circumvent Google blocking their credit card account numbers.The solution here is to never use a hidden or “privacy” card number with Google, although of course Google will never tell you that or confirm or deny this. I only know this due to working with clients in this area.You can try removing that card and adding a regular hard card number and asking for a reinstatement again, but it may be too late for this account.Hopefully this helps folks reading this to not make the same mistake (although it’s incredibly frustrating that stuff like this has to be learned by trial and error or knowledge from those of us who have dealt with this previously.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have had nearly this exact experience, marketing a small SaaS.A sudden ads suspension arrived, with no explanation beyond &#34;suspicious payments&#34;. This from the same billing account used with GSuite, Domains, GCP; and from a business that was having no trouble running ads on FB, Twitter, and Reddit. &#34;How silly, but I&#39;m sure we can get it fixed&#34;.. I thought.Like OP I&#39;m also a Xoogler, so after two rounds of unsuccessful appeals through the front door (including updating my payment account to a hard card, providing articles of incorporation, and so on, to no avail), I figured it was time to call in my first ever favor. Surely one of my old-timer engineer buddies could thunk a ticket somewhere and maybe we&#39;d help them fix a bug in some automated system in the process.But the Google of 2022 is far different than the earlier days. It seems individual employees, even well-placed engineers, have incredibly and increasingly limited agency to fix things outside their immediate purview; a wiki about internal escalations for ads suspension stated they were no longer accepted, vaguely for reasons of &#34;compliance&#34;.On the bright side, the whole episode made me rethink and ultimately diversify our technology dependency on Google. I was naive not to do so more seriously and earlier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It feels like every month or so there is another story like this about Google&#39;s customer support. For me it is one of the reasons I will *never* build on Google Cloud.Combine this with their propensity to randomly shut down services and also jack up the prices of things by some wild amount overnight with no warning or justification. (Google Maps API and Kubernetes control plane.)I would never consider risking all of my work on Google&#39;s reputation which is a shame because I&#39;m sure the services themselves work relatively well. It feels like everyone outside of google is widely aware of these issues but everyone inside is completely blind to them.Side Note: has anyone ever &#34;won&#34; an appeal with Google or does the system deny 100% of appeals?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems extremely clever.I know Mullvad already allows you to e.g. send cash in an envelope for total privacy, but that&#39;s kind of a pain, it&#39;ll take a long time to arrive, if the envelope is lost there&#39;s nothing you can do, etc.But by physically printing covered-up codes on cards, this actually uses Amazon to create the privacy/anonymity, which kind of feels ironic given how Amazon generally tries to hoover up all the data. You can get your code with fast Prime delivery, a tracking number, pay for it with your credit card, get a free replacement if it&#39;s lost in the mail...I love this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kind of surprised this hasn&#39;t been mentioned yet, but it&#39;s pretty commonplace to buy gift cards with cryptocurrencies. So there&#39;s yet another layer of anonymity if you buy an Amazon gift card from a stranger/service then use it for a physical Mullvad activation code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I generally believe it to be possible, I am very curious about how Mullvad is storing its payment records to avoid time-based correlations.For gift cards it&#39;s more async, but given that payment processors keep records that can be correlated, if Mullvad isn&#39;t careful about timestamping, how it records crediting to accounts, or the like, it would be extremely easy to de-anonymize account relations IMO."</p>

Volume is now lower than it was way back in 2020.The crypto down rounds are going to be hilarious.Note to investors: if you’re investing in crypto projects, carefully consider the ponzinomics and the vesting schedule. You want your unlocks to happen in the middle of the bullrun when exit liquidity is ample.And also remember that whatever you might think of as “normal”
volume will crash 90%. And when you think it has stabilized, it will crash 90% more.The number of investors who bought the top is hilarious. But then, this is also a field where risk management is treated like a sin."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Helium isn&#39;t your typical crypto company.  Their vision is actually very lofty - build a distributed low data wireless network completely independent of phone providers and cable companies.And pay the people who own nodes a percentage of the $ earned thru the traffic flow of their node.The payment just uses crypto because the ecosystem is a nice fit.  Everybody knows what miners are and that they make money.The problem is that you need the entire network in place before people can build on it.  So they have been subsidizing the miners.  And it&#39;s a race of how much money can you raise and payout vs how much is a network like that is worth.And right now everybody has cellular and cable and fiber and no one really needs another system.  Most of the use cases (LOTS of sensor data) aren&#39;t really worth that much money.Personally, I think the government should subsidize something like this to allow it to get off the ground.  Earthquake data, climate data, traffic data, etc.  Essentially public use."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I looked into getting a Helium hotspot, but when I looked at my ISP‘s terms of service, the Helium use case is explicitly forbidden (I use Frontier Internet in Florida.)If you’re not familiar with it, what a Helium hotspot does is allow compatible IOT devices to share your Internet connection.I suspect that allowing random third parties to use your Internet connection it’s explicitly forbidden by the terms of service of most ISPs, especially when you are being monetarily compensated/rewarded for such sharing.Excerpt from ToS:
“Customers may not retransmit the Service or make the Service available to anyone outside the
premises (i.e. Wi-Fi or other methods of networking).”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What really helped me understand and troubleshoot network communications at the socket level was the book by W. Richard Stevens[0]. I think this is because he starts with an introduction to TCP, and builds from there. Knowing TCP states and transitions is important to reading packet dumps, and in general debugging networking.Also, no matter what platform you&#39;re using, there is probably a socket implementation somewhere at the core. You&#39;re best off understanding how sockets work, then understanding how the platform you&#39;re working with uses sockets[1].Once I read the W. Richard Stevens book, I was able to read and understand RFCs for protocols like HTTP to know how things should work. Then you&#39;re better prepared to figure out if a behavior is due to your code, or an implementation of the protocol in your device, or the device on the other end of the network connection, or some intermediary device.[0] - http://www.kohala.com/start/unpv12e.html[1] - https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winsock/porti..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How you handle a file no longer existing vs. a socket disconnection are not likely to be very similar. I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll get counter arguments to this,That&#39;s my cue! I think the &#34;everything is a file&#34; is somewhat misunderstood. I might even rephrase it as &#34;everything is a file descriptor&#34; first, but then if you need to give a name to it, or ACL that thing, that&#39;s what the file-system is for: that all the objects share a common hierarchy, and different things that need names can be put in say, the same directory. I.e., that there is one hierarchy, for pipes, devices, normal files, etc.I&#39;d argue that the stuff that &#34;is&#34; a file (named or anonymous) or a file descriptor is actually rather small, and most operations are going to require knowing what kind of file you have.E.g., in Linux, read()/write() behave differently when operating on, e.g., an eventfd, read() requires a buffer of at least 8 B.Heck, &#34;close&#34; might really be the only thing that makes sense, generically. (I&#39;d also argue that a (fallible¹) &#34;link&#34; call should be in that category, but alas, it isn&#39;t on Linux, and potentially unlink for similar reasons — i.e., give and remove names from a file. I think this is a design mistake personally, but Linux is what it is. What I think is a bigger mistake is having separate/isolated namespaces for separate types of objects. POSIX, and hence Linux, makes this error in a few spots.)But if you&#39;re just writing a TCP server, yeah, that probably doesn&#39;t matter.&gt; and that you should write your applications to treat these the same.But I wouldn&#39;t argue that. A socket likely is a socket for some very specific purpose (whatever the app is, most likely), and that specific purpose is going mean it will be treated as that.In OOP terms, just b/c something might have a base class doesn&#39;t mean we always treat it as only an instance of the base class. Sometimes the stuff on the derived class is very important to the function of the program, and that&#39;s fine.¹e.g., in the case of an anonymous normal file (an unlinked temp file, e.g., O_TMPFILE), attempting to link it on a different file-system would have to fail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the big issues with TCP is a lot of communication isn&#39;t well-suited to the stream model and is message-oriented, so yes, like the author says, you have to go implement ACKs. And then you want multiplexing, which streams also fail at. Before you know it, you built a worse version of HTTP2."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I sort of owe callgrind a big chunk of my career.I was working at a company full of PhDs and well seasoned veterans, who looked at me as a new kid, kind of underqualified to be working in their tools group. I had been at the firm for a while, and they were nice enough, but didn&#39;t really have me down as someone who was going to contribute as anything other than a very junior engineer.We had a severe problem with a program&#39;s performance, and no one really had any idea why. And as it was clearly not a sophisticated project, I got assigned to figure something out.I used the then very new callgrind and the accompanying flamegraph, and discovered that we were passing very large bit arrays for register allocation by value. Very, very large. They had started small enough to fit in registers, but over time had grown so large that a function call to manipulate them effectively flushed the cache, and the rest of the code assumed these operations were cheap.Profiling tools at the time were quite primitive, and the application was a morass of shared libraries, weird dynamic allocations and JIT, and a bunch of other crap.Valgrind was able to get the profiles after failing with everything else I could try.The presentation I made on that discovery, and my proposed fixes (which eventually sped everything up greatly), finally earned the respect of my colleagues, and no phd wasn&#39;t a big deal after that. Later on, those colleagues who had left the company invited me to my next gig. And the one after that.So thanks!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish I hadn&#39;t read this article because now I know that I&#39;ve been mispronouncing Valgrind for nearly 20 years but I&#39;m not going to stop.(Kidding. Thanks for Valgrind! I still use it for assessing memory corruption vulnerabilities along with ASan.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well damn, no wonder he’s so good at optimising the Rust compiler. He literally has a PhD in profiling tools!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m fond of Vale, where you can write your own rules or grab others off github. I wish we could crowd source a grammarly clone using it. Some efforts have been made to do so, but didn&#39;t get far.https://github.com/errata-ai/valehttps://github.com/testthedocs/Openly"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been a user of the Language Tool API as we&#39;re building (experimenting with?) a language learning app [1] and grammar correction is a key component. I really want to love it, and I&#39;m so appreciative of the open source version that has allowed us to get going, but it&#39;s just so... limited. I haven&#39;t really dug into the code, but I gather that it is very rules based and that seems destined to fail because so much of language is context sensitive.For example, it really can&#39;t determine in German if you&#39;re using the correct case or not for a particular verb. Or it can&#39;t really tell if you&#39;re using the right prepositions.Ultimately, we ended up building a grammar engine just for language learners using transformers [2] + a version of errant [3] we ported to be multilingual. It&#39;s not perfect, but after a couple weeks of development was more helpful than LT.1. https://squidgies.app2. e.g. this paper from Grammarly https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.12592, but there are a bazillion others3. https://github.com/chrisjbryant/errant"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a heavy user of LT. Very happy with it.A really nice feature of LT is that you can add your own rules. A rule editor is provided here:https://community.languagetool.org/ruleEditor2/Basically, whenever you catch an error in your writing you add a rule to ensure that it is caught the next time. After a few years your rule set will catch a large portion of your writing errors. It&#39;s fun too."</p>
