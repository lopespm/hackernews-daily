								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The web pages and git aren&#39;t updated yet, here is the vulnerability straight from the .tar.gz on their FTP:Fixed two buffer overflows in punycode decoding functions. 
A buffer overrun can be triggered in X.509 certificate verification, specifically in name constraint checking. Note that this occurs after
certificate chain signature verification and requires either a CA to have signed the malicious certificate or for the application to continue
certificate verification despite failure to construct a path to a trusted issuer.In a TLS client, this can be triggered by connecting to a malicious server. In a TLS server, this can be triggered if the server requests client
authentication and a malicious client connects.An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow an arbitrary number of bytes containing the . character (decimal 46) on the
stack. This buffer overflow could result in a crash (causing a denial of service). ([CVE-2022-3786])An attacker can craft a malicious email address to overflow four attacker-controlled bytes on the stack. This buffer overflow could result in a
crash (causing a denial of service) or potentially remote code execution depending on stack layout for any given platform/compiler.
([CVE-2022-3602])-----------------------------------Doesn&#39;t sound that critical to me. CAs normally don&#39;t let you outright construct your own certificate, and I&#39;d expect you&#39;ll have a hard time to get a certificate issued which is both for mail encryption (so you get an email name constraint) and TLS (SAN constraint). And servers without TLS client authentication, which is about 99.99 % of them, aren&#39;t affected. TLS client auth is usually only used in enterprise networks and typically terminated by middleboxes running ancient software anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone else with &#34;mature&#34; server configurations confused by the OpenSSL version number because you&#39;re on 1.1.x and wondering how to translate the patched 3.0.x version number to something that applies to you; it seems that you have nothing to worry about:&gt; This code was first introduced in OpenSSL 3.0.0.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To put this in perspective, the 18300kg per hour from the Permian site is equivalent (over a 100 time horizon global warming potential) to a 500 Megawatt coal power plant&#39;s CO2 emissions (~1kg of CO2 per kWh of electricity) burning 24/7. Or, to put it another way, it accounts for the same emissions as about 0.3% of the entire US electricity grid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Several questions ask to contextualize this measurement.Here&#39;s a highly-cited paper in Nature (including some of the researchers quoted in the OP) that describes how an earlier survey of California methane emissions went:https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1720-3If I remember right, the state of CA asked for this survey. It was carried out by an instrument similar to that of the OP, but airborne, not on ISS as in OP.California has standards for methane emissions (e.g., https://ww2.arb.ca.gov/resources/fact-sheets/oil-and-gas-met...) that are now covering landfills and oil and gas infrastructure, and dairies -- three of the largest categories of large emitters.(One effect of these regulations, that lay people may have noticed, is trying to get food waste out of the landfill stream, and into composting, so that it doesn&#39;t decay anaerobically and produce methane. In LA, for example, the LADWP is test-driving a program where food scraps - vegetables, but also meats and fats - are diverted into green bins.)Strengthened regulations on methane emissions from oil and gas infrastructure are part of this - I&#39;m not saying the studies motivated these regulations, just that they are all part of policies heading in that direction.It is believed that large oil companies are aggressively selling off oil pumps/fields to get out from under this responsibility. (https://www.propublica.org/article/california-oil-wells-shel...)The ISS measurements in OP have covered (and will continue to cover) a much broader area than the California airborne survey - but with less spatial resolution - so presumably a broad survey of mid-latitude super-emitters will be possible in the coming months."</p>

She didn&#39;t ask for this and was working on cool stuff:https://holliemengert.com/Next, somebody grabs her work (copyrighted by the clients she works for), without permission. Then goes on to try and create an AI version of her style. When confronted, the guy&#39;s like: &#34;meh, ah well&#34;.Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s legal or not, it&#39;s careless and plain rude.

Not aggressive, not threatening to sue, just expressing civilized dislike, which is as reasonable as it gets.Next, she gets to see her name on the orange site, reading things like &#34;style is bad and too generic&#34;, a wide series of cold-hearted legal arguments and &#34;get out of the way of progress&#34;.How wonderful.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know this website is not a hivemind, but it&#39;s interesting every time an article like this gets posted the majority opinion seems to be that training diffusion models on copyrighted work is totally fine. In contrast when talking about training code generation models there are multiple comments mentioning this is not ok if licenses weren&#39;t respected.For anyone who holds both of these opinions, why do you think it&#39;s ok to train diffusion models on copyrighted work, but not co-pilot on GPL code?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a graphic artist. In the recent months I&#39;ve read dozens of articles and threads like this. I still can&#39;t see what the big deal is.Graphic artists don&#39;t have trade secrets or unique impossible techniques. If someone can see your picture, he can copy its style. It becomes publicly available as soon as you publish it. For the vast majority of graphic styles, if one author can do it, then hundreds of his colleagues can do it too, often just as well. If one author becomes popular and expensive - then his less popular colleagues can copy his style for cheaper. The market for this is enormous and this was the case for probably hundreds of years.I personally am a non-brand artist like that. More often then not clients come to me with a reference not from my portfolio and ask me to produce something similar. I will do it, probably five times cheaper than the artist or studio who did the original. It may not be exactly as good, but it won&#39;t be five times worse.Some clients are happy to pay extra for the name brand, and will pay. Some want to spend less, and will settle for a non-brand copy.The clients that are willing to pay for the name brand will still be there for the same reason they are now, and the existence of Stable Diffusion changes nothing to them. And the ones that just want the cheap copy would never contact the big name artist in the first place. The copy market will shift, but the big name artist doesn&#39;t even have to be aware of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The dynamics on Twitter are quite weird. There’s a small number of users with potentially lots of followers for whom Twitter is an important part of their work or life. If you’re a journalist, being on Twitter is basically part of your job so maybe you should have to pay a bit more just like the customer of some business software ($100 pa seems pretty cheap there). Indeed maybe media publications should be paying for the blue checks for their staff. But on the other hand, these people are going to represent a large part of the draw of Twitter and so maybe Twitter should be paying them instead.But other people use Twitter in different ways. If you mostly use it as a social network between your friends you might not care because they’ll presumably see your tweets because they follow you rather than because they found them in search or whatever.If you’re using Twitter as a forum for discussions about some topic of your interest, maybe you’ll end up feeling crowded out in replies by people with the check. But if you’re at risk of being crowded out then maybe Twitter isn’t working so well as a forum. And I think that if eg A follows B and B retweets you, A should see your tweet whether or not you have a check. Maybe that isn’t so true with the non-chronological feed. If people in the community follow you then, depending on the dynamics, your opinions could still be spread via retweet rather than getting lucky in your position in the replies, no?If you’re some reply guy, maybe your tweets should be downranked but then if you’re serious about it then I guess you’ll pay."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The good:Twitter should not be editorally curating people through verification, making verification only about ID and being a real person is a broadly good change, as long as it&#39;s not necessary for participation. Brands, celebrities, those in the public eye could benefit from this. Needs to be implemented with care and ideally with a branding change so as not to confuse users as the semantics change.The bad:$8 is way more than the profitability of an ad supported user. There&#39;s no excuse for &#34;half the ads&#34;, it should be none at all. See: every streaming service. (Edit: ok some streaming services have ads, but for most online content - video, journalism, etc, if you subscribe there are no ads, it&#39;s just nickle-and-diming users to give them a bunch of ads, particularly when the marginal cost for Twitter Blue is essentially zero).The ugly:Paying $8 to get your voice heard by more people biases towards those with means rather than those contributing to the conversation. At best this will reduce conversation quality on Twitter, at worst this is ripe for abuse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The title/article seems to be a bit of a strawman, AFAICT countries (or their governments / citizens) do not consider the GDP as the one and only measure of national success. Politics are driven by tons of different interest groups (in the broadest sense, ranging from corporate interests, environmental activists, minority representatives, medical or teaching professionals, farmers, retirees living on state pensions, etc, etc.), not by whether some policy might give a boost to GDP. I could argue that it would probably be better if they actually did, but that&#39;s for another thread.In truth, pretty much nobody really knows for sure what policies actually will increase GDP, or what causes the short term fluctuations (business cycle / recession) or variation in long term divergense between different countries in the first place. The more honest academic economists will freely admit this. (I was explicitly thaught so in my graduate macro-economics courses). So I think it&#39;s a strawman to think that countries/governments are engating in some kind of myopic GDP maximization plan.I think the appropriate analogy is household or personal income. (GDP is just all incomes in a country summed up and corrected for inflation.)  It&#39;s probably not the most important thing in the world, and probably not the most important determinant of personal happyness or life satisfaction. But a severe lack of it (especially compared to the people around you) or an unexpected large drop will probably be considered problematic by most people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been known since the idea was first conceived: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_domestic_product#Limitat...The real issue is simply that, a lot of the things we want to convert to simple metrics can&#39;t be. Suppose I hand you a list of the exact rate each crime in a country was committed, and I ask you to convert that list to a single number, how would you do so? You could assign a weight to each crime, but how would you know which weights to use? What&#39;s the &#34;true cost&#34; of each crime?Of course, in reality we won&#39;t know the real rate of any crime. We will have estimates, which are likely quite far from the truth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s hard to overstate how terrible this idea is.GDP is a concrete measure that is difficult to fake.  Once you start arguing about the economic value of volunteering, divorce, income inequality, and crime -- you&#39;ve opened the door to never being able to trust GDP again.Should we create new metrics to track progress?  Sure.  Should we stop tracking GDP?  No way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve read that doctors now spend as much as 50% of their time documenting their work. Companies such as Epic, which provide the software that hospitals use to build databases of patient data, have been big winners in the new world of hospitals-depending-on-software. But did the doctors become more productive? By almost any measure, they became less productive.People in tech keep thinking more tech will solve problems and they keep underestimating the flexibility of the old models. For instance, most large companies used to be run by armies of secretaries, and the senior secretaries functioned as what we would now call &#34;project managers&#34; -- they made calendars, oversaw who was working on what, followed up to keep track on whether work was being done, and kept a close eye on what money was being spent. The crucial thing about having humans overseeing such work is that humans can take a flexible approach to the rules: they know when to break them. By contrast, systems that are highly dependent on software tend to be more rigid. Software doesn&#39;t know when its rules should be broken.The flexibility of the old system is constantly underestimated, the rigidness of the new systems is often misunderstood.In his book &#34;The Design Of Design&#34; Fred Brooks talks about the power of trust, and he contrasts that situations where everything needs to be first negotiated and specified in a contract. High trust systems are flexible and fast, whereas a system where every detail needs to be specified in a contract is slow and rigid. We should stop and ask ourselves, our favorite Agile methodology resembles which of these? Are specifying things with needless detail?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"US Worker productivity is 0.7 standard deviations below its average over the last 3 years. It is 3.6% below all time high. It is higher now than at any point before July of 2020. YOY Productivity growth has dipped negative and then went back to positive 20 times in the past 22 years.To be concerned about the current level of productivity requires either the attention span or the intelligence of a goldfish.https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/productivity"</p>
