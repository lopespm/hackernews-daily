								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember while trying to figure out why Microsoft was blocking emails that IPv6 SMTP source addresses had a much higher risk of being blocked despite having done all the required stuff like PTR, SPF, DKIM. Microsoft&#39;s form to submit delisting an IP address does not even accept an IPv6 address: https://sender.office.com/Stuff like this really hinders adoption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If only ISPs actually bothered giving out IPv6 addresses to their customers. It&#39;s 2021, I have a 1 Gbps FTTH connection and still no trace of IPv6. This is a complete disgrace."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m still waiting for Hetzner to support servers (physical and virtual) without public IPv4 addresses. I could easily free up the ~50 public addresses I&#39;m using. One public IP will do, I can reverse proxy everything else.But there&#39;s no support for that. So every time I spin up a 1 vCPU tiny VM, which will never connect to the public internet, I&#39;m wasting an expensive resource. Sorry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just want my own office. That&#39;s all. I&#39;d be pretty okay with going in if I had my own office with 4 walls.First job of my career, they told me I would have an office of my own. First day I come back do for full time (I had interned there too with my own office), they tell me they&#39;re switching buildings to go open office in about a month&#39;s time. I got a precious few weeks with a personal office, and then it was all gone. I hated this change of scenery mmediately, but I guess I got used to it after a few years.Working from home took me back to that zen. I didn&#39;t even know how much I missed it - how much I needed my own space to feel productive.I&#39;ve since changed jobs, and I kinda dread having to go to the open office nightmare once this is all over. The facilities are way nicer than my last job, but it&#39;s still an open office.Open. Office. As. Implemented. In. Our. Industry. Is. Stupid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like the relationship is dysfunctional in both directions.On the one hand, the employer set up a panopticon in the office, with crappy furniture, lots of interruptions, a crappy office kitchen, no decent food (i.e. needing to bring food from home). Garbage in, garbage out. Of course nobody is happy to sit in traffic to come to an environment like that.Then we have the author, who has the mistaken idea that the number one most important thing that you do at your job is your directly measurable productivity. Not relationship-building, just pure &#34;shut up and let me sit down and get my work done.&#34; Personally, I&#39;d prefer it if engineering work didn&#39;t go the way of Amazon warehouse workers, because if &#34;productivity&#34; is the sole metric of an employee&#39;s performance, just wait until your employer decides to try and optimize it.Best of luck to the OP at the dice roll that is the next company he works for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I noticed is that while more experienced people are productive working from home, it is devastating for fresh starting employees. Work from home eliminates learning through osmosis. If anyone has a work around this let me know. I am surprised no one else has mentioned it here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At my last job I made a feature to deploy arbitrary user code (most likely a trained model in Python) to a subdomain running a JS server that could take input parameters when called at that URL and would respond with the answer from the model. This effectively cut down DS deployments from potentially days to about 45 seconds. It was seen that be hard and I had a good amount of help from our awesome devops person and worked through a number of issues with the lead dev. When this was delivered everyone loved it, lots of kudos and compliments because it was seen as hard. I felt like a bit of a fraud as I felt I had a lot of help and it really was a team effort, I made efforts to highlight this.I also worked on my own (with the exception of some nginx issues) on a feature to keep an in browser file browse up to date for all users via web sockets. This was really a view on a git repo accessed through the Gitlab api, it was a nightmare to deal with because of the way Git tracks (or doesn’t really) folders. This feature was seen to be easy and I slaved on it for days and eventually weeks because of edge cases and feature creep to no kudos or compliments. Which is fine, it’s my job.It matters, I think, not if the task is easy or hard but if management/product view something as easy or hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ouch. This hits close to home.I _constantly_ get passed over for the interesting work, despite being _extremely_ qualified for it.  (e.g. I keep getting told I don&#39;t &#34;have a scientific background&#34;, so I&#39;m not qualified to work on problem X, despite the fact that I have a PhD in the field and extensive experience on closely related problems)It&#39;s because I&#39;m seen as a technician, not an engineer or a scientist.That&#39;s because I&#39;m the person everyone picks for the &#34;hey, just whip up this quick demo / generate this report / prototype this idea for me&#34;, and therefore I get critiqued when it&#39;s not fast enough / polished enough, despite it being a &#34;drop everything and have this done by 10pm&#34; situation every time.The big things I&#39;ve accomplished, other people have _always_ gotten credit for.  The things that fail, I get the blame for.So serious advice from someone who&#39;s too old to change it now:  SAY NO TO URGENT ONE-OFF REQUESTS FROM MANAGEMENT!!!  Once you start, it&#39;s a trap that&#39;s really hard to get out of and gets you nowhere career wise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A classic &#34;easy&#34; thing that appears &#34;hard&#34;: write a little bit of assembly. Note, a little bit[1].Writing assembly, again, in small amounts, is exactly the kind of thing that is difficult to start, and fails spectacularly if you have little experience. Debugging is a pain. But you can totally get the hang of writing assembly, and as long as you are doing it for the right reasons (TM), it&#39;s justified, and heroic. The key is you need to write and debug a little at a time.Case in point, I wrote an entire Wasm interpreter[2] in x86-64 asm over the past few months. I wrote it a little at a time, had lots of unit tests, and am working in an engine that was already completely functional (with a slower interpreter).[1] If you find yourself writing more than a hundred or so assembly instructions in a sitting, you are going to fail. If you find yourself writing more than a few thousand assembly instructions, total, you have probably have already failed.[2] https://github.com/titzer/wizard-engine/blob/master/src/engi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hm:&#34;long period of uncertainty began on 31 May 2010, when she stabbed her left thumb with a curved forceps while cleaning a cryostat—a machine that can cut tissues at very low temperatures—that she used to slice brain sections from transgenic mice infected with a sheep-adapted form of BSE. She pierced two layers of latex gloves and drew blood&#34;Later in the article:&#34;&#34;We conduct research only on mouse-adapted sheep prions, which have never been shown to be infectious to humans,” Aguzzi [neuropathologist at the University of Zurich] says.&#34;It sounds like the assumption that mouse-adapted sheep prions can&#39;t infect humans may be flawed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prions are weird.  I was at UCSF during the time they went from a fringe theory to an established fact and a nobel prize.  The professor who studied them (Prusiner) had to overcome tons of resistance and the experiments were heroic (often waiting months for mice to die).  It&#39;s really funny that everybody resisted it until somebody mentioned that there was a plausible physical mechanism of refolding catalysis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article talks about the case of Émilie Jaumain that got contaminated by prion while cleaning a device used to slice mouse brains. She died 9 years later of a prion disease. After several cases of exposure across the world, France decided to block prion research for 3 months to try to study the issue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two steps in the right direction, but this one page still sends requests to soundcloud.com, rawgit.com, cloudflare.com, googleapis.com, amazonaws.com, fontawesome.com, sndcdn.com, stackcommerce.com, stackassets.com, stacksocial.com,  and gravatar.com.Their &#34;self-hosted&#34; Plausible content is pulled from tics.techdirect.com, which resolves to 46.101.161.209 and shares a reverse DNS with custom.plausible.io. Can&#39;t tell who runs the web server on the other end of this, so it may well be self-hosted.The site also dropped a first-party one-year cookie, and let a third party drop a week-long cookie.My browser is set to send Do Not Track requests, so my explicit wishes are still being flagrantly ignored.There is still a lot of third-party tracking going on here, as well as execution of remote code under the control of third parties. It&#39;s remains a privacy and security clusterfuck but it&#39;s better than it was."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ads should be relevant to the site, not the user.For example, I buy hot rod magazines to get the advertisements selling hot rod parts in those magazines. I don&#39;t buy them to read toothpaste ads. I even pay money to get those ads.But if I was visiting a site about dental hygiene, I&#39;d be interest in the toothpaste ads.I&#39;ve tried to configure context-sensitive ads from Amazon on my web site to be books on programming. But Amazon would insist on showing:1. batman movie ads2. the same ad for a C++ course over and over and over and overSo I wound up removing those from the site. Instead, I created a list of good programming books myself, and would randomly cycle through that list to show an ad.It would be so much better if I could enable:&#34;Only show books from this category.&#34;as my aim is to only show advertisements that would be of interest to the people reading the site.Google has context sensitive ads, and one would think this would work. But it doesn&#39;t. For example, I have a page on the American Revolution. Google&#39;s context sensitive ads are usually for travel agencies, presumably based on the place names on the page. Actually relevant ads would be for history books. I tried meta keywords, etc., nothing worked. I gave up. Google&#39;s context algorithms are worthless and the site owner should be able to provide guidance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google Ads is so deep into tracking that it defeats its own purpose.I search for Product A on Google or Amazon and am immediately inundated with ads for the same product on every page I go that has Google adsWhat is worse is that the ads continue even after I purchase the product / service. So I get ads for a mobile phone I searched for and bought in Amazon (and all its accessories) for months after I have already purchased it.My mind automatically ignores every ad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Orbiter Space Simulator (http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/) has been one of the major realistic-ish space simulators of the decade.Development has slowed down in the last years due to the obligations of its sole author, so seeing it be open-sourced with a free license (MIT) is a great opportunity to rekindle its development! It seems that the first priorities would be to upgrade the code to 64-bits and transition to a more recent version of DirectX."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh, fond memories of it. It was the first time when I understood that when you fly to the Moon, not only you have to cross the Moon&#39;s orbit, but you have to do it when Moon itself is nearby. If you are 1/4 orbital period ahead of it, you are screwed.It also ruined space movies like &#34;Gravity&#34; for me, because pointing the nose to the space station in 50 km and applying thrust towards it turns out to be a sure way to NOT get  to that station!Edit: fixed the thrust direction"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have some experience on this field. Around two years ago i was a DevOp for the company running Dagbladet, Norways #2 newspaper. One of the things I did was keep an eye on mysterious traffic.I managed to find a huge spam network that set up a proxy service that delivered normal content, but injected &#34;you  can win an iPhone!&#34; spam to all users visiting them.Since I was in the position of being able to monitor their proxy traffic towards many sites I managed. I could easily document their behaviour.In the same time, I wrote a crawler that visited their sites over a long, long time. I learned that they kept injecting hidden links to other sites in their network, so I did let my bot look at those also.By this time, I also got a journalist with me that started to look at the money flow to try and find the organisation behind it.My bot found in excess of 100K domains being used for this operation, targeting all of westeren Europe. All the 100K sites contained proxied content and was hidden behind Cloudflare, but thanks to the position I had, I managed to find their backend anyways.We reported the sites to both CF and Google, and to my knowledge, not a single site were removed before the people behind it took it down.Oh, and the journalist? He did find a Dutch company that was not happy to see neither him or the photographer :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen the same here in Germany but they do appear only if you use the results within the last 24h functionality.
It looks like the German content is generated through GPT2 or 3. It makes no real sense if you read it.
If you go on the page you are immediately redirected to a scam just like the article mentions.
Interestingly they use &#34;.it&#34; domains here. It also looks like the domains might have been hacked or are expired domains that have been bought.For example if you check havfruen4220.dk on archive.org you can see that it appears to have been a legitimate business website before. https://web.archive.org/web/20181126203158/https://havfruen4...How do they rank so well?I&#39;ve checked the domain on ahref and it has almost no backlinks. But if you look closely you will see that all the results that rank very well have been added very recently.
On the screenshots in the article you can see things like &#34;for 2 timer siden&#34; which means 2 hours ago.
It looks like google is ranking pages that have a very recent publishing date higher.Edit: Here is what the content of such a site looks like: https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Bk0VsM..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate dealing with this and now refuse to use Google now when I saw patterns in search results while I was researching common things (like housing) in Norwegian, here in Norway. I rarely use Google these days, but I thought for a second that Google might be better with search results than DDG in Norwegian, but this stuff is aggravating. This is one of those where they screw around with history that you just have to start fresh again on whatever you were doing instead of going back.edit: one other thing I have seen, but it doesn&#39;t mean it is always spam. All The Words In A Title Are Capitalized - it&#39;s something to pay attention to whether it is spam or not. Conventionally, titles are usually not like that in Norwegian."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For folks interested in this space, there&#39;s a few other resources of which I&#39;m a fan.First, there&#39;s Micro.blog (https://micro.blog/).  They can host a blog for you, or you can publish to their service for free using your own blog by pointing Micro.blog at your RSS feed (I do the latter).  Think blogging but with a social element, facilitating both interaction and content discovery.Second, there&#39;s the IndieWeb movement more broadly (https://indieweb.org/), which advocates for a whole ecosystem of distributed, open technologies for enriching the blogging ecosystem and encouraging interoperability.Third, believe it or not, webrings live on!  The indiewebring (https://indieweb.org/indiewebring), for example, is a fun way to find additional bloggers out there.As you can tell, I&#39;m a fan of blogging and the IndieWeb movement... :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome, I agree, personal blogs are great.I can&#39;t help but notice all the blogs tagged &#34;software&#34; in the list (so far). In fact, I think if there was a filter to exclude software blogs, there might be only a few remaining?I missed out on the whole RSS thing when it was popular. My sense was that it solved the problem of knowing when, among a whole bunch of blogs, a site had new content.Perhaps it exists, I want an app/site that will scrape a list of sites I give it (blogs for example) to show me any new content each day. A personal home page with titles and perhaps a hundred or so words from each site I track that has new content.In the broader picture, I feel overwhelmed by the amount of technology these days, spend too much of my time browsing, etc. (HN, case in point). So I am looking for something I call TRAoT, The Right Amount of Technology.Maybe it&#39;s a &#34;magic mirror&#34; that displays this overview, home page. Interactivity is minimal or nil. No ability to comment, follow links, etc. Like the morning newspaper of old, I spend a little time in the morning with it and then go about my day &#34;offline&#34;.In short I am looking at ways to take the open-ended and stress inducing (anxiety inducing?) relationships I have with technology and replace them with a more staid, maybe even serendipitous, relationship that allows me back more free time, less stress.Maybe this &#34;Solar Punk&#34; thing is something of the Zeitgeist of our time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am afraid to blog. I could write about my career and my hobby, but those do not seem to be interesting for others. My opinion may be interesting, but it is risky because something I write may come back to offend others one day, or get me in trouble. One time ago I considered blogging anonymously about the economy but doing so anonymously felt disingenuous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sumatra, alongside maybe Everything and IrfanView, is my favorite piece of software on windows. Incredible speed, great customizability and awesome compatibility.I really missed it when I made the switch to Linux, but not enough to consider installing WINE. Still, absolutely wonderful project deserving of the highest praise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s amazing to see the drive of &#34;I know what I want to make and I do it the way I want&#34; carry the project for so long. More than any development ideology just having the passion to continue working on whatever it is you&#39;re doing is an extremely powerful force for creating useful software. And SumatraPDF is definitely useful software, has been for a long time.&#34;ideology doesn&#39;t matter as much as doing&#34; being said the syntax valid semantic invalid error at the end of this excerpt in the section on extensive tests being overrated gave me a chuckle:&gt; Dogma is powerful. Sometimes in my corporate life I felt like writing tests was just going through motion. Maybe we should spend more time writing code instead, I though?In all seriousness I agree though. In a project where you write the majority of the code it is possible to overdo tests in a way that you are wasting more time than you&#39;re saving yourself and in a passion project efficiency isn&#39;t always as important as interest anyways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This app has gotten me through so many days of undergrad. It&#39;s one of the only windows apps that can handle textbook-sized pdfs well. I can search on text quickly too, while Adobe Reader can barely open any PDF larger than 100 pages."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I&#39;ve wasted many an hour combing through Google and my search history to look up a good article, blog post, or just something I&#39;ve seen before.This is the fault of web browser vendors who have yet to give a damn about book marks.&gt; Apollo is a search engine and web crawler to digest your digital footprint. What this means is that you choose what to put in it. When you come across something that looks interesting, be it an article, blog post, website, whatever, you manually add it (with built in systems to make doing so easy).So it&#39;s a searchable database for bookmarks then.&gt; The first thing you might notice is that the design is reminiscent of the old digital computer age, back in the Unix days. This is intentional for many reasons. In addition to paying homage to the greats of the past, this design makes me feel like I&#39;m searching through something that is authentically my own. When I search for stuff, I genuinely feel like I&#39;m travelling through the past.This does not make any sense. It&#39;s Unix-like because it feels old? It seems like the author thoroughly misses the point of unix philosophy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My version of this is https://dogsheep.github.io/ - the idea is to pull your digital footprint from various different sources (Twitter, Foursquare, GitHub etc) into SQLite database files, then run Datasette on top to explore them.On top of that I built a search engine called Dogsheep Beta which builds a full-text search index across all of the different sources and lets you search in one place: https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-betaYou can see a live demonstration of that search engine on the Datasette website: https://datasette.io/-/beta?q=dogsheepThe key difference I see with Apollo is that Dogsheep separates fetching of data from search and indexing, and uses SQLite as the storage format. I&#39;m using a YAML configuration to define how the search index should work: https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/main/templates/d... - it defines SQL queries that can be used to build the index from other tables, plus HTML fragments for how those results should be displayed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this idea, but the name “digital footprint” sort of implies it’s what effect you’ve had on the Internet for helping keep your online persona under control: your tweets, comments, emails, et cetera.But this is a great idea! Having a search engine for vaguely _anything_ you touch very much does look like it’d increase the signal:noise ratio. It’d be interesting to be able to add whole sites (using, say, DuckDuckGo as an external crawler) to be able to fetch general ideas, such as, say, “Stack Exchange posts marked with these tags”."</p>
