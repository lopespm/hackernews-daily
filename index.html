								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This kind of highlights a subtle interactive design or user experience component of the Trolley problem.Part of the Trolley Problem is that the choice is between an action or inaction.  But these problems, or the first one at least, have two buttons.So you&#39;re making a choice.  Yeah, some might argue it&#39;s a technicality.  But what if you put the Do Nothing choice on a timer?What if you made it an asynchronous &#34;Problem of the Day&#34;.  No action by the end of the day triggers Do Nothing, etc.Lots of cool, interesting design choices.  There&#39;s an unstated subtle ultimatum hidde. in these problems, but still cool.Sorry, geeking out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Level 20 was weird. It was a choice between letting a trolley run as normal (&#34;emits CO2, kills 3 people in accidents over 30 years&#34;) or running it into a brick wall and decommissioning it. For some reason more people picked the latter. So, they just dislike public transit? What about the emissions and death rate when everyone switches to cars instead?Goes to show how easily the context and exact wording of a question can sway people&#39;s opinions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Let&#39;s not let the perfect be the enemy of the good.This is a huge step forward for iPhone users. Look, I get it. From the typical HN perspective, this potentially looks like a lot of hype. But many of you aren&#39;t looking at from a high level.In the world we are now living in; even what&#39;s happening in the United States right now, being able to protect yourself from well-funded, determined attackers for the average person couldn&#39;t come at a better time.There&#39;s a huge gap between Fortune 500 executives, government officials, etc. and regular people in terms of the resources available to them to prevent state-sponsored attackers. It doesn&#39;t take much these days to go from a nobody to being on somebody&#39;s radar.If you&#39;re a woman seeking an abortion in a state where it&#39;s illegal or severely restricted, you could be the target of malware from your local or state government or law enforcement. In Texas, you can sue anyone who aids and abets a woman who attempts to get an abortion for $10,000, which is enough to get someone to trick someone into installing malware on a phone.No, it&#39;s not China or Russia coming for you but it doesn&#39;t take much to ruin someone&#39;s life.I don&#39;t think this is virtue signaling or marketing hype by Apple; if anything, this is right in alignment with the stance they&#39;ve had on privacy for years. Even for a company the size of Apple, putting up $10 million to fund organizations that investigate, expose, and prevent highly targeted cyberattacks isn&#39;t pocket change.At the end of the day, this is all good news for user privacy and security going forward. I also suspect if I lockdown my iPhone, my other compatible devices using the same Apple ID will also lockdown. No IT department required."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am so excited about this news. I understand that some people are pessimistic, and view it as a &#34;giving up&#34; on complete security against nation-states. I think that&#39;s the wrong way to analyze the situation.The dream I have is someone making a phone that is purpose-built to be secure against state actors. Unfortunately, this makes very little economic sense, and probably won&#39;t happen (maybe if some rich person started a foundation or something?). The phone would need to have pretty restricted functionality and would not be generally appealing to mass market consumers.As it stands, securing a mass market modern smartphone, even from just remote attacks, is just intractable. We should not bury our heads in the sand and wishfully think that if they just spend a little more money, close a few more bugs, and make the sandboxing a little better, somehow iOS 16 or Android 13 will finally be completely secure against state actors. The set of features being shipped will grow fast enough that security mitigations will not someday &#39;catch up&#39;.This is the next best thing! The more we can give users the freedom to lock down their devices, the more the vision of an actual solution comes into view. This is the first step towards perhaps our only hope of solving this someday - applying formal methods and lots of public scrutiny to a small &#39;trusted code base&#39;, and finally telling NSO group to fuck off.Even this dream may not pan out, but at least we can have hope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With this announcement, Apple are saying &#34;we will protect you from state actors&#34;, which is a role usually performed by states. Apple is saying &#34;we operate at the same level as nation states; we are a nation-state level entity operating in the &#34;digital world&#34;: It&#39;s a flag-raise.It&#39;s the first such flag-raise I&#39;ve seen. Security researchers talk about protections from state actors all the time, and there are tools which support that... but this is the first public announcement, and tool, from a corporation with more spare, unrestricted capital than many countries. It comes at a time when multiple nation states are competing for energy and food security; and Apple are throwing up a flag for a security-security fight (or maybe data-security). This is not just handy tech, it&#39;s full-on cultural zeitgeist stuff. Amazing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two points to highlight from this article:1. LinkedIn is an absolute godsend for bad guys, allowing easy targeting of everyone in the company with spear phishing emails and texts. I know many security professionals no longer use their real name, and don&#39;t list the real name of their company, because they know it&#39;s such a great hacking vector. Not sure what/whether LinkedIn can do anything about this.2. I wish there were more information about what the vulnerability was in the PDF in the first place. I think a lot of people would be wary of downloading a PDF from a stranger, but not from someone who you had multiple interview rounds with and who offered you a job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got to say, this is an incredibly cyberpunk article.&gt; Ronin, the Ethereum-linked sidechain that underpins play-to-earn game Axie Infinity, lost $540 million in crypto to an exploit in March. While the US government later tied the incident to North Korean hacking group Lazarus, full details of how the exploit was carried out have not been disclosed.It&#39;s not in William Gibson&#39;s style, sounds more like Bruce Sterling&#39;s.&gt; Axie Infinity was huge. At its peak, workers in Southeast Asia were even able to earn a living through the play-to-earn game. It boasted 2.7 million daily active users and $214 million in weekly trading volume for its in-game NFTs in November last year — although both numbers have since plummeted.&gt; Earlier this year, staff at Axie Infinity developer Sky Mavis were approached by people purporting to represent the fake company and encouraged to apply for jobs, according to the people familiar with the matter. One source added that the approaches were made through the professional networking site LinkedIn.Also gives me Charles Stross vibes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those that don&#39;t want to read the whole thing, (supposedly) the attackers reached out on linkedin to a bunch of employees asking them to apply to a fake company. One of them did it, went through a bunch of fake interviews, and then got a fake offer, in the form of a PDF.They opened the PDF and that installed a keylogger on their system (it doesn&#39;t explain how).The attackers then used that engineer&#39;s credentials to take over 4 of the 9 validators on the blockchain which they then used for their heist."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the unfortunate reality of India; the government/police don&#39;t need to actually go to court. It can harass companies and executives by simply threatening to / actually carrying out unnecessary &#39;raids&#39; through the tax department.The usual process is for the a bunch of policemen and beareaucrats to just show up unannounced; seal the office so that no one can enter or leave, and seize computers / phones, files and demand random stuff like invoices for $10 purchases from three years ago and so on. This can happen regularly until all business basically comes to a halt (unless the company complies with whatever the government wants). [1]The next step is to threaten arrests and actually carry out some arrests on trumped up charge, and you can wait forever until trial (unless you comply with what the government wants). The trials usually result in acquittal after several years but the process is the punishment. The media in the meanwhile is happy to go along with the official version (that the company is question is allegedly employing shady accounting practices).The next stage is painting the company as &#39;anti national&#39;, arrange for a few mobs to harrass folks / attempt lynchings and finally actually &#39;dissappear&#39;/kill people (this last step is usually reserved for judges/writers etc since others usually comply before this step)[1]: https://www.economist.com/asia/2021/10/02/indias-government-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rule of law is a joke in India.Center has central agencies and each states has their own police department. 
So whenever there is a noticeable criticism from someone centre or state govt will send their police/agency your way. You will be detained, put through the worst conditions and false charges will be filed. Most of these charges don&#39;t hold in higher courts but the damage is done. You will suffer, a lot. 
You will not dare to speak up again.This is even so comical, sometimes centre will send agencies against another party politicians in power in a state they are not in power, and state will send police for local politicians from centre party.
(https://scroll.in/article/1027571/how-the-modi-government-ha...)Sometimes diff state police with diff party governments fight with each other.
(https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/blogs/toi-editorials/sto...)And sometimes police will just plant evidence in your email with their work email address as backup email address. They literally jailed bunch of very old left activists with fake charges by hacking their email accounts.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More big companies that use open source should do this or something similar. The dividends to security, developer productivity, etc are probably extremely high, particularly for a company with hundreds or thousands of engineers already. It&#39;s such an efficient use of money to give it to the people who already have the expertise to do the work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such great news for ruby. Here’s hoping with these resources rubygems and bundler can add improved support for signature verification. Rubygems supports gem signing but without a good scheme for trust, key rotation, etc it is not particularly usable.  Sprucing this aspect of the ecosystem up would go a long way towards allowing ruby to maintain its historical role at the vanguard of language specific package management.Another thing I would love to see is the ability to incorporate a signed attestation that a gem was built from a given signed commit. A common dirty trick by supply-chain blackhats is to publish a gem which contains code other than that of the corresponding tag in source control.  Given that rubygems has no means to browse package contents other than downloading and extracting the tarballs for manual inspection this means that people typically reference changelog or diff links on source control hosts, despite the fact that those diffs will only be accurate for gems published by good-faith actors following platform norms.There are a number of ways to fix this and I sure hope one of them gets implemented."</p>

I could totally see a variant of GeoGuesser for unknown worlds. That would be trippy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ok, the first thing I looked at is &#34;long content&#34; https://defensivecss.dev/tip/long-content/
and here they recommend to just clip it. Because who cares about content right? Who cares if the partial content you display is useless, as long as it looks good. And that&#39;s the kind of tip everyone here is applauding. I would like to say webdesign is in a sorry state nowawadays, except it was also that way 20 years ago. Maybe this &#34;who cares about the content&#34; attitude is inherent to web designers? Sorry if I sound blasé or cynical, but one gets tired after long enough of this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of these are pure common sense if you are apt with CSS.However, one problem mentioned here is vendor prefix grouping. I&#39;ve never experienced this problem or seen a grouped prefix ignored by any browser. Autoprefixer doesn&#39;t even ungroup prefix rules. I even ran a grouped prefix through W3C validator and came away validated, though the article mentions it&#39;s not W3C compliant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Suggestion for the breadcrumb example on this page (and other examples like it): https://defensivecss.dev/tip/flexbox-wrapping/#breadcrumbsShow the HTML and CSS for the example in plain text below the example - saves me from firing up the browser inspector tools, which aren&#39;t available if I&#39;m browsing on my phone."</p>
