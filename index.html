								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ars Technica has a sceptical but optimistic/hopeful take on it:https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/framework-startup-de...Edit to add quote from Ars article:Framework is promising an awful lot in its very first product—&#34;thin as an XPS 13, repairable as a custom-built gaming PC&#34; is a pretty tall order to live up to. We very much want to believe, but it&#39;s going to take a full Ars Technica teardown before we&#39;re completely convinced.Although we&#39;re skeptical, we are hopeful—the fledgling company does have a pretty solid pedigree. Framework founder Nirav Patel was Oculus VR&#39;s head of hardware from 2012 to 2017, and he was a Facebook director of engineering beyond that. The company&#39;s team also includes design, engineering, and operations people hailing from Apple, Google, and Lenovo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see any mention of the firmware and drivers efforts for this. Firmware and drivers always end up more difficult to deal with than expected.The Fairphone company was surprised by difficulties upgrading and patching android without support from their BSP vendor, causing many months delays of updates _and_ years shorter support life than they were planning for their earlier models.I purchased the Purism Librem 13 laptop from their kickstarter, and they had great plans for firmware and drivers, but also great difficulty following through. The trackpad chosen for the first models took much longer than expected to get upstream linux support, and it was never great (it turned out to be impossible to reliably detect their variant automatically). They finally hired someone with sufficient skill to do the coreboot port _months_ after initial units were delivered, and delivered polished coreboot firmware for their initial laptops _years_ after they started the kickstarter.So, why should we have confidence in the firmware and drivers that Framework will deliver :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interestingly it was very clear at around $10MM ARR that DO was on a trajectory to IPO. You can thank Moisey Uretsky for a fantastic product idea and his brother Ben for CEOing it for so long. Congratulations to everyone who was involved in building DigitalOcean, it was an INCREDIBLY wild ride in the early days, lots of chaos but through all the chaos and disfunction, I think everyone involved knew this day would come.Personally I&#39;m really proud of the work we did, and I&#39;m overjoyed to have been part of building a business that is going to be a public company.  Thanks to the HN community for being so supportive over the years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love DigitalOcean. The simplicity of their UI, friendly CLI tooling and (as a hosted k8s customer) the frequency of updates to their offerings.BUT:1. Their web UI stability is terrible (constantly hangs and errors out)2. Their hosted DB IOPS aren&#39;t competitive with other PaaS providers. There&#39;s also no way to scale DB size dynamically without upgrading to a new price tier which is overkill.3. Their Kubernetes Control Plane scaling is obfuscated. I had to contact support to realize that the control plane nodes are somehow tied to the size of your node pool when you create the cluster? That&#39;s not documented anywhere and was the cause of many control plane timeouts.4. No ALIAS dns record, no way to serve Spaces from an apex domain. (I know this is a vendor specific implementation but it&#39;s table stakes imo)Again, I&#39;m a (mostly) happy DO customer and wish them the best but if they really want to be seen on the same level as AWS or GCP in terms of some parity, they need to include some of these QoL features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats to DO.Really like the direction DO is going. Which is something in between millions of small VPS firm and giant like AWS. It also forced Linode to React. And proved the space in Cloud Hosting exist, which company like Vultr and UpCloud are now joining. And I think their features are finally close to hitting the perfect spot. With all the essential like DBaS, Object Storage and K8s.They have also ( finally ) introduced AMD EPYC CPU, ( no more explicit mention of Intel CPU on their homepage ). Which is good for their margin since price / core count are cheaper.So DO today is something I would like as an AWS competitor in 2016.  And they are finally here. I am not sure if there are any other low hanging fruit at all. Or what features I would want for a company competing at this space. It will be things that people dont see, like CPU performance, SSD Performance, Services Reliability, Interconnect, Better Network, More Locations, security improvement....There are only two suggestions I could think on top of my head right now.First is the pricing structure and list. It is getting very messy and AWS like. SSD Storage variant should be a simple calculable option, not an extra line on pricing table that tries to bombard me with extra information. And I know Basic Droplet are burst-able CPU resources, but not showing they are vCPU ( a Single Thread ) and calling them CPU doesn&#39;t really rhymes with me.Second is Full BareMetal Monthly option. Something like vultr [1] is offering. I am not sure if below $100 is feasible. Basically it  should be something that offer much better price / performance at a monthly payment that pushes people with low spending to metal for baseline load with headroom as insurance. Pushing up Average User Spending.  It should also be attractive to small business. ( Although arguably Linode and Vultr has yet to expand or launch Metal seems to suggest otherwise )[1] https://www.vultr.com/products/bare-metal/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s a crazy idea: Don&#39;t use analytics at all but focus on your product. If your success relies solely on &#34;improving conversions&#34; by tracking your users and then changing the position and color of your &#34;Checkout&#34; button then maybe try setting yourself apart such that customers want to buy your product even despite an obnoxious purchasing flow. Only then start optimizing it.More serious thoughts: Google Analytics introduces performance overhead for your website and now you have to explain to your users which third party is responsible for processing their data on top of yourself. Why introduce those headaches? Are the insights from Analytics really valuable enough to justify the cost? I personally haven&#39;t seen it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After a recent story on HN about all the horrible tracking Disqus started to do after being acquired by an ad-tech company, I ditched it and Google Analytics on my semi-dormant personal website.  The process of fixing it got me interested in working on my site again and I ended up upstreaming the patches into the Hugo theme I use[1], so now everyone with that theme can benefit easily.  I ended up using GoatCounter[2] after examining several alternatives in the market, predominantly because it was free for personal sites, but also because it was very no-frills which is all I really needed.  I also appreciated that I could control retention rate and other configuration that might affect my visitor&#39;s privacy to collect as minimal amount of information as possible.I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with having basic site analytics, but I appreciate that there are now alternatives to Google Analytics that don&#39;t try to do the pervasive tracking that&#39;s become commonplace online.[1]: https://tristor.ro/blog/2021/02/05/ditching-google-analytics...[2]: https://www.goatcounter.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are a couple mentions but no top comments:
Amazon has installed a mailbox at their facility, this mail piece specifically says to use it.AND this mail piece says &#39;BE DONE by 3/1&#39; when workers have until the end of the month to vote (context: amazon must stop anti-union mandatory meetings etc during voting).This could be a legal violation &amp; is a big deal. I think at a minimum breaks the spirit of the NLRB mail-in voting ruling.HN seems to consider big tech = oppressive surveillance. I&#39;ll let you draw your own conclusions.This is also the latest in a long list of extreme tactics some aren&#39;t mentioned in this article. To name a few:Amazon also fired an activist who was speaking out. It&#39;s been reported Amzn has been penalizing pro-union employees with baseless and unfair management penalties/&#39;strikes&#39; and purposeful last minute over-time demands as punishment. Digital surveillance. Management basically stalking associates in break rooms, asking if they are only there to organize and attorneys and consultants drawing graph person relationship research charts to map their employees. A big propaganda push online &amp; a pretty successful press drive - most of these articles Amazon gets many inches of positive talking points.https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18277322/amazon-fired-warehous...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Detailed, 6 step instructions on how to open a ballot and mark no? Thanks, amazon. This is almost as scummy as asking the city to change traffic lights so union organizers have a harder time talking to workers in between shifts.https://www.al.com/business/2021/02/jefferson-county-now-say..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Full disclosure: I&#39;ve always been anti-union for my own personal approach to life. I do see the value in unions, I&#39;ve just always, to this point, been a go-it-alone-and-fight-my-own-battles kind of person. I don&#39;t want to be beholden to a union or their rules any more than I want to be beholden to an employer beyond my contractual obligations for which I&#39;m paid.That said, people should take note of what happened when Walmart used these tactics. Employees then went on to suffer such things as zero hour contracts, contracts where time was just shy of the legal requirement to give them benefits, pay was no more than the minimum required in any given state/province and people became slaves to their jobs because they couldn&#39;t afford the time off to find other jobs because then they wouldn&#39;t be able to make ends meet or there were no other jobs so Walmart had zero incentive to pay any more than absolutely required to by law. etc. etc. etc. because humanity is only afforded if legally required [which I personally find disgusting].These are tactics to prevent a coalition of employees from having their rights heard and maintained... even with this coalition someone is fighting to maintain and win your rights(!!!!!) There&#39;s something very wrong with anyone having to fight for their rights to be given, but that&#39;s another discussion. In a commercial environment that allow employers to behave this way, where the only advantage to winning your rights is in a coalition of the workforce holding employers to account, unions absolutely must not only be allowed but must also be protected.Its okay if you&#39;re bullheaded enough or within your means enough to walk away if your rights aren&#39;t given fair consideration and honoured, but if you&#39;re in a position where you&#39;re a prisoner to your job, i.e. can&#39;t afford to take time off to find another job/other income, or there are no other jobs in your area and you don&#39;t have the means to leave etc. you don&#39;t have any bargaining chip.No employer should ever have the privilege of keeping you prisoner, nor preventing you from having a means to bargain for your very right to fair treatment.Amazon needs to be severely reprimanded for this and taught a lesson about what it means to honour employees&#39; rights."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a Shopify partner through 3 years, paying 20% of my revenue to Shopify, and every time I have been in contact with &#34;partner support&#34; it has been, to put it mildly, an underwhelming experience.You have to argue your way through an army of outsourced supporters who are equipped with nothing but the public Shopify docs, until you get to a real employee who concludes it with a &#34;sorry, but we can&#39;t help&#34;.Some of my issues:1. If you&#39;re not American, you will be forced to hand over 3% of your 80% revenue cut to PayPal. (Unless your MRR cut is &gt;$30k)2. Sometimes Shopify just kills features, which merchants and partners rely on. Sure, we get a notice that the API will change - but how does that help, when there is no alternative way to achieve the removed functionality? I was lucky enough to get through to someone who knew someone at the dev team, but the response was once again &#34;sorry, you&#39;re not a priority&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I understand this correctly: this OP partner app (not merchant/store) has been evading the Rev Share agreement with Shopify and is complaining because they got caught and are having to pay back their due?  And then they are trying to jump on the furor of Apples 30% rev share agreement to get support from other developers - when the cases are completely different?To me it sounds like this App developer is trying to have their cake and eat it too.  FWIW - I am typically on the small developer side of things but this seems like a case of a bad actor trying to couch it in other complaints..."</p>

I SSH to it via VS Code and basically I have a fully functional Linux dev environment with MacOS as the UI, just the way I like it.Honestly, I haven&#39;t been this excited about a new setup since Moore&#39;s Law was in effect :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also worth mentioning that UTM developers has been contribution patches to QEMU to get TCG (code emulation layer) to work under iOS / M1 Mac[1] as well (whereas I think TCG is still broken as of latest QEMU release due to mprotect[2]). So huge, huge thanks for this as well![1]: https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/20210126012457.39046-1-j@...[2]: https://lore.kernel.org/qemu-devel/161259505296.24527.772997..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a very nice frontend. Someone should definitely port it or rewrite it for Linux. All the existing UIs are either ugly or use libvirt, which is a nasty pile of hacks that has no place on a desktop machine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The one about proxy_pass blindly forwarding syntactically malformed requests and silently failing to process the response is astonishing.It doesn&#39;t appear to be documented.  Looking through NginX documentation at http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html I don&#39;t see anything (e.g. under proxy_hide_header) to say it&#39;s sometimes not applied, and there doesn&#39;t appear to be any option to prevent this blind forwarding.I would never have expected the backend to receive invalid HTTP from NginX, but more importantly it&#39;s not uncommon for backends to send an extra header or two to tell NginX how to serve the response, with NginX removing those headers before serving.How do you even handle this properly?  Checking for valid HTTP might not be enough, as you need to exactly match whatever NginX&#39;s idea of valid is, rather than matching the HTTP spec."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Default for root is &#39;html&#39; according to the docs (which is a relative path wrt /usr/share/nginx), not /etc/nginx. http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#rootI guess it may depend on how nginx was configured during build. But for example on Debian this is not an issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good example of the trade off between pretty/terse/clever and safe/correct/maintainable.  Nginx is well-respected mature software but it&#39;s hard to see these issues as anything other than a design blunder.  The trailing-slash path traversal thing looks to me like a file system analogue of SQL injection.I think d3.js is another example of this.  It&#39;s obviously written with incredible skill but I could never get on with the ultra declarative and implicit style, it always felt like a fight.These days there seems to be a trend towards a verbose, explicit style, e.g. Zig (no hidden control flow - compare to C++&#39;s operator overload-fest) and Go."</p>
