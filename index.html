								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People have been noticing this a lot recently but what nobody seems to know is that this is a form of money laundering/“scamming.” I know because I used to be active on crime forums and talked to some of the people who engineered this scheme.People will set up fake Spotify artist accounts with stolen identities and bank accounts, pay a musician for songs that pass as music, and then bot millions of streams on them. At this point there are so many of these fake profiles and songs that the music, which is simple “mood music” normally (which happens to be easy to make), is appearing on real playlists and being recommended to real listeners."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the “Release Radar” generated for me last week, there was a 40 second song consisting of rhythmic mechanical noises with a strange title and album art of an alien head. I didn’t like it at all. I think it was recommended to me because the publisher listed its artist as “Fanny Mendelssohn” — a classical composer whose work I definitely enjoy and have probably pressed “Like” a few times on — even though the song had nothing to do with her.You’d think, she shouldn’t be releasing any new works, you know, on account of being long-deceased and all. Therefore Spotify could block releases claiming her as an artist. Unfortunately, there are new renditions of her work being performed, recorded and published regularly, by many different groups. All of them have the right (perhaps even an ethical duty) to put Fanny Mendelssohn as one of the artists. These are works I’d like to hear, so Spotify’s recommendation algorithms are on the right track.How on earth can Spotify distinguish real Fanny from fake Fanny?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The post was interesting, but I also noticed something in the blog that had the same flavor.
Even though the link was for a specific post, the page layout neatly flowed into another post. So smooth I thought the second post&#39;s title was a subheading of the original article. A strange thing, but maybe that&#39;s just me making connections that aren&#39;t there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Millenials and GenZ may have no idea who Mudge is. I, however, almost lost my first job out of college at a bank because I ran l0phtcrack against our Windows NT 4 server to see if it could crack passwords. I showed my boss, and he pulled me aside into another room and tore my head off for irresponsibly running this tool against a production server. He said I could have been fired if this got out, but he covered my ass, sent out an email requesting everyone reset their passwords, and let me continue working. I learned a good lesson because even though my intentions were good, and it did expose security issues, it was a bit immature and should have been done in a more controlled manner along with the proper clearances.Mudge knows the implications of &#34;whistleblowing&#34;. He has been a security consultant and even testified to Congress. He&#39;s not some noob that doesn&#39;t understand security or how systems work together to provide services like disclosure to FTC. The idea that Twitter PR can pooh-pooh away his concerns is shockingly stupid.I think Twitter is in real trouble here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned a lot about Mudge by reading &#34;Cult of the Dead Cow: How the Original Hacking Supergroup Might Just Save the World.&#34;For anyone wanting to explore 90&#39;s security nostalgia, it&#39;s worth a read. For anyone wanting to learn where hacktivism comes from, it&#39;s worth a read. For anyone wanting to learn about how security consulting has evolved over the years, it&#39;s worth a read.Mudge is a very cool and capable individual. I am slightly surprised that Twitter would ignore someone of his talent and respect, and choose to air their dirty laundry in this manner. It&#39;s as if they have no idea who they hired. That, or C-levels think they can outpay $$$ any PR against Twitter to control the narrative. Either way, if Mudge is whistleblowing, there&#39;s probably some bad shit going down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The whistleblowing case is a new dimension. To me as an outsider it implies Agrawal may have also been the manager in his previous technical role for a lot of the tech problems Zatko identified, and what made Agrawal CEO was his ability to leverage these problems to play ball with all the interests in that company and board, while sustaining through neglect some of those concerning practices within the organization. Twitter&#39;s product isn&#39;t technology, it&#39;s an uncertified  slot machine that pays out in political influence, and there are a lot of big interests depending on their cut of it. They needed a steady hand who wouldn&#39;t be vulnerable to being swayed by principle, and that&#39;s the one thing you don&#39;t keep hackers around for, imo.If I were betting, nothing is ever really systemically broken in large orgs, it just works for someone you can&#39;t see. This is a factor everywhere and not necessarily at Twitter. Shitty process? Cui bono. Unverifiable systems? Cui bono. Deniable and unaccounted-for access to God-mode data? Cui bono. Repudiable numbers reporting? Cui bono. Bizarre political posturing? Cui bono, etc."</p>

State can&#39;t help you as you do not have a way to communicate with it, don&#39;t have a way to start any legal process as you do not have a way to pay.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had some fun with StyleGAN a couple years ago.   I should probably have written this up, or something.  Some others I showed it too thought I should.  But I never took it too serious.  I was just bored over a couple weekends when I had access to some beefy GPUs.  And y&#39;know, it&#39;s quasi-porno.I opted for dudes not gals.  Part personal preference, partly because I happened to get my hands on an enormous dataset of hot shirtless guys taking selfies.The initial results were rather poor: https://i.imgur.com/npzDcCL.jpgThat&#39;s around when I realized how important the training data really is.  Too much variation in pose. So I trained a model that detected the face, nipples, and belly button, and aligned them vertically with that.  Then I briefly skimmed over the dataset manually, and deleted anything that just varied too much from the median, in a rather arbitrary way.Results were better: https://i.imgur.com/bS7ERC6.jpgSo I just let it churn away for a week, heating up the basement.  Some final results with narrow truncation and style transfer: https://i.imgur.com/rhnWnpK.jpgOne thing I find intriguing is how bland those men are, really.  Oh, beautiful, but too classically beautiful.  In a sense, StyleGAN is a compression algorithm, and highly truncated outputs are something like a median of the inputs.  So the above reflect a sort of &#34;average&#34; idealized image, that contains the traits most commonly found, in the media I trained it with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2012 I was looking at investing in REITs.  One REIT&#39;s pitch was that they owned such a large percentage of the rental housing in Tampa Florida, that even though vacancy rates were high, and rents were going down throughout the nation and other areas in the state of Florida, they were able to keep rents high in Tampa.Disgusted, I realized the harm that REITs and private equity are doing to housing markets, and wanted nothing to do with it.We need legislation that discourages housing as investment if we are to maintain  housing as shelter.  Unlikely, as wealthy folks who make money with the status quo run things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have considerable experience in the Real Estate backend software industry, and so am occasionally contacted by headhunters hiring for Real Estate Investment startups. Here&#39;s a typical reply that I give to them:  I am philosophically opposed to &#34;investing&#34; in real estate, as your industry exists entirely to snatch up affordable housing from actual homeowners as a get-rich-quick scheme, benefiting those who are already rich at the expense of those who would otherwise be rising up out of their own financial situation.
   
  Nothing personal, but I wish you - and everyone in your predatory industry - swift failure in your endeavor, for the benefit of the average homeowner.
  
  Have a good day!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key piece of information from the article:&gt; The CoreLogic data shows that what it calls “mega” investors, with a thousand or more homes, bought 3% of houses last year and in 2022, compared with about 1% in previous years, with the bulk of investor purchases made by smaller groups.So the mega investors only make up 3% of that 25%. I&#39;d love to see data on what the remaining 22% are, but my guess is:* flippers* middle class individuals buying a second property as an investment* small time property management firms run by local businessesAlso the Inside Economics podcast&#39;s recent episode Cooling Inflation and Confounding Housing Riddles[0] adds even more interesting color to the dialog. They explain that a lot of this is driven by demand for single-family home rentals. Roughly half of Americans will want/need to rent a single-family home at some point in their lives! Many people want to live in a home on a short-term basis, like when a family with kids moves to a new city and wants to familiarize with the area before committing to a full mortgage. And COVID combined with the changing demographics has caused a huge surge in demand, so surprise prices have also gone up.[0] https://moodys-talks-inside-economics.simplecast.com/episode..."</p>

I did my undergraduate thesis on &#34;Nash equilibria to predict consumer decision making under uncertainty&#34; under Dr. Bruce Lister WELL before machine learning was even a core field of Computer Science.People, individuals, you and me, demand increasing determinism from other stochastic humans so that we can better predict and manage our relationships with them. A corporation has the same instinct, so they are doing the reasonable thing and collecting data in order to predict the next state in the Markov Decision Process that is you.Every major technology (and some non-technology) corporation either has built or is building a similar system to optimize you for their system. People have chosen by a HUGE MARGIN to join these systems because the non-hidden benefits outweigh the hidden risks.

The stated aim: To prosecute child pornography. [1]Yeah, that will go down well, a central government checking our private conversations for &#34;suspicious content&#34;. Of course they would use the &#34;think of the children&#34; trope, they could also have gone with the &#34;think of the bad terrorists&#34; trope, but that would have been too American, too cowboy-ish, we need to feel special, we&#39;re Europeans, after all.Minus some street protests I don&#39;t think we can actually stop this, and, even then, I have my very big doubts. It so happens that I live in the EU periphery (I still need to present my ID card if I want to travel to Budapest or West from there), and it sickens me to see that my privacy depends on countries and electorates on which I have no say (like Germany, with all due respect to the Germans who still care about their privacy). Why should my privacy be made fun of because of decisions taken by some people from half way around the continent with which I have no direct connection and no shared past? Did they have a Securitate-like thing? Many of them didn&#39;t, and even those that did (like the same Germans), it looks like it doesn&#39;t matter at this point, they&#39;re all too happy to see their private political conversations be scrutinised 24/7.F. that, the only viable solution I see for my country is an exit from the EU, but the money (still) coming in from Bruxelles is too good to leave aside for pesky political principles, so of course that no serious politician from around these parts puts the problem that way.[1] https://www.patrick-breyer.de/en/posts/messaging-and-chat-co..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only &#34;good&#34; thing is that the current German government is very skeptical about this and two of the current governing parties (the Greens and the liberal party) have also long been opposed to more surveillance.This was different with the previous government where the &#34;law &amp; order&#34; mentality was much more entrenched, and which did nothing to prevent e.g. upload filters (despite promising to do so).So I try to maintain some hope that at least Germany as a member state could tank this awful bill.edit:Here&#39;s the list of 61 questions that the German government sent to the EU concerning the bill (at the end of the article, in English): https://netzpolitik.org/2022/chatkontrolle-bundesregierung-l...From a cursory reading, it reads to me like the diplomatic equivalent of &#34;what you&#39;re proposing doesn&#39;t make any sense&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It doesn&#39;t matter how low the error rate is. The fact that the European Commission wants to have a third (robotic) participant listening in on every digital communication is absolutely ridiculous.Saying that this is about child protection is a blatant lie. This serves only as a stepping stone to introduce other screening criteria later. And with opaque ML models it will be very tedious to determine what the model is supposed to find."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been working 100% remotely for about 6.5 years now. Overall I love it.  However, there are very real drawbacks that have taken me awhile to fully realize.For me, the primary one is that it&#39;s _way_ too easy for everyone to get deeply frustrated with each other.  Social interactions and chit-chat lead to a better understanding of people and a more accurate mental model of what people actually mean when they say something.Written text is the majority of remote communication.  That&#39;s both good and bad. It&#39;s a much lower bandwidth form of communication than face-to-face in terms of being able to pick up intent and understand the context of someone&#39;s mood/etc in what they&#39;re saying.  The same goes of communication over webcam.  It&#39;s higher bandwidth than written text, but still lower than in-person.When you&#39;re fully remote, you&#39;ll much more commonly misinterpret folks intent. You&#39;ll also more commonly have your intent misinterpreted.At least in my experience, this tends to lead to a much higher rate of frustration and more frequent extreme misbehavior when everyone is remote.I don&#39;t have an easy solution.  Occasional in person meetings help a lot, but they&#39;re hard to do well, and easy to do poorly.  Having 200 people in the same room for 2 days doesn&#39;t really help the situation, as there&#39;s zero time to get to know anyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Your remote team is my company&#39;s opportunity.&#34;Purely anecdotal based on my own experience, but at my company we have some people who work in an office and lots more that work remotely.  The in office staff contribute more ideas, work, fixes, and functional software than the remote teams by a factor of 4 or 5, or sometimes, depending on the in office worker, 10 times.  Those are hard numbers right out of our project management system.  It&#39;s simply easier to hash out hard problems in person that it is on a remote team, and the context is key.  You have all the little asides, ah ha&#39;s! and comments collected up that provide a better picture than any remote team can get unless they have their headsets on the whole time.Not that you couldn&#39;t have a good remote team - I just think the methods of communication available are not best suited to our monkey brains.  We&#39;re social animal, and we work best socially.What this has allowed us to do is beat out other development teams, both inside and outside the company.  Hasn&#39;t gone unnoticed - we also get the most important projects and are paid the most.  When it matters, the in-house people get the work.YMMV, of course, this is just one place, but I think a lot of people who want to work at home aren&#39;t interested in their success as making their work life easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;A study conducted on the main campus of a Fortune 500 company found that just 10 percent of all communications occurred between employees whose desks were more than 500 meters apart. This suggests that once companies span multiple floors, buildings, or campuses, they’ve already lost much of the collaborative value of being “in the office” together.&#34;This point often seems to get missed. If you&#39;re at a large company, you&#39;re often working with people on different floors, buildings, offices, countries. I want to be co-located with the people I work with often just isn&#39;t an option at larger companies even if many people come into an office."</p>
