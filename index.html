								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In high school, my friends and I managed to resuscitate a 914 that had been stowed away in a garage for over a decade. We towed it to the top of a hill with a pickup truck and attempted a clutch start after we&#39;d picked up some speed. None of us (especially me in the driver&#39;s seat) expected this to work, but amazingly it fired right up. One of my friends managed to jog alongside and jump into the car as I tried to keep it puttering along, and we ripped a few laps around the neighborhood. Soonafter, we stopped the engine and were never able to get it started again. Thanks for bringing up this memory. Cool article."</p>

I have absolutely no clue what this person is talking about and have no interest in cars, yet I read every single word.I love when people have such a deep knowledge of something that they can write an essay as unique and thoughtful as this. It reminds me of Kitchen Confidential, Surely You&#39;re Joking Mr Feynman!, or any rant about British politics by David Mitchell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story reminded me of the time I was trying to exploit a web app as part of a bounty programme.Unfortunately the application was so unstable that any attempts to SQLI, or really send any kind of malformed request would simply crash the entire site for hours, presumably until an admin came and restarted the server. DoS wasn&#39;t included in the programme so I never won a bounty. I&#39;m sure it could have been exploited, but it was simply so rickety and shoddy that I couldn&#39;t figure out how.Security through instability?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A single successful effort of unionization at an Amazon facility is more than symbolic: It will encourage -- and serve as a blueprint for -- employees at other Amazon facilities to do the same. Moreover, it will motivate employees at other large companies to try. This has been brewing for a while.It&#39;s possible we&#39;ll see a generational wave of unionization."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Freakonomics ran a recent episode on unions [1]. A pair of interesting stats were presented near the start: the approval rating for unions stands at 70% in the US (even higher among the young) at the same time that union membership stands at 10%. Both numbers are at multi-decade extremes.I don&#39;t think it&#39;s any coincidence that this success at Amazon comes right now. After the GFC all regulatory efforts turned to keeping financial markets solvent. That has meant unwavering support for policies that favor those with assets over those who don&#39;t.The pandemic happened in early 2020 just as the wheels were flying off the US economy yet again. So what would have played out got masked by many other factors, including direct government transfers.Those stimmie checks of yore are long gone, and it will be a very steep uphill battle to bring anything remotely like that back given the rip-roaring yr/yr increase in CPI and PPI now underway. Those checks are being blamed for the ongoing inflation that more than just the lunatic fringe now thinks is the start of Weimar-style hyperinflation.So with the 2/10 year yield curve now inverted [2], it&#39;s just a matter of time before the economic chickens come home to roost once more. Will it be different this time? Will unions step in to fill the gap that government can not?[1] https://freakonomics.com/podcast/do-unions-still-work/[2] https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/01/us-bonds-treasury-yields-inv..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When this has happened at individual Walmart stores in the past, the company would immediately shut down the store and everyone would lose their jobs. A couple years later they would build a new store within 20 or so miles of the old store, free of the union. This was obviously financially painful for Walmart, but it served as such a strong signal to employees to not even try to unionize that it must have paid for itself many times over given Walmart&#39;s thousands of stores. I wonder if Amazon has been taking notes from them on this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One of the unfortunate facts about open source operating systems like Linux is that specialized hardware support sometimes lags behind commercial operating systems like Windows and MacOS.Well that&#39;s just because the manufacturer just doesn&#39;t write one, not because of some intrinsic factor of FOSS. That&#39;s an odd point to make when it&#39;s the manufacturers&#39; fault."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool! I always assumed the Linux driver was maintained as a best effort side project by Wacom engineer(s), not as an official endeavor.Overall, Wacom tablets work fairly well under Linux and have for quite some time. There are some caveats with what events the devices report vs what apps expect, but I think that’s smoothed out in the modern world of XI2, the wayland tablet api, and libinput.I’m not a passionate user of graphics tablets, but in my experience, Wacom tablets work better on Linux than Windows (and similarly good to macOS) partly because on Windows, they predate Windows having an input stack that can support pressure-sensitive graphics tablet pens. That arrived in Windows 8. Wacom had instead implemented a sort of defacto standard called Wintab, which they seemingly standardized with a company called LCS/Telegraphics in the Win 3.x days. In the modern invocation of this, the tablet kernel driver appears to act as a relay for hardware events, but those events get pumped back to a usermode service, and then wintab32 clients get them pumped into their event loops. Modern Windows has WM_POINTER* events, but it seems this usermode service is needed even for those events to work, probably so that wintab and WM_POINTER events can remain consistent, sync with control panel, and not fire over eachother. Still, it’s a shame.In the modern world, if you happen to have a USB tablet that speaks the HID digitizer API, Linux should be able to give you fairly good support straight out of the box, usually only lacking support for rebinding keys easily, controlling LEDs, etc. More tablet manufacturers have been choosing hardware that can support the HID digitizer class as it’s probably the only way to get graphics tablet support for Android devices. I found this to be the case with an XP-Pen device that I bought with intent to try writing a driver, only to find it spoke perfectly good standard USB, produced events in evdev, and plumbed through to Krita absolutely fine. To be sure, not all XP-Pen tablets will work this way, but some will. I’d guess ones that advertise Android support are likely to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked as a Linux engineer at Disney Animation for 4.5 years and can attest to the great driver support Wacom has on Linux. We frequently tried new devices and always had support (user space tools were a different story)."</p>

It immediately links this app to more data for weather prediction, which might lead to better weather predictions.I wonder how they would measure that on an android phone.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A well-written design system is a godsend for end-user consistency, especially for people who use assistive technologies and are easily forgotten about by inexperienced teams. It also means that teams can focus in on the problem they’re actually trying to solve, and stop obsessing over the common components.I was only around for the first six months or so of this project, but I’ve taken so much of what I’ve learnt into my current design system, and I continue to reference GDS’s continuing work as the gold standard for researched user interface patterns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve enjoyed reading their thoughtful guidelines for common forms and pages. On the whole, it all seems like good advice that can be applied to any website. They also talk about the pain points and potential research areas. Here&#39;s one example https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/gender-or-sex/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been building prototypes with this. It is everything good web design should be– UI with good contrast, legible type and accessibility patterns.My only gripe is perhaps if their teams made example pages from their own use cases– sub-nav from the components page, charts/references from their Covid dashboards.Great work overall!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"+1 for plain-text for all the points you mention, particularly &#34;data-first with tools on top&#34;. But why reinvent the wheel when the org-mode format is well established and does everything you want, and more?There are an increasing number of tools using org-mode as a plain-text data store, so you are more likely to be able to participate in a tool ecosystem. In addition to my own https://braintool.org see the list below. BrainTool (mainly a bookmark manager) has an elemental to-do system, I&#39;d love to have my users be able to use your tool for todos.NB see also Karl Voit&#39;s push for org markup awareness outside of Emacs via Orgdown: https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown.------

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am conflicted on this.The spec is nice. I love the recognition that dates may be imprecise (e.g., 2022-05 --  although I would count that as the last day of the period, 23:59:59 on 2022-05-31, rather than the first day of the next period, 2022-06-01). I like the thought that went into it and the nice presentation.On the other hand, I do not think this is necessary or even all that helpful in the real world. You don&#39;t need a standardized format if you are writing to do items manually in a text editor. You just write them. In the vast majority of cases no one is going to see them but you. Time spent conforming to a spec is time wasted.A formal spec also doesn&#39;t help much for apps to use this format. There is not a huge need for portability between to do apps, and for most users to do items are ephemeral and not something that needs to be archived and revisited. Even if an app adopted this, being tied to a plain text format would likely hinder feature development, including the ability to sync across multiple devices. Beyond that, different to do apps use different systems of categorization and tagging, so really in practice I doubt this will become any kind of standardized format.So, all told, it is a beautiful effort, nicely presented, but  I think it is unnecessary."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This thread has (at least at the moment) serious Bob Martin Sudoku Solver energy to it. Tailscale has solved an infamously complicated problem using, for the most part, simple tools. They&#39;re not just successful; they&#39;re remarkably successful, spookily successful, upsettingly successful.Consider whether the secret sauce here might not be au courant database choices, but rather something much harder for random teams to pick up and run with: just straight up good design and programming.This is a thing that happens in other fields, too; some of the hardest dishes to cook seem extremely simple and have few ingredients. They&#39;re hard because there&#39;s no place to hide: your technique has to be flawless or they don&#39;t work. A famous entrance exam for new cooks at fine dining restaurants is &#34;make an omelet&#34;. Tailscale is, thankfully (and, to me, irritatingly), more like an omelet than a truffled hash."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I loved this article, despite the negativity.A discussion that keeps recurring on HN is how you can get a lot done with simple, boring solutions. This is a perfect example of that in practice. What’s the simplest thing that’ll work? Do that, monitor the solution, and when you start hitting a limitation reevaluate what the next appropriate solution is.There are plenty of comments here deriding this as insanity when we have established best practices, but “best practices for me are not necessarily best practices thee”.People aren’t perfect, not every engineer comes fully-formed grokking the industry’s best solutions and their trade offs.This is what learning looks like. This is what an evolving system looks like. And this is how valuable software gets built every day.Who gives a fuck about scalability on a poc? “Let’s just put in a json file”. I Love it. Personally I start at the “use SQLite” step and go from there because SQLite is such amazing software. Thanks to this post I’m excited to try out Lifestream.You might rightly point out that Tailscale isn’t a side-project/poc anymore. But that’s exactly why they’re changing to SQLite and writing this post; this is their team learning to deal with larger problems and changing needs, and they’re sharing that journey with us.As long as they’re not _ignoring_ serious risks let them experiment. But try not to get too upset if they’re making different risk/effort trade-offs than you would. Even if it’s “objectively” the “wrong” thing.My rubric for technical sanity is:- are you taking (and testing) backups?- is your infra/data secure?- are you monitoring what’s happening?- can you recover from catastrophic failure in a acceptable time frame?- are you meeting your legal obligations?Cover those needs and you can be forgiven a lot suboptimal/experimental implementation details."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;re using litestream [1] to replicate a SQLite database, which streams additions to the SQLite WAL file to object storage and can replay it back.

There&#39;s also the SQLite Session Extension [2] that is a built-in way to support generating and applying &#34;patches&#34;.I&#39;m curious how these tools will mature, it seems like a good match for microservices.[1]: https://github.com/benbjohnson/litestream[2]: https://www.sqlite.org/sessionintro.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In terms of evolution through the donation and acceptance of information carrying material, the most bizarre ritual I have witnessed is that of Developa Linuxia:  git format-patch --stdout | mail

  ... | git am

It is recommended that this be seen in the wild. The beasts that exchange material this way are rare and ancient but we are fortunate that it is easy to observe them performing their rites.  They make a point of enacting them publicly, in open clearings know as mailing lists.  You will note that, in comparison to more evolved techniques, what first seems like clumsy fumbling takes on a primal beauty of its own.These creatures are aware of more modern practices and yet they choose to remain in their own evolutionary niche, in part, because they lament the way in which Developa intercourse has been cheapened and corrupted by an unmentionable website named “something”hub.com."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems fairly straightforward to me..when it is expensive to procreate due to restricted resources, procreation becomes picky. Birds are mostly monogamous because flying is very energy intensive and the male parent doesn’t want to waste resource on fledglings that isn’t his..obviously, exceptions exist. It is very costly to raise the young. Parental investment is high.It is different for birds that don’t fly. Water fowl especially have a different reproductive system. Because they don’t fly. This is true for all flightless birds. Even for birds like geese that only fly for seasonal migration. They get their food from the water. Ground dwellers have plenty of food and don’t have spend as much energy foraging for food as a bird that flies. Very few of them mate for life.Further: Galus Galus has different design than geese and ducks. Castrated roosters are called ‘capons’(French)…produces a nice soft fat capon for Sunday lunch. It’s genitalia is less developed than say..geese.As a chef, I knew how to sex identify geese/duck. water fowl  genitalia is different than fowl. Most farmers know this as sex determination is key to raising animals for profit. With the exception of Pilgrim/Emden/White Italian and some Chinese geese where the autosexing is straightforward with feather colouring and down colour, most have to be identified while they are still goslings.Goslings can be gender identified as early as the first week and also when they are adults. Male adult penis is invaginated and like a corkscrew. Female organs has genital eminence. The breeding ratio is 1:3 or max 1:5. So it’s important to separate them as early as possible.Mammals are different..example: feline penii is barbed and most copulation results in kittens. A female cat can have a single litter with multiple tomcats. Male cats will kill kittens ..probably those that aren’t their own..because a lactating mother cat won’t go into heat.With insects like bees and mantii, the male often meets his end after sex. It comes down to energy needs and availability of resources.P.S: [..] Birds, she thought at the time, didn’t have penises. In her two years studying them at Cornell University, a world leader in avian research, she’d never once heard her colleagues mention a bird penis.[..] Huh! Really? Cornell university scientists don’t know what a farm child picks up during one farming season? The article is full of red flags for clickbait lies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some points I found interesting:- Kristian Andersen offered to abuse his power as editor to stealthily edit a preprint. He is the main author of the most notable paper supporting a natural origin, and has been one of the major resources of the natural origins camp. Now his scientific integrity is seriously questioned.- Peter Daszak appears much more focused on finding new sources of grant money than on doing good science: &#34;What was needed, he exhorted his staff, was a “change in culture” as “part of [a] mentaility [sic] to get money,”- The Wuhan Institute of Virology is more of a second zone lab than a top lab: &#34;The WIV was also viewed as subpar, especially when compared with the Harbin Veterinary Research Institute. Harbin was China’s Harvard, said the former DARPA official. The WIV was more like a safety school&#34;- EcoHealth Alliance and Daszak were seen by DARPA as amateurs in virology, not at all the expert frontline organisation that&#39;s been suggested before: &#34;EcoHealth Alliance was viewed as a “ragtag group” and a “middle guy,” a backseat collaborator willing to get on an Air China jet, eat terrible food, and stay in bad hotels&#34; &#34;EcoHealth Alliance had “bolted on” a serious scientist, Ralph Baric&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;The report he finally did submit worried the agency’s grant specialists. It stated that scientists planned to create an infectious clone of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), a novel coronavirus found in dromedaries that had emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 and killed 35% of the humans it infected. The report also made clear that the NIH grant had already been used to construct two chimeric coronaviruses similar to the one that caused Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), which emerged in 2002 and went on to cause at least 774 deaths worldwide. (A chimeric virus is one that combines fragments of different viruses.) These revelations prompted the NIH’s grant specialists to ask a critical question: Should the work be subject to a federal moratorium on what was called gain-of-function research?Wait what?! Is this new information ? Because this is incredibly troubling"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of this is tough to evaluate as a lay person.  For example:&gt;From the 75-page proposal, a striking detail stood out: a plan to examine SARS-like bat coronaviruses for furin cleavage sites and possibly insert new ones that would enable them to infect human cells.&gt;A furin cleavage site is a spot in the surface protein of a virus that can boost its entry into human cells. SARS-CoV-2, which emerged more than a year after the DARPA grant was submitted, is notable among SARS-like coronaviruses for having a unique furin cleavage site. This anomaly has led some scientists to consider whether the virus could have emerged from laboratory work gone awry.Should I interpret it as a would-be unbelievable coincidence that they would be working on the very same furin cleavage site that is unique in CoV-2?  Or should I interpret it as obvious - maybe the furin cleavage site is the most important part for infectiousness, and so we should expect any new human-infecting virus to have changes there, and should also expect that to be the area scientists focus on.Without expert knowledge, I have no way to tell, but it feels like the sort of thing I could very easily interpret incorrectly one way or the other."</p>
