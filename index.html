								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ah, there it is. I was wondering when this would happen.Facebook used to be involved with the Mercurial community, but it was difficult to work with them. They always wanted to do things their way, had their own intentions, and started to demand that the Mercurial project work the way that Facebook wanted. For example, they demanded that we start using Phabricator and started slowly removing sequential revisions from Mercurial in favour of always using node hashes everywhere, arguing that for their gigantic repos, sequential revisions were so big as to be useless.Eventually the disagreements were too great, and Facebook just stopped publicly talking about Mercurial.I figured they would emerge a few years later with their fork of it. They love doing this. HipHop VM for PHP, Apache Hive, MyRock; these are examples of Facebook forking off their development in private and then later emerging with some thing they built on top of it.The Mercurial project is surprisingly still chugging along, and there are still those of us who actually use Mercurial. I doubt I&#39;ll switch over to Sapling, because I disagreed with the things that made Facebook fork off in the first place. But if others like Sapling and this manages to put the slightest dent into the git monoculture, I&#39;m happy for the change and innovation. I really hope that git is not the final word in version control. I want to see more ideas be spread and that people can see that there can be a world beyond git."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank god.I have been waiting ten years (https://www.google.com/url?q=https://stevebennett.me/2012/02...) for someone to develop a better CLI for git, someone with the scale and clout to do it well and gain mindshare. It&#39;s not that useful to learn a new workflow if no one you ever work with will be familiar with it.This looks incredible. A simple command to uncommit or unamend makes you further realise what a disaster the Git CLI is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not a big fan of FB as a company, but I think their open source work is pretty impressive. Various other large companies have the problem of giant monorepos that they constantly need to onboard new developers to, but I can&#39;t think of anyone other than FB who consistently released their solutions.Sure, most people are probably fine with Git once they learned it and if they only work with small to mid sized code bases (like me). But I&#39;m still happy Sapling is out there, I might use it or learn from it if I ever run into the problems it solves."</p>

And it&#39;s much less creepy if all that data isn&#39;t going to someone else&#39;s computer.Also piping in and processing the data from my mobile would be cool, but I wouldn&#39;t want to invade other people&#39;s privacy if I&#39;m in public."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Physical books wear out in decades to centuries, computers break in years to decades. Also digital formats are constantly evolving and backwards compatibility for old formats is removed. Even without publisher/legal issues it&#39;s clear that preservation of digital media for even the next 10 years, and especially for the next 100 or 1000, is at risk.But I really wonder why is there no other major service like the Internet Archive? The way to preserve media is to distribute it and store it in many places, not just one central location. Does the Internet Archive store redundant copies in many locations? Does it use long-term physical formats?Also, figuring out what information is &#34;meaningful&#34; and which is completely useless or redundant is extremely important. Because we want to store everything with the potential to be important in the future, but we also have an incredible amount of data (hence one of the reasons why IA is the only major archiver). It may be good to strategize data collection, e.g. a shallow list of all sources and a deeper list of popular sources, a sample of various sources from every region, etc"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Ever try to read a physical book passed down in your family from 100 years ago?  Probably worked well.No, it worked terribly because they hadn&#39;t been stored well and were covered in mold (even the ones from only 70 years ago) or otherwise falling apart. I couldn&#39;t search them for specific phrases I remembered my grandfather reading me as a child, and I didn&#39;t have the physical space of my own to store them all either anyway. Even making a stab at indexing them all was enormously labor intensive. I was the only one in the family interested in even trying. It really sucked.&gt;Ever try reading an ebook you paid for 10 years ago? Probably a different experience.Yes, it was excellent, since naturally it was DRM-free or I wouldn&#39;t have paid for it. I have digital stuff from the 80s, still perfectly preserved, that I can call up as I wish, when I wish, anywhere I wish anywhere in the world.I&#39;m 100% onboard with the correct argument that modern copyright and DRM go against the core bargain of IP (societal agreement for public benefit) and could use major reform. But I don&#39;t think this piece does a very good job of making that argument, the entire comparison and pretending that books don&#39;t require any sort of preservation and so on really distracts from the core issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"DRM-laden digital books should be seen like the extra cheap paperbacks which fall apart sitting untouched on the shelf after a couple of years. Extremely different than the well-bound books one might think of when handling a 100 year old book.Non-DRM&#39;d ebooks in formats which are open, easily parseable, and that people care to archive should be fine for a long time. Some people here are talking about a decade as if we won&#39;t be able to parse epubs or text files in 10 years. I&#39;ve got documents &gt;30 years old already which are still easily parsed, and I don&#39;t imagine I&#39;ll have problems rendering them in another 30 years.I&#39;ll be utterly amazed if we can&#39;t render a basic HTML document, text-focused PDF, or hell even just ASCII text in the year 2032. I also have little doubt I&#39;ll still technically be able to load my DVDs or Blu-Rays of that data in 2032 and copy it into the holographic crystal storage devices that&#39;ll come out just before that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a scientist, I often have to deal with similar BS of a reviewer misunderstanding a submitted journal article, literally insisting we do something we already did, and explained in the paper.I try to just own the fact that I didn&#39;t make my explanation clear and visible enough, so I just submit an updated version along with a comment like &#34;We thank the reviewer for pointing out that we didn&#39;t clearly articulate our work on X, so we revised the manuscript accordingly.&#34;In this case change around the UI for this tool to make it slightly more idiot proof, resubmit, and it will be approved. Getting angry and adversarial will only make them have a bad attitude and intentionally be unhelpful. Take them seriously, stroke their egos, and take fully responsibility for having presented your feature in a way they didn&#39;t understand.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"And this is why we need to cherish the web. I see no reason why a yoga app can&#39;t be done on the web. I do know that apps tend to convert better, if only we could bridge that gap.It&#39;s in particular troubling how much of this madness we&#39;ve internalized to just accept. The idea that you need to resubmit a 100 apps because Google decided you need to target a different internal version number is insane. It would be very bad if the SDK had a breaking change, but in this case it&#39;s just busy work: upping a number and resubmitting.And what about the rule to be able to report user generated content? Who the hell is Google to interfere on such app-specific functionality? What if my moderation workflow would only allow draft posts, each manually approved, making reporting them pointless? Does Google actually check if a report gets sent or followed up? I don&#39;t think so. So it&#39;s an invasive power grab, and then poorly regulated.These platforms and gatekeepers have become far too powerful and leveled up the arrogance that comes with it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any large group representing App developers that could manage the large-scale negotiation and legal wrangling required to force Apple and Google to be more helpful when rejecting legitimate applications?When I worked in Google (Ads, then later in Recommendations for Play and youtube) people often said this was intention to avoid teaching spammers how to get around the rules.  But it&#39;s clear there are enough legitimate developers acting in good faith who are trying to change their applications without significant guidance that it seems entirely reasonable for a large-scale group negotiation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was just on the ground coordinating with 4 friends that got buried in 5+ foot of unexpected snow  in the mountains (forecast said 1&#34;-2&#34; when they went up) for the rifle opener in Montana. I wound up getting sick so I stayed home (hilariously I was the only one who got an elk) but I sent them up with my InReach.All I can say is THANK GOD that I did, because it turned into over a week long effort to get them out. Two decided to walk out and were able to text me a nav point that I was able to meet them at (took all day to get there because of the snow and mud, but I made it and was able to pick them up). The other two stayed up there, and we sent probably 100 texts back and forth coordinating what turned into like 3 solid days of fighting to get up there with snowcats and get them back down. Multiple situational changes that we would have been hosed without.In the end, I spent like $80 on texts, but it was money well spent. I think it&#39;s great for people to have SOS built into their iPhone, but there needs to be a &#34;use it now, pay later&#34; or no one is going to activate it and actually have it available when they need it. The other half of the equation is that you really need to be able to send texts. The SOS button is very expensive. Extremely expensive. That will keep a lot of people from using it. (Yes insurance exists, but hardly anyone has it). Being able to text your friends for help is substantially more useful. Being stuck on a backroad with no service, 5, 10, 20 miles from where anyone can be expected to drive by is a far more common scenario than breaking your leg at the top of a mountain and needing to be evacuated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Set backcountry search and rescue aside for a second.Seems to me this is for ordinary people doing ordinary things outside cell range, and finding they need help. A family member has a heart attack. A collision with a moose. Who knows what.Less “should’ve brought water and a jacket” and more “we’ve been on route 9 for two hours, a moment ago everything was fine, now he’s not breathing, we have no bars, and we have no idea where the nearest hospital is.”Besides, even if this feature only saves a single life, seems worth it to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a Paramedic in Northern California and am VERY happy about this feature. Even in some of our SF Bay Area counties, we have a lot of windy mountain roads with no cell service at all. Our portable radios don&#39;t even work up in the hills. To have an iPhone be able to send GPS location to the public safety access point is fabulous. Our dispatchers can at least drop a pin on a map and we can route to that location ourselves. This already happens in a lot of cases but the caller has cell service. We&#39;ve been on multiple incidents up in the hills where people have reported that they had to drive several miles down the mountain before they were able to get any reception to make a 911 call.This will save us a lot of time, and it will save lives. This is a game changing feature."</p>

When FS5 came out, you could modify the looks as well, so I&#39;d get the flight dynamics as close as I could and another guy would build the model of how it looked. I forget what that package was called, now. But it was a lot of fun. I don&#39;t think any of us had an idea that VA&#39;s would turn into a Thing. We were just teens having fun :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At one time, probably the early 80&#39;s when the first clones of the IBM PC came out, being able to run MS Flight Simulator was an indication of a clone&#39;s ability to run all other IBM PC software.  I remember one clone manufacturer used a screenshot of FS in their ad at the time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PayPal isn&#39;t a bank, folks. If you treat PayPal like a bank, you will have a bad time.Almost all horror stories you hear about PayPal involve the user treating PayPal like they were a bank. Just do not store money in PayPal... sweep nightly if you use PayPal for business. They even provide tools to make this automated.The reason this policy exists is likely to remove super old liabilities for long-dormant accounts that have been long forgotten about.PayPal is not interested in storing funds forever... they want you to buy stuff with it or transfer it to your real bank account.This policy seems aimed at convincing people to &#34;move it or lose it&#34;..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paypal has always loved keeping money they didn&#39;t earn.  They should be treated like a crypto exchange: never keep your funds with them, only use them to transact then move funds away (if no other alternatives available)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have only ever used paypal to pay for things with a credit card. I was tricked into having the account at all by a fraudlent and misleading UI built by ebay and that&#39;s the only reason I had it in the first place. I did use it to pay for some things so I guess their plan worked.Paypal recently, after a decade or so of use, demanded I hand over multiple forms of ID. I refused and said close the account. They refuse to close the account because I have not handed over ID documents that I don&#39;t want them to have on their files because they are untrustworthy both ethically and in terms of competence as you guys know well.So the account is there ready to be hacked. I&#39;ve pointed this out to them on about 20 separate occasions and they refuse to close it.Paypal are crooks. It is in their dna. They&#39;re crooks for no reason, just from force of habit. You cannot trust them in any way. Society allowing them to have any market power whatsoever is completely insane. Yet another case of a cpu attached to a network being on the critical path of what some company is doing preventing otherwise intelligent humans from thinking a normal, critical fasshion about what they are doing and forming a minimally appropriate response, trapping the rest of us who literally cannot act at all."</p>
