								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Maybe there needs to be a self-hosting association/union that self-hosters can join?  It could advocate for adherence to open standards, and an equal standing for small servers.  It could also be a repository of advice for current best practise in small server administration and configuration.  Should it be under the auspices of an existing group such as FreedomBox?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m on 12 years of self hosting email and counting. Once every so often, I do end up being blocked, usually by Outlook and once by Yahoo. I&#39;m in their &#39;sender program&#39; and they still don&#39;t actually bother to contact postmaster@, but a few emails is usually enough to unblock the block within 24h.Agree with a sibling comment that many major providers fail to operate the SPF/DKIM/DMARC tools they insist you do.Each to their own, but ultimately if we don&#39;t hold on to the freedom to operate our own mailservers, it will be taken away through inaction. This means doing some things right: DMARC, DKIM, SPF of course, server maintenance, good password policies and of course IP reputation. The best way I can recommend for IP reputation is to use a dedicated provider or VPS provider that disallows things like VPN endpoints, where it is less likely they&#39;ll assign an address with a poor reputation. A good provider might also ask you what you intend to host, and you might be able to discuss IP addresses with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been hosting my mail for 20+ years now, with minor issues. I guess I&#39;ve been lucky.Reading the comments here makes me incredibly sad. Every answer that tells me to use a provider misses the point. The Internet was created so that there could be many independent nodes, not so that everybody has to rely on one of several blessed providers. I should be able to run my own E-mail.The real problem is lack of incentives. The big corps do not care about e-mail. It doesn&#39;t make money and isn&#39;t easily controllable. You can&#39;t turn it into a walled garden and lock users in. So, it gets minimal attention, and only defensive measures are developed.Either we solve the spam problem, or things will get worse. The big tech corps won&#39;t solve it for us."</p>

It&#39;s unlikely that actual people weren&#39;t hurt because of these bugs. They have known about these issues for years, and they continue to give them the importance of an unresponsive button in Gmail settings.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29492884https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/rfld6m/pixel_p..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got a Pixel 6 Pro a few months ago, and it&#39;s without question the worst phone I&#39;ve ever had the displeasure to own.- It crashes constantly.- Bluetooth is even buggier than usual.- Fingerprint unlock is very finicky.- The touchscreen isn&#39;t designed/calibrated well and leads to constant fat finger presses.- The hotspot is buggy to connect and randomly drops once it does connect.- The phone is so slick (ie low friction) that it will randomly slide and fall off of slightly off-level surfaces.- It feels like this was released without anyone living with the phone for even a couple weeks and trying normal use cases...Anyway - I&#39;ve been really disappointed there haven&#39;t been updates to fix some of this stuff. I&#39;ve heard this may be because of hardware issues, but I haven&#39;t looked that deeply. I&#39;ve owned Pixel phones before and like the no BS + Google Apps-centric approach, but this phone really soured me on Google phones. :-("</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is 44 years ago, that I worked on a program in FORTRAN and it is 43 years ago that I learned LISP. It is about 36 years that I am writing software for a living.The longer I am a software engineer the longer I begin to understand that the soft skills are much more important than all the technical skills. For me software engineering is much about dealing with my insecurities and coming to term with my weaknesses. I also feel that it is a lot about dealing with your ego and a lot with cooperating with colleagues and bosses. The longer I am a software engineer, the more I understand that developing software is not about writing code but communicating with people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Try different things” is the key, of course.32 year programmer here (started at 19).I cannot “amen” this sentiment enough. But probably not in the way most will read it.Most will interpret this at a macro level: Learn some Smalltalk! Now go learn Lisp! And then Clojure followed by Haskell, throw in some Java or C++ so you know what pain feels like! This is OK, it is good to be somewhat travelled in your journeys as a programmer.But I find that there is a micro application that gets overlooked. You can do a lot of “try new things” right in the stack you’re in without having to bust strange new worlds. Most languages end up with many ways to do things. You can and should take time to explore those. Learn the conventions/idioms, but then push/challenge those.I was afraid of C macros until I took time to really try some things with them. It didn’t mean I suddenly used them for everything, but overusing them for a bit helped me better make good choices about them.C pointers intimidated a peer until I forced him to forego index based for statements, using all pointer math instead.Smalltalk context objects were kind of “behind the scene” magic until I decided I’d like to figure out how to implement goto in Smalltalk. After that, they opened up for me.Python decorators are “magic” until you make a few of your own.The examples could go on and on.Try new things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is my 30th year programming. I always hope it&#39;s my last. Programming for money destroyed the fun hobby long ago.It&#39;s just reinventing the wheel year after year by this point. The last thing the world needs is more software.The web is the crappiest platform ever conceived; I won&#39;t touch it. Social media is poison. Smartphones didn&#39;t impress me in 2007 and they don&#39;t impress me now. They&#39;re annoying and intrusive. I still like desktop software. I know, I&#39;m a dinosaur.I just don&#39;t care about computers any more. I don&#39;t care what direction the industry goes in. I&#39;m not depressed and I don&#39;t need to learn a new language or work on a different project.I love creative problem solving. What I do not love is solving whatever problems are handed to you without asking whether they truly need solutions, or whether it&#39;s good for the world. Much of what people want computers to do is a waste of time and of life. Whether it&#39;s bureaucratic corporate garbage or thought stopping entertainment.I&#39;m so tired of computers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The deplatforming logic is practical but pretty shaky as a long term strategy. Kiwifarms absolutely may have been a despicable place causing real harm to people. In that case, the police should initiate a request to take them down that Cloudflare or ISPs etc. are obligated to follow. The problem is the government is completely ineffective and regularly offloads their responsibility to platforms like Facebook, Cloudflare etc. A private company should not be making decisions on essentially freedom of speech. Its just one more responsibility that law enforcement has completely shirked leaving others to clean up the mess."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article seems to have been posted to make a false equivalence with the current Kiwifarms situation. There’s a pretty clear difference in urgency between taking down DDOSers and deplatforming a forum that is a gathering point for a mob engaging in mass harassment, stalking, and SWATing. One is a nonviolent crime. The other is a crime targeting an individual that had already escalated to the point of a high risk of violence, with no sign of slowing down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So he ran a DDoS network that wasn&#39;t behind Cloudflare, but used Cloudflare to stop his website being DDoSed by competitors, and this means Cloudflare was helping him DDoS others?No, it means Cloudflare was helping keep his website up, in a neutral manner.In other words, exactly what Cloudflare have stated their policy is.Now if Cloudflare allowed him to run DDoS code on its Workers, then yes, that&#39;s Cloudflare helping him.Very false equivalence."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#39;One port to rule them all&#39; was a mistake. Instead of being convenient, USB C has become a confusing ordeal of varying capabilities and quality control. It is like we&#39;ve gone back to having many different types of connectors, but it is even worse because they share the same form factor. For any of the devices that use USB C to charge, I only use the cable that came with it when I purchased it.While I complain, I would also like to mention the USB forum&#39;s insane naming strategy and non-obvious labeling system. Remember when USB 3 was easily identifiable because of the blue plastic in the port?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok I knew the situation was confusing but after reading this I am dumbfounded. It seems so much strictly worse than the old world of having different cables with different connectors - yes you had to have a lot of different cables but you couldn’t get it wrong. Now we have all the same complexity and you can’t tell what’s what by just looking at the connector."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been a big pain, for me.The only docks that have worked for me, have been the CalDigit TSX docks, which I have used for a long time. The TS4 is out of stock on the CalDigit site, and I&#39;m never using Amazon again, for anything over about $100. I&#39;ll get it, eventually.I have the latest 14-inch MBP (M1Max).The biggest issues that I encounter are:1) External keyboard wake up/recognized.If I use a dock, the keyboard is often not recognized. I found that I need to plug directly into the Mac. Otherwise, it sometimes won&#39;t wake the computer, or the computer sometimes &#34;forgets&#34; the keyboard.2) Monitor Handling.I use a 49&#34; LG Ultrawide (5120 X 1440). I used to have it split into two monitors (3840 X 1440, 1680 X 1440), but now use it as a single, ultrwawide, after Apple started natively supporting that resolution.I found that many docks (even &#34;Thunderbolt&#34; ones) and adapters, refused to allow me to select the ultrawide size. Also, the monitor would often fail to be recognized, after the computer wakes, and I would have to reach under, and unplug/replug, to get it recognized. I have the monitor plugged directly into one of the TB ports, with a TB-to-DP cable, and it works great.From what I understand, the new CalDigit should fix these issues."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love projects like this. Very cool, but only possible by completely disregarding the fact that this is illegal under copyright law. As it is, I expect this person has already painted a sizable target on their back and there&#39;s a very good change they&#39;ll be sent a take-down notice once Nintendo becomes aware.I think projects like this should be allowed to exist and that eventually people will grow very tired of how restrictive copyright law is and demand changes, but until that happens, I hope these types of projects continue to be created and spread in violation of the law for as long as possible until the lawyers finally come after them.It&#39;s better that we see what kinds of things we could have without oppressive copyright laws and be upset when they are taken from us than for people to refuse to start cool projects just because they are doomed to be shutdown."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool! It isn&#39;t quite what I expected from the idea of &#34;street view&#34; though; it definitely has a very full map, but it seems like there are only a few specific spots where you can actually see the world (i.e. the &#34;street view&#34; part versus the &#34;Google Maps&#34; part), and it seems like there isn&#39;t any way to move when in the &#34;world&#34; view compared to the &#34;map&#34; view.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat tangential but somewhat related...I love the Apple TV screensavers that are basically beautiful slow moving drone shots of landscapes, which you can get for Mac too [1]. There are expansion packs too you can pay for, with 3rd party videos.And I kind of want the same thing, only of high-quality 3D rendered landscapes! For me specifically, slow flybys over Red Dead Redemption 2 landscapes, and also of real-life Microsoft Flight Simulator locations. Producing such videos would save all of the cost of real-life transportation, lodging, waiting till sunrise/sunset, flying a drone... And instead of having just 40 videos on rotation, you could have 10,000&#39;s...I don&#39;t have the time to build it, but it&#39;s a hobby project I wish desperately that somebody would![1] https://aerialscreensaver.github.io/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Originally made by Bob Nystrom [1] who now works on Dart, it is now maintained by ruby0x1 who is a game developer and most importantly creator of a game engine that uses Wren as a scripting language [2]. Unfortunately Luxe is still not publicly available (closed beta), which I admit is a bit of a frustration for me as I&#39;ve been following development for a few years, but it does show a lot of promise and in the meantime I&#39;ve become a happy user of Godot. I keep Wren in the back of my mind as an easy-to-embed scripting language in cases where you could integrate Lua (which Wren outspeeds) but not LuaJIT.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=munificent[2] https://luxeengine.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a neat little language. It was created by the author of [Crafting Interpreters][0]; the language in the book (Lox) is essentially a slimmed-down Wren for teaching.[0]:https://craftinginterpreters.com"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wren seems pretty elegant, but it makes the same mistake a lot of languages do when it comes to operator overloading.  If you put the binary operator as a method on the first object, then there isn&#39;t a simple way to have &#34;builtin_object &lt;operator&gt; your_object&#34;.For instance, Wren doesn&#39;t provide complex numbers, so you aren&#39;t going to get a nice syntax for &#34;1/z&#34; or similar.  I could make similar examples with scalar multiplication for vectors, matrices, or Numpy-style arrays, etc...Python and other languages have fallbacks to work around this, but Wren does not.  And really, I think of binary operators as 2 argument functions, not methods on the left object."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Buyer beware - my wife hates Amazon and goes out of her way to not purchase from them. She has encountered several vendors on Walmart marketplace that simply place orders with Amazon at 100% markup - the packages arrive in Amazon boxes w/ a receipt showing the actual cost paid at Amazon. Total rip-off.When ordering electronics from Walmart Marketplace, particularly TVs, I’ve found that the marketplace sellers freely substitute makes and models. Maybe nobody notices if you are shipping a gift to someone else, but since I need specific models from specific manufacturers for development it gets noticed when I order LG model XYZ and get a no-name tv instead. I stopped ordering from Walmart altogether after the second time (out of two, consecutive) that happened.So my advice is anything you buy online at Walmart, make sure it is not a marketplace seller, just save yourself the trouble.In all cases Wal-Mart refunded my money after waiting for a week for the vendor to respond, though I had to lug the stuff to the UPS store to return it. Amazon usually suggests I donate stuff rather then return it.I’ve not had any issues with the items sold by Wal-mart actual, those you can buy with confidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon let’s the same thing happen in their store: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=1+tb+flash+drive&amp;crid=1XK7KPUOQ4X...It’s horrible and they won’t do anything about it despite contacting them via help requests and Twitter.3 of the top 5 listings are total scams.And Amazon’s choice for 1TB flash drive is a scam: USB Flash Drive 1TB, Flash Memory Stick for PC/Laptop, Ultra Large Storage USB Drive, Portable Thumb Drives (Black) https://a.co/d/cTi7XqZ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Flash drives with hacked firmware to pretend to be bigger capacity than they were (along with other evildoing, like counterfeits targeting people paying a premium to get Sandisk quality) were already rampant on eBay IIRC 15+ years ago.I was still seething over some of the storage ones when, a few years ago, I joined an anti-counterfeiting startup.  (Sadly, our successful MVP launch integrated into a high-end factory production line happened just as Covid was breaking out, which spooked our flagship customer, and impacted followthrough we needed, then we ran out of runway while pivoting.)As a consumer, I can imagine a lot of things that the marketplaces like Amazon.com and Walmart.com could do to improve trustworthiness.  I don&#39;t know whether those make business sense.  I&#39;d love to see consumers reward a marketplace that conspicuously kept out the scammers.Ideally, the solution would protect integrity of all brands, not only house brands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s 2 different things going on here:- The optimal amount of fraud in society is 0- The optimal amount of fraud a business/industry should accept is non-zeroThe simple observation that the cost to prevent each marginal fraud attempt increases; the last 0.1% of fraud costs way too much to prevent compared to the first 99%. Obviously society would be better off if fraud didn&#39;t exist, but since it does the effort expended is only worth it up until when the marginal cost of prevention exceeds an acceptable threshold (when it starts to lose you money).The optimal amount of fraud is still 0, but the optimal amount of fraud prevention lies somewhere on the margin.This is why important transactions like banking have KYC checks, and buying a pair of sneakers don&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This whole article is one giant time sapping piece of click bait.The author makes the unexpected claim that businesses want a non zero amount of fraud. And so as a reader you are tempted to read on because you haven&#39;t heard this before. But essentially the argument is that fraud is needed as an unavoidable byproduct of allowing trust/credit in the system to facilitate transactions. However, if businesses could have the trust without the fraud of course they would. I wouldn&#39;t be so upset if the author had been more upfront about what this was about. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people out there who are learning about the fraud and trust/credit relationship for the first time. Just don&#39;t try and spin this in a way that it isn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this starts with an agreeable premise. Some fraud is egregious, costly, and/or easy to detect. These low-hanging or high-impact cases are most worth pursuing. At some point you reach diminishing returns, where the amount of time / effort / capital you&#39;re putting in to eliminating fraud outstrips the losses from the fraud itself.I don&#39;t know that I agree with the ethical conclusion that the optimal amount of fraud is therefore non-zero. The leap from &#34;anti-fraud efforts are expensive&#34; to these sentences in the final paragraph was not, in my opinion, convincingly made here:&gt;We should, as a society, accept non-zero amounts of benefits fraud. We should accept non-zero amounts of cheating on taxes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why all the negativity in the comments here? Yes, sometimes it is extremely valuable to make a nice thin wrapper on existing tech. As a community, we can&#39;t always complain about the user interface of FOSS tools, and then when someone makes a UI, again complain that they haven&#39;t done anything or the size is large. Pick a side!"</p>
