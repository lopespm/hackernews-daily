								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will never forget the day a postdoc in my lab told me not to continue wasting time trying (and failing) to reproduce [Top Institution]’s “Best Paper Award” results from the year prior. He had been there when the work was done and said they manipulated the dataset until they got the numbers they wanted. The primary author is now a hot shot professor.My whole perception of academia and peer review changed that day.Edit to elaborate: like many of our institutions, peer review is an effective system in many ways but was designed assuming good faith. Reviewers accept the author’s results on faith and largely just check to make sure you didn’t forget any obvious angles to cover and that the import of the work is worth flagging for the whole community to read. Since there’s no actual verification of results, it’s vulnerable to attack by dishonesty."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue is that the authors of bad papers still participate in the peer-review process. If they are the only expert reviewers and you do not pay proper respect to their work, they will squash your submission. To avoid this, papers can propagate mistakes for a long time.Personally, I&#39;m always very careful to cite and praise work by &#34;competing&#34; researchers even when that work has well-known errors, because I know that those researchers will review my paper and if there aren&#39;t other experts on the review committee the paper won&#39;t make it. I wish I didn&#39;t have to, but my supervisor wants to get tenured and I want to finish grad school, and for that we need to publish papers.Lots of science is completely inaccessible for non-experts as a result of this sort of politics. There is no guarantee that the work you hear praised/cited in papers is actually any good; it may have been inserted just to appease someone.I thought that this was something specific to my field, but apparently not. Leaves me very jaded about the scientific community."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"More specifically, this paper is focused on the social sciences. That&#39;s not to say that this isn&#39;t present in the basic sciences either.But one other thing to note here is that these headlines about a &#34;replication crisis&#34; seems to imply that this is a new phenomenon. Let&#39;s not forget the history of the electron charge. As Feynman said:&#34;We have learned a lot from experience about how to handle some of the ways we fool ourselves. One example: Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops, and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right. It&#39;s a little bit off because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air. It&#39;s interesting to look at the history of measurements of the charge of an electron, after Millikan. If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bit bigger than Millikan&#39;s, and the next one&#39;s a little bit bigger than that, and the next one&#39;s a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher.
Why didn&#39;t they discover the new number was higher right away? It&#39;s a thing that scientists are ashamed of—this history—because it&#39;s apparent that people did things like this: When they got a number that was too high above Millikan&#39;s, they thought something must be wrong—and they would look for and find a reason why something might be wrong. When they got a number close to Millikan&#39;s value they didn&#39;t look so hard. And so they eliminated the numbers that were too far off, and did other things like that ...&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drop_experiment#Millikan.2..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article isn’t about if you should join a startup vs. a big company. It’s about if you should join a startup vs. a FAANG company, which offers outrageous compensation &amp; benefits. From that perspective, FAANG is the obvious choice 99% of the time.The more and apt comparison would be if you should work at a startup vs. a corporate job at a HP or Qualcomm.  At those type of companies, compensation is not competitive (they often off-shore), benefits are tight, and the work is not interesting. It could very well be argued that a startup, even with high probability of failure, would be more fulfilling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is success? The article assumes for the most part that success is mainly monetary, and further it makes the classic mistake of comparing success monetarily to companies like Facebook. Success is different depending on many factors.  For example, if a person needs or likes guidance and structure, a startup is likely not a good fit, especially when they are inexperienced. There are some good points about the strong community in startups and how it can be used to encourage excessive work hours and lower pay. However, that same community feeling and sense of purpose is what I remember fondest from working at startups. In addition, startups give you access to other capable and driven people that you might create a startup of your own with … much less likely at a large company full of risk-averse employees who work on a small piece of the company’s “mission”.What personality type are you? The author likely comes from a structured, religious background and prefers the “certainty” of a corporate environment.  Some of us were raised by hippies with little or no religion and high structure. People like that are miserable in highly structured environments in which gaining a sense of the “mission” is impossible.The main point here is that career decisions are highly personal and one person’s hell is another person’s heaven."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As much as I agree with everything said in this article I wouldn&#39;t trade my years at a start up for anything. Both financially and emotionally it was awesome. I didn&#39;t get rich, and I worked way too much, but it was awesome. I loved the constant change and chaos. I learned so much, way more than I would&#39;ve in any other type or work place. I made great friends too. It was as bad as the article, but it was way waaaay better too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d like to highlight the Introduction of nmcp.pdf which explains in a very compressed form how it works which encompass all the magic.&#34;The lossless data compressor employs the traditional predictive approach:  at each time t, the encoder uses the neural network model to compute the probability vector p of the next symbol values t knowing all the preceding symbols s0 up to st−1. The  actual  symbol  value st is  encoded  using  an  arithmetic encoder  with approximately −log2 ( pst ) bits. Then the model is updated knowing the symbol st. The decoder works symmetrically so there is no need to transmit the model parameters. It implies both encoder and decoder update their model identically.When  no  preprocessing  is  done, st represents  the  byte  at  position t. Hence there are Ns= 256 different symbol values from 0 to Ns−1.&#34;For those usually familiar with Huffman coding this is using an Arithmetic coding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_codingIt allows adaptive coding (i.e. changing the probabilities of symbols dynamically). Here these probabilities are modelled dynamically using a neural network.The magic is that the neural network parameters are defined implicitly : You don&#39;t need to transmit the neural network parameters, therefore you can use as big as you want neural network.During the decoding the from scratch network is continuously trained using the freshly decoded data, in the same way that it was during the encoding. The more data you compress, the more you train the internal neural network parameters, and the better the prediction for next character gets.You decode 20 bytes, you update the model with this new data, you decode 20 new bytes with the new model, you update the model,... , every 1000000 bytes you can even update your model multiple times using all currently available data to make the network converge faster.Of course this only works if everything is exactly deterministic, which Fabrice Bellard took great effort in guaranteeing, which is no small engineering feat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Compression speed is around 2 KB/sec.The figure is given in nncp_v2.1.pdf. This is 1000x slower than xz, which in turn is 1000x slower than gzip.I have always wondered if a compression service could be a viable commercial offering and with NNCP rates and its compression speed, it looks like it could! That&#39;s for cases when you need to really compress the heck out of something, e.g. prior to distributing a large static piece of data to a very large number of recipients. I think there was a service like this, used by AAA game developers for distributing patches, but it didn&#39;t take because it had a very slow decompression... and, now reading further through the paper, it looks like an issue with NNCP too -    The NNCP v2 decompression speed is similar to its compression speed.

So it&#39;s a no-go for my brilliant and lazy startup idea, but fascinating stuff nonetheless."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fabrice Bellard is proof that 10x programmers exist. Or even more than 10x; he single-handled wrote a software 4G LTE base station (https://bellard.org/lte/), something that would normally take a team of hundreds to develop due to the complexity of the specification."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Postgres is one of those pieces of software that’s so much better than anything else, it’s really incredible. I wonder if it’s even possible for competitors to catch up at this point - there’s not a lot of room for improvement in architecture of relational databases any more. I’m starting to think that Postgres is going to be with us for decades maybe even centuries.Do any other entrenched software projects come to mind? The only thing comparable I can think of are Git and Linux."</p>

Or does it still rely on problematic, 3rd party tools?Last time I was responsible for setting up a HA Postgres cluster it was a garbage fire, but that was nearly 10 years ago now. I ask every so often to see if it has improved and each time, so far, the answer has been no."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Brilliant work.  And it makes me think - we produce tools, that are part of two phase spaces - the idea and the knowledge of how to create it.  Firstly I simply would not have thought of it, &#34;like button inflation&#34; is a pretty off the wall concept.  On top of which I don&#39;t know where to get an HN data feed or how to make a chrome extension etc.
Yesterday I was on a call with a collegue and the conversation turned to a useful feature we did not have (internal use) - and 30 minutes after the idea we had coded it up - because we had the knowledge but only lacked the idea till that moment.Without that knowledge even the best idea moves the process from &#34;yeah let&#39;s do it&#34; to &#34;I should schedule some time and make a project plan and ...&#34;The difference is important somehow.  And most of our working lives would be better if we stopped with the project plans and just built useful stuff.Edit: To try and clarify - exploring a new and uncharted phase space is exploration - it cannot be planned in advance, or driven in a particular direction.  Sun-Tzu teaches that Climate, Landscape and doctrine all affect our success as much or more than mission and leadership - so we should stop trying to control and actually find the flow.I think we search for product-market fit, we do not decide product market fit.One tool I realise i have been trying to build on and off is a post-hoc reporting tool that makes it look like my exploratory development style was actually planned (it&#39;s always something like, I am going to explore this inferring hill over there, and just make sure the roadmap, docs and timesheets are up to date.)  This way I don&#39;t get people bothering me so much.  It works better than grumpy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not sure where we go from here, but not being able to escape anxiety-inducing situations in a workplace is the definition of a toxic work environment. I don&#39;t think the answer is a return to 20th century &#34;no politics at work,&#34; but at the FAANG I worked at, politics was impossible to avoid. Even the desire to be apolitical is itself criticized at worst and not respected at best. Work doesn&#39;t afford the use of the &#34;block user&#34; button. I hope we figure out a better way that respects some people have a hard time immersing in it the way others do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; according to a new Harris poll commissioned by Paradigm, a diversity consultancy, more than two-thirds of adults in America want to be able to discuss racial-justice issues at workI just plain do not believe this poll."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Boards should have more apprehension about their companies being exploited as political platforms by employees.It&#39;s as though there is a bargain where in exchange for boards tolerating staff radicalization, these employee groups cheerfully overlook the dystopian, totalitarian surveillance infrastructure, environmental devastation, and political corruption machines they seem to have zero problem building and managing on their behalf, and decieving users into depending on them. One doesn&#39;t even need to take a side to recognize the bitterness and contempt in tech toward red state denizens. I&#39;ve sat through numerous meetings where all the shibboleths were trotted out to make sure we were all on the same political page before senior executives engaged in what would be considered hate speech against working class people in any other context. If calling people &#34;trash&#34; isn&#39;t hate speech, I really don&#39;t know what is.There still exists a group (perhaps even a majority) in society who are good and charitable people with an immense amount of tolerance for this stuff because they believe tolerance is the price of principles, and they&#39;re only principles when they are hard to keep.Radicalized platform company employees do not have a single moral leg to stand on in this regard. Bringing your whole self to work to build defacto social credit systems and partisan social engineering and surveillance tools is just moral licensing. Maybe that&#39;s how they sleep at night. While they found a new way to take a few more minutes of peoples time to show them outrage and advertisements, at least they mouthed the right party lines in favor of distant oppressed people they don&#39;t know personally?I know a number of people in tech who sincerely believe they do not need to be good men or women by any standard because they are self justified by being engaged not in discourse, but ideological warfare. I used to think they were misguided idealists and I thought their passion could be used for good, but I&#39;ve come to realize they are just dispicable.All I can recommend is, don&#39;t let yourself be bullied."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Jonathan Blow, in a talk about how software is getting worse, points to the example of Ken Thompson&#39;s text editor, which Ken built in a single week.This kind of sentiment drives me crazy. Yes, internationalization makes things harder and more complex than they were in the old days. But, back then, only people who lived in one small part of the world were able to usefully use computers in their language. (Simply supporting the Unicode character set is not enough.)  Nostalgia for the simplicity of the past ends up having ugly cultural implications. It&#39;s easy to say &#34;let&#39;s go back to the time when things were simple&#34;; it&#39;s a lot harder to say &#34;folks in (e.g.) Israel shouldn&#39;t be able to type in their native language&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding the vertical cursor movement, back in the day there was an alternative behavior. You can see this in QuickBASIC/QBasic[1]. Here, Microsoft treated the entire screen as a grid. I always thought that was a great UI. It hides the fact that there are line endings (\n on Unix or \r\n for DOS). And why shouldn&#39;t it? That&#39;s an implementation detail. And as evident by DOS using CR+LF it goes back to the days where you had an actual physical carriage on a typewriter. Nearly every modern text editor you have to type out the spaces/tabs you want to reach the area you what to add text. In QBasic, you just move the cursor wherever you want on the screen with arrow keys and start typing. Because, unlike a typewriter, a computer screen is 2D. Vim has block mode but, AFAIK, can only work on selections. Of course, this is not universal and only works with monospace fonts in certain languages. But back in the day it made it easy to create ASCII/ANSI diagrams and art.Modern text editing is a multilayered mess. Rendering, input methods, variable width fonts, and the special codes (markdown, etc.). On some sites it&#39;s not even self-consistent. Take Jira. Last I checked, they have one editor for creating a ticket and an entirely different editor for editing that same ticket[2] (one of these editors sucks more than the other, but I can never remember which... but neither one is remotely what I would consider a &#34;good&#34; interface). How they got there is truly the 8th Wonder of the World.[1] https://archive.org/details/msdos_qbasic_megapack[2] https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Software-questions/H..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s such a pleasant surprise to me how effectively and quickly people have become concerned about this issue. The recent WWF report came out less than 2 years ago [1]. Microplastics were obviously known for a long time, but that&#39;s when conversations about microplastics re-ignited. And now we can see an entire country declaring plastics toxic and restricting them. If you&#39;d asked me an hour ago, I&#39;d have predicted it&#39;d take at least another decade before concern about this would spread widely enough to prompt a national policy shift. Great to see that raising public awareness can actually do something![1] https://wwf.panda.org/?348371/Could-you-be-eating-a-credit-c..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a lot of misleading and false statements in this article.They claim plastic recycling doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s true that most plastic isn&#39;t recycled, but that&#39;s because of lackluster government involvement, not some technological barrier.British Columbia has the most sophisticated recycling equipment in North America. Two plants there first use lasers to identify different types of plastic (PP, HDPE, PET, etc) in the incoming stream and then use air blasts to categorize it.These streams are then separated by color. The material then goes to a plastics reclamation facility where the material is shredded, washed, dried, melted and forced through a filter, and turned to pellet.The result is that 74% of plastic beverage containers in BC are recycled. Why isn&#39;t this done elsewhere? It&#39;s because BC has a tax on plastic packaging, and this tax money is then used to subsidize the loss from converting recyclables into new plastic pellet (the cost is higher than the revenue). And other governments don&#39;t want to do it, partly due to lobbying from plastics packaging manufacturers.Plastic recycling does work when society wants it to. But instead we turn to paper. Paper produces double the CO2 emissions of plastic, and it requires vastly more energy: a European study showed that switching to paper in Europe would consume 57% more energy and 61% more greenhouse gases from packaging than are produced today. In a world where human existence is threatened most likely from runaway climate change, this seems like a bad idea.And while we&#39;re so focused on transitioning plastic packaging to paper, we ignore the real problem with plastic in the oceans: plastic netting dumped from illegal fishing. Plastic netting wraps around animals and drowns or suffocates them. It can also drag along a seabed, killing the seabed life.But this is considered a difficult problem to solve (international waters, policing is difficult, etc) so we ignore it.The idea policy would be:1. Tax plastic packaging. Use the tax money to pay for recycling that works, which has been proven to work.2. Develop international treaties and enforcement mechanisms to prevent illegal fishing and find ways to reduce fish consumption.3. Implement carbon taxes that reflect the cost to human survival imposed by any kind of packaging, or other activity, in accordance with the degree of GHG emission."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there are restrictions, I hope they target major microplastic sources like tires and textiles, rather than easily scapegoated but very minor sources, like plastic bags and drinking straws. Based on precedent, I am not holding my breath, but I hope so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this is the second or third time that I&#39;ve seen this browser hit the front page.  Each time I get a little more interested.The concern that I have is that there&#39;s going to be a learning curve to picking this up.  Normally, that&#39;s fine, but this is my browser.  I live in the thing and there&#39;s no other piece of software outside of my IDEs that affects my productivity more.  When I took the time to learn VIM a few years ago, retrospectively, I could have about spent half as much time learning it as I did and skipped a handful of things I don&#39;t use.  The tone isn&#39;t meant to be negative -- that 50% is tremendously useful and it&#39;s rare that I don&#39;t over-learn something (I enjoy it).I&#39;m hoping someone who uses Nyxt as their &#34;primary browser&#34;[0] might be able to provide their thoughts on any of my questions --I use VIM/VIM plug-ins, but Firefox; what&#39;s the experience of becoming proficient with Nyxt?Is there any tool/first-timer/quick-start that works better/worse for acquiring the muscle-memory?Outside of &#34;keyboard&#34; ... As a full stack web developer (various front-ends, mostly .NET web FWIW), what are the &#34;big reasons&#34; that I want this (killer app?)?  Put other ways: Are there any interesting &#34;one-liners&#34;[0] that solved real problems developing web-sites?  Is there any feature that is so amazing that you agonize over it not being available when you&#39;re not on your own hardware?Basically, I&#39;m trying to answer (for myself) whether or not it&#39;s worth the effort to explore integrating this into my work tooling, so I&#39;d love any other input.[0] I&#39;ve not used the product; I&#39;m referring to its programmability -- I can see its use (and do this, today, kludg-ily) -- but I&#39;m wondering if there are any use cases that were surprisingly &#34;magical&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a cool project that I have tried a few times in the past. To me, the big draw is that it is written in Common Lisp. I was a patron contributor for a while, but when I had problems building from source, I stopped. Interfacing Common Lisp to things like WebKit, GTK, or Qt to build Nyxt was probably the reason I failed building from source, IIRC.This is probably a bad analogy, but forty years ago Lisp Machine subsumed the operating system. In modern times, in some sense the web browser is like an operating system layer, or at least a portable application platform. So, my bad analogy is that Nyxt is like a Lisp Machine.If I have time, I will try to build from source today. I just reread the dev source install instructions, and it does look straight forward. Hopefully being on a M1 MacBook won’t affect the build process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Nyxt is web engine agnostic. We utilize a minimal API to interface to any web engine. This makes us flexible and resilient to changes in the web landscape. Currently, we support WebKit and WebEngine (Blink)."</p>
