								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like this idea, but when I go to the web page...&gt; Download the Font… and change the world!  By downloading, installing and/or using the font software, you confirm that you have read and agree to be bound by the terms of this End-User License Agreement...Sigh.  I guess I need to read that EULA.Anyway, clicking on that then downloads a pdf rather than a nice link to some web page text.  Sigh.So then anyway, trying to open that pdf then fails in the first two readers I tried.  Sigh.Why must everything in the world be so hard?  Fuck it, never mind.  I&#39;ll let someone else change the world and wait for widespread adoption for this font to reach me in whatever other ways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With a few tweaks (monospaced variant), it could make a great coding font.Coding fonts have essentially the same goal: make similar looking characters different: 1liI|, 0O, etc... Code naturally strains our visual acuity: we want to see as much as possible, it means that we may use a smaller font size than we would find comfortable reading text with. Single letter, punctuation, etc... can be really important, in regular text, you can understand even if you can&#39;t read all the characters. So a hyperlegible font can help coders, even those with good vision, and many coding fonts already have &#34;hyperlegible&#34; features."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be honest, what I love about legos is the free play aspect.When I play with my kids, (now 8 and 10), I find that the key thing is not what pieces we have (admittedly, we have a lot of pieces), or instructions, but developing some theme or challenge.The theme could be ‘space’ or ‘under water’ or ‘I’m going to build the taller possible leg structure’ or ‘I’m going to build a vehicle that can be blown across the floor with a fan.’  Once they have a theme, they will do amazing stuff.Also, I believe it’s important to have a big slush pile of pieces.  It’s amazing how much builds change when your are scrounging for piece X, and you see piece Y and think, actually…I see that this app is technologically interesting for the developer, but it doesn’t address my core problem: inspiring kids to get started on free creativity.  For that, I’d more like a Lego theme of the day app, maybe slightly inspired or guided by the kids ages or genders.  If I did that, I’d have the kids submit pictures of their results, and use those over time to assess and improve the quality of my suggested themes at different ages and Lego piles sizes (there is your AI, if you must).The pitch would be ‘inspire your kids to new creativity.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just tested it on my kids lego clone bricks; there are like 800 of them but they are almost exclusively basic shapes (1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 2x3, 2x4 and 1x4) in red/black/blue/green/yellow/gray. This is a picture of the box: https://static-v3.e-jumbo.gr/uploads/resources/137879/201611... ; you&#39;ll see they are exactly like legos.The app identified 400 pieces (of the 800) and unfortunately the resulting ideas were not possible to be constructed because it required pieces we don&#39;t have. Of the 50 ideas I was only able to construct 1 or 2 that had very few pieces.I tried it a couple of times with diferent layout in pieces or lights, nothing really changed.Sorry but it doesn&#39;t work, at least with my kind of bricks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very cool.Now what I want is something that will scan a pile of rocks and tell me how to put them together to build a wall with minimal space between them.https://media.istockphoto.com/photos/stone-wall-texture-pict...Or better yet, tell my robot how to do it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Death of Yugoslavia (1996) [1] [2]. Won the BAFTA and Peabody awards that year.It&#39;s a BBC documentary in six episodes about the conflict that caused the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the wars in the Balkans.It stands out among many documentaries for being a truly dispassionate moment-to-moment record of events. No sensationalism, no grand-standing, just the facts.If you&#39;re tired of the Netflix style of documentary — lots of talking heads quickly edited together for sound bites, dramatic music, re-enactments — then this is for you. Sadly, too few documentaries are produced in this style anymore.Edit: Looks like the episodes are on YouTube [3].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Yugoslavia[2] https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gfbpy[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj9Zw5fN3rE&amp;list=PLdw7wnKe0w..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“The Century of the Self” by Adam Curtis.https://youtu.be/eJ3RzGoQC4sIt goes through each decade of the 1900s and explains how Freud’s psychology and the new field of marketing completely reshaped society. For the first time in my life I feel like I understood the “why” of how things work in American society. This film is probably best if you’re age 40+ and actually remember some of the events."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This really is a one-click installer, which is excellent. As far as I know it&#39;s the first and only one for M1. It&#39;s quite a polished UI, but there are a lot of features missing. The first ones that come to mind are:- No way to specify a seed. This is an important part of SD workflows, letting you redo an image with a slightly tweaked a prompt.- No way to specify a custom model. Alternative models (such as Waifu Diffusion) are fun to play with too.- No way to generate batches of images.- No way to specify which sampler to use.- No way to adjust the weight of specific sub-phrases, or use negative weights.There&#39;s also no img2img yet, but it sounds like that&#39;s a planned feature.Other GUIs such as https://github.com/sd-webui/stable-diffusion-webui, https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui have many more features - but not all will be trivial to port to M1.P.S.: For the people asking - yes, it can do NSFW images. I checked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can confirm that this works great on the M1 Max. It has been taking less than a minute to run the model and generate the images. So far I have been really satisfied with the output. Let&#39;s please make one-click installers the norm for future technology. I love nerding out, but wading through dependency hell is not worth it most of the time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Diffusion Bee is the easiest way to run Stable Diffusion locally on your M1 Mac. Comes with a one-click installer. No dependencies or technical knowledge needed.Features:
- Full data privacy - nothing is sent to the cloud
- Clean and easy to use UI
- One click installer
- No dependencies needed
- Multiple image sizes
- Optimized for M1/M2 Chips
- Runs locally on your computer"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"http://ai is an interesting case. It was there from the early days of the web, back when you could type &#34;ai&#34; into the mozilla url bar and it would take you there. Today firefox &#34;helps&#34; you out and changes what you typed into something else because it knows better than you do what web site you want.It&#39;s run by a character named Vince Cate who moved to Anguilla to protest taxes or something. He was from the US and gave up his US citizenship. He talked the Anguilla government into letting him set up its internet infrastructure for them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Some have A records pointing to the root servers. I’m not sure why this is - I think it might be because no DNS has been configured in the TLD zone for these TLDs.I was also curious about this. It turns out that it&#39;s because dig interprets some TLDs as DNS record types (MD, MG, MR, MX) or DNS classes (IN and CH) of the same name! Not sure why, but when given only a type or class (without a domain name), dig actually queries for a list of the root servers, which explains the strange results. Looks like using the -q option to specify the domain name works around this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was responsible for the Turbo C (later Borland C/C++) run-time library in the late 80s and early 90s.Tanj Bennett created our original 8087 floating point emulator. It was real mode, 16-bit code, that kept an 80-bit float in five 16-bit CPU registers as a working value during its internal math calculations. If you ever coded for the PC you will appreciate just how precious register space was on the 8086/8088.It&#39;s been a few decades and my memory is fuzzy but I don&#39;t recall any critical places where the registers had to be saved and restored. He choose math algorithms and code paths specifically to keep all five live at all times. Tanj&#39;s code flowed with an economy of motion that brought to mind the artistic performance of a professional dance troupe. I did not have the math skill and could not have ever created it as he had. It brought me genuine pleasure just to read his code.Eventually, it came time to port it to 32-bits (real and protected modes.) I wrote new exception handlers and replaced the instruction-decode logic with a nice table-driven scheme but did not touch the core math library. It still ran in 16-bits under the hood exactly as Tanj designed it.Tanj, if you happen to see this, I have fond memories of your emulator. It was beautiful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nobody has mentioned Knuth’s corpus of work in Pascal-Web for the TeX ecosystem. This is code written for an era where there wasn’t an ecosystem of libraries for common tasks and even things like being able to access a file in random access order couldn’t be counted on. Even 7-bit ASCII couldn’t be counted on as a given (EBCDIC-based IBM mainframes were a significant element of the computing landscape still).Against all that, Knuth wrote code that could be ported to other systems (I first used TeX on an IBM mainframe running VM/CMS, then later on a VAX minicomputer running VMS, then on a PC with DOS, PC with OS/2, PC with Windows and now a Mac with OS X/MacOS. His presentation of code and internal documentation intermingled is something which I could see still being useful now, although sadly, literate programming seems all but dead now. I still go back to Knuth’s code to understand how to solve some problems on occasion even though it’s about 30 years since I last wrote a line of Pascal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Postgres code is very good, redis as well. Some of the core parts of Linux also totally worth learning from.I also remember how Qt UI code and docs were a revelation after the nightmare of win32 and related frameworks.Bellard&#39;s original Tinycc was very entertaining and took a while to digest.Most old and well-maintained projects are worth learning from.Apart from some local tips and tricks what is more important is understanding that there&#39;s nothing special about other people&#39;s code."</p>

Pretty much sums up what rich people think about technology: make it sexy and powerful but I don&#39;t want to hear about ongoing maintenance costs.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find really amazing is that we have here an incredibly elite service that the vast majority of people will never be able to afford, and yet its elite clients are dependent on essentially the same mobile devices that everyone else is. You can spend ~$2k on a phone, and it will be the best phone you can buy. There&#39;s no $20k phone that will be any better.It&#39;s like flying in first class and then having to queue up in the same immigration line as everybody else - except in that scenario you can pay your way into a priority lane.True, ~$2k is still a lot for a phone, but it&#39;s within reach of so many more people than the gatekept world of private banking and jets.This is not a comment about wealth disparity - it&#39;s about goods which seem to resist the impact of wealth disparity; where there is a relatively low upper bound on how good of a thing you can buy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a road cyclist commuter, I find that the most aggressive motorists tend to also be in larger vehicles. Whenever I&#39;m taking the lane to attempt to prevent an unsafe pass, it&#39;s almost always the driver of a large truck that will still execute an unsafe pass anyway (forcing oncoming traffic to take evasive action) or will tailgate, rev their engine, yell out their window, and/or wiggle back and forth in apparent frustration and intent to intimidate me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Using three separate identification strategies we show that, controlling for own-vehicle weight, being hit by a vehicle that is 1000 pounds heavier generates a 40–50% increase in fatality risk. [...] We consider two policies for internalizing this external cost, a weight-varying mileage tax and a gas tax, and find that they are similar for most vehicles. The findings suggest that European gas taxes may be much closer to optimal levels than the US gas tax.In an environment of wealth inequality, this seems like another way that the wealthy can benefit: easily afford to drive heavier vehicles that increase their personal safety while increasing the lethal threats against the poor.How about instead: if larger vehicles are more dangerous for the population overall, then they should be banned for everyone, not only effectively off-limits to the poor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like heavier cars being a separate license or an endorsement on your existing car license is a sensible idea. They have very different handling characteristics, and it&#39;s pretty noticeable a lot of their drivers lack the skill required to operate them safely.I mean the idea that you can sit your license test in a subcompact and then go out and drive a 4 door high displacement ute/pickup truck is pretty absurd on the face of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh hey HN. This is in the Caddy 2.6 beta already: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/releases/tag/v2.6.0-bet... - please try it out!Thanks to Marten Seemann for maintaining the quic-go library we use. (I still haven&#39;t heard whether Go will add HTTP/3 to the standard library.)Caddy 2.6 should be the first stable release of a general-purpose server to support and enable standardized HTTP/3 by default. HTTP versions can be toggled on or off. (Meaning you can serve only HTTP/3 exclusively if you&#39;re hard-core.)PS. Caddy 2.6 will be our biggest release since 2.0. My draft release notes are about 23 KB. We&#39;re looking at huge performance improvements and powerful new features like events, virtual file systems, HTTP 103 Early Hints, and a lot of other enhancements I&#39;m excited to show off on behalf of our collaborators!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Caddy in a 3 node HA cluster sharing an anycast bgp address for about 18 months now and it&#39;s been fantastic.  Certs &#34;just work&#34; across the cluster once consul is wired up.  I recently added IPv6 which also &#34;just works.&#34;greenpau/caddy-security is fantastic and &#34;just works&#34; for OIDC sso.mholt, thanks for recently adding the ability to bind to multiple specific IP addresses by default, this help me conserve precious public IPv4 addresses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for a great piece of software that I use every day in production and just works.At first I was scared of how stupid simple it is. It feels like web servers are supposed to have giant config files with a hundred mysterious knobs to twiddle. Now I always default to Caddy, and have yet to find an instance where it didn&#39;t fit my needs. Congrats."</p>
