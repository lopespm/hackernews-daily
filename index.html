								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d add to this list:Chunk extensions. Most people know HTTP/1.1 can return a &#34;chunked&#34; response body: it breaks the body up into chunks, so that we can send a response whose length we don&#39;t know in advance, but also it allows us to keep the connection open after we&#39;re done. What most people don&#39;t know is that chunks can carry key-value metadata. The spec technically requires an implementation to at least parse them, though I think it is permitted to ignore them. I&#39;ve never seen anything ever use this, and I hope that never changes. They&#39;re gone in HTTP/2. (So, also, if you thought HTTP/2 was backwards compatible: not technically!)The &#34;Authorization&#34; header: like &#34;Referer&#34;, this header is misspelled. (It should be spelled, &#34;Authentication&#34;.) Same applies to &#34;401 Unauthorized&#34;, which really ought to be &#34;401 Unauthenticated&#34;. (&#34;Unauthorized&#34; is &#34;403 Forbidden&#34;, or sometimes &#34;404 Not Found&#34;.)Also, header values. They&#39;re basically require implementing a custom string type to handle correctly; they&#39;re a baroque mix of characters &amp; &#34;opaque octets&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun Fact: When http first came out and was hidden in Academia, there were no headers. Then the need for metadata was realized and second-system syndrome took over to create a bunch of crazy headers. My favorite odd-ball header is &#34;Charge-To:&#34;https://www.w3.org/Protocols/HTTP/HTRQ_Headers.htmlThis is not a custom X- header but an official header. Also Email: and some other odd headers were standardized at that time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been searching for a while for a good way to know whether a client has disconnected in the middle of a long-running HTTP request. (We do heavyweight SQL queries of indeterminate length in response to those requests, and we&#39;d like to be able to cancel them, rather than wasting DB-server CPU cycles calculating reports nobody&#39;s going to consume.)You can&#39;t actually know whether the outgoing side of a TCP socket is closed, unless you write something to it. But it&#39;s hard to come up with something to write to an HTTP/1.1-over-TCP socket before you respond with anything, that would be a valid NOP according to all the protocol layers in play. (TCP keepalives would be perfect for this... if routers didn&#39;t silently drop them.)But I guess sending an HTTP 102 every second or two could be used for exactly this: prodding the socket with something that middleboxes will be sure to pass back to the client.If so, that&#39;s awesome! ...and also something I wish could be handled for me automatically by web frameworks, because getting that working sounds kind of ridiculous :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Its really wild, as a person coming from other languages who has written maybe ten lines of C in his life that the functions that seem to be massive footguns in C are, like, &#34;format a string&#34; or &#34;get time in GMT.&#34;  That&#39;s... really scary."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To respond to some of the comments.It is not that there is anything intrinsically wrong with these functions. You can technically use all of them and I have been using all of them, safely, for decades.The issue is they are huge traps to the point that in a larger piece of software one can say &#34;well, it&#39;s just not worth it&#34;.You can go much, much, much further than that.In couple embedded projects I worked some of the rules were:* dynamic allocation after application has started is banned -- any heap buffers and data structures must be allocated at the start of the application and after that any allocation is a compile time error,* any constructs that would prevent statically calculating stack usage were banned (for example any form of recursion except when exact recursion depth is ensured statically),* any locks were banned,* absolutely every data structure must have size ensured, in a simple way, beyond any reasonable doubt,etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be nice if the error messages generated would suggest replacement functions that they deem appropriate.  I see that I&#39;m not supposed to use gmtime, localtime, ctime, ctime_r, asctime, and asctime_r; but what do they think I should use?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s an anecdote about what happens when you design a product in the opposite way.I own https://www.executeprogram.com, which has interactive in-browser courses on various software development technologies. Currently they all cover languages, more or less: TypeScript, SQL, various JS topics, regexes. (Disclosure: it costs money after you finish your 16th lesson.)Almost all (maybe literally all) of our competitors are amenable to binging. It&#39;s true of books, video learning platforms, and most/all other interactive learning platforms.Execute Program is very intentionally non-bingeable. When you start a course, you get 5 lessons on the first day, then it stops you and tells you to come back tomorrow. On the next day, you get some brief reviews of yesterday&#39;s lessons, then a few new lessons, then it stops you again until the next day. That cadence repeats until you finish the course. You can&#39;t binge/cram even if you want to.(A bit more technical detail: it&#39;s a spaced repetition system with exponential review intervals, similar to those used for language learning in e.g. WaniKani and Anki. But it also has a lot of fine-grained knowledge of its own course structure, so it can use reviews to intelligently unlock different lessons depending on how the user performed on their reviews.)Occasionally, we get support email from new users who don&#39;t like this. They want to cram a whole course in a day. But cramming is a very time-inefficient way to learn, so this is self-defeating! Since launch, we&#39;ve had good success adjusting the app&#39;s behavior and internal explanations to reduce these complaints.However, we still get emails from long-term users who appreciate the time limitations. Generally these fall into two categories:1. Users like that an enforced break before the reviews provides tangible evidence that &#34;yes, I genuinely understood yesterday&#39;s lessons&#34;. If we allowed cramming, that reassurance wouldn&#39;t exist; it&#39;s too easy to succeed at a review when you just finished the lesson 30 seconds ago.2. Users like that the usage limits remove a source of anxiety and worry. You do your reviews and lessons, you finish, and then you wait until tomorrow. There&#39;s no temptation to think &#34;I really should&#39;ve done 10 lessons today instead of 5; I&#39;m so lazy&#34;.It&#39;s still possible for a very dedicated user to do all of our courses in parallel within their first monthly billing cycle. (Median course start-to-finish time is 8-18 days depending on the course.) So this scheme doesn&#39;t make users pay us more than they would otherwise. And they&#39;re spending the same amount of wall-clock time that they&#39;d spend if they crammed all of the lessons in one day. That makes it pure win: they memorize the topics more deeply, they worry less, and they get those benefits for no extra time expenditure. The only exception I can think of would be people who think &#34;I must get exposure to all TypeScript syntax and semantics before tomorrow morning, even if that significantly reduces my ability to remember what I learned.&#34;Obviously I&#39;m very biased here, and the goals that we&#39;re optimizing for don&#39;t even exist in most other product spaces. But I thought it would be nice to have a counterexample to &#34;engagement at all costs&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t like the current trend of social media apps burying users under push notifications, calls to action, and other engagement hooks.However, there&#39;s a second, parallel problem adding fuel to the fire: The more we talk about overindulgence in social media (or Netflix, or video games, or fast food) as an act perpetrated by evil corporations on us helpless individuals, the less sense of individual agency we give ourselves. I&#39;m not suggesting that we let social media companies off the hook, but battling this problem is going to require more than simply shaming them in Medium posts. We have to start reminding people that they are in control of their decisions, and that they can take steps to reduce their social media usage to healthy levels.I know the common refrain is &#34;Delete Facebook!&#34; but that&#39;s the equivalent of abstinence-only education. We need to start talking about how to configure Screen Time on iOS, or how to use Facebook&#39;s built-in tools to hide content you don&#39;t want to see. We also need to encourage people to take control of their feeds, muting users and topics who draw them into unproductive discussions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A tangential point about the horrifying power of euphemism: I&#39;ve done some consulting work with some large biopharmaceutical companies in the past and found myself consistently shocked at how effective euphemism was at making people comfortable talking about, and doing, very questionable things. E.g. &#34;Maximizing treatment&#34; = &#34;extend how long a patient requires our medication&#34;. This was at a senior level and these were, on the face of it, warm, caring people having a very comfortable and open conversation. I had always assumed decisions that directly disadvantaged the consumer would look different, with some sense of secrecy or at least awareness. Nope, one level of language abstraction is apparently all it takes.There are countless other examples out there. I just finished &#34;Cruel Britannia&#34; regarding the torture practices of the British over the last century. They were particularly adept at it. Euphemism is such a powerful tool for doublethink and systemic abuses of power."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Please do. Had to go up to full gigabit down with xfinity to get 35 up. Next highest was 15 I think? Not that you can figure that out easily - their website doesn&#39;t list upload speeds. Or maybe it does - the website is terrible to navigate, slow and I got 404s off their main internet landing page.Anyhow at the risk of this turning into a multi page rant about comcast I&#39;ll cut back to upload speed. I see it as upload is for creation and download is for consumption. What do the cable companies want people to be doing?If you look at the popularity of twitch/youtube/(things I&#39;m too old and unhip to know about) it is a direct threat to cable/traditional content creation. I&#39;d wager the current state of affairs holds a lot of people back from getting into content creation, especially poorer/larger families who have to share a limited connection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My local broadband provider admitted to me that they could offer symmetric 1 gig service, but are choosing not to.  The current max a residential customer can purchase is 1 gig down, 25Mbs up.  The monthly non-discount rate is $180, with $110/month possible with certain promotions.  It is an extra 10$/month to go from 20Mbs up to 25Mbs.  Starlink is doing well here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in South Africa. Myself and all my friends are sitting on around 100 Mbps up/down uncapped unshaped, no fair use policy each at around $100 USD monthly. A few of my friends are on Gigabit down, 200 up.How is America behind on this? Everything is hosted there and cached there. Is it big business lobbying politicians to prevent them from having to compete? In South Africa we have dozens on ISPs and as an economy we&#39;re probably not far off from one US state. The competition has been great for consumers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of my pet meta-theories about Hacker News is that the frustration expressed over several apparently different stories really has a single source: Hacker News likes the internet of 10-20 years ago a lot more than the average person.One place this shows up is a frequently-expressed sentiment that the internet is a less magical, less weird, and more corporate place than it was 10-20 years ago. Part of this may be because SEO has diluted the voices of individual creators. But part of it is also because way more average, everyday, tech-unsavvy people are on the internet now.Another example is the periodic highlighting of somewhat garish HTML-based websites. I like these too! My own personal website falls in this category! But as far as I know, the generic internet user likes the generic slick-graphics-and-whitespace style, and so go the websites that want to attract them.More relevant to the topic at hand, many comments in this thread argue that targeted ads are unnecessary for a functional internet, since the internet of 20 years ago seemed to work just fine without targeted ads. But, again, it&#39;s less clear to me that general internet users -- that is, mostly people who never experienced the internet of 20 years ago -- have the same preference.It&#39;s funny, because I&#39;m to a large extent on HN&#39;s side on this one. But my enthusiasm is tempered by my sneaking suspicion that the other side is a lot bigger, and my side is actually powered by more elitism and nostalgia than I thought."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This captures my feelings on the issue:&gt; That framing is based on a false premise that we have to choose between “old tracking” and “new tracking.” It’s not either-or. Instead of re-inventing the tracking wheel, we should imagine a better world without the myriad problems of targeted ads.I don&#39;t want to be tracked. I never have wanted to be tracked. I shouldn&#39;t have to aggressively opt-out of tracking; it should be a service one must opt-in to receive. And it&#39;s not something we can trust industry to correct properly. This is precisely the role that privacy-protecting legislation should be undertaking.Stop spying on us, please."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fully agree with EFF here, and what&#39;s most frustrating is that Google could actually be on the side of banning tracking, and win big over Facebook.Google had a fully working, very lucrative business model in search term based ads. You search for &#34;office rent Arizona&#34;, and Google shows you ads about offices in Arizona. No privacy violations.There was no other problem with search term based ads except that Google wanted to pump up shareholder value faster than what that could give them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now this part is getting a little too carried away.  It is one thing for libraries and bookstores to decide not to offer for borrowing or sale things that they disagree with.It is another (and overstepping imo) for Ebay to restrict individual people from selling to others goods that are not illegal or in violation of their other practical rules (no selling jewelry, monetary equivalents, etc).This falls into the category of taste / political opinions and has gone too far too quickly.  Much as I don&#39;t like what the silly cartoons are, and of course while I don&#39;t think Ebay is a public forum that has any obligations (they can do what they want), I think Ebay is getting in deeper than it should.Will they apply the logic here to all categories of goods for sale?  T-shirts?  Political buttons?  Historical political pamphlets?  Current political pamphlets or campaign material? How about baseball team merchandise that has racist mascots?  (Why haven’t they?)  Merchandise of companies where the CEO may have bigoted views?How about books that have words in them that discuss race, or in any way describe an unflattering picture of a certain group?  Or scientific studies that may come to race-based findings?I think the other thing that bothers me is that to be protected by such measures, you have to be popular.  And it&#39;s flimsy.  This year it&#39;s &lt;x&gt; group, next year that group is forgotten and it&#39;s on to &lt;y&gt; group.   Woe to the actually wronged group of people who can&#39;t garner enough popular support, and who fall by the wayside of laws that are less enforced because people thought the social-media driven justice system took care of it.Ps. And edit just to add, lest someone discount my opinion as from a privileged position, I am among one of the groups said to be portrayed in a racist way in those books. If only people’s concern about racism in cartoons extended to more important matters as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know any culture that banned books independent of their content that people didn&#39;t regret in the future.A few months ago I was reading about schools banning the book &#34;To Kill a Mockingbird&#34; because it contains basically the &#34;n&#34; word. I&#39;m not american, and and havent read that book. I watched the movie, through, and it seemed to me to be a very anti racism message.I think instead of banning, schools should work provide  context to kids and teens that read this books, of how society was when they where written, so people don&#39;t forget the past, but are able to make better decisions to the future."</p>

The deliverables will also include all technical data related to the tooling needed...&#34; It&#39;s clear they don&#39;t have the technical data.Here&#39;s how this can happen: the government asks for proposals, and the prospective contractors say &#34;we&#39;ll create it for you for cheaper if you don&#39;t require the technical data &amp; its related rights&#34;. The government program manager (PM) is under a lot of pressure to &#34;get it cheaper&#34;, and this is cheaper in the short term, so the government PM agrees. The PM will be around for a few years, then leave. Later on, the contractor is the only one who can make the parts (because they&#39;re the only ones with the technical data &amp; the technical data rights to do it). The government procurement system is all about competition, but now there is no possibility for real competition. Thus, the parts will cost 10x or more, and the government PM who approved this is long gone (probably with a promotion), and the contractor is happy with incredibly large profit margins.I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s what happened in this case. But it&#39;s very very possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reverse engineering seems like a good skillset for the DoD to nurture, anyway. Yes, the US is going to be at the cutting edge of weapons design at least through the medium term, but the leadership isn&#39;t arrogant enough to think that all engineering innovations will come domestically. If the US acquired a next-generation Chinese fighter, wouldn&#39;t it be handy if someone had the expertise to tell you exactly how its parts were made and machine replicas if needed?So, the tinfoil hat interpretation of this story would be, of course the Pentagon has the original blueprints in quintuplicate, but it&#39;s identified reverse engineering as a key strategic advantage China has over the US (pretty reasonable so far, right?) and has announced this as a way to shuffle some money into building up domestic RE expertise in the defence industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US nuclear weapons program had to do something similar in the 2000&#39;s with a material known as Fogbank. This is used in the W76 warhead as an interstage material, and they needed more of it to keep the weapons in operational state.Unfortunately, they&#39;d forgotten the manufacturing process, decommissioned the plant that made it, and the people that knew how to do it weren&#39;t around any more. They figured it out, but it doesn&#39;t necessarily look easy to do (nor does the material seem easy at all to make in the first place).https://www.armscontrolwonk.com/archive/201814/fogbank/p20 here says more: https://www.lanl.gov/science/weapons_journal/wj_pubs/17nwj2_...Edit: I somehow missed this other thread in this story, despite a search: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26334367"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Your whole blog resonates deeply with me. All this corporate grifting and women&#39;s empowerment months will do jack shit until we figure out how to make workplaces and lives more equitable for mothers and allowing for gaps, breaks and destigmatizing time off for parents of both genders.Instead, we talk about how sexism is the biggest problem. Sure, sexism might be annoying, but in the west, it is hardly something that creates a genuine barrier for women.Startups have it worst, and everday I count the number of years I have to work in the high stress places I want or do a startup if I want to have two kids before 35. No one talks about planning around fertility. When I mention it to someone that I want to take time off for a couple years to have children in silicon valley, they look at me as if I&#39;m an alien. As if wanting to be pregnant and not working at the same time as being sleep deprived and wanting to spend time with my own baby when they are at their youngest is some strange outlandish fantasy.All careers are built this way. PhD to tenure, startups, generally high stress professions. I wish the world wasn&#39;t so male centric, that feminists actually cared about finding structural solutions instead of forcing women to become copies of men to achieve gender parity. But they care more about power than actual equality where we acknowledge that women have different needs and desires, that those needs and desires are equally valuable and not inferior to desires men have, that the two genders have different strengths and capabilities and it is equally important to reward both. And maybe not wanting to outsource your baby to a nanny during their most vulnerable years is not a heretical thought.I wish we had more focus in allowing people to transition back from taking a few years off to raise young kids, and it wasn&#39;t automatically assumed that you would be a worse founder or professor or software engineer just because you have 2-4 years you didn&#39;t commercially work. Hell, I want to take that time to contribute to open source, something I don&#39;t get to do much usually and I&#39;m looking forward to it because I am willing to face the  consequences. But I wish more women could be less scared of their career prospects for choosing to have children."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree completely with the premise that most people don&#39;t appreciate just how fleeting fertility can be, but I think rather than freezing eggs, the solution is for people to normalize having children at a younger age and designing work and home life around children existing and even being present in certain work contexts.Obviously freezing your eggs is something that you can do as individual without society&#39;s input, and my preferred solution is a cultural overhaul...But economic productivity is only useful insofar as it leads to better lives for people, economic activity that increases well-being by one unit is pointless if it requires us to spend more than one unit of well-being (by say, freezing our eggs and not becoming grandparents until we&#39;re 80) to achieve it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not so sure freezing eggs is sound advice.Lord Winston, who is professor of fertility studies at Imperial College London, warned that it was &#34;a very unsuccessful technology&#34; and said: &#34;The number of eggs that actually result in a pregnancy after freezing is about 1%.&#34; He later clarified he was referring to live births.https://www.bbc.com/news/health-51463488#:~:text=Lord%20Wins....“It’s not like I would discourage egg freezing. Women should be doing it because it’s the best option they have, but it is not an insurance policy,” says Christos Coutifaris, past president of the ASRM and a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania. “Insurance policies usually guarantee a payoff. In this case, there is no guarantee.”
