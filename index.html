								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve found the reason (I think) 90% of the world&#39;s semiconductor-grade neon production is concentrated in one country. Per this German government whitepaper about the noble gas industry: the USSR massively overinvested in neon capacity in the 1980&#39;s, in order to build space-based excimer laser weapons. Ukraine&#39;s extant plants date (probably) to the 1980&#39;s; they&#39;re responsible for a global oversupply that&#39;s persisted since the Cold War.- &#34;Neon was regarded as a strategic resource in the former Soviet Union, because it was believed to be required for the intended production of laser weapons for missile and satellite defence purposes in the 1980s. Accordingly, all major air separation units in the Soviet Union were equipped with neon, but also krypton and xenon, enrichment facilities or, in some cases, purification plants (cf. Sections  5.4 and 5.5). The domestic Soviet supply of neon was extremely large but demand low.&#34;- &#34;Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, global crude neon production was approximately 500–600  million  l/a  (=  500,000–600,000 m3/a).  It  was dominated by far by large-scale air separation units associated with metallurgical combines in Russia and Ukraine. Simultaneously, demand was estimated at around 300 million l/a (cf. Section 4.2). In the years between 1990 and 2012, therefore,  most crude  neon was not  purified, but  released into the atmosphere, because there was no customer base.&#34;https://www.deutsche-rohstoffagentur.de/DE/Gemeinsames/Produ... (chapter 5.2)For context, this would have overlapped with Energia/Buran&#39;s launch of the Polyus weapon (which was a megawatt CO2 laser).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How is neon extracted and why does one country have a 90% monopoly (in this specific grade)?edit: Found this C&amp;EN story from 2016 that adds context:- &#34;Chip makers, which account for more than 90% of global neon consumption, are already experiencing high prices and some shortages stemming from the Russian conflict with Ukraine, Shon-Roy says. The war, which started in 2014, interrupted global supplies of the gas, about 70% of which comes from Iceblick, a firm based in the Ukrainian city of Odessa.&#34;- &#34;Iceblick gathers and purifies neon from large cryogenic air separation units that supply oxygen and nitrogen to steelmakers. Most of the air separation units equipped to capture neon, which makes up only 18.2 ppm of the atmosphere by volume, are in Eastern Europe.&#34;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cen-09410-notw7This is puzzling to me, because I don&#39;t get why air separation should naturally concentrate in exactly one place. It&#39;s not tied to a rare and localized geologic formation, like helium sort-of is.Also there&#39;s cryogenic air separation plants all over the planet, why don&#39;t they do neon too? (Asking in the spirit of curiosity)edit #2: I&#39;ve just found something that offers a possible explanation and it&#39;s far more interesting than I expected:- &#34;Neon was regarded as a strategic resource in the former Soviet Union, because it was believed to be required for the intended production of laser weapons for missile and satellite defence purposes in the 1980s. Accordingly, all major air separation units in the Soviet Union were equipped with neon, but also krypton and xenon, enrichment facilities or, in some cases, purification plants (cf. Sections  5.4 and 5.5). The domestic Soviet supply of neon was extremely large but demand low.&#34;https://www.deutsche-rohstoffagentur.de/DE/Gemeinsames/Produ...

Ukraine accounts for 7% of the world&#39;s wheat.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/17/infographic-russia-...This conflict will affect 1/4 of the world&#39;s wheat which will affect food prices.In 2010 Russia stopped exporting wheat due to wildfires burning their fields (most likely caused by climate change). This caused a hike in food prices which helped trigger the Arab revolutions in 2011.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Russian_wildfires"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in downtown Kharkiv, Ukraine right now (SaaS founder born in Canada). Woke up to explosions at 5 AM this morning. At 12PM still some explosions, can feel the ground shaking, but the streets are mostly calm. Went out to buy some groceries, long lines, but everything still works. Police cars are out patrolling in full force, but no signs of unrest. Church bells tolling nonstop. TransferWise is limited to $200 USD transfers but it worked -- Apple Pay worked at the grocery store. Obviously internet and electricity is still up for now, but water pipes have been shut off in many of my friend&#39;s places."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From a philosophical stance, this is history repeating for the same basic reason. 2022 AD and risk of war is still the same as it was in 1022 AD, or 22 AD. That reason is the accumulation of power (or by proxy, wealth) in a small set of individuals, or in this case one person. No realtime access to information changes this; it just makes the story of the horror unfold faster.Persisting with the concentration of power in individuals has shown throughout history to have dire consequence. We continue risking civilization on the mental health of those who already show significant issues with their obsessive clammer for power. The cult of the leader is toxic and, as far as I can see, illogical and lacking evidence for benefit.Where are the voices that seek a structured shift away from personality cult politics? The innovation we all need for the future are those voices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a weird place to be where I can watch a war unfold on television and have live geotagged curated material laid out on a map on my computer.  It&#39;s amazing and depressing at the same time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m genuinely curious at what point a bully threatening you with MAD can be stopped if you value the existence of your own civilization?Say Russian conquers all of Ukraine and moves troops to the Polish border and parks some tanks a bit inside. What then? Strongly worded essays? If Russia isn&#39;t raining hell on Poland, then NATO is forced to .. apply sanctions, make threats, but take no action since the escalation and outcome, MAD, is not an acceptable trade for a tank crossing your border.Repeat until arrival at French coastline. The terrorist steps forward waving a trigger to a bomb and either you show him your bomb and threaten to blow yourselves both up, or you step back.At some point, the only option is to call the bluff and give him a good punch and hope that he values life as much as you and won&#39;t actually detonate. It has to be a solid one but not so hard as to make him think you might kill him, as that would make the detonation a certainty.I don&#39;t know that NATO has the guts to give Putin that bloody nose."</p>

But this is such a bad suggestion. Instead of fixing the default to be safe, and possibly having a _unsafe_but_fast() variant for the places where it makes sense they want to keep the broken version and require user to explicitly opt in into safety.Same as the infamous PHP mysql_real_escape_string (don&#39;t make the mistake of using mysql_escape_string!) [2][3] or whole host of C stdlib footguns like strcpy/strncpy [4].The default, easy, obvious option should be safe.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m trying to understand how this linked list works --    struct list_head {

If we are walking iterator-&gt;list-&gt;next ... how do we get the pointer of the next enclosing foo struct?  Are they doing pointer arithmetic to get the beginning of the struct from the list field offset and casting it to foo?Ah -- That does seem like what they do:    #define list_for_each_entry(pos, head, member)              \
        for (pos = list_entry((head)-&gt;next, typeof(*pos), member);  \

            pos = list_entry(pos-&gt;member.next, typeof(*pos), member))

    #define list_entry(ptr, type, member) \
         container_of(ptr, type, member)

    #define container_of(ptr, type, member) ({          \
         const typeof( ((type *)0)-&gt;member ) *__mptr = (ptr);    \

     struct foo = { x };       // not allowed in C89
     int bar[3] = { 0, x };    // ditto

Chances are the kernel does this because, I think, it&#39;s also a GNU89 extension."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was during an online rapid tournament. So still very impressive, but Magnus loses games online all the time and I&#39;m not _quite_ sure why this is news.It is interesting which junior players Magnus invited to the tournament, though - besides Praggnanandhaa, there&#39;s also Andrey Esipenko, who _did_ beat Magnus in a classical game once at the prestigious Tata Steel Masters 2021, and also Nodirbek Abdusattorov, who beat Magnus late last year en route to becoming the World Rapid Champion at 17 years old. A fun group! With Vincent Keymer in the mix too, you&#39;re only really missing Nihal Sarin and (of course) Firouzja for many of the future faces of chess.[Edit: the article says that Praggnanandhaa is the youngest player ever to beat Magnus since 2013, which would definitely be newsworthy. I think the article must be leaving out important context, since this tournament is (1) online, (2) speed chess and (3) not FIDE rated, so it typically wouldn&#39;t be included in records, and Magnus has almost certainly lost random online games to younger players before. I&#39;m guessing the article is referencing some other source without providing the relevant criteria, which is why it looked a little weird to me.]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is noted in another comment, but it should be a top level comment... Magnus actively has COVID and has said that it was affecting his energy levels and ability to calculate during the early rounds of the tournament (during which this game happened).And Pragg wasn&#39;t even the lowest rated player to beat Magnus this tournament! Eric Hansen, aka popular chess streamer &#34;chessbrah&#34;, is even lower rated and also beat Magnus, which again you would not expect if Magnus were playing his usual level.So still a great win and great accomplishment for Pragg, but a little context would have been nice in the article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even Prags coach pointed out [1], let&#39;s not get carried away. This was a great achievement but the pressure this creates can be very bad for him in the longer run.[1]: https://mobile.twitter.com/Rameshchess/status/14964993222462..."</p>

It also means you can&#39;t watch them without handing over your phone number to Google, because it seems it&#39;s no longer possible to create a YT account without a phone number.This whole thing makes NewPipe a lot less useful than it used to be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does this or Vanced help with the problem I have: my kids are being brainwashed via Google&#39;s algorithms?More specifically, I hate that when they watch YouTube it is pushing really shitty content on them.Is there a way with either of these apps to filter out things I don&#39;t want them to watch, or perhaps even have a list of things I only want them to watch?I don&#39;t think my kids would notice if they couldn&#39;t get Ninja Kidz and their spammy Walmart plastic crap they are always shilling to my kids."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"NewPipe is great but it breaks quite frequently due to the use of unofficial YouTube APIs. I tried to get my girlfriend on it because she was annoyed by all the ads but it kept breaking every month. Vanced is nice but a weakness for both is that they can&#39;t support casting on a non-jailbroken device (and I suspect the issue won&#39;t be solved by jailbreaking)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This thread is mostly full of jokes, and that&#39;s cool. But more seriously I&#39;m exactly the kind of person I suppose this is meant to appeal to. I&#39;ve spent the last 2-3 decades breaking into systems. Many of these systems comprise what the US calls &#34;critical infrastructure&#34;. That&#39;s pipelines, power generation, transmission, distribution. Air traffic control systems. Government agencies.I&#39;m based in the US. The problem is that the US, unlike Russia, will not simply agree to allow attacks against foreign targets so long as its suits their strategic purposes. And I suppose that&#39;s for the best. In the meantime, myself and people like me simply aren&#39;t going to risk our entire careers to retaliate. I suppose if we felt strongly enough we would&#39;ve joined the NSA and done this legally. I wish Ukraine the best and hope our &#34;official&#34; hackers are doing their best to assist or will be unleashed soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m Ukrainian activist for 10+ years, have been on Maidan, etc, know many other activists.Unfortunately, we have not seen understanding with any government.
Looks like, all people who got to government or state organizations, work on classical totalitarian scheme - &#34;for friends all the best, for all others - severity of the law&#34;.
Mean, system is so much disbalanced, that any government got totalitarian power and does not account on people. And laws are created, to make all people offenders, and with very wide possibilities of interpretation, so state officials and their friends become above law.If you really want to help Ukraine, better to contact volunteers-entrepreneurs, who where on Maidan, and who struggle for economic freedoms, and support Ukrainian army as private persons, without government/state.You could just donate, or you could create some business opportunity, so Ukrainians will make business, export working hours, or export some products to world.Business opportunities much better, because Ukraine now have critically huge dependence on Russian market, close to 50% of all trade, need much-much more export to world.Thank You!"</p>
