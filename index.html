								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is profoundly insightful.I have been searching for patterns and insights in this field for 25 years.  What 
 apenwarr concludes is true:    All we need is to build distributed systems that work. That means decentralized bulk activity, hierarchical regulation.


The problem is, everyone wants distributed systems that require everyone else to agree (global consensus), which is literally impossible (see: CAP theory, and what happens when Partition occurs).  There&#39;s another word for &#34;require everyone else to agree&#34;: Tyranny.Fortunately, the entire universe and everything in it works without global consensus, just fine (for various definitions of &#34;fine&#34;).There is also methods for building computational distributed systems that work &#34;fine&#34; in the face of CAP failure:https://holo.hostThis is a serious breakthrough.  And we really, really need this, NOW.Just to whet your appetite, here&#39;s some high-level observations on how these breakthroughs may affect our lives, in the area of Money: https://perry.kundert.ca/range/finance/holochain-consistency..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"* Everyone seems to increasingly be in it for themselvesI was fortunate to have had a career with mild autonomy to help other team members even if it was slightly out of my job description. But this only happens in a shared office environment where you can see when someone is falling behind or overhear a problem. That physical presence also creates a bond with co-workers that&#39;s often more powerful than the corporate mission.But working from home for the past years I feel like I mercenary working among mercenaries. Working with people that have never met and will never meet and for whom work isn&#39;t about the mission or the customer. If I get work done early, I now just call it a day. Why bother with ad-hoc testing, documentation, checking in on that new hire, proposing a conference paper, investigating technical debt, etc. It&#39;s liberating but it&#39;s also depressing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I strongly believe that money itself has been corrupted lately, this then causes all number of bad flow on effects to happen. A massive shift happened when central banks started getting involved in direct purchases of various asset types and we started to see a major distortion happen in monetary policy that which has distorted the functioning of money itself. For example who would care if their business is completely unprofitable if it could get access to freshly printed money every quarter to prop it up. What then happens to all the other businesses who don&#39;t get access to that freshly created money? When we have situations like the BoJ owning more than 60% of the Nikkei 225 we really ought to be asking some serious questions about if we really have free markets? We also should be asking some questions about the properties we desire in money itself. If a central monetary agency can go about unconventional monetary policy such as purchasing equities we can quickly have a situation whereby an unelected group of bureaucrats can damages the ability of money to be used as a means to convey information. Further there&#39;s questions about picking winners and losers that comes up there too. As a whole I think people need to ask what money is again and have some serious conversations about what money and the monetary system should be. It seems that these difficult questions really fell out of favor a while ago and as a result things have been drifting in a direction that many people aren&#39;t comfortable with.If we don&#39;t ask these questions then technological approaches to money, like various cryptocurrencies and other financial technologies are unlikely to actually cause long lasting improvements. We have some serious monetary policy problems in the world right now and while some tech could help (in some cases) these aren&#39;t primarily technological problems."</p>

You use yaw to rotate your monitor away, toward the hallway or window."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I prefer to work with a single large external monitor. If my device is a laptop I keep it in clamshell mode when attached to an external monitor. I find switching applications with keyboard shortcuts and focusing on one thing at a time has improved my productivity. Using two or more monitors made it so easy for me to get distracted. To each their own though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"fools begone.The ideal monitor rotation --the one that secures the most favour on HN-- is a slow 1-2 centimetre per second continuous orbit about the office in 2 dimensions on a tracked rail.  This in turn ensures that one may not only glorify their monitors rotation, but also glorify their practice of standing whilst working instead of sitting.  The movement --which rotates as well amongst its own Z axis-- also promotes good evangelical proselytization of the many woes of desk sitting, for example, that ten million people die per second for not standing at the lectern as a fourteenth century pork belly clearinghouse clerk.At days end then the monitor should be guided into a velvet sack, and stored gently atop a layer of old Haskell parchments that it may succor inspiration at the next stand-up which is conducted standing, as our christ lord intended."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regardless of your opinion on piracy, I think Google (and ISPs) should not moderate search results.Basically, search engines are used to find things publicly available on the internet, policing should be done on the actual hosts of the content.Same goes for ISPs, they are here to provide access to publicly available computers, without interfering with the content or accessibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google already acts upon DMCA requests, delisting sites if requested. They add a small note to the end of their results to inform you if the page should normally have had more search hits.So this raises so many questions. Has _no party_ requested to delist TPB under DMCA?!That sounds incredible if true. But the only explanation I have for Google feeling like they need to go this far, delisting on their own initiative! It&#39;s like a scenario that should never have to happen, and something they should never do either.So what&#39;s going on here?Update: Ugh, editorialization... Apparently court has been involved here and while Google may not be individually targetted and forced YET, so &#34;voluntary&#34;, it&#39;s easy to see how Google see the writing on the wall and choose to comply. No point in fighting this with such a clear cut DMCA violation. But in this case I&#39;m still surprised it took this long!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google Search itself is now a threat to the open web. Forget Chrome.Google willingly interferes, in a heavy-handed way, with both search suggestions and search results, with both Google Search and YouTube. Just try to look up any topic on YouTube, and you&#39;ll have to get past the hundreds of mainstream media channels covering the event, before you actually find the original video. They artificially promote &#34;authoritative sources&#34; which are anything but, since they may be second-hand coverage of original videos that get buried in search results.Google&#39;s results are not only manipulated by clever SEO people[0], but by employees[1], in direct contradiction to Sundar Pichai&#39;s sworn testimony. Some of that is very defendable. But there&#39;s zero transparency. Given their search monopoly, and that most people aren&#39;t aware that search results are manipulated, Google Search is the web. Websites that get delisted are presumed to have ceased to exist. Focusing on browsers (Firefox) is good, but no longer enough.That&#39;s why Google Search itself is now a threat to the open web. Switch to other engines. DuckDuckGo, Brave Search are the ones I trust, and there&#39;s tons more.[0]: how many times have you tried looking for a machine&#39;s user manual, mistyped the model number, and somehow &#34;found&#34; a webpage with the manual for a product that didn&#39;t exist? and then modified the model number further and found more results from the same website, with relevant keywords and yet another incorrect model number? My understanding of SEO isn&#39;t good enough to know how they do that. I don&#39;t believe websites can dynamically alter their index to show up for so many typoed search queries.[1]: https://medium.com/@mikewacker/googles-manual-interventions-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason to block the merger is pretty straightforward:1) Nvidia designs expensive chips and sells them by the millions. [1]2) ARM designs cheap chips and sells them by the billions. [2]3) Nvidia&#39;s &#34;normal&#34; product departments are incentivized to prevent ARM from competing with Nvidia&#39;s expensive chips, in various ways. This would hinder ARM&#39;s innovation and growth opportunities vs being independent.I am glad to see this motion to block the merger, for the sake of a competitive market for CPUs, GPUs, etc.[1] https://www.techradar.com/news/nvidia-hits-new-highs-in-gpu-...[2] https://www.tomshardware.com/news/arm-6-7-billion-chips-per-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Strategically, why wouldn’t the US gov’t want a US company owning ARM? Why is the FTC pilling on to block this? How would I, as a consumer, be harmed by a graphics company owning an instruction set and design specification?Stopping two US companies from merging because it would create a monopoly and negatively impact US consumers is one thing. But this isn&#39;t even remotely the case here? Doesn&#39;t the US government get more tax revenue if Nvidia makes some extra dough charging royalties for that IP? I’m confused."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the most megalomanic thing I&#39;ve ever heard of. ARM has high chances to be both the next x86 and the most common embedded architecture. While at the same time Nvidia GPUs are already the de facto standard for GPU computing. So Nvidia would have monopolies in 2 verticals. No reasonable and competent antitrust commission could ever allow that - although probably everyone was betting the latter wasn&#39;t the case..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think Facebook (meta)‘s key asset is now WhatsApp.Facebook is practically dead. It’s just a stream of awful content that isn’t from your friends. It’s hyper advertising and desperate attempts to clone other platforms as it slowly dies. It’ll continue for a long time, eventually becoming yahoo like, but young people do not care about it at all.Instagram has similarly been over monetised but in an earlier stage. It has been roundly defeated by TikTok, utterly destroyed by TikTok, in the battle for teens’ attention.Oculus was a great buy but the gap (in terms of years) between instagram’s peak and oculus really coming online is just too wide to “save” the company.In contrast, WhatsApp is still used across the generations. It’s the one platform where grandparents and grandkids are both active users.If I were Zuck then I’d focus on turning WhatsApp into an Asian-style chat platform with integrated services. That I can’t wire money on WhatsApp in the U.K. is I think a very very big strategic error on his part.It seems clear Facebook (meta) can’t build anything truly new, but they can certainly extend platforms - they should focus on WhatsApp. It has longevity, strong network effects, and huge potential. Just don’t use ads and destroy it.Otoh Facebook deserves to die so I hope he continues to think oculus will save them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook aside you really see this across the board on almost any platform, that once the product reaches it&#39;s 1.0 stage, (where it is good, does what the users want it to do, and has realised its vision) it begins a process of gradual decay, as the focus of the product managers (now panicking to find some statistics to improve to show their bosses) shifts from &#34;building functionality&#34; to &#34;increasing engagement/retention/active users per month&#34;.Whatever product it is, whether a social media platform or an online learning platform, it will slowly be zombified into an attention sucking machine, whose goal has now become to keep you interacting with the app as much as possible (using ML and DL of course).I mean, Twitter now sends me daily notifications that a person I follow made a random tweet (wasn&#39;t this the purpose of the news feed?), Udemy now has a notification service and an inbox that fills up with automated messages that are just a &#34;welcome to the course&#34; message. Everywhere I look, the pattern is the same, Product is good &gt; Product adds social features &gt; Product attempts to cluster user activity and make recommendations based on social features.We, as in the IT industry, need to come up with a culture or methodology of &#39;declaring a product complete&#39; whereby all product managers are gracefully allowed to move on and a product is put into a state of stasis, where bugfixes and the occasional relevant feature is built. If a product was not designed to show intelligent recommendations, use gamification or become a notification dashboard then that should be bared from ever appearing in its Backlog.I&#39;m deeply worried about the long-term effects of an industry that is booming by sending sending some of our brightest minds to scale the economy of distractions Or to innovate Ad-tech.I really hope we&#39;ll look back at this age with the same wisdom-fuelled disgust we have when we look back at the early industrial age. Where smog factories were built in the middle of cities and dusty kids were shovelling coal. We lack any sort of foresight wrt. the digital economy we&#39;re building. Maybe one day we&#39;ll find a healthy alternative to make software-products users love.But until then, seldom are the days where I do not look at the internet with such savage despair."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand Instagram language. My GF uses it. It is full of digital influencers, people who make money because they are digital influencers. Young people with sometimes funny but generally pointless and most often ridiculous dancing moves to an equally ridiculous repetitive song. People buying expensive things, doing idiot things talking about uninteresting details of the uninteresting lives of equally uninteresting people...I don&#39;t understand the hypnotic effect it has."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What we&#39;re seeing here is one of the wealthiest countries in the world with a population of &gt; 80M people crumbling over a few thousand ICU patients because of long-standing issues that were never addressed.The staffing problems in hospitals (and nursing homes) have existed much longer than Covid. I heard a lot about them myself when I did my FSJ (volunteer work) back in 2004, and it&#39;s only gotten worse since then. Our government is in full CYA mode, and doing everything they can to blame a scapegoat for problems they themselves have willingly created over decades. It&#39;s despicable, and nobody should support it.FSJ is a year-long volunteer program for young people typically organized and funded by NGOs like the Red Cross and similar. I worked with small children, plenty of the other volunteers I met regularly worked in hospitals and nursing homes. They all talked at length about how atrocious the working conditions were and how they were asked to do things they weren&#39;t legally allowed to (e.g. taking blood, handing out medication) because the staff shortages were severe enough that people didn&#39;t have enough time to adhere to very reasonable safety rules anymore. That was 17 years ago.This is a well known, widely publicized[0] and not at all new problem, and the unvaccinated are not to blame for it. Let me repeat, we&#39;re talking about one of the wealthiest countries in the world with a population of 83M people crumbling over a few thousand ICU patients.[0]Some random articles from 2018/19 (German):https://gesundheit-soziales.verdi.de/themen/mehr-personal/++...https://www.tagesspiegel.de/politik/wenn-aus-notstand-panik-...https://www.zeit.de/politik/deutschland/2018-05/pflegenotsta...https://www.rbb-online.de/kontraste/ueber_den_tag_hinaus/bil..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a double vaccinated German, I am very disappointed and angry about this move.Our politicians have failed to prepare the country for the Winter (who could have known...). We lack a basic strategy how to cope with Covid.And now they try to fix this by dividing the country in two. This will have no effect whatsoever on the infections, it will just continue to drive a divide that is already existing and will make anti-vaxxers even more convinced that this is a big conspiracy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If we were a serious society, then the conversation would be about:immune vs non-immunehigh risk vs low riskinfectious vs non-infectiousBut no, it&#39;s jabbed vs unjabbed. It doesn&#39;t make sense. Everyone in Germany who wants the vaccine has had it, and if you&#39;ve had Covid, you&#39;re about as protected as the vaccinated. Furthermore, leaky vaccines don&#39;t prevent transmission, can&#39;t eliminate the virus (animal reservoirs) and may even make it more virulent. See Marek&#39;s disease: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15757475/ https://www.nationalgeographic.com/science/article/leaky-vac...This is not a rational, science-based policy. This is about punishing the non-compliant, mostly the under class. As the upper class continues with their events surrounded by masked servants, with endless examples of officials breaking their own rules. Worse, we are normalizing the dehumanization of a group of people who we&#39;re told are diseased and dangerous and it&#39;s all their fault. Germany of all places should be absolutely allergic to such rhetoric."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ex-Ubiquiti employee here. Nick Sharp wasn&#39;t just a senior software engineer. He was the Cloud Lead and ran the whole cloud team. His LinkedIn profile will confirm it. This is why he had access to everything.Nick had his hands in everything from GitHub to Slack and we could never understand why or how. He rose to power in the company by claiming to find a vulnerability that let him access the CEO&#39;s personal system, but nobody I spoke to ever knew what the vulnerability was. I discussed this with another ex-Ubiquiti person in an old thread [1] Now I&#39;m positive he faked the security issue as a power move, just as he faked this attack for extortion purposes.He would also harass people and use his control over Slack and GitHub against the people he didn&#39;t like. Many people left around this time partially because Nick made everything so difficult at the company. What a terribly depressing series of events.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26694945"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always been fascinated by the idea that intelligence lies within a spectrum. Someone might be incredibly smart about a narrow topic or field, yet be blind to their own stupidity within another realm.To me, this seems like a classic example. To quote the press release: &#34;During the execution of that search, SHARP made numerous false statements to FBI agents, including, among other things, in substance, that he was not the perpetrator of the Incident and that he had not used Surfshark VPN prior to the discovery of the Incident.  When confronted with records demonstrating that SHARP purchased the Surfshark VPN service in July 2020, approximately six months prior to the Incident, SHARP falsely stated, in part and substance, that someone else must have used his PayPal account to make the purchase.&#34;This man was a senior developer yet this quote sounds like it comes from a nine year-old. Not to mention &#34;hire a lawyer, don&#39;t talk to the police&#34; has always been pretty solid advice.He now faces significant prison time, and the strong potential for a dismal life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mr. Sharp is apparently not so sharp. He carried out the attack from his home network. He connected directly for enough time that his bare IP was logged. The rest of the time, he carried out the attack using a commercially purchased VPN solution that was trivial to trace back to him via the purchase record. He lied to the FBI. (I have yet to understand why people talk to law enforcement instead of staying silent so as to not implicate themselves.) And, for no apparently good reason (meaning, there&#39;s no claim of him shorting the stock), after the raid, he seeded fake news that drove the company&#39;s stock down 20%."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back when Edgeium was new and just Chrome but with a lot of Google cruft removed, I actually used Edge instead of Chrome when I was on Windows. It was the same browser with some additional tweaks that I quite liked.Then Microsoft started this aggressive, disruptive push to bring it to iOS Safari&#39;s level as the only browser people should use.I don&#39;t know any good operating systems for normal people anymore. Windows 10 and 11 are hostile, macOS only runs on very expensive hardware and doesn&#39;t run most programs people need (because the business world is still Windows oriented) and Linux has been making progress but still isn&#39;t a good alternative for the common user unless they have an expert to rely upon when something breaks down. ChromeOS doesn&#39;t run on most devices (it can, but the images aren&#39;t available) and I wouldn&#39;t recommend a Google-oriented OS to most people anyway, if they can avoid it; Android is bad enough already.I miss the Windows 7 days. The Win10/11 kernel may have seen loads of improvements, the UI and basic behaviour has only been regressing for many years now. The Windows 11 window snapping is nice but it doesn&#39;t excuse the aggressive spyware that comes with the OS, and neither does it excuse this antitrust lawsuit in waiting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I heard some people having a decent time with Edge in the past with some features implementations. Not that I would use it myself, but I&#39;m firmly convinced these childish plays only ruin whatever good work was done on it. Who on Earth would continue using a browser that has such hostile behavior and dark patterns all over the place e.g., buy-now-pay-later at browser level?It&#39;s so hard to trust Microsoft anyway, I&#39;m glad 11 is such a tranwreck dead on arrival. Makes it easier to discourage people from using it, ever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Microsoft Edge runs on the same technology as Chrome, with the added trust of Microsoft.&#34;They named their user tracking, telemetry, and &#34;Buy Now, Pay Later&#34; add-ons &#34;trust&#34;?  That&#39;s really Orwellian."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a super cool blog post. However I think it alludes to a much larger problem. For many products today, it’s very difficult or impossible for most people to verify the product works.For a network switch, there are free and open source tools like iPerf to test and verify speeds are as advertised. For a faraday box, you have to go through all these steps (and knowledge learned) just to be able to test these. What about for vitamins, or pet food, or any other “durable” products that are supposed to last for X years?In an age of snake oil salesmen, paid for reviewers, and fraudulent products on Amazon, there is a real opportunity for creating systems that enable individuals to verify products do what the sellers claim they do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like Snowden&#39;s recommended Faraday cage for phones or other devices of similar size: two drink-shaker cups[1].Drink shakers are cheap and widely available. The average hotel room in any medium/large hotel chain probably includes a shaker as a standard item as part of the minibar. The simple two-cup style (as seen in [1]) is preferred over the fancier &#34;strainer top&#34; style because you can press the two cups together; this should cause the inner cup to slightly cut into and/or deform the outer cup along the circle where they join together. The seal between the cups should work sort of like the  knife-edge seals used in vacuum chambers.A metal box or conductive bag is only a Faraday cage if it is fully closed/sealed. Any imperfection in the seal or hole[2] might allow the radio signal to leak out. Most improvised items (freezer, random metal box, etc) have poor seals. Making a high quality cage that actually block a modern phone can be done without much trouble, but the drink shaker method is the only method I know of that will do the job using widely available (free) or very cheap ($10-ish?) parts.[1] https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HLB1yRyhXZTxK1Rjy0Fgq6yovpXaZ/Win...[2] Holes of sufficient size. How big are the waves you are trying to block?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At my former job we had a rather large faraday cage for testing telco equipment. Two things surprised me: 1) It is more fiddly to ensure a room-sized faraday cage doesn&#39;t leak RF than I thought.  It is really easy to make mistakes that compromises experiments. 2) There was a bath-towel sized piece of cloth that came with one of the expensive Rohde &amp; Schwarz instruments that was astonishingly effective at blocking signal.So I mainly used the room because that&#39;s where the magic blanket was - which was easier to use than ensuring the room was set up correctly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ha, yes, I&#39;ve done that at https://gigablast.com/ .
The biggest problems now are the following:
1) Too hard to spider the web. Gatekeeper companies like Cloudflare (owned in part by Google) and Cloudfront make it really difficult for upstart search engines to download web pages.
2) Hardware costs are too high. It&#39;s much more expensive now to build a large index (50B+ pages) to be competitive.I believe my algorithms are decent, but the biggest problem for Gigablast is now the index size. You do a search on Gigablast and say, well, why didn&#39;t it get this result that Google got. And that&#39;s because the index isn&#39;t big enough because I don&#39;t have the cash for the hardware. btw, I&#39;ve been working on this engine for over 20 years and have coded probably 1-2M lines of code on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The consistent theme every time this comes up is that dealing with the sheer weight of the internet is almost impossible today. SEO spam is hard to fight and the index gets too heavy. However, I wonder if this is a sign that we&#39;re looking at the problem wrong.What if instead of even trying to index the entire web, we moved one step back towards the curated directories of the early web? Give users a search engine and indexer that they control and host. Allow them to &#34;follow&#34; domains (or any partial URLs, like subreddits) that they trust.Make it so that you can configure how many hops it is allowed to take from those trusted sources, similar to LinkedIn&#39;s levels of connections. If I&#39;m hosting on my laptop, I might set it at 1 step removed, but if I&#39;ve got an S3 bucket for my index I might go as far as 3 or 4 steps removed.There are further optimizations that you could do, such as having your instance not index Wikipedia or Stack Overflow or whatever (instead using the built-in search and aggregating results).I&#39;m sure there are technical challenges I&#39;m not thinking of, and this would absolutely be a tool that would best serve power users and programmers rather than average internet users. Such an engine wouldn&#39;t ever replace Google, but I&#39;d think it would go a long way to making a better search engine for a single user&#39;s (or a certain subset of users&#39;) everyday web experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Natural Language Processing is a pox on modern search engines. I suspect that Google et. al. wanted to transform their product into an answer engine that powers voice assistants like Siri and just assumed everyone would naturally like the new way better. I can&#39;t stand how Google is always trying to guess what I want, rather than simply returning non-personalized results solely based on exactly what I typed in the textbox.While that may be good for most people, there is still a lot of power and utility in simple keyword-driven searches. Sadly, it seems like every major search engine has to follow Google&#39;s lead."</p>
