								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ah, the simple life...My grandfather would take me along and we&#39;d go to the neighbour to fetch eggs. He had a plastic bucket that he put them in with some old newspapers scraps in the bottom. I heard that before the war they didn&#39;t even need money. He&#39;d simply bring a bucket of milk, and he&#39;d get a bucket of eggs in return. But it was of course a lot simpler to bring money. It was far cheaper than in the store too.My grandfather knew what all the birds were singing. Every bit, plus their behaviour. He&#39;d especially heed the magpie, because it&#39;s a smarter bird. If it warbled this way, it meant that the weather would stay warm. If they warbled in another way, it meant that it might become rainy. He said that the birds knew, because their lives depended on it.Another more commonly known sign is dependent on where the magpie makes its nest. If it it&#39;s high in the tree, then it will most likely be a warm and sunny summer. But if it is tucked way down in the tree, the summer will be cold and wet. It makes sense. There&#39;s more protection from the elements further under the leaves, but it&#39;s also colder there. If I were a magpie, I&#39;d want to make a warm and nice nest for the summer, but all that could be ruined if I didn&#39;t heed the weather.One day, the grouse was seen perching atop the family house. When I told this to my grandmother, she went silent at first, and then she told me that it means someone will die in the family. This was of course terrifying news to me. But it also turned out to become true, because my grandfather also died that year. May he rest in peace."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;This valley is cut in the shape of my heart&#34;. I&#39;ve known farmers like him, bachelors who are mild mannered and love their lives and the extended family that comes with living an entire life in one valley. He maybe goes to Sunday service for socialization and the local pub to watch the game, and as long as his sheep are healthy and the sky does what it promises (because he knows the day before always if it will rain), the peace he feels is the result of being in place, of not creating too much fuss, the satisfaction of seeing the stone walls he built in his 20s holding strong and knowing they&#39;ll be there long after to tell his story. He leaves behind him more of a legacy than many of us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happiness - he&#39;s found it.Sure, he&#39;s an extreme and very few want to emulate it because there&#39;s a mild element of delusion. But, he&#39;s found the thing so many of us work our entire lives for only to never find.Part of life is letting happiness find you, part of life is finding happiness, and part of life is pushing away things to find happiness in what you have.I say, well done."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi! I&#39;m recently working on a portfolio website simulating macOS using React and tailwindcss. The style is between macOS Big Sur and Catalina (in another word, I picked out and combined my favorite parts from these two versions).Here&#39;s the link to website and Github:Website: https://portfolio.zxh.ioGithub: https://github.com/Renovamen/playground-macosI appreciate any feedback or suggestions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First thing that came to my mind when I opened this: hey let&#39;s test if maximization is just as broken as in real MacOS. And oh my god it is indeed! Safari won&#39;t maximize to the entire screen, just like in the real thing, and other apps like the terminal maximize correctly. Wow, this level of attention to detail is really crazy! :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can even open the website recursively within its own &#34;Safari&#34; window. The recursion depth seems to be limited to one though. Nice easter egg nonetheless.Edit: It&#39;s possible to bypass the recursion limit. First open the &#34;Blog&#34; bookmark on the Safari start page. Use Inspect Element on the &#34;portfolio&#34; link at the top right, and remove    target=&#34;_blank&#34;

from the HTML. Open the portfolio and enjoy infinite recursion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What I find the most fascinating is that a single person, possibly with the help of a few select others, is able to curate, index, host, and serve 85% of scholarly literature[0] which otherwise would be inaccessible to many.80 million papers are available on Sci-Hub to its half a million daily users.[1] That is around 80 TB of data, and 2 TB of daily outbound traffic.[2]Given the fact that Sci-Hub has achieved all those whilst being forced to operate under the radar, I have massive respect for Elbakyan first and then all the others that have helped it survive. Not only Sci-Hub is an undeniable disruption, but also an amazing technical feat that many startups would envy.[0]: https://greenelab.github.io/scihub-manuscript/[1]: https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https...[2]: 3 articles × each 2 MB × per 400k users ~ 2.4 TB.P.S.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure I understand the concept of paid access to scientific research, so I&#39;d be grateful if someone with more knowledge of the topic could explain it to me.Governments fund universities, people donate large amounts of money to universities, and a large portion of the population has student debt because of how expensive tuition is. Why are they charging for access to research at these institutions then?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like she&#39;s been in hiding since 2015[0]:&gt; Following a 2015 lawsuit brought in the US by the publisher Elsevier, Elbakyan remains in hiding due to the risk of extradition; Elsevier was granted an injunction against her and $15 million in damages. Elbakyan and Sci-Hub were again involved in a US lawsuit in 2017, this time with the American Chemical Society. ACS sued the site for copyright and trademark violations, and conversion. Later that year, the court ruled in favor of ACS, fining Sci-Hub $4,800,000 in damages, enjoining further infringement, and prohibiting search engines and domain name registries from &#34;facilitating access&#34; to Sci-Hub.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandra_Elbakyan#Creating_Sc..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Small business near me never seem to have online catalogues or stock levels.Hunting for a specific product (for example a washing line) might involve walking into 3 different shops and guessing which shop might sell what you need.  When you arrive in the shop, they always arrange aisles differently so unless you have 20 minutes to hunt you might not find it either.Whereas online it&#39;s a simple search and click &#34;buy now&#34;.  It&#39;s probably cheaper too.Bricks and mortar shops need to do a lot of work on the shopping experience before they&#39;re competitive.   The only time bricks and mortar shops win are when I need something right now or groceries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’d be happy to support local merchants, but they have to get the overall value proposition somewhat competitive. For the most part, they aren’t. Maybe it’s pricing, selection, policies, hours of operation, or some combination, but other than grocers and large chains, I’m not even sure they’re trying.Amazon is winning by serving the customers. Local shops will continue to have a hard time if the primary value prop is “we’re more expensive and not as good, but we’re your neighbor, so you owe us!”I try every so often to use a local shop. Maybe I need a common appliance, lawn mower, or small engine part. If they have it on-hand, I’ll pay 5x the online price to get the job done today. I can only recall one time where that worked. “We can get it for you” only to find out that means a week and 4x the online price. “No thanks; I don’t want to be a bother...” &lt;tap, tap, wait 2-3 days, done&gt;Our dishwasher door broke last Thursday; I fixed it in 30 minutes that Saturday afternoon with a $30 part I ordered on Thursday. Don’t even know how long it would take to setup a $150-200 repair appointment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a really good idea! I love my small businesses but being coddled by the internet is so real, you get used to immediately finding exactly what you want. With local stores, you have to put in some work sometimes, and ghasp talk to real people, potentially a few, at different stores, to get what you need. It sounds like a lot written out like that, but the important bits are that the people you talk to, you learn things from, and that makes you better at finding things.This tool is kind of like that effect, or an easing into it from someone who may have just bought the first-worst thing on Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Their tactic of degrading ux when you don&#39;t give them permissions has been happening for a long time.Accounts in WhatsApp have a username, but if you don&#39;t enable contact permissions on your phone, they will only display the contact phone number in the conversation list view. The username is there if you click into their profile from the chat, but WhatsApp wants to punish me instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great, I will eventually uninstall it when they make me. I only keep it around to deal with people that haven&#39;t switched to Signal or Telegram yet. I have all three on my phone. Whatsapp usage has dropped a lot lately in my circle of friends. I removed Facebook Messenger ages ago (nobody I know uses that anymore). Just like the Facebook app and instagram. Whatsapp is the last bit of Facebook software on my phone.I&#39;ve been watching this corporate stupidity train wreck play out over the last few months. Every time I open whatsapp I get an obnoxious dialog urging me to pretty please accept their T&amp;Cs. I click it away because I can. The fact that I can amuses me because it signals a certain amount of despair by Facebook. It&#39;s not normal for an app to be usable without accepting the terms and conditions.The dilemma Facebook has is the very real problem that people are opting to uninstall rather than accept. Their users are angry and disgruntled. Which is why they are allowing people to use the app without accepting the terms and conditions. Which is of course highly unusual. From a legal point of view, until I agree, the old T&amp;Cs apply. Basically they are saying those were actually fine and nothing really changed and it&#39;s all cosmetics but bla bla bla could you please accept the new ones anyway. It&#39;s a very weird position to take legally.Either the old T&amp;Cs were fine and there never was a reason to change them or the new ones materially change the old T&amp;Cs and they should just state in plain language why and how. Instead we get this months long weaseling that is no doubt partially inspired by the fact that they are under a lot of scrutiny by authorities in the EU and US for privacy violations, monopolistic tendencies, data leaks, etc. The real issue is that the new T&amp;Cs are of course designed to carve out some legal wiggle room there for Facebook to do user hostile things like ads and tracking. So they are in fact a change and they need users to swallow that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been clicking the X everytime i get the popup for a few days now. I haven&#39;t really thought much about it or actually read it yet. I honestly fucking hate WhatsApp and wish I could convince the few people i talk to on there to use something else, even SMS. I&#39;ve tried, yet they always message me through WhatsApp. They&#39;re not people i can really ignore either.Anyway, i guess this is mostly a rant. But fuck WhatsApp, they actually manage to somehow be worse than Facebook messenger. At least messenger let&#39;s you appear offline."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly the more appealing aspect than the &#34;await $`cmd`&#34; syntax is that it imports a bunch of handy libs by default.For some reason there&#39;s just something that rubs me the wrong way about having a bunch of requires at the top of a bash script (or cluttering my package.json with handy tools I use once in a script). But you&#39;re gonna want things like (promisified) fs, os, chalk, readline, node-fetch, etc quite a lot of the time.Definitely wish they&#39;d included shelljs though; almost strange not to.I hope they add (or already have) syntax highlighting as .mjs without the file extension (just the shebang) for GitHub, VSCode, etc."</p>

Apple always does what is in the best interest of Apple. Everything else is just marketing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The following was posted on Macrumors. Definitely not a perfect user-first response from Apple, but didn&#39;t seem terrible either. Particularly because Apple wasn&#39;t the source of the issue, the issue was people downloading an unofficial XCode tool not made or hosted by Apple. Apple discovered it (just like many researchers did) and made various (non-perfect) efforts to mitigate it. And according to Macrumors, the attack did not really lead to any serious consequences. Not sure if that&#39;s true but I haven&#39;t seen any evidence to the contrary either.&gt; Apple did ultimately inform users that downloaded XcodeGhost apps, and also published a list of the top 25 most popular apps that were compromised. Apple removed all of the infected apps from the  App Store , and provided information to developers to help them validate Xcode going forward.&gt; XcodeGhost was a widespread attack, but it was not effective or dangerous. At the time, Apple said that it had no information to suggest that the malware was ever used for any malicious purpose nor that sensitive personal data was stolen, but it did collect app bundle identifiers, network details, and device names and types."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As for why anyone would download this &#34;counterfeit&#34; copy of Xcode (quoting from TFA):&gt; XcodeGhost billed itself as faster to download in China, compared with Xcode available from Apple. For developers to have run the counterfeit version, they would have had to click through a warning delivered by Gatekeeper, the macOS security feature that requires apps to be digitally signed by a known developer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a huge milestone for the Starship team and SpaceX, so massive congratulations.This was also fun to watch. Fun in part because while SpaceX had it on &#34;tape delay&#34; the enthusiast channels were showing it live. It will be fun to have them do it without the low cloud cover but I&#39;m guessing that without the disassembly at the end they may have some on-board recordings that are recoverable.To whomever does telemetry for these things, the frequency bands you are using are blocked by clouds. It makes it hard to keep a live signal. Ask the FCC for a temporary operating permit for 900Mhz or so. You will be much happier with the results.I was paying close attention to the area of &#39;heat shield&#39; tiles. That is the next really big hurdle. If you recall getting the grid fins on F9 to survive re-entry was a big challenge. Getting tiles that don&#39;t break because the various expansion coefficients don&#39;t match is a big challenge as well. That is critical to having enough fuel left over to stop when you get back down inside the gravity well.It is easy to forget the scale of this thing without visual cues but its like flying skyscrapers around. They are very big. And the booster will be larger still.Also super curious how the lunar lander version will work. That is awfully high up there, could be a long ladder down to the surface. That, and given its mass, means that when it lands on the moon the dust it kicks up will hit escape velocity[1] which will be interesting.All in all though, so much progress in space after so much non-progress. Quite the thrill![1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12312"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the previous tests Spacex used 2-3 rocket engines for the initial landing burn.For SN15, the rocket used 2 engines throughout the landing procedure. I wonder if this is a sign of their confidence in the improved design.The landing was smooth as butter and nothing went noticeably wrong, although I did noticed that the rocket landed dangerous close to the edge of the concrete pad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In old days people used #ifdef to compile things out so that the &#34;production code&#34; doesn&#39;t have any unnecessary branches. I was shocked when I first saw these living if()s in the server-side C++ code but then realized it was vital for debugging in production.People also used to prefer table based jump over long if-else-if chain for anecdotal performance reasons. That has gradually changed over the evolution of CPUs with various optimizations like the branch prediction. Now some JIT impls like tracing JIT replace virtual function calls with if-elses.By the way, I&#39;m glad that the article is so thoughtfully written that it doesn&#39;t include any ambiguous &#34;best practices&#34; at the end. It could have created yet another myth. The three top tips in the article is more about stating facts. I admire the author taking that stance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great article, just to add one thing: conditional branches can seriously mess with the compiler&#39;s ability to optimize, especially the ability to auto-vectorize. So even if a never-taken branch is more or less free when the CPU executes it, just having it there might have resulted in much less efficient codegen. Just another thing to keep in mind with this issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a pretty amazing analysis that answers questions we probably all had as newbie programmers before realizing that code readability mattered more than efficiency 99.9% of the time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"* The documents were not classified, they were export-controlled.* Honeywell voluntarily reported their violations.I was an ITAR Empowered Official. What they did was bad, especially in light of the fact that at least one other time they got nailed for something I would consider a willful violation, but this isn&#39;t on the order of disclosing the manufacturing secrets behind a turbine blade or the composition of various coatings on the F-35.That $5M likely goes into web-based training hell for all their employees, where they spend a few hours clicking through a refresher on ITAR and various export control acts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The headline is true but suggests a far more sinister implication than what is actually going on.A few things that need to be taken in context here.- The materials in question were sent to China, Taiwan, Canada and Ireland.- As others have mentioned, Honeywell sent commercially-available schematics to the above countries, not classified information. The article mentions that Honeywell sent parts relating to the engine, this could literally just be a valve or bearing component. I doubt this kind of information is usable unless you have a ton of additional documentation describing their function and utility as a sub-assembly.- Honeywell reported this themselves. A bunch of articles on this topic use the phrase &#39;Honeywell admits...&#39; as if this was some kind of smoking gun.The knee-jerk reaction claiming that Honeywell has committed treason or something like it is unreasonable. Methinks incompetence from the sales department is to blame here rather than malice.See Reddit threads discussing same topic:https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/n5vglg/honeywell...https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/n5tcqg/honeywel...https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/n4gwma/honeywell_...https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/n5n1jc/honeywell_admi...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; All together, the materials pertained to the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, the B-1B Lancer long-range strategic bomber, the F-22 fighter, the C-130 transport aircraft, the A-7H Corsair aircraft, the A-10 Warthog aircraft, the Apache Longbow helicopter, the M1A1 Abrams tank, the tactical Tomahawk missile; the F/A-18 Hornet fighter, and the F135, F414, T55 and CTS800 turboshaft engines.All that amounts to $13M in fines, $5M of which Honeywell is allowed to spend? Yikes."</p>
