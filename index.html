								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"E Ink is a great example of how the patent system stifles innovation.One company developed a small, expensive, newspaper-quality electrophoretic display with a refresh rate so terrible it was only suitable for books, decided that that was good enough, and 15 years later every comment in this thread is looking forward to finally seeing some innovation in this space &#34;once the patents expire.&#34;That is some first class bullshit. We could have had large form, glossy brochure quality displays with video refresh rates by now, but nobody outside of China wanted to get anywhere near this patent minefield."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a 13.3-inch Dasung e-ink monitor, and use it daily for three to six hours (basically, whenever I use my PC). Some days ago the HDMI cable it came with broke, so before I had the opportunity to replace it, I had to switch back to an LED monitor for the time being. Well, surely anyone can already guess what happened... After just a couple of days, I came upon a long forgotten enemy: eye fatigue. Blurry vision, trouble focusing it, and a light headache.Like many others here, I wish the technology could have advanced faster and been made more accessible for everyone. Without the obstacles it still faces, I&#39;m sure we would already have color screens with a good refresh rate. C&#39;est la vie."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like the breakthrough here is in making a large (bigger than e-reader-sized) e-paper display available as a self-contained, HDMI-compatible monitor instead of just a display assembly for OEMs and experienced DIYers.While I don’t expect this to also be a breakthrough in terms of pricing, hopefully it starts driving the volume that will eventually make this type of display more accessible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s no intentional or manual effort at Google to promote pinterest.Pinterest shows up because they understand how the Google algorithm works and built their website to display all the signals that Google looks for in relevant image content.They understand user intent and generate URLs that present content in a way that google expects to see.Examples of how they do this from their engineering team:https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/demystifying-seo-wi...More:https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/tagged/seo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related: in the last several years, there started appearing these StackOverflow mirrors. It&#39;s gotten to the point that you can&#39;t google a programming question without running into at least one. Some copy the questions and answers verbatim, some use machine translation to (crappily) translate them into my native language. Sometimes they even rank higher than the real StackOverflow.I really wish there was a non-hacky way to ban sites from Google search results. I also feel like Google&#39;s ranking algorithm is utterly broken since it&#39;s amenable to this kind of exploitation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One big reason why Pinterest ranks so highly, and why you are seeing different tld&#39;s in the results, is because they have a variety of tld&#39;s that they use and those tld&#39;s all have separate crawl budgets from each other. So Google crawls Pinterest about an order of magnitude more than most other sites. You can read more about this here: https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/how-switching-our-d...Source: I run a think tank focused on Google’s web crawling advantage and have been studying stuff like this for a couple years now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;But why&#34;, I hear from the back. Having Linux available makes it easier to port emulators and fb or console games.&gt; Most importantly, because I can.Good. All I can say is at least it is something different to what I keep seeing on HN. (React, Rust, Kubernetes, JAMstack, JavaScript, etc.)Probably present this somewhere in a conference (CCC, FOSDEM, etc). Who knows who could be looking at this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be clear, this is a tech demo; we&#39;re long past the point where running anything useful on a system with graphics and 4MB (8MB with expansion) of RAM under Linux is reasonable. You can barely get the kernel itself that small. There&#39;s a reason why even cheapo consumer routers have at least 64MB of RAM.So it&#39;s for fun; you won&#39;t be able to run any existing &#34;normal&#34; Linux emulators and you&#39;d be better off porting stuff to run on bare metal than trying to squeeze it in under Linux on an N64. Cool project, fun, great that it&#39;s getting upstreamed... just keep in mind it&#39;s not really useful for end users for anything (unlike, say, Wii Linux, where with ~80MB of RAM you can actually get somewhere, though still with many limitations).OTOH, as other people have mentioned, it makes a good test case for N64 emulators. If they can run this, that&#39;s good validation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is, of course, cool. No doubt. I have an EverDrive 64 and I’ll probably test this out later today or tomorrow.I am skeptical that this would be the preferred way to port emulators or graphical games. You’re not getting a budget SGI workstation out of this, because the OS kernel itself is only a small part.The N64 is built around a chip called the Reality Control Processor, or RCP. This contains the RSP, stripped-down MIPS CPU core with a fixed-point SIMD vector unit, and the RDP, a rasterization engine that does simple trilinear texture interpolation and color blending. This is the hard part of programming the N64, and it’s not something that’s addressed by swapping out the OS kernel.There are… a number of major challenges you will still have to face if you want to make homebrew software for the N64, unless you are okay with just having something on the CPU and writing to the framebuffer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the original paper&gt;&gt; SrTiO3 is a suitable photocatalytic material for the assessment of this possibility. This compound is a well characterized photocatalyst with a bandgap energy of 3.2 eV (ref. 11–14), and its EQE for overall water splitting has been improved by up to 69% over the past years using various refinements.Here, we increased the EQE to its upper limit by constructing highly active HER and OER cocatalysts on SrTiO3:Al particles site-selectively. This was accomplished by using a stepwise photodeposition method instead of an impregnation process, which results in random dispersion of the cocatalysts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The abstract of the paper makes it sound good:&gt;Overall water splitting, evolving hydrogen and oxygen in a 2:1 stoichiometric ratio,  using particulate photocatalysts is a potential means of achieving scalable and economically viable solar hydrogen production. To obtain high solar energy conversion efficiency, the quantum efficiency of the photocatalytic reaction must be increased over a wide range of wavelengths and semiconductors with narrow bandgaps need to be designed. However, the quantum efficiency associated with overall water splitting using existing photocatalysts is typically lower than ten per cent1,2. Thus, whether a particulate photocatalyst can enable a quantum efficiency of 100 per cent for the greatly endergonic water-splitting reaction remains an open question. Here we demonstrate overall water splitting at an external quantum efficiency of up to 96 per cent at wavelengths between 350 and 360 nanometres, which is equivalent to an internal quantum efficiency of almost unity, using a modified aluminium-doped strontium titanate (SrTiO3:Al) photocatalyst3,4. By selectively photodepositing the cocatalysts Rh/Cr2O3 (ref. 5) and CoOOH (refs. 3,6) for the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions, respectively, on different crystal facets of the semiconductor particles using anisotropic charge transport, the hydrogen and oxygen evolution reactions could be promoted separately. This enabled multiple consecutive forward charge transfers without backward charge transfer, reaching the upper limit of quantum efficiency for overall water splitting. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of overall water splitting free from charge recombination losses and introduces an ideal cocatalyst/photocatalyst structure for efficient water splitting.Not so sure about the fuelcellsworks article clickbaiting up the &#39;quantum&#39; bit when all it means is one photon splitting one H2O."</p>

Be sure to get the nightly/3.0 branch , the 2.0 branch is several years old.  Also I strongly suggest building the plugins extra repo [1], has some great ones, like a terminator plugin that can kill apps various user and kernel ways.Unfortunately due to a personal dispute with a Webroot employee and Microsoft its signature ended up in antivirus databases, so don&#39;t expect any love from Microsoft. They often look at the APIs PH uses and use signature checks and other ways to block/discourage PH from using them. Also expect having to whitelist it with anti-virus products, but the source code is open and you can build it yourself if you don&#39;t trust what you are getting.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d add Directory Opus[0] to that list. It&#39;s an incredibly customizable and scriptable file explorer that allows you to fit it exactly to your workflow. It&#39;s like IntelliJ of file explorers.- Tabbed interface with multiple panes- Every function can be assigned a shortcut- Every button can be scripted- Defaults can be overwritten- Dynamic layouts based on folder contents, path or determined by a script- Custom file previews, context menus, rename scripts- Hooks for reacting to different events- Every corner of the UI is themable- Virtual filesystem for archiving and bookkeeping- ...One disadvantage is that you have to use an ancient version of JScript (ES3 / Microsoft flavor) or VBScript (possibly because of the need for communicating over a COM interface). Or use its own DSL for simpler scripts.I wish it had support for a more modern / more popular languages for scripting. I wonder if QuickJS[1] can be integrated into it. Or Python. That would be really sweet.[0]: https://www.gpsoft.com.au/[1]: https://bellard.org/quickjs/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Illiad.  As the foundation of Western literature, it may have received the greatest amount of hype that it is possible to receive.I had attempted to read it and The Odyssey when I was much younger, in middle school, maybe too young, and failed miserably.  But as it is always with cultural touchstones, references to it are inescapable, and a few years ago, in my mid 50s I overcame the reluctance accumulated in the intervening time and set out to read the Samuel Butler prose translation of 1898.  Most of the translations I&#39;d previously approached were in verse, which is in some ways its own hill to climb when one is customarily a prose reader, so this seemed perfect.And so it was, and I was bowled over.  It was a mind bending experience for me the likes of which I experience much to infrequently as age and experience take their toll on the novelties of youth.  I can&#39;t say the last work I read I experienced as electrically.  For all the stiltedness of epic story telling, the personalities of Agamemnon, Achilles, Zeus, et al are both vivid and convincing; the violence of battle is  horrible, electric, and wierdly beautiful in a way that will resonate recognizably with fans Sam Peckinpaugh or Hong Kong action movies.  Though the characterizations are far more stereotyped, as befits the age in which it was produced, than modern readers are accustomed to, they still evince a polish that rises above conventional story telling into true literature.  Worth every ounce of effort you expend to summit this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Wire.I&#39;d tried to watch it a few times, but only a few months ago actually got past the first two episodes. I think it helped that I quite quickly saw it as a morally ambiguous discussion of the institutional ineptitude of conservative western cultures in mitigating the effects of crime, rather than a typical &#39;good vs bad&#39; cop show.With that mindset, the possibly-underwhelming finale of S1 is much more effective, and the sudden pace-change in S2 is more meaningful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A good thing about that film is that after seeing it if I can&#39;t remember how a differential works I usually can remember the steps they took to get to how a differential works and then figure it out myself from there.That suggests that it didn&#39;t just tell me how a differential works. It taught me how someone who needs to invent a differential should think about the problem."</p>

Dont buy books and methods. Learning this way is like playing a game...and arguably much better than Cyberpunk 2077 ;)"</p>

You can see the building in the helicopter shot at the top of the NYTimes article on the story: https://www.nytimes.com/2020/12/25/us/nashville-explosion.ht...Obviously a telecommunications/switch hub, with it being a large windowless building in a downtown core.The other thing that&#39;s particularly odd is the fact that the attackers appear to have broadcasted some sort of warning or evacuation message from the site of the bombing prior to the explosion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reportedly, there was a visible countdown timer on the vehicle that exploded, and an audible warning played for 15-20 minutes prior to the blast:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5nygTJeu9fU"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is an update from AT&amp;T:The front 1/3rd of the building is structuraly damaged. That includes fiber entry.They have no power and there is major flooding on all floors including the basement.The Fire Department is en route with pump trucks to help with the flooding.They have Building Engineers and Electricians on the way to  look into the structure and getting power turned on.They have 2 850KW generators on the way and 2 1MW generators on standby.They have new A/C Chillers on the way (Existing Chiller plant was destroyed)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Baremetics customer here, disapointed to read those updated terms.At least in California there seems to be a law preventing this. https://www.cnet.com/news/companies-must-let-customers-cance...&#34;The law states that customers who accept an automatic renewal or continuous service offer online must be able to cancel the service online. [...] The law means you won&#39;t have to make anymore phone calls to obscure customer service hotlines to cancel services like news subscriptions, music streaming or meal plans, for example.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have one that is even better. Bell Canada. They require you to speak to the &#34;loyalty&#34; team before you can have a service cancelled.  That team is only available by phone. That team has a 1 hour wait time during the hours that they are open. That team likes to hang up on you.  That team calls you back from numbers that cannot accept calls.  That team is not available by chat or email and every other department has no access in the tools to effectively cancel a service.I escalated to the crtc and opened a case. I got a call back from someone who was very good at apologising for this policy but was at the same time very clear that this was within their legal rights as a service provider.Super convenient that I can sign up to any service with one click though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am pretty sure Baremetrics wouldn&#39;t be able to do business in California with that policy.CA passed a law in 2018 requiring companies that allow people to signup online to also allow them to cancel online https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtm...&#34;In addition to the requirements of subdivision (b), a consumer who accepts an automatic renewal or continuous service offer online shall be allowed to terminate the automatic renewal or continuous service exclusively online&#34;"</p>
