								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fully agree with this. Scanning Google News or a couple of the more professional international news services like BBC / Al Jazeera / Reuters I still feel pretty well informed (and confident that there&#39;s usually nothing of immediate consequence to me) but it doesn&#39;t grow into &#34;expert analysis&#34; or impact my feelings much. Here&#39;s another thing I noticed: how manipulated / manipulative it is. And not just news and I don&#39;t just mean politically - I know everyone thinks that news that doesn&#39;t align with their politics is just brainwashing. Broadcast TV is just generally awful now IMO.We went quite a few years without ever seeing cable. My kids would stream shows and consume other media on-demand, but any advertising was minimal and fairly non-intrusive. And then they were watching a kids show at a hotel once and the ads came on and the effect it had on them was crazy. They suddenly desperately needed all the toys in the commercials and were repeating catch phrases from ads after only seeing them a couple of times. The contrast in their behavior was insane. And they HAD to keep watching it like I hadn&#39;t seen before. I spent a week off-grid with my parents a while back and it was great. We came home and my Mom put on the news suddenly everything was terrible and she was angry, but she had to keep watching.Just awful for mental health if you can&#39;t separate yourself from it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who just stepped back into pop culture after being in prison for years (so might as well been on the moon) my first shock was just how horrible it all is now. There is no news worth watching. Cable news is just a pile of filth excremented by a Labrador Retriever that solely eats baby diapers. I thought I will watch Bloomberg since if real money is involved it can&#39;t be too manipulative. Nope, wrong. The internet is just a fireheap. Let&#39;s check Reddit. Oh god close the browser window immediately. WTF? Slashdot? Um, what is this, someone wearing a Slashdot skin suit? How about the sites by supposedly rational academics on each side of the political persuasion to get some balance. WTF? Just hate and anger and toxicity on a crazy level otherizing any opinion not their own. People are once thought great intellectual insides making incredibly uncharitable frankly hate filled comments and self isolating in echo chambers. Google Discovery app... &#34;here&#39;s some blog posts summarizing relationship posts made on Reddit&#34;. Huh? Why would anyone want to read this let alone have it further aggregated for them? Seriously, modern American discourse has less humanity, compassion, depth, and recognition of nuance THAN PRISON. Or maybe prison just made me less patient of bull crap and able to immediate horrible people by their mannerisms. Seriously this site is the only place I have found still sane and enlightening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the value-added of journalism to society has changed drastically since the Internet. If I&#39;m interested in a topic or issue I can find writing by people who actually practice it, and I can find the primary sources if at all possible.In particular, I question the need for giant journalistic institutions like the New York Times or Fox News or any other. If anything happens anywhere I tune to the local news first, because I&#39;d rather read that then the NYT copy/pasta from that, along with some quote from some friend-of-a-former-professor expert.That said, the news fills a valuable function even if you don&#39;t read it. When Alzheimer&#39;s gets cured, I will likely learn about it from a headline.I am torn on this issue, partially because I don&#39;t want to let my past deeply unhealthy relationship with reading about current events affect how I view it vis a vie society."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I avoid all things Samsung for a much more important reason: They spy on you mercilessly, up to about the same level as Facebook.For example, they take screenshots of what you watch on your Samsung Televisions!Don&#39;t believe me? Take it from them: https://www.samsung.com/us/business/samsungads/resources/tv-... and https://www.samsung.com/us/business/samsungads/insights/You&#39;re not their customer, you&#39;re the product.Additionally, Samsung have a habit of releasing forced updates that almost-but-not-entirely brick their TVs, slowing them down to molasses. They do this right before the next model becomes available for purchase.Last but not least, a colleague worked there as a consultant, and his stories of their lax IT security were nearly unbelievable. Even though they spy on you like Google or Facebook, they are not like a FAANG when it comes to protecting your private info! They&#39;ve been hacked for sure, probably by multiple nation state actors. Whatever you watch or do with their TVs is being relayed to the US, Russians, Chinese, or whomever. Assume that nothing you do with a Samsung device or Samsung software is remotely secure or safe.They&#39;re a slimy company made up of unscrupulous people trying to squeeze every last drop out of every rock.Don&#39;t give them your money. There are many other companies with much better track records."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am truly, deeply, unsurprised that foldable phones fail along the seam.I know that&#39;s not the point of the post, and I&#39;m not blaming the author. It just seems like such a ridiculous concept in the first place. My old flip phone had its own problems, and there wasn&#39;t even a display along the seam."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So the author had a folding phone that failed and couldn&#39;t get it repaired/replaced. The narrow take is that you&#39;re kinda crazy to buy a folding phone but Samsung was selling them so is really on the hook for the inevitable issues.The story of getting it fixed is really why people love Apple and even Amazon.I&#39;ve had the Wifi go unreliable on an iPad. I got a Genius appointment for later that day. They confirmed the Wifi module was shot and just gave me a new device on the spot. They even offered to do the transfer for me. This sort of convenience is what gives people confidence in buying Apple products.Even something as simple as accessory access matters. If my Macbook charger dies, I can walk into any number of stores and buy another. Dell charger? Not so much.Amazon has pretty accurate shipping estimates. This matters. So does Apple for the record. Just last week I got sent the wrong product. I didn&#39;t have to talk to anyone on the phone. I simply went to my order on my phone and clicked &#34;return item&#34; -&gt; &#34;wrong product&#34; and the entire matter was dealt with.I don&#39;t want to deal with support that is deliberately hard to contact that is monetarily motivated to not do anything for you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I changed careers at 40+ years old.  I&#39;m very happy that I did it.People have all sorts of constructs / ideas about how careers work (based on experience) or how they think it works, or how they want it to work.   I talk to some college graduates who tell me what they&#39;re planning for and have ZERO clue what industry they&#39;re talking about, their description is unrecognizable to me ... even tho I know it is the one I work in.I find your experience and paths can vary greatly company to company, even job to job.We all find truths we want to hold on to about work.   I recall trips to the valley where my coworkers where astonished to hear tales of people doing the same work they did, but doing it slightly differently elsewhere in the country.  Their view of how that job was done was entirely shaped by the couple places they worked (and everyone seemed to cycle through those couple companies).   You&#39;d think these folks though that if you didn&#39;t fill out the TPS report right to left that the world would end... I&#39;m pretty sure the vast majority of people fill them out left to right but I didn&#39;t feel like telling them that, it might have been too much for them to handle.&#34;
I think there are three main kinds of career destination, at least in the tech industry:    Independent
    Senior individual contributor (IC)
    Management
&#34;I have no idea why those are the only destinations ... for an article worried about being happy that seems kind of limited.The whole article feels very pie in the sky to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;It&#39;s not surprising, then, that many of us find ourselves in less than fully satisfying jobs, with doubtful or non-existent prospects for advancement.&#34;Very true. I can&#39;t wait for my career to be over. I don&#39;t think I&#39;ll ever find the position where I feel I belong, so I&#39;ll just be miserable anywhere now that I know how broken the system really is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I think there are three main kinds of career destination, at least in the tech industry:&gt; Independent&gt; Senior individual contributor (IC)&gt; ManagementI guess I&#39;ll stick my neck out and just admit that I don&#39;t want to give any more fucks about any of the above and just wake up, sip my tea, read the news and take a bloody nap whenever I want to. Also volunteering/open source but mostly, not doing things I don&#39;t want to do any more. Yep, I don&#39;t want to be &#34;incredibly excited&#34; about the &#34;next growth chapter of my life&#34; - I just want to live my life in a non-agile way without sprinting towards the end of it. That is about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The simple answer is to reject the cashless society.In the medium to long term it&#39;s simply incompatible with any reasonable definition of freedom. Surveillance is bad enough, but a system that allows governments to arbitrarily &#34;turn off&#34; thousands or millions of people at the push of a button is too powerful to not be abused.Even the mere existence of such a system has a chilling effect. Which I suspect is precisely what these people want and is exactly why we can&#39;t give it to them.I&#39;ll take inconvenience over slavery any day of the week.This isn&#39;t some sort of anarcho-libertarian paradise opinion, I have no issue with there being a well functioning justice system.But yeah, if you want to seize assets, get a court order and go and lock someone in a box and take their things, don&#39;t take the cowardly way out and pretend that you&#39;ve just flipped a database key and it&#39;s not really a big deal.By the same token, if you tell me there&#39;s been a murder on my street I&#39;ll give you the CCTV footage of my door cam. If you ask me for a backdoor, I&#39;ll tell you where to shove it. That&#39;s what being a member of a free society is, that seemingly minor distinction is one of the most important things we have and better minds than mine have sought to elaborate on why.Even a child is able to understand that force is still force regardless of whether it involves the direct visible physical kind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree that this needs to be taken very seriously. However, the author overstates his case significantly when he writes:&gt; Doing this to someone—a small business owner in BC, a public servant in Winnipeg, a student in Halifax—who made a small donation to support the convoy is a clear abuse of power.However:&gt; The RCMP, banking sector and federal government said Monday that account-freezing powers bestowed under the Emergencies Act to help authorities deal with convoy protests do not affect donors to the protests, despite unsubstantiated claims by a Conservative MP that a constituent had her bank account frozen over a $50 contribution.&gt; “At no time, did we provide a list of donors to Financial Institutions,” the RCMP said in a statement Monday. [1]Facts are important!1: https://www.theglobeandmail.com/canada/article-rcmp-banks-an..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most concerning thing about Trudeau&#39;s use of the Emergencies Act is that it was both unnecessary and, despite the protests being quelled, ongoing.First, the police in Ottawa chose not to enforce even basic laws in the area of the protest for several weeks.  The result was lawlessness and a total lack of respect for the police.  They were being jeered at for putting threatening flyers under windshield wipers one day, and the next they brought in armoured vehicles and riot squads.  If the police had consistently written tickets and made arrests from the start of the protest it likely would not have grown as large as it did.Presently, Trudeau is keeping the Emergencies Act in effect, not because there is an ongoing emergency, but because there might be.  He&#39;s argued that some of the protesters have not left Ottawa and might return to the protest site if given the chance to do so, but there is nothing in the Emergency act that is required for the police to maintain peace and order.  Trudeau wants the act to remain in effect for other reasons apparently.The opposition is introducing a motion in parliament to end the Act, but that will likely fail unless Trudeau loses the NDP&#39;s support.  However, the senate could also end the Act at any time.  Given that the emergency is over they should do just that.  It is entirely unclear what Trudeau hopes to accomplish by holding onto these powers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had the chance to work with a few people I&#39;d consider genius level.  While I&#39;m pretty smart myself, they all have something I don&#39;t always have:  The ability to be happy in any situation and interested in everything.For example, we were walking trough a hallway. On a wall is an old, damaged, ugly map of my country, half covered with graffiti.  I&#39;d walked past it almost every day for half a year.He checks it out, and starts noticing a lot of semi-interesting factoids about names, merged cities, obscure places, old mapping conventions, etc...  All of this with an absolute positive energy of pure interest.  We spent a fun hour just looking at it.  I should have known all this, and yet an hour with him makes me look at it with new eyes.Wherever he was, he instantly attracted a group of friends and wannabe girlfriends, and never really seemed to notice.  Same in this case:  There was a group of beautiful partygirls we&#39;d never met before, no nerdy interests at all, which accreted around the map in less than 5 minutes. They loved the situation just as much as us nerds did.I learned a lot from him, and try to follow this example, but I still can&#39;t do this today and am humiliated (in a positive way) by this way of living."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; we suggest that leaders follow the science and take a structured approach to hiring for, promoting, and developing employee happiness&gt; Measure happiness in both employees and job candidates.&gt; we conservatively advocate using measures of happiness and optimism as discriminators, or tiebreakers, because the risks are low and the benefits could be important.Good luck getting a job, unhappy people…I don’t think they have the evidence to make this recommendation, since they surveyed people already employed (by the US army), who may have been unhappier pre employment.&gt; might dismiss these results if you believe that military data somehow doesn’t apply to the business world, but you would be wrong to do so. After all, the U.S. Department of Defense is the single largest employer in the worldTheir entire argument for this also applying outside the military domain seems to be that the military is a very large employer… However, is not the military a vastly different environment from normal civilian workplaces?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading these comments is forehead slap inducing. People think that just because something is mental that it has to do with your mindset, your parents, your this your that.When a dude can run faster than other people, it’s written off as genetics. When someone is resilient to depression, it’s anything other than genetics. Both cases are the same: it’s just biological.I’ve been suffering super hard with depression recently and it’s made something clear to me: your mindset is bullshit. It might tip things one way or another but the actual mechanisms of depression will change your life. Everyone will be super humbled when we figure out how to turn off depression, and everyone gets it and everyone experienced on average a 50% boost to their intelligence and productivity. They will be humbled because they will realize that all of that relative suffering was totally pointless and for no other reason than a quirk of evolution. And that some people had it good for absolutely no reason. But it’s exciting to know that this day will come and it can’t come fast enough for me!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cool demonstration of regular expression power!
Note that as implemented, this is a space bounded Turing Machine with a hardcoded tape length limit:&gt; With the current implementation, the read/write head looks at the 22nd element of the tape whenever we want to read the current position. With complicated machines that utilize long lengths of the tape, you would need to increase this number so that you never delete a necessary tape element as you scroll along it. This can be done by increasing the {20} that appears at the beginning of the expression.Embedding the tape head pointer ^ within the tape, just to the left of the scanned bit, should remove this restriction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"   The instruction sets are the remaining lines, formatted like &gt;C.I:WMN
   C current instruction name.
   I the input from the current tape position. Either 0 or 1. Each instruction has 
   execution parameters for both inputs.
   W the output to be written to the tape at the current position. Either 0 or 1.
   M the movement of the read/write head. A 0 moves the head one position to the 
   left. A 1 moves it to the right.
   N the name of the next instruction to be executed at the new tape position.

Would it have been clearer to use &#34;&lt;&#34; or &#34;&gt;&#34; to specify whether to move left/right from the current position?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen a lot of commentary about the fact that the Emergencies Act provisions &#34;expire&#34; automatically after 30 days, and include &#34;safeguards&#34;, ergo there&#39;s nothing worry about. People getting hung up on the text of the bill forget that it&#39;s merely an Act of Parliament, and thus can easily be amended or replaced via a simple majority vote.What played out last night indicates that none of these checks and balances really matter in a parliamentary system where the nuclear option of a non-confidence vote (and subsequent election) can be invoked to force any MPs with qualms to vote along party lines.It&#39;s easy to see what will happen next, based on this government&#39;s track record: they will introduce amendments to the Act, or new legislation containing only the provisions they would like to make permanent, and once again proclaim that voting against the amendment will result in a new election.They will probably also use it as an excuse to ram through their &#34;Online Harms Bill&#34;, i.e. internet censorship, targeted at &#34;misinformation&#34; (disagreeable speech) and, many suspect, independent media outlets that the PM despises.Internet censorship + government-directed financial de-platforming = Canada&#39;s near-term future if the situation doesn&#39;t change somehow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Occupy Wall Street was started by a group of organized Canadians and they blocked access to NYSE facilities. OWS was obviously an occupation (it’s right there in the name), but the better question is: was OWS a protest, too? If so, why can’t this be called one as well?There are generally more parallels between OWS and the truckers than people are willing to recognize, because there’s been a hell of an inversion: if you supported OWS 10 years ago you probably don’t like the truckers today and if you like the truckers you probably weren’t for OWS 10 years ago. There are a handful of Tim Pools that like both, and there are elites that disliked both, but the average person has to do some gymnastics.All that I ask is that everyone is consistent: if OWS is a protest, then this is too. If you don’t like that Americans funded the truckers, you have to be willing to call out that OWS took place in NYC but formed from a Canadian nonprofit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A related report from the BBC (published a few days ago):Europe gas prices: How far is Russia responsible? https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/58888451Some key points in the BBC article:- Russia supplies about 40% of the EU’s natural gas imports. Most of the rest comes from Norway and Algeria.- Russia sends gas to Europe through several main pipelines - such as the Nord Stream, the Yamal-Europe and the Brotherhood (see the map in the article).- Overall, Russian gas exports to Europe have been decreasing over the last couple of years - down 32% in February this year compared to February 2020. One factor - during the pandemic - has been falling demand as economic activity shrank. Stocks of gas across Europe have been depleted, which in turn is driving up prices.- Gazprom, Russia&#39;s majority state-owned energy company, supplies gas to Europe under two different arrangements: 1. Long-term contracts often lasting from 10 to 25 years. 2. &#34;Spot&#34; deals or one-off purchases for a fixed amount of gas.- It is understood that Gazprom met its obligations to European buyers last year under these contracts.- &#34;Spot&#34; sales don&#39;t appear to be happening in any significant quantity, going by data from Gazprom&#39;s own electronic sales platform.- The International Energy Agency&#39;s executive director, Fatih Birol, has accused Russia of reducing gas supplies to Europe for political purposes.- Gas storage across Europe is well below the 10-year average, with levels currently at about 75% of storage capacity, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is not remotely pulling the plug. This is &#34;thinking about it&#34; again. They already stopped accreditation a few weeks ago, otherwise it would already transport gas as the pipeline is already filled. They just say that they have officially stopped the process which they more or less already did. I think in a year it might come online again if the news cycle is on another topic.Overall it will be much more expensive for Europe than for Russia. Who do you think will profit the most if gas prices hike?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s some quick numbers I just googled to understand the big picture.This pipeline has an annual capacity of 55 billion cubic meters. It&#39;s the same capacity as the Nord Stream 1, which is already in operation. If Germany was truly meaning business, they&#39;d stop Nord Stream 1 the moment Russian boots enter Ukrainian territory. But let&#39;s leave that aside.55 billion cubic meters translate to about 0.6 billion MWh. The price today for natural gas Dutch TTF futures is EUR 78/MWh [1] , so that translates in about 40 billion EUR per year.  It has been as low as EUR 13 and as high as EUR 165 over the last 2 years. It&#39;s quite likely that Russia would make a profit even at the lower range, so the 40 billion EUR/year is pretty much pure profit for them.[1] https://www.theice.com/products/27996665/Dutch-TTF-Gas-Futur..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank goodness. Bethesda&#39;s launcher was uniquely awful in a number of unpleasant ways. Slow, prone to crashes, bad user communication, not suitable for use on small monitors. The worst of the launcher apps I have used - and there are so many!I remember when it was in vogue for every game maker to build their own launcher or even full Steam clone - when EA pulled all its new games from Steam to get people to use Origin, when Ubisoft forced uPlay on you no matter how you bought the game, and so on. Now, it seems like we&#39;re pulling back from that situation somewhat - a lot of EA games are back on Steam, for example.I wonder whether the experiment didn&#39;t work, or if it worked, but now the goals have changed again?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there a technical reason why Steam is a such a force in the space? People, myself certainly included, often criticize Apple for taking 30% of developer revenue for merely existing in it&#39;s walled garden. Right or wrong, they control the ecosystem, so their ability to monopolize and heavily tax the App Store is unsurprising, they&#39;re exercising their pricing power as much as they possibly can.But how is it that on PC, where we have a mostly open field on which anyone can participate freely without a gatekeeper&#39;s blessing, Steam managed to consolidate so much of the gaming marketplace that even a titan like Microsoft is throwing the towel and bowing to Steam&#39;s cartelish 30%? I get that being the dominant two-sided marketplace of a given space is a strong network effect and moat, and consolidation is certainly convenient for users (I like having all my purchased games on a single account), but intuition tells me Bethesda doesn&#39;t need Steam&#39;s exposure to sell games or make new arrivals known (their announcement will go viral regardless), similarly to Riot, Mojang, Epic and co not listing on Steam. So I&#39;ve always found it surprising they were dual listing their games in the first place, but the fact they&#39;re now entirely giving up on direct selling is a testament to Steam&#39;s might in the gaming industry.Is Steam&#39;s product particularly good and hard to reproduce from the publisher&#39;s PoV, even one backed by Microsoft, to the extent it is hard to compete against with something like Microsoft Store? Or is this just another case of being early enough to establish the initial brand and let the self-fulfilling network effect kick in - with the userbase acting like gravity to bring in more users and developers - until it&#39;s large enough that sheer force of habit/inertia makes it quasi-&#34;indisruptible&#34;?Either way, I found it fascinating how Valve turned into Steam, whether it was accidental or not, what a homerun pivot. Seems that is the way of the Internet, being first matters more than just about anything, having the superior product (not claiming there is one for game stores) is irrelevant if you&#39;re remotely late, it just won&#39;t matter how much cash you pour into a Microsoft Store or a Google+. My gut tells me Microsoft is salivating at the idea of buying out Steam, seems like a perfect fit for the conglomerate if it wasn&#39;t for the scrutiny it would bring their way while they are positioning themselves as the good FAAMG."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a matter of principle, I think digital delivery platforms benefit from competition, and we should not be locked down into a single monopolistic, stagnating platform.As a selfish consumer though, I hugely wish we just had Steam and Netflix:The Origins and Uplays and Battle.nets of the world exist solely to make my life difficult, refusing to play my game when I want it due to obscure update required or forgotten password or old email account (especially when they are an overlay on top of Steam), and have zero repeat zero positively zero benefit to myself as a consumer. It is blatantly anti-consumer, and not made with customer view in mind.(Gog.com gets a pass because it allows me to JUST download the game, with no launcher and crap, so essentially going into opposite direction from all publisher-owned platforms and provides a unique value proposition)Same for Netflix.  It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s good. It&#39;s great! Over the last 5 years, proliferation of Disneys, Amazons, HBOs, Hulus, CBS All Access, Paramount Ultra Plus Exclusive Diamond Platinum... the whatEVERs, all they do is make me have to guess which  service is content I want to play on. All they are, at any level, is &#34;we want more money for less consumer convenience, and we think we can get away with it due to exclusive content lock-in we refuse to license to the convenient platform&#34;.I understand I&#39;m supposed to vote with my money, but with exclusive lock-in that&#39;s difficult. My kid wants their Octonauts and their Stinky &amp; Dirties, dammit :D"</p>
