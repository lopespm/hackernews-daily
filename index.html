He very much is aiming for that market with future devices (not the Quest 2).Here&#39;s a couple:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IMpWH6vDZ8Ehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zHDkdkqd1IAlso he&#39;s described their Project Cambria headset as intended for productivity, as in the following article:&#34;What’s different about Project Cambria?The most important description we’ve received about Project Cambria comes from The Information; according to the publication, Meta employees have alternately described the headset as a “laptop for the face” or a “Chromebook for the face.” It’s a device Zuckerberg hopes people will use to get work done rather than being aimed primarily at gamers as with previous headsets.&#34;https://thenextweb.com/news/meta-project-cambria-what-we-kno..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe I&#39;ve just been on a too-long coding stretch, but speaking for myself, it&#39;s just really unsavory to read so much &#34;red/blue&#34;-style sloganism around the big tech companies. Obviously I&#39;m biased because I worked for one, and so I saw up close the process that produces the decisions that seem to routinely generate comment threads with people comparing Google/FB/MSFT/etc. to e.g. &#34;Satan&#34;.It&#39;s just not that simple folks: and a hallmark of why this forum is great is that we tackle &#34;not that simple&#34; with a relentless curiosity rather than 1-bit generalizations.I routinely whack these megacorps for their shady dealings. But this &#34;Marg bar Āmrikā&#34; shit is an unflattering look for such a thoughtful community and it ignores that huge parts of this community are a direct personal object of very nasty remarks made &#34;in general&#34; on a fairly daily basis.People are quite pleased to enjoy the corporate funding of all the open-source projects that wouldn&#39;t exist without the megacorps: try saying something bad about Kubernetes if you don&#39;t believe me.It&#39;s not a 1-bit thing, and Hacker News is Hacker News because when people (and I&#39;ve been that guy) throw rocks, we demand better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well that is unfortunate. I would not want to be in Simula&#39;s position, I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve got enough on their plate without having to deal with stuff like this that they barely have an impact on in the first place.I understand that Meta needs to prove they&#39;re not a monopoly, and apparently the way to do that is through other companies laying their cards on the table, but my goodness would I feel uncomfortable giving core business plans, outlooks, and associated data to a huge (and arguably unethical) company like Meta.It&#39;s unreal that this is just a thing that can be done, but I&#39;d expect those documents to never reach the eyes of anyone who guides business decisions at Meta. Or so I hope. Or maybe this kind of information isn&#39;t as sensitive as I think, I don&#39;t run a business and have no plans to currently, so I&#39;m not savvy in that department."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So some people are upset that this happening in an election season, even though they support it?This was a lawful and thoughtful exercise of presidential power that helps some people convicted of something that really shouldn&#39;t be criminalized. It could also potentially help the Democratic Party in the upcoming election.But if you believe in what the Democratic Party is trying to do for the country, that&#39;s not a bad thing. There&#39;s no corruption in doing popular things that can help get people in your party elected. That&#39;s just good governance and acting according to the will of the voters.The majority of people in the US, 60%, and even a plurality of Republicans support decriminalizing recreational cannabis federally. The support for medicinal cannabis, possible if Cannabis wasn&#39;t scheduled as it currently is, is even higher.Recreational:https://www.benzinga.com/markets/cannabis/22/10/29166025/new...Medical:https://www.ipsos.com/sites/default/files/ct/news/documents/..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note: The vast majority of people arrested for marijuana possession are not charged Federally. This only applies to the Federal charges specified, Biden can&#39;t do anything about the State level charges most people are charged with.Just noting for non-American readers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess prosecutors won&#39;t be as willing to offer a possession plea deal to people caught running an illegal trafficking operation.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh hey look the consequences of a monetary system that isn&#39;t backed by a legal system (that is backed up by people with guns).The reason fiat money works is because at the end of the day if you run into trouble you have the legal system to make things right.  And if the perpetrator of the crime doesn&#39;t listen to the legal system, there are people with guns/violence to back that up.  That&#39;s why the whole system works -- because of the threat of violence.Crypto doesn&#39;t have that.  It has a lot of advantages (I use crypto myself) but it also has a big disadvantage, for now.When the USA starts issuing it&#39;s own crypto they might solve this problem by requiring KYC to get the coins, but then of course you loose the anonymity aspect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is an article about Federal reserve officials selling all their stocks dated September 10th 2021 to avoid &#34;conflict of interest&#34;. I would ask you to open the S&amp;P 500 and check the 10th of September 2021.
https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/fed-officials-sell-...It&#39;s not just about crypto, it&#39;s about who is allowed to use inside information.Celsius was a scam, if something seems too good to be true then it is. The same applies to LUNA and it&#39;s Anchor protocol which was giving 20% APY on the UST stablecoin. We saw what happened there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fun story.At my previous company we had &#34;Sign in with Facebook&#34; – whatever your opinions on it are, it was probably the right thing for the company at that time.Facebook decided to &#34;audit&#34; us to make sure we were doing sign in right. The tested it incorrectly, told us we were at fault and needed to fix it, and gave us 2 weeks to do so. We scrambled to figure out what the issue was, only to find after they eventually replied to our emails (all they told us up-front was &#34;it doesn&#39;t work&#34;) that they had tried to use a sign-in only button to sign-up, similar on many websites, not at all for our flow and not something it was possible for us to do. We explained this and they dropped the audit.2 weeks later, they audited us again, failed us again, and gave us a deadline to fix it. We replied pointing to the previous case and explaining again why it was working. We never heard back.2 weeks later, they audited us again, failed us again, and gave us a deadline to fix it. We replied asking what the hell was happening (politely). We never heard back.1 week later &#34;Sign in with Facebook&#34; stopped working with no other warning. We opened a support case, we emailed our ads account manager, we emailed our previous ads account manager as the first was on holiday, and all we got was &#34;we&#39;re looking into it, but it looks legit, fix it&#34;.I asked for a call and explained that the current user experience for users was that they would click &#34;Sign in with Facebook&#34; and see an error saying &#34;Facebook is currently not working, please sign in another way&#34;, and that the only way we had to resolve this was to email all our Facebook auth&#39;d users a password reset with an explanation that Facebook sign in no longer worked, and to then remove the feature from our site.&#34;Ah. Ok yeah let me see what I can do&#34;. It was working about 2 hours later, and we weren&#39;t audited again in the rest of the time I was at the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Similar experienceI used to run a graduation photography company, we did professional graduation photos half the price of the &#39;officail&#39; providers (who pay a huge commission to the university, but don&#39;t get me started on that).We promoted our service with facebook events and advertised said events. One year without warning or explination they Facebook just deleted all our events (we would travel from one uni to another over the summer). I frantically tried to get a response from facebook. I never got one.I sued in small claims court and they settled the case (not before being very threatening through high paid lawyers and trying to dodge the case altogether) they never did explain what had happend or why.Ultimately it&#39;s partly the reason I shut the company down, facebook was our channel, without certainty we could host events and promote them it made no business sense to invest in the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t have a specific solution for you, but I also run a domain with some thousands of subdomains and is always a fight to not be banned from Google, Meta, internet operators etc. Sometimes is enough one bad actor under one of your subdomains to have a full ban on the whole domain.What I suggest is for your and your clients to contact Meta through the Business Center support. Their support for paying clients is much better. I would also recommend you become a Meta Business Partner if Facebook/Instagram is important for your SaaS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would have agreed until I started working at Google. Also, you should completely avoid having Remote Desktop and instead use ssh + an editor that works with remote files.At Google we have a custom fork of VSCode running in browser and builds can either be distributed or run on my Linux VM to utilize build cache.I liked it so much I started doing a similar setup for small side projects. Just boot up the Cloud Console on GCP and start coding.Advantages are:- Accessible from anywhere (I use my pc, my laptop, etc. The env is always the same)- More compute (I can attach more CPU + more RAM flexibly)- Less friction to start (minimum environment setup, most tools are preinstalled)- Datacenter Network speeds + Artifacts cached (installing dependencies is fast)Disadvantages:- network dependenceThere are some adjustments that need to be made to your workflow. And for some applications you are dependent on having the correct tooling. However, my personal prediction is most companies will move to this type of development workflow as the tooling improves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nothing beats working directly on a fast but quiet workstation sitting next to my table.At least for me, the productivity gains associated with quicker builds, IDE resyncs (CLion, looking at you) or just being able to have email, chat, calendar and an active video conference running without making the system crawl to a halt or long latency spikes are huge. 3-4k for a machine that will likely last 2-3 years is nothing in comparison."</p>

Apparently, you have discovered a method for constructing quines based on an arbitrary blueprint involving any amount of languages.
&gt; 
&gt; Please write a technical paper describing your approach. I&#39;m sure you&#39;ll have no trouble finding a CS journal that will publish it.&gt; mame:&gt; Okay I&#39;ll submit to the Journal of Universal Rejection.Later:&gt; mame:&gt; I&#39;ll soon publish a book, &#34;The world of obfuscated, esoteric, artistic programming&#34;. The book explains how to write a uroboros quine. Hence, I proudly close this issue.&gt; It also contains my almost all (about forty) works, including alphabet-only Ruby program, radiation-hardened quine, etc., and explains many techniques to write such programs.&gt; You can buy my book on amazon.co.jp.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is nothing but a bad strawman from start to finish.Sprints are not made to help organize things, they&#39;re a tool to get more predictable deliveries. Their very short nature forces participants to construct tasks that are easier to estimate and therefore complete on time with a higher probability.This certainly adds overhead to an idealised scenario where people take the shortest reasonble route often enough and that is the tradeoff. Plus: people actually seldomly take the optimum routes in the first place.Nobody has to like it, this is probably not the best method and maybe it&#39;s not even good. But the author misses the point completely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kanban is the best middle ground IMO. I agree sprints are a distraction. The planning and ceremonies alone sap time. Sprints are really just a form of pressure. In my experience the stories estimating is not accurate enough to set up a predictable sprint, and the inevitable deviation from the plan just creates additional work to audit and adjust, along with a sense of failure around what has often been a productive 2 weeks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get the hate for sprints, and the bastardisation of agile. I think however, the root cause of this is the way in which our society as a whole has been modelled, in a top down manner where control is wrested from the bottom, and perceived control is given to those in between. Each of these articles that make, valid criticisms in my opinion, always makes me think of Bullshit Jobs [1][2]. Most of our lives nowadays are inundated with menial bureaucracy, and each attempt to reform it within bureaucractic systems has simply lead to the red tape being rearranged. I think this stems from our hesitancy to have more horizontal models of ogranisation.[1] - https://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/david-graeber-on-the...[2] - https://bullshit.ist/bullshit-jobs-how-our-modern-bureaucrac..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite nuclear disaster! Criticality events.I lived in Los Alamos for a while. I looked into renting a studio space. I became curious about the property across the street from my prospective rental which was surrounded by a chain link fence with green canvas. I researched and learned it was the site of an original Manhattan site waste dump which had, a few years prior, been enclosed with a negative pressure tent and cleaned up at a cost of 2-3 billion. Apparently the government had dumped an unknown quantity of high level nuclear waste there in an unlined pit in the dirt in the 40s. This led me to research the history of the area.After a couple of months I figured out that my house in White Rock was about 3/4 of a mile from the current waste dump for the entire lab, known as TA-53 or MDA-C or something. They were in the process of excavating the three 200 foot deep pits of MDA-C - one for low level nuclear waste, one for transuranic (as they call “high level” these days) and one for classified waste. If I stood on my roof I could see the negative pressure tents surrounding them. My favorite non-classified project which was disposed of there was the “experimental high temperature plutonium reactor”, from the 90s.The lab has some rather interesting history. There was no concept at all of safely disposing of anything or even recording what they dumped and where until the 60s. The first ever radioactive metal working facility, out on a ridge by the entrance to town (TA 21? 23?) dumped all of their wastewater directly into the canyon untreated. This has recently been cleaned up at a cost of several billion dollars also, and now they are building homes there. The heavy/radioactive metal plumes went down into the earth over 500 feet. In fact, all of the waste from the entire lab used to be dumped into a stream in the middle of town. They cleaned it up, opened it as a park (“Acid Canyon”), then after heavy rains found some barrels they missed which were determined to contain plutonium waste. Oops, cleaned that up some more and now it’s a nature preserve and hiking area. There are still untouched facilities from the 50s where Feynman worked on polonium experiments sitting a few hundred feet from the banks of the Rio Grande.There was a power plant right on the edge of a native reservation neighboring the lab. According to the federal government, the plume of chromium contamination it left ends exactly on the property line of the lab to the reservation.Everyone I met in Los Alamos had zero concerns about pollution having an impact on them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They keep saying that profit seeking was the issue, but taking selfies with plutonium, running a lab for 4 years that produces nothing, and not having any employees that don&#39;t understand the most basics of nuclear physics does not sound like profit seeking. It sounds like someone just has way too much money and runs a nuclear weapons lab as vanity project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;... tested to see if they remain safe and reliable  for use in the nuclear stockpile.Note here this expression &#34;safe and reliable&#34;, taken from the DoE&#39;s founding legislation, is officially re-interpreted to be very, very different from what a normal person would conclude.Most particularly, &#34;safety&#34; doesn&#39;t mean anything about risks to the public or to people handling equipment and materials. It does not mean anything about them not exploding in their warehouse or while hanging in a bomber. It does not mean protecting against release of radioactive materials or contamination of groundwater or ecosystems.It does not mean keeping people from stealing plutonium or whole weapons. It does not mean keeping bombs from falling out of planes at random (which has happened), or from crews setting them off accidentally or on purpose.  It does not mean keeping bombers loaded with them from crashing or missiles with them on top from exploding in their silos (which have both happened).The only responsibility &#34;safety&#34; places on the DoE is ensuring that, when the button is pushed, the bomb really does go boom.&#34;Reliability&#34;, meanwhile, means only that the boom is as big as it says in the specs.It probably requires legislation to change these re-interpretations."</p>
