								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At the risk of sounding to newage-y, I experience the benefits of exercising as energy balancing.Solving problems, learning and building new things all day can be very mentally exhausting. Cardio, sports, lifting; helps re-balance the physical with the mental. I am sure there are more scientific words and biological descriptions that I lack the vocabulary for. If I get too mentally focused on a project/job/problem and go days without matching it with vigorous physical activity, I end up not sleeping as well, am less tolerant, more scattered and brain fog tends to start rolling in. If I counter it with the physical exercise or physical energy expenditure the mental clarity comes back, I sleep better, and don&#39;t have hair-triggered verbal impulse control issues. Otherwise, if I let it go for too long, lethargy sets in - which I attribute to the body/physical and mind/mental trying to rebalance itself. I dont think it cares that it makes me feel like crap overall, more that it&#39;s neutral in just wanting a balance however that comes about.I often refer to exercise as me taking care of my mental health - as opposed to being physically fit. That could be seen as &#34;exercise [being] the best cognitive exercise&#34;. Looking at it that way, exercise creates a mental-out imbalance, which causes the stored energy in the mind to be stimulated and need more output creating the mental sharpness. Obviously I have nothing to back up the claims other than decades of experiencing this to be true for me time and time again; though I do believe there are better biological explanations than energy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t have any references to hand, but drawing from both personal experience and anecdotal stories from places like r/nootropics, the link between cognitive performance and physical exercise is already well established and almost universally accepted. In comparison, brain training games and sudoku puzzles are rarely, if ever, mentioned as beneficial (again, anecdotally). Am I misunderstanding what&#39;s being speculated here?Somewhat related - something that I do find quite curious from my own personal experience is that lifting heavy weights has a far greater impact on my ability to concentrate (and therefore perceived cognitive ability, I guess) than cardio/aerobic exercise does. Like night and day. I&#39;ve recently started attributing it to creatine supplementation, but I do wonder if there&#39;s anything more to it than that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working out makes you more cognitively sharp because it increases the rate of fluid transfer throughout your body and increases metabolism. Ancillary effects of this are calmness, endorphins, and regulated sleep. There I said it, no magic science required. You bring balance in, you get balance out. This ain&#39;t the type of cut throat science most of you on HN expect, but sometimes the simple explanation is the one."</p>

Whenever I look into the history of ancient cities numbers like this boggle my mind, how many thousands of years a city saw culture and life and death only to fade into nothing. I feel like we&#39;re lucky to have language be as widespread as it is today because the chances that our lives will be forgotten is at least just a little less likely due to our written record.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another interesting point is that the city of Ur had a harbour, which connected it directly to shipping routes with India [1] and Bahrain [2]. The shipping connection with India meant that Ur was able to import a funny blue-coloured stone from Afghanistan, called Lapis Lazuli [3].Nowadays, Ur isn&#39;t even close to the sea, but appears to be about 200 km inland. That is what 2,5 thousand years of silt build-up will do...[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indus_Valley_Civilisation[2] Bahrain was known to the Sumerians (people of Ur and other southern Babylonian peoples) as &#34;Dilmun&#34;. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dilmun[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lapis_lazuli"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was on a ferry ship from Italy to Greece where they had  paid sattelite Internet via WiFi. The WiFi AP was at first a captive portal. You could buy Internet access with cash at the reception or you could pay online. For that they had to enable access to stripe.com. But stripe uses fastly CDN, so they enabled one specific fastly endpoint that stripe uses. You had direct IP traffic to this specific IP address. reddit also uses fastly CDN. So with a /etc/hosts hack I could load reddit pages for free. Not images though, as they are hosted by imgur.I assume one could also create a tunnel over reddit chat connect to the Internet, but I never did that.By default, reddit did not work though, as their fastly CDN endpoint is different from stripe&#39;s, also the stripe&#39;s endpoint did not correctly sign TLS for reddit.com. But setting a Host header of old.reddit.com on that fastly IP successfully downloaded the page.When I still had phone network by the coast, I set up iodine IP over DNS tunnel, but it did not work, even though DNS requests worked on that WiFi. Maybe they had some sort of protection specifically for iodine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this as a check on zero-rating. I think that Facebook zero-rating in emerging economies will prove to have an abysmal toxic legacy. Anything that can tax the value proposition by e.g. forcing a lot of data through the pipe should be encouraged as a way to generally decrease the prevalence of the practice."</p>

https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/loda/article_lc/LEGIARTI00003...This specific ruling is about wether the lock screen of the phone was subjected to this law as well.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; If you have $110 million in assets and $100 million in liabilities you are said to be levered 10:1There is no single leverage ratio [1]. On an asset basis, this is an 11:1 leverage ratio, i.e. $11 of assets for each dollar of equity. A lot of miscommunication around leverage seems to stem from this ambiguity.[1] https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/accounting/l..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems a bit too wordy to demystify the concept. Here&#39;s a simpler example.1. Bank A offers you 5% interest for a 1 year deposit. You deposit $100 of your own money. You are unlevered. Things go well and after a year you receive $105, a neat 5% return on your investment. Or things don&#39;t go well, bank A turns out to be a scam and you receive $0, a -100% return.2. Bank B offers you a loan for a year for 4% interest. You borrow $900, together with your own $100 you deposit $1000 at bank A. You are levered 1:9. Things go well and after a year you receive $1050 ($1000+5% interest) from bank A, you repay bank B $936 ($900 + 4% interest), so you&#39;re left with $114, a very neat 14% return (almost triple the unlevered return). Or things don&#39;t go well, bank A turns out to be a scam and you receive $0. But now you still owe bank B $936, so together with your own $100 loss you made a -1036% return. Oops.p.s. It&#39;s called leverage because (like a physical lever that allows you to lift something much heavier than without) supplementing your own funds with lots of borrowed money allows you to tackle something much bigger than using only your own money, like buying a house or starting a business or getting 5% on $1000 instead of on $100."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find this uncharacteristically hard to understand.In the stock brokerage example, we&#39;re told:&gt;They might allow you 2:1 leverage when you buy stock: your $1,000 buys 20 shares now.But then a couple of paragraphs later:&gt;But you now owe $1,000 to your brokerage, and are 1:1 leveredMy brokerage offers 2:1 leverage, which results in me being 1:1 levered? I think I understand what patrick is saying here but I also find it hard to followOn the other hand:&gt;One is that, because people can ask for money from their checking accounts at any time, impecunious operation of the bank could cause the value of the mortgages to be impaired just a tiny little bit at a time when people need most of the money in their checking accounts.I&#39;ve read this four or five times and I don&#39;t understand the chain of cause-and-effect here at all. Why does &#34;people can ask for money from their checking accounts at any time&#34; mean that &#34;impecunious operation of the bank could cause the value of the mortgages to be impaired just a tiny little bit at a time when people need most of the money in their checking accounts&#34;?"</p>

Is Apple innovative? Is Google? Both examples of companies who have demonstrated tremendous amount of investment in design updates over the years.

Also pretty interesting to pause and see what&#39;s on the newspapers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is so appalling with the added context that this might be the worst airport in Europe."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s important to note that Uniswap is decentralized and anyone can &#34;list&#34; anything for trading without asking anyone or going through any process. This means there are thousands of tokens, probably millions in the future, available to trade.Users do not see these tokens unless they actively search them out. Uniswap uses the TokenList standard (https://tokenlists.org/) and by default users only see tokens such as the top 100 projects on CoinGecko. There are many lists created by reputable players such as Aave and Gemini which cover the entire gamut of projects users want to trade without exposing end users to scam tokens.I believe this is a good system and has worked well as having any kind of listing process or even a DAO introduces subjectivity and provides points of capture for bad actors. With an open listing process and standards like TokenLists we can say that Uniswap is truly a public good and will be around as long as we need it which provides a guaranteed way to swap any asset for any other asset no matter who created it or how controversial it is which is a good primitive for humanity to be able to rely on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some comments: While the report findings might be correct on the number, the terminology and conclusion in related discussion are often not. No real person ever traded these 26k tokens. The creation of liquidity pool should not be considered a launch, as you still somehow need to convince other people to buy it from you. Nothing was &#34;launched&#34;.These trading pairs are more akin to spam, to show up in the search results (somewhere else, do not show up on Uniswap). Other research find the scam volume is way less than 1% of the total trading volume. Only looking this number does not reflect the true health of the market or the controls Uniswap has in place to prevent trading these tokens.We also do not call fake Viagram advertising email rug pull, even if it is clearly intended to steal your money without making your dick hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sure, because anyone can create and list a token on Uniswap. The only cost are the gas fees. That doesn&#39;t mean those tokens have any real liquidity or are being used. Just like anyone can create a website and put it online. The only cost are the hosting fees. That doesn&#39;t mean it&#39;ll get any visitors."</p>
