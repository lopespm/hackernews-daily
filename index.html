								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This really bums me out.I was a convicted felon at 18 years old, poor, living on the street.It wasn&#39;t any government re-integration program that helped me, it was a random person I met in highschool.I worked my way through everything -&gt; college -&gt; jobs -&gt; startups -&gt; lucky windfalls -&gt; owning my own company. I&#39;ve immigrated to Europe (3 times in the last 10 years technically), beating the legal issues each time.And finally, after 17 years, I&#39;m no longer a felon thanks to a pardon and expungement.I really wish something like 70MR would stay up. Not everyone can be as lucky as me. Is there some place I can donate?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I announced the launch of 70 Million Jobs on HN back in 2017, it proved to be one of the most widely read and discussed posts ever on the site. I was totally blown away. Once again, I am struck by the incredibly sensitive and supportive tenor of the reactions to my news here.For some context, besides having a criminal record, I was/am a solo founder who somehow talked his way into Y Comb. Perhaps most surprising is my age: I&#39;m 68. To my friends I grew up with, I&#39;m f&#39;-ing Steve Jobs. To you guys, you&#39;d no doubt see me as the bumbling great uncle at Thanksgiving that isn&#39;t allowed to touch the TV remote control.So it&#39;s all been pretty weird. (wanna see it get weirder? google me and check out my past)As you all know, doing a 2-sided marketplace is always tough. But imagine if neither side of your marketplace was convinced they wanted your product. Chances are you keep your distance from such an undertaking (&#34;Build something people want,&#34; my YC t-shirt says). I build something arguably no one wanted, but I knew they needed. Does that make me a schmuck? Probably.But to those who&#39;ve never gotten close to someone with as record--particularly someone with a different color than you, who was brought into an unfair world from Day One, someone who wanted the same things as you, but never quite figured out how to get there, I&#39;m here to say that some of these folks are the most honorable, humble, appreciate, hard-working people you could imagine. They just want a peaceful life, to take care of their family and get a good night sleep.So that&#39;s where the mission comes in, and that&#39;s when zealots are born. The truth is, I have nothing in my life other than my work. No wife, no kids, no home, nothing. But the satisfaction I got from helping these heroic folks, and the smiles I&#39;d see on their kids&#39; faces when they were reunited, meant/means the world to me. If you don&#39;t have something like this in your life, I urge you to find it. Your karma will thank you for it.I invite you all to ask your questions and continue to opine. If you have something to share that isn&#39;t merely an attempt to win an argument, I&#39;d appreciate your taking the time to email me. More importantly, if you&#39;re ever in a position to hire someone with a record, take the chance. Life is too short not to take chances.  Richard"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be some confusion here over my use of the expression, &#34;The Great Resignation.&#34; https://www.investopedia.com/the-great-resignation-5199074
This is a economic/workforce phenomenon that began amidst the pandemic and continues. (The NY Times reported today that there are 11.4 million unfilled jobs. That&#39;s historically off the charts.)My company operates/ed a job board and a staffing business. Both ran like traditional job boards (Indeed, Zip Recruiter, etc) and staffing companies (Kelly, Adecco, etc.), except being focused entirely on the formerly incarcerated. This is how large employers source many, many employees.The staffing business was much larger. In this model, we serve as the hirer-of-record, and essentially lease out the workers to our client employers, who cover all our costs (wages, unemployment insurance, taxes, etc.) plus our mark-up (profit). It&#39;s a high volume, low margin business.During the Great Resignation, we found it took 10x the time and effort to get someone placed, eroding our already thin margins. Plus, if a worker left (which they began doing at a great rate), we&#39;re obligated to replace them. All of this made it pretty much impossible for us to make money. (Again, we&#39;re a for-profit business).  I hope this clarifies things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related, Washington Post previously published an anonymous open letter from Dalit women in 2020 in the wake of Cisco being sued for caste discrimination: https://www.washingtonpost.com/context/a-statement-on-caste-...One of the most interesting things that stood out to me from this letter and that lawsuit was the assertion by those affected that discrimination on the basis of caste was more impactful and more severe than discrimination suffered due to immigration status, race, and gender in US society, and the letter goes so far as to state &#34;We know that we thrive when we work under a non-Indian boss.  Our work is seen and evaluated on merit, and we are integrated rather than being excluded.&#34;It makes these discussions of castes even more important, especially as Indian immigration continues to rise and Indian culture begins to take precedence in the tech industry.  Being a white American from the Midwest, I had no awareness of caste or caste discrimination when I began my career, but as I got more experienced began to learn about it and unfortunately I have personally witnessed some incidents in the workplace during my career.  I wish that Google had allowed this talk to move forward, because I think ending workplace discrimination is a critical path to ensuring a merit-based free market open to all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hmm...&gt; To Soundararajan, Google was long overdue for a conversation on caste equity. Pichai, the CEO, “is Indian and he is Brahmin and he grew up in Tamil Nadu. There is no way you grow up in Tamil Nadu and not know about caste because of how caste politics shaped the conversation,” Soundararajan told The Post. “If he can make passionate statements about Google’s [diversity equity and inclusion] commitments in the wake of George Floyd, he absolutely should be making those same commitments to the context he comes from where he is someone of privilege.”&gt; Soundararajan said Pichai has not responded to letter she sent him in April. Google declined to comment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a well-written article with excellent explanations and I thoroughly enjoyed it.However, none of the variants using vmsplice (i.e., all but the slowest) are safe. When you gift [1] pages to the kernel there is no reliable general purpose way to know when the pages are safe to reuse again.This post (and the earlier FizzBuzz variant) try to get around this by assuming the pages are available again after &#34;pipe size&#34; bytes have been written after the gift, _but this is not true in general_. For example, the read side may also use splice-like calls to move the pages to another pipe or IO queue in zero-copy way so the lifetime of the page can extend beyond the original pipe.This will show up as race conditions and spontaneously changing data where a downstream consumer sees the page suddenly change as it it overwritten by the original process.The author of these splice methods, Jens Axboe, had proposed a mechanism which enabled you to determine when it was safe to reuse the page, but as far as I know nothing was ever merged. So the scenarios where you can use this are limited to those where you control both ends of the pipe and can be sure of the exact page lifetime.---[1] Specifically, using SPLICE_F_GIFT."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once had to change my mental model for how fast some of these things were. I was using `seq` as an input for something else, and my thinking was along the lines that it is a small generator program running hot in the cpu and would be super quick. Specifically because it would only be writing things out to memory for the next program to consume, not reading anything in.But that was way off and `seq` turned out to be ridiculously slow. I dug down a little and made a faster version of `seq`, that kind of got me what I wanted. But then noticed at the end that the point was moot anyway, because just piping it to the next program over the command line was going to be the slow point, so it didn&#39;t matter anyway.https://github.com/tverniquet/hseq"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ran the basic initial implementation on my Mac Studio and was pleasantly surprised to see  @elysium pipetest % pipetest | pv &gt; /dev/null
   102GiB 0:00:13 [8.00GiB/s] 

  @elysium ~ % pv &lt; /dev/zero &gt; /dev/null
   143GiB 0:00:04 [36.4GiB/s] 

Not a valid comparison between the two machines because I don&#39;t know what the original machine is, but MacOS rarely comes out shining in this sort of comparison, and the simplistic approach here giving 8 GB/s rather than the author&#39;s 3.5 GB/s was better than I&#39;d expected, even given the machine I&#39;m using."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is just cool!  If the author releases an STL, I might actually buy a Gameboy camera just to try it out!  Lost my original one but I&#39;ve still got my Gameboy and other stuff.The thing I loved about Nintendo back then was how they did little things that overloaded the original intent of their devices.  The printer is probably the best example, but the camera is a great one too.  There was just something magical about that.  Same goes for initially owning a Nintendo 64 then getting the Rumble Pak, plugging it in, and suddenly adding a whole new dimension to the game.Those days are long gone, for better and for worse.  Nobody would want or even need such devices because they&#39;d either be built right in or just be a part of the household, as would be the case of a printer.  But even though everyone knew the Gameboy&#39; screen was really crappy for the purpose, there was just something novel about turning it into a camera.  It&#39;s an experience of its time that I&#39;m not sure will be recreated any time soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me...there used to be a sonar attachment for Game Boy color that tells you what type of fish are in the waters.

Really interesting to see the modding scene still strong, been thinking of upgrading my gameboy color with a new large screen IPS with Bung Enterprises flash.Lots of interesting and neat stuff on the Game Boy Color, there&#39;s wifi mods, etc"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article takes an off-the-cuff comment from the CEO of Ford and reads too much into it IMO. He wasn’t saying dealerships are going away; he was actually saying the opposite. The point he was making was that Ford is going to adopt some of Tesla’s practices while using the dealership network to compete with them.Here’s the quote with more context:
“I believe for retail, we have to -- it&#39;s kind of like what happened between Amazon and Target. Target could have gone away, but they didn&#39;t. They bolted on an e-commerce platform and then they used their physical store to add groceries and return -- make returns really much easier than Amazon. They used their expertise as a physical retailer to their advantage, but they modernized the e-commerce piece. So it would be really easy to do business with them. It&#39;s exactly what we have to do on the retail side. We got to go to non-negotiated price. We&#39;ve got to go to a 100% online, the vehicle there is no inventory goes directly to the customer, 100% remote pickup and delivery, but then we have this opportunity to use our physical presence, they outperform them. Like, I believe some Mach-E and Lightning customers would love to have a Mustang for the weekend. Maybe they want a Super Duty. I can do that, they can&#39;t do that, unless they ran a Ford.”Source: https://seekingalpha.com/article/4515793-ford-motor-company-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot has been said about the dealership model in the last few years, and the almost universal consensus is that it is an unnecessary and predatory industry and all auto makers should just sell cars directly like Tesla does.That being said, is there any counterpoint to this view? Are there any benefits that dealerships offer today over direct sales? What would we lose if we got rid of every dealership? If there is truly little or no advantage, why has this obvious disruption never come up in the last ~100+ years of car sales in this country and all over the world?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This story makes me smile.Back in the late-2000&#39;s, I worked at CNN on a 12-month contract.  While there, I built a predecessor to the current &#34;Breaking News&#34; website banner.At least at the time, Turner did not allow contractors to extend beyond the 12-month mark.  So when my contract came up, they offered to convert me over to perm.  I declined, because my interests lay more on the backend side of the tech stack, and my role there had been far more frontend-focused than I wanted for the long term.Fast-forward 10 to 15 years, and I&#39;ve had a lot of experiences that I&#39;m very proud of.  I&#39;ve built concurrent systems that scaled to impressive levels of data.  I&#39;ve built event busses that moved hundreds of millions of dollars worth of financial transactions per year.  Etc.STILL, &#34;my son built the Breaking News banner on cnn.com!&#34; is the thing that my mom tells her friends.  It&#39;s the only thing that my wife ever understood about what I do for a living.There is such power in the visual, and in the consumer-side.  In a very real sense, this silly thing was the crowning achievement of my career... and it was about two days of work and a few hundred lines of HTML and jQuery."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"[Discovery CEO] Zaslav and mentor and investor John Malone have been public about their push to bring CNN back towards hard news coverage, and away from progressive commentary.I had missed that. That&#39;s very welcome - I hope they succeed. I imagine it could be very hard to pull this off after a ~decade of whatever CNN has been doing though.More context: Discovery and WarnerMedia (former CNN parent company) merged back in April. The resulting entity &#34;Warner Bros. Discovery&#34; is led by David Zaslav, Discovery CEO since 2006."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve long been enamored with the idea of learning from analog computers to build the next generation of digital ones. In some perspective all our computers are analog, of a sort - today&#39;s computer chips are effectively leveraging electron flow through a carefully arranged metal/silicon substrate, with self-interference via electromagnetic fields used to construct transistors and build up higher order logic units. We&#39;re now working on photonic computers, presumably with some new property leading to self interference, and allowing transistors/logic above that.&#34;Wires&#34; are a useful convenience in the electron world, to build pathways that don&#39;t degrade with the passing of the elections themselves. But if we relax that constraint a bit, are there other ways we can build up arrangements of &#34;organized flow&#34; sufficient to have logic units arise? E.g. imagine pressure waves in a fluid -filled container, with mini barriers throughout defining the possible flow arrangement that allows for interesting self-reflections. Or way further out, could we use gravitational waves through some dense substance with carefully arranged holes, self-interfering via their effect on space-time, to do computations for us? And maybe before we get there, is there a way we could capitalize on the strong or weak nuclear force to &#34;arrange&#34; higher frequency logical computations to happen?Physics permits all sorts of interactions, and we only really use the simple/easy-to-conceptualize ones as yet, which I hope and believe leaves lots more for us to grow into yet :)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of the method of calculating Fourier transform by refracting light through a prism and reading off the different frequencies. You get the &#34;calculation&#34; for free."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A better title would have been: how to make the universe do (a whole lot of) math for us [1].  What so-called neural networks do should not be confused with thinking, at least not yet.And the fact that we can get the universe to do math for us should not be surprising: we can model the universe with math, so of course that mapping works in the other direction as well.  And this is not news.  There were analog computers long before there were digital ones.---[1] ... using surprisingly small amounts of hardware relative to what a digital computer would require for certain kinds of computations that turn out to be kind of interesting and useful in specific domains.  But that&#39;s not nearly as catchy as the original."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">" Launch day is here! Our team is proud to present our open source product, Svelvet is a lightweight Svelte component library for building interactive node-based flow diagrams.Easy install with a NPM or Yarn package!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The performance on my S21 Ultra is pretty bad. Feels like ~40fps and stuttering. Also, it doesn&#39;t have mobile interaction for dragging nodes. I can only pan the canvas."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very nice! I love Svelte, and reading code like this is a great way to learn how to use it better.Has anybody made a customizable JSON tree editor / browser for Svelte? Especially one that supports schema driven custom views for json data structures."</p>
