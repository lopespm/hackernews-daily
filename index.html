								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once took a critical thinking course and bought the textbook 2nd hand from the college bookstore.  A week or two in, I noticed half of a sentence written in the margin.  As the professor started teaching the topic from that page, he rhetorically asked a question, did not get an answer, and then answered himself with the sentence from the book.  I filliped ahead and found that the entire book was annotated with all of his answers, anecdotes, and various other helpful notes.  There was even a table that accurately listed his wardrobe choices!  The notes were in several different handwritings, and the book had been resold over a dozen times, so that professor must have been teaching the same class the exact same way for a decade or more.  I quickly became a star pupil as I always had an answer ready.  I added a few notes along the way and then sold it back to the bookstore at the end of the year.  I really wanted to keep it for posterity, but It just seemed wrong to take it out of circulation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my middle school German textbook, I found the following note (translation my own):Hi Katie, we should meet up over tea over these images. The first image should be a simple sketch of two dudes playing football, tell the guys in graphics that the one they gave me is waaa too complex. The second image should be a chick playing tennis.The note went on in this manner for a couple more sentences, describing all the images on the page. Because I was a blind student who used a screen reader, I had to get the PDF version from the publishing company, which I then put in a specialized ebook reading app for the blind. I strongly suspect that the editors of that book used some PDF tricks for hiding information to post notes to each other. Whether they were alt descriptions, white fonts on white background, regions shrunk to be 1px tall by 1px wide or something else entirely, I do not know. That file was intended for printing, not digital distribution, so I guess that they decided the notes didn&#39;t need removing as long as they weren&#39;t visible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; He looked around at the faces in the crowd and said, “I’m opening the bidding at one dollar.” I about shit myself. I bid the $1 immediately to get things rolling. Well, after I bid, he looked around and said, “Once, twice, sold that man there for $1.” I just laughed… and wondered how the Hell I was going to get this pallet home and what I was going to do with all those books.&gt; When I asked the auctioneer afterwards why he’d let it go so cheaply, he said, “Did you see anyone trampling you to get in a bid?” I said no, I didn’t. His reply, with a smirk on his face, was, “Gotta’ know your audience in this job.”&gt; Well, needless to say, I got the books home and spent a few years going through them and selling some, giving some away, etc. However, that’s not the point of this story. The point was finding things in books. So, with that in mind…Dude goes to an auction and finds books. Nobody bids on the books. Dude is amazed that the auctioneer is willing to sell him something nobody wants for a low price. Dude spends years going through those books.I&#39;m happy for this guy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hustle and grind. Create 7 streams of income. Work 18 hour days - anything less and you&#39;re a loser destined for mediocrity. Read 5 books a week. Start trading stocks and crypto. Take cold showers, hit the gym. Optimize your schedule, log every minute spent. Ditch your loser friends and only hang out with likeminded - success breeds success. Sigma grindset. Moon or bust. If you&#39;re not worth $1 million liquid before 30, cut off your finger and work even harder. Analyze your productivity and always look for places to cut fat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Jewish people have their Sabbath, as a hispanic person myself, we have our Siesta. I spent over a decade in the tech industry and I&#39;d literally be scoffed at for actually napping in a nap room or pod for 20min. Finally just started doing it in my car. But that&#39;s one of my practices that anchors me not only to my culture, but my Creator. It humbles me. And brings me joy. I hope everyone could find what their practice could be that would bring them this.Take some time, at least once a year, to sit down with yourself and have a vision for your life not based on work or status (ie vacations or the acquisition of things). If that isn&#39;t enough to snap you out, go to a small village in Latin America or maybe like Matthew McConaughey discovered and talked about in his book, a quaint monastery in New Mexico. Stay there until it makes sense.Most people want to be productive because they want to feel valued by others. But if you have to look to your own value from others, you&#39;ve already lost, and will continue to lose forever.Be. You. Slowly. and you&#39;ll find you&#39;re more valuable than you ever thought."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Examples of productivity porn include but are not limited to: reading a tweet by a top VC about how to become a better startup founder; watching a Youtube video about the 7 mistakes you need to avoid at the gym; perusing a Hacker News thread about how to improve the code you write. All of these activities deceptively make you feel like you’ve done something productive. “I just learned something new”, you tell yourself.Those examples from the article make sense but in my experience the biggest illusion of productivity happens right inside our day to day work routines, namely email and chat systems. People respond to endless email threads that in the end trigger no action, endless discussions on Slack channels with no decision making until eventually somebody calls a meeting. We type and type but in the end we waste our own attention and our coworker’s attention just to feel important and productive without doing anything useful most of the time."</p>

But the breathless coverage of their work by news organizations, little more than rephrasing press releases, that&#39;s what irks me.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just got access to the DALL-E 2 beta, and it&#39;s a ton of fun to make pictures out of everyday occurrences as prompts.Someone else here on HN observed that everyday people don&#39;t &#34;get&#34; how huge this all is. I experimented with asking random acquaintances at a local cafe for prompts and showed them the generated pictures. All but one person was totally unimpressed.If everything feels like magic, then what&#39;s one more piece of magic?This scared me more than the implications of DALL•E 2 itself specifically. People think of the technology in the world as mysterious black boxes that do inexplicable things, and they hence no longer understand relative complexity, progress, or change.My impression is that to most people DALL•E 2 is not &#34;substantially&#34; different to, say, Google Image search. Text in... image out. What&#39;s the big deal?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve spent just over 1 week with DALL•E 2.Over the past 7 days I’ve generated ~1000 images, 150 of which were good enough to save. I only saved images which made me audibly gasp.Witnessing your own novel idea spring to life is a magical experience. DALL•E provides an artistic tool on a comparable level to digital photography, and by extension Photoshop.At this stage it’s 100% clear to me that DALL•E has heralded in a revolutionary new age of design. Every day I worked with it, I grew more confident in my outlook.It might not necessarily be an OpenAI product which truly “integrates” with humanity — but DALL•E has shown me that it’s possible… and just a matter of time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prompt crafting is quickly becoming an art. I just found out yesterday that there&#39;s actually market places for buying and selling prompts [0]. It can really make a big difference if you can tune the image by adding the right words. Midjourney [1] even allows things such as adjusting the weight of each keyword or how &#34;literal&#34; the AI should take your prompt.[0] https://promptbase.com/[1] https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/user-manual"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PHP has so many hidden benefits:- it&#39;s stateless by design (much easier to scale)- it was &#34;serverless&#34; before Serverless- surprisingly performant- no &#34;unknown unknowns&#34;. it&#39;s so tried-and-true, there&#39;s no surprises- deployment is so simple, just drop a file on a web server. No middleware needed.- No long compile times because there is no compiling needed.EDIT: why the downvotes? If you don&#39;t agree, just reply so we can have a healthy dialogue.EDIT2: I also think there is something unique about PHP documentation. It has plenty of real life examples, and the ability for users to leave comments allows you to hear directly from others &#34;gotchas&#34; that people have experienced. I feel like PHP documentation is very undervalued."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I love legacy codebases.&gt; A legacy codebase means that the product is performing well. It means that I can often make immediate and impactful improvements.Wow. This person must have worked on very different legacy codebases than me.Legacy Javascript code, to me, is something that I do not want to touch with a 10 foot pole, because every little piece of it can be intertwined with and used by many other hidden places. Plus, I&#39;ve never found a legacy JS codebase that has a robust test suite, so any refactoring I do can be hard to test and verify.From a practicality perspective, I get that the best programming language is the one you can use to build your product, but I tend to long for languages like C# or even Go when I&#39;m trying to deliver a product on a team with 10+ people. Static typing really helps when you&#39;re interfacing with someone elses code, and Typescript only aids this point.Maybe if your target audience is genuinely 10 year olds learning to code, fine. But also if you&#39;re building a serious product for a company, please don&#39;t choose a &#34;Janky programming language&#34; because I really don&#39;t want to have to debug it after you left before really thinking about sanitizing user input.I feel like, in the hands of a really talented programmer, they can be super productive in PHP or Javascript or really anything. But I&#39;ve just had a lot of bad experiences with quickly written, undocumented code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really speaks to my heart. I learned programming as a young kid when my uncle taught my pascal. But I just couldn&#39;t see the point of console programs and never really got into it. Eventually I picked up late 90s HTML (hello geocities!) and php was a natural next step. I still remember going to the library to borrow the book PHP and MySQL web development. It was so empowering. I could make any kind of application I wanted and see the result in my browser, GUI and all (Win32 API was way beyond me at that age). I made my own forums, ebay clone, and a few web apps for an old Korean MMO.Fast forward a few decades, and things look very different. Tons of web app backends being written in go, nodeJS/TS, and I recently learned people write them in rust+webasm. It&#39;s just crazy to me. I&#39;ve worked on FOSS projects that are massively over-complicated because of their platform/language choice, when they would&#39;ve been very straightforward php choices. But php still has this weird stigma about it despite most of the old concerns having been addressed.I do have to say, though, that front end web development is way better than before with the advent of React and co, webpack, css libraries etc. Doing all that html/js/css by hand was always painful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Bravo! I&#39;m so glad this is born. I&#39;m curious about its model, SalesForce CodeGen. Does it train on all the public repos on GitHub? Does Copilot have access to private repos that CodeGen cannot access?Also, it would be really cool if I can personalize FauxPilot by feeding it with all my repos on GitHub. Sometimes I just need to reimplement a function I&#39;ve written before but it&#39;s really hard to find where my old code is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangential, maybe someone here knows; how complicated would be to implement an autocompleter that just understands syntax + patterns and can offer me suggestions but based on my own stuff? Like what is the simplest version of Copilot that doesn&#39;t require huge amounts of training but just does a decent job at recognizing tokens and trying to fill in the structure based on some input code. e.g: `app.get(&#39;/&#39;,|`  &lt;- at this point I should get an express.js handler autocomplete like `(req, res, next) =&gt; {}`, maybe with multiple choices grepped from my own data ranked by occurences. Is this too extreme it needs a multibillion parameter AI model to achieve? Does anything like this exist? Like an auto-snippet thing but contextual and token replacing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome work, I made a similar project which is making a cost effective and privacy focused alternative to OpenAI text generation that can be switched to in a one line/easy way because it&#39;s API compatible https://text-generator.io/blog/over-10x-openai-cost-savings-... also works for generating code too so would be excited for someone to try that out too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is plenty of room for all of Chess.com, Chess24 and Lichess to exist.Lichess has the best platform to play on and is free to use.Chess.com is a business. As such they want to earn money.
However, without a large, online chess community there will be no subscribers.
The amount of effort chess.com has made to sponsor events, streamers etc.
is tremendous.Making a living as a chess professional is tough. 
Streaming/YouTube has opened the field somewhat: it is no longer
required to be in the world top 20 to make a living in the field of chess.The Chess24 initiative is without doubt inspired by Chess.com.
Chess24 gives yet another way for chess players to earn money.
Via Chessable (owneed by Chess24) players can sell chess online book/booklets.If Hikaru has a clause in his contract with Chess.com, that he can&#39;t play on Lichess - then the just can&#39;t play on Lichess. That&#39;s simple.Would Nike be happy if Portugal’s Cristiano Ronaldo suddenly appeared in Adidas shoes?It works the other way too: Wen did you last see Magnus play on Chess.com?
[I am aware that Magnus as owner/investor in Chess24 makes his own rules - and plays on Lichess]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paying off Chess streamers is pretty much the only way Chess.com can keep people using their site. Their product is simply inferior in every way, except for their library of master lessons, and all these GMs exclusively streaming through Chess.com.I figure all this spending on sponsorship and GM content is why the rest of their site is so inferior to Lichess. Lichess can spend all their time perfecting the platform, and it really shows."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Chess has always had this dichotomy over free/paid services. (a bit not unlike programming tools).I love lichess.org but make no mistake: without the dedication of one talented Scala programmer willing to underpay themselves that site would not exist.Commercial sites can provide more services and offer more opportunities to chess professionals simply due to the funding model.Disclaimer: I&#39;ve played over 100k online chess games since 1992. Starting with original ICS (client was on Xwindows) before ICS/FICS split drama, then chessbase.com, then chess.com and now lichess.org. I slightly prefer lichess but play on chess.com as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like this trend of &#34;making the terminal great again&#34;. Between rich/textual in python and lipgloss/bubble tea for golang, this turns cmd from &#34;the default ugly stuff that is easy to produce&#34; into &#34;something fun and pretty&#34;.Also note that those projects have the (not anymore) secret goal to also produce a web app from the same code base automatically.I imagine native will follow, or wasm, or something. Nevertheless, having the terminal as the smallest denominator for UI makes a lot of sense for small utilities. You won&#39;t build the next Figma with it but a lot of scripts could benefit from that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The advice to use lru_cache is good.But there is an issue if lru_cache is used on methods, like in the example given in the article:1. When lru_cache is used on a method, `self` is used as a part of cache key. That&#39;s good, because there is a single cache for all instances, and using self as a part of the key allows not to share data between instances (it&#39;d be incorrect in most cases).2. But: because `self` is a part of a key, a reference to `self` is stored in the cache.3. If there is a reference to Python object, it can&#39;t be deallocated. So, an instance can&#39;t be deallocated until the cache is deallocated (or the entry is expired) - if a lru_cache&#39;d method is called at least once.4. Cache itself is never deallocated (well, at least until the class is destroyed, probably at Python shutdown). So, instances are kept in memory, unless the cache is over the size limit, and all entries for this instance are purged.I think there is a similar problem in the source code as well, e.g. https://github.com/Textualize/textual/blob/4d94df81e44b27fff... - a DirectoryTree instance won&#39;t be deallocated if its render_tree_label method is called, at least until new cache records push out all the references to this particular instance.It may be important or not, depending on a situation, but it&#39;s good to be aware of this caveat. lru_cache is not a good fit for methods unfortunately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my proudest moments during the development of &#34;Linux on the Web&#34; had to be the creation of a Terminal application (try it at https://lotw.site/shell) that can render its output with near-native efficiency. My initial attempt was based on placing character images, one-by-one, onto a canvas element, but it was horribly sluggish. Then I started playing around with a &#34;Virtual Dom&#34; (React-like) approach, wherein I convert the underlying data structure into an html string, and then set the innerHTML property of a div element, for every time the screen has to be redrawn. (Source code: https://github.com/linuxontheweb/LOTW/blob/main/root/code/ap..., the relevant code is the &#34;render&#34; function starting on line 569, and the innerHTML is set on line 940).I don&#39;t know how many years its been that I started working on the Terminal application, but it was only within the past week or so that I &#34;bit the bullet&#34; and figured out how to do finger pad/mouse wheel scrolling of the output buffer (See the &#39;main.onwheel&#39; function in the source code for that little tidbit!). Since I required fine-grained control over the rendering process, I could not rely on the &#34;naive&#34; way of doing scrolling on the web (which is to simply let the browser take care of the entire process)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The emphasis on &#34;downturn&#34; concerns me. Aren&#39;t reputed firms like YC supposed to look at a 10+ year horizon?If this is true, it indicates that earlier investments were based on the market than the fundamentals of the founding team, market, and product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"no, YC realized that they let a bunch of companies into YC that historically would have never made it in, reducing the value of the brand.  This is a great move to more or less shrink the size and use the economy as a reason."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have worked at both startups and tech companies 40+ years old, and the conclusion I&#39;ve come to from my anecdata is that every engineer at every company is swamped all the time.Feature requests and bug reports are easy. Writing features and fixing bugs is hard. Your todo list will always grow faster than you can tackle items. Once a senior engineer retired, and I inherited about a hundred of his bugs out of the 600 or so he left behind.It&#39;s a marathon, not a sprint. Working at a consistent pace is better than burning yourself out. The work is omnipresent. It will never stop growing. It will consume all if you let it.Unless you&#39;re at an early-stage startup, let your manager deal with your giant and ever-growing todo list. Let someone more plugged-in to the business side deal with prioritizing, and focus on technical excellence. Unless you aspire to management yourself, that&#39;s already plenty to do.Anyone who tells you every engineer needs to be in touch with every business concern either only works on early-stage projects or is part of a hustle culture that I don&#39;t ascribe to. I don&#39;t have the energy for technical excellence and knowing everything about the business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just talked about this with my wife just yesterday about her peer. If you&#39;re always the hero to take on too much work and you never keep up, you invite various significant structural problems.You&#39;re too useful to remove, you may not get attention for corrective measures because of fear of the person leaving.You are often too swamped to effectively get work done smoothly and in an expedient manner.You become a single point of failure (bus factor 1) so that when you take a vacation / hit by a bus, the company suffers significantly.A common personality trait of these types of people seem to be self reliance / control seekers. When they own that authority of work, they are less likely to accept delegation to get them out of their woes.In general, these types of employees may end up being labeled super stars, but they&#39;re also potential albatrosses that could significantly wound a company if not properly managed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been on both sides. A lot of people say people who want to be swamped is a control problem but I&#39;ve found its more delicate than that. My circumstances require me to have decent insurance so my life will forever be tied to an employer. I don&#39;t really get an &#34;escape&#34; at least until obamacare becomes cheaper than $2800/mo. for what I need in order to try out the entrepreneur life.As a result I work very hard. I end up getting a lot of work done, and thus more work on my plate. This is often manageable and I use this as a gauge of my probability of being fired for any given reason. Someone knocking on the door of a PIP likely won&#39;t be getting as much work especially if it&#39;s reasonably complicated. It&#39;s been my experience as work starts to die down to a less-than-consistent level I&#39;m usually out the door (never fired, but often laid off in this industry).However, this burned me when I became staff-level because I&#39;d get so much work that despite trying to reduce the bus factor back to &#34;manageable chaos&#34; I was unable to and ended up leaving the job for another one because I became the smart guy in the room.But overall I aim to walk the razors edge between swamped and normal at all times because it&#39;s the only form of security I have. When I am in this condition I am now useful enough I have plenty of power over my employer and my position and for an employee this is an ideal situation to have. Especially when the alternative is extremely expensive &#34;between jobs&#34; insurance, or a less than ideal insurance package from another company."</p>
