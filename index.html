								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like this approach.Far to often I’ve interviewed at places and been grilled by the interviewer only to find out when you start the quality isn’t great, what you where grilled on you won’t be working on “as that’s to hard”  or “we don’t do that” despite being grilled on it and the level of skill not to great they just want senior people. It’s the bait and switch.At least being taken through existing code you know what you are getting yourself in to. Also looking at the current open pull requests and closed pull requests to see the standard and speed of delivery. Bonus points for no PR’s and trunk driven development as that shows a very mature team.My simpler interviews have often been with companies that have held a higher bar than the ones with tougher interviews. Those companies have often been sink or swim though and if you don’t make the grade you’ll be kicked out pretty quick. My last company had a reputation for new starts disappearing and not great that way, but the team was probably the strongest bunch of people I’ve ever worked with as only do good survived."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly what I started doing at my company a few years back. You are presented with a complete app written in the stack we use. This app has some bugs we will solve to get it working (nothing that&#39;s a trick... actual, commonly encountered bugs that have all the error messaging you need to solve them). Once it is working you will walk me through a particular flow of the app, explaining what is going on and why we do it this way. There are optimization opportunities (purely optional, there for you to notice), areas we can dig into if we choose (or if I feel the need to). If you tear through it we can examine a different flow in the app. Perhaps we could discuss the database structure and how it might be improved or changed, maybe we dig into some CSS or into some GraphQL or any other aspect that we need to. I&#39;ve had people stumped and unable to continue but the vast majority of devs can make a good stab at it, even if they are not familiar with the specific stack. The best devs are barely slowed down by such unfamiliarity and can still reason, logically, about the code.So far I&#39;ve had really positive feedback from job candidates. A couple even described it as their favorite interview ever! I feel like it has worked well, given the people we have ended up hiring."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s interesting, I&#39;ve never heard testing code skills by reading instead of writing.An example would have been nice though, as I&#39;m not sure how to find a piece of code that does something standalone that is too large to grasp in 20 minutes yet make a reasonable prediction at the output. That combination seems kind of weird.I wonder how well it would work to modify OP&#39;s idea and present a candidate with some code that has a bug in it (you reveal what the bug is to save time, they&#39;ll need to understand the code anyhow) and you ask them how they&#39;d fix it. First broadly, like what approach, then actually write part of it.To take my own advice and make the discussion more concrete, I should add an example. Random script from my github: https://github.com/lucb1e/randomdirectory/blob/master/random...To prepare for the interview, one could add an argument like -h to show usage (in the same style as -v is currently implemented), then tell the candidate that the bug is that passing -vh executes neither -v nor -h (one would commonly expect it to execute both). Fixing this requires a &#39;structural&#39; change to this little bit of code, but it&#39;s small enough to easily grasp and implement. The candidate might propose to loop over each character after a single hyphen to fix this, or they might propose to throw out this custom reinventing-the-wheel and use a proper arg parsing library. Either is fine, but they should be prepared to write the code (in any language, they can write just the changes in C, Python, JS, or whatever language they&#39;re comfortable with).Has anyone tried such an interview coding question?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello HN! Here is some context to decorate this announcement:The Zig self-hosted compiler codebase consists of 197,549 lines of code.There are several different backends, each at varying levels of completion. Here is how many behavior tests are passing:       LLVM: 1101/1138 (97%)
       WASM:  919/1138 (81%)
          C:  740/1138 (65%)
     x86_64:  725/1138 (64%)
        arm:  490/1138 (43%)
    aarch64:  411/1138 (36%)

As you might guess, the one that this milestone is celebrating is the LLVM backend, which is now able to compile the compiler itself, despite 3% of the behavior tests not yet passing.The new compiler codebase, which is written in Zig instead of C++, uses significantly less memory, and represents a modest performance improvement. There are 5 more upcoming compiler milestones which will have a more significant impact on compilation speed. I talked about this in detail last weekend at the Zig meetup in Milan, Italy[1].There are 3 main things needed before we can ship this new compiler to everyone.1. bug fixes2. improved compile errors3. implement the remaining runtime safety checksIf you&#39;re looking forward to giving it a spin, subscribe to [this issue](https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/89) to be notified when it is landed in master branch.Edit: The talk recording about upcoming compiler milestones is uploaded now [1][1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqDdWEiSwMM"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Zig’s compatibility with C is such a valuable feature.I also wish we could rewrite everything in a modern language, but the reality is that we can’t and that if we could, it would take a LONG time. The ability to start new projects, or extend existing ones, with a modern and more ergonomic language—Zig—and be able to seamlessly work with C is incredible.I look forward to the self-hosted compiler being complete, and hopefully a package manager in the future. I’d really like to start using Zig for more projects."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;My most immediate takeaway from this novella of a thread is that Twitter is way overdue for long form tweets! (Musk&#39;s response)this may very well be the first thing in my life I&#39;ve agreed with Musk on. By god scrolling through an entire essay chopped up with random replies and profile links thrown in because you have to click &#34;show more replies&#34; (which pops up twice?) over and over is awful. Just link to a Twitlonger.On yishan&#39;s actual points I agree though. Companies moderate haphazardly and improvise and they care about their bottom-line and to extinguish shitstorms. There&#39;s no coherent ideological bias on any sufficiently large social network, they just pivot to whatever is causing chaos on any given weekday.One important point stuck somewhere in the middle is his observation that in the physical world, no public square, or public debate looks like what&#39;s on display on internet social networks. All of them have rules, civility is a thing, if you&#39;re crazy someone&#39;s likely going to throw you out, there&#39;s identity instead of anonymity and so on. Maybe provocatively, &#34;cancel culture&#34; is simply culture. Culture is a bunch of rituals, rules, coercions, customs and traditions that predominantly tell us what not to so so we don&#39;t behave like a bunch of naked apes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve sometimes wondered if the way American media and culture treat people like Musk, Bezos, Gates is that we have no royalty -- there&#39;s no hereditary monarchy and indeed the old money keeps a studiously low profile.Do human cultures just need kings and princes? Is there a special kind of celebrity niche that the billionaire businessman fills that occupies an ancient hierarchical part of our society?I read Yishan&#39;s post here as kind of like a duke commissioning an epic poem in the hopes it&#39;ll influence the king. Maybe it&#39;ll work -- he shot his shot, and he&#39;s a pro at putting in just the right Internet comments in just the right place. But I wonder why I&#39;m so fascinated about seeing this conversation between these two nobles. Is this how the English lower classes saw their royalty in the 17th century? Did they chatter about the king&#39;s foibles on the street while they were out costermongering?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This thread is an interesting perspective on social media &#34;censorship&#34; that you don&#39;t hear often.Of course everyone working at a social media company has an ideological bias, and that can come out in the product. But consider also that the latest censorship controversy creates negative PR, makes people leave the platform, attracts regulatory attention, and ultimately, hurts the company&#39;s profits. Content moderators are at least as worried about that as they are about making sure their ideological opponents aren&#39;t given a voice.Social media companies are in the unenviable position of playing referee in the culture war, and like referees in any sport, they&#39;re going to constantly be criticized for doing it, right or wrong. These companies are global and universal, and there&#39;s no way they can satisfy all parties. Sometimes, the values of left and right, or Iran and the US, or Israel and Palestine, are just irreconcilable. You&#39;re better off just trying to avoid as much trouble as possible, and avoiding negative media attention.Reddit is probably the most ham-fisted example of this approach. Their content moderation is pretty hands off, but as soon as any subreddit attracts negative attention, it&#39;s quarantined or banned, no matter if the controversy is justified or not. When Russia invaded Ukraine and Russia Is Bad Now, they just straight up banned /r/russia and any link to an .ru domain! That does nothing to address the conflict, but it does keep those NYT opinion pieces from showcasing Problematic Russian Bot Behavior on Reddit.I&#39;ll note that I don&#39;t think this model fully explains moderation policies at Twitter or other social media sites. I genuinely believe moderation leans left due to an ideological monoculture (I&#39;ve seen it first hand). But it&#39;s important to recognize the difficult situation social media sites are in."</p>

This is something I&#39;ve been working on for the past couple of months and a concept that I think will be though provoking, if nothing else, to the HN community. If you want to read more on my thoughts and the story behind this, you can check out my blog post here: https://dev.to/duensing/introducing-slow-social-4a90Besides that, I&#39;m happy to answer questions and take criticism."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a much bigger problem than Heroku.There are countless SaaS applications asking for full-repo  access to Github (all the source code, with write access).- Productboard- Bugsnag- Sentry- Skylight- Percy- CodeTree- DataboxThere are heaps of others, these are just some on top the of my mind. A ticking supply chain attack waiting to happen, since these companies make themselves into alluring hacking targets.Most of them need access only to issues (a few need read access to code or recent commits, almost none need write).Solution:- Let customers give granular access (only issues, only read to source code, etc) when the integration is setup. This is possible with Github&#39;s APIs.- Try to use push instead of pull where possible, i.e. provide a CLI tool to use with Github actions or use Github&#39;s webhooks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Additionally, we recommend disconnecting Heroku from your GitHub repositories.I have respect for the Heroku/Salesforce Security team for willing to ask users to perform this action.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It might feel &#34;overengineered&#34; to people outside the Japanese society, but it actually just solves common issues here and it&#39;s not overengineering.
 The rotating mechanism is the easiest to see this.First, Kanji signs are more detailed than the alphabet and uneven lines can make it really ugly/hard to read. Same issue with breaking lead, causes ugliness.Second, traditionally handwriting in Japan have been seen as a way to measure one&#39;s upbringing; you can fake looks and style but if your handwriting is bad, that signals that your parents didn&#39;t raise you well. This was(and still is in some places) the reason resumes have to be handwritten.So tools that helps your handwriting had uses beyond just utility.(my handwriting is garbage and I&#39;m happy IT and tech jobs doesn&#39;t check this)"</p>

Bravo Jet Pens for avoiding that dark pattern."</p>

Their online storefront is very well put together, and above all their buyer team ensures they have mountains of imported variety in every category.It’s so nice to see someone doing something well.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very interesting article and statistical analysis, but I really don&#39;t see how it concludes that the DK effect is wrong based on the analysis. The fact that the DK effect emerges with _completely random data_ is not surprising at all - in this case the intuitive null hypothesis would be that people are good at estimating their skill, therefore there would be strong a correlation between their performance and self-evaluation of said performance. If the data weren&#39;t related, then this hypothesis isn&#39;t likely, which is exactly what DK means. And indeed if you look at the plots in the article (of the completely random data), they depict a world in which people are very bad at estimating their own skill, therefore, statistically, people with lower skills tend to overestimate their skills, and experts tend to underestimate it.Also wanted to point out that in general there is no issue with looking at y - x ~ x, this is called the residual plot, and is specifically used to compare an estimate of some value vs. the value itself.That being said, the author seems very confident in their conclusion, and from the comments seems to have read a lot of related analyses, so I might be missing something. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excerpt from a newer paper by Nuhfer (2017) adds more clarity:“… Our data show that peoples&#39; self-assessments of competence, in general, reflect a genuine competence that they can demonstrate. That finding contradicts the current consensus about the nature of self-assessment. Our results further confirm that experts are more proficient in self-assessing their abilities than novices and that women, in general, self-assess more accurately than men. The validity of interpretations of data depends strongly upon how carefully the researchers consider the numeracy that underlies graphical presentations and conclusions. Our results indicate that carefully measured self-assessments provide valid, measurable and valuable information about proficiency. …”https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312107583_How_Rando..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is correct.  The effect is statistical not psychological.  It emerges even from artificial data and occurs independently of the supposed psychological justifications even for data where those justifications are clearly removed.If you adjust the experiment design to avoid introducing the auto-correlation you get data that doesn&#39;t show the DK effect at all.  Some might take issue with the adjusted experiment as using seniority related categories like &#34;sophomore&#34; and &#34;junior&#34; as skill levels has its own issues. To show the DK effect is real you need to come up with a better adjusted experiment that avoids the autocorrelation while still generating data that generates the effect. It&#39;s unclear if that&#39;s possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ha, Flash Boys 2.0 was from 2019. This blog post is literally &#34;I read a thing from three years ago and have lost faith in something that I never believed in in the first place&#34;.As someone who knows and has worked with all the people involved with the write-ups referenced in this blog post, I can pretty confidently say that the author is way way behind here. There have been some insane advancements in recent years that would blow his mind.MEV harvesting is actually an insanely fascinating field of study, and it comes down to consensus in a world where information can only move as fast as the speed of light.Front-running is a general problem where, if you can find out that someone wants to buy something, and can buy it first and sell it to the person who actually want it at a premium. This gets really interesting in the blockchain space, because Miners (Validators) decide the order of transactions, and in some cases validators can be incentivized/coerced to move around transactions in a way that might be beneficial for certain users. This is what is referred to as &#34;Miner Extractable Value&#34;.Yes it&#39;s a problem, yes there are mitigations, yes there are fun and weird ways around those mitigations, etc.This is what happens when people are incentivized to take a really good hard look at what global consensus really means. At a high level, most users don&#39;t really need to know or care about any of it, but it exists as a parasitic force constantly extracting value from the network. Still, IMO the parasites that feed off MEV are at a significant disadvantage compared with those who feed of legacy financial networks (for more on that, you can read the actual Flash Boys book https://www.amazon.com/Flash-Boys-Wall-Street-Revolt/dp/0393...)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So Crypto Andys like to hand-wave about the risk of a 51% attack but consider this:&gt; This is in addition to the long-standing concentration of Ethereum mining power, with normally three and sometimes only two mining pools controlling over 50% of the mining power.There is further hand-waving about how Proof-of-Stake (over Proof-of-Waste) will magically fix these problems. But it&#39;s actually this PoW computing power that makes the network more resilient to hostile takeover.I&#39;ve heard it described that the attraction of Crypto is the essence of the American Dream: by getting rich by doing nothing while lauding how smart you are over other people. So much of Crytpo can be explained by Bitcoin FOMO. Everyone just jumps on the latest shitcoin or NFT because &#34;I&#39;m not missing out this time&#34;.Ultimately something has to create value or it will come crashing down. The only use case we really have is illegal activity. Some of that is justified on ethics grounds (eg bypassing capital controls in Venezuela). A lot of it is just shady.There&#39;s a ton of talk about the &#34;potential&#34;. So far the offshots (eg NFTs, Web3) are just ludicrous boondoggles in finding problems for a solution. I have doubts this will ever create value for the masses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While many contracts within Ethereum have clear flaws, that doesn&#39;t mean Eth as a whole is broken.Time bandit attacks go away once proof of stake finality arrives. Also, trading ought to be done in Layer 2s. Does MEV work on L2s?Re: certain token drops wasting lots of gas, it&#39;s up to the token authors to use an implementation that avoids gas wars.Once you go into claiming equivalences with P = NP, you&#39;ve lost me. Theoretical optimums are an academic game, in reality you can get 95% of the way there with heuristics.&gt; Because Ethereum transactions are programs, the halting problem means that it isn&#39;t possible to accurately predict the resources needed to execute them.Ah, more appeals to theory. They&#39;re programs with a low ceiling on the number of steps and possible codepaths. They barely even have loops half the time. Estimating isn&#39;t that hard in practice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"According to the original complaint, a few months after being interviewed by an FBI agent on returning from his trip to North Korea, Griffith had the following conversation over text messages:Griffith: I need to send 1 [REDACTED UNIT OF CRYPTOCURRENCY] between North and South Korea.
Other Guy: &#34;Isn&#39;t that in violations of sanctions?&#34;
Griffith: It is.A few day later, also in text messages to someone else:Someone: What interest does North Korea have in cryptocurrency?
Griffith: Probably avoiding sanctions... who knows.&#34;It looks like it wasn&#39;t just speaking at a conference after being denied permission from the US that got him in trouble, it looks like both before and after the trip he was working on a variety of ways to get the North Korean government more onboard with cryptocurrency, including discussions about mining ventures, moving funds in and out of the country, and offering connections with other cryptocurrency people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reposting it from the previous thread:He is the creator of WikiScanner https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WikiScanner https://www.reuters.com/article/us-security-wikipedia-idUSN1...He also created Tor2web with Aaron Swartz and used to work for the tor team.Seems like an interesting guy. It&#39;s a shame that this happened.The situation is kinda similar to the one with Bobby Fischer https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Fischer&#34;In 1992, he reemerged to win an unofficial rematch against Spassky. It was held in Yugoslavia, which was under a United Nations embargo at the time. His participation led to a conflict with the US government, which warned Fischer that his participation in the match would violate an executive order imposing US sanctions on Yugoslavia. The US government ultimately issued a warrant for his arrest. After that, Fischer lived as an émigré. In 2004, he was arrested in Japan and held for several months for using a passport that the US government had revoked. Eventually, he was granted an Icelandic passport and citizenship by a special act of the Icelandic Althing, allowing him to live there until his death in 2008.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of comments have said &#34;stay in therapy&#34; or &#34;quit therapy&#34;, but my immediate reaction is that maybe you have the wrong (ineffective) therapist and need to switch.My spidey sense went up when you mentioned what &#34;you told your therapist&#34;, full stop. I was at least expecting &#34;what my therapist responded&#34; or &#34;what my therapist told me that didn&#39;t work&#34;. That really (spidey sense, no evidence really) implies that your therapist is having low impact.I&#39;ve had half a dozen therapists in my life. What I realized is there&#39;s a huge difference between most therapists and good ones. With a typical therapist, not much happens, you phone it in and they don&#39;t notice or call you on it. A good therapist somehow has a way of listening and then catching you properly off guard at least once or twice a session. They can stare into your soul and see through your bullshit, even when you don&#39;t notice the bullshit you&#39;re saying. If you don&#39;t feel that incisiveness, perhaps it&#39;s time to start shopping for a new therapist.Therapy really is a 100x profession."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m in my late 20s, but I noticed that people live as if they are forever.They spend half of their life working for survival, preparing and planning for their (!) future.Some people die in the process and never live to see that future, 
but some people reach that point and become aware of the finite time that just elapsed.Having physical needs met is trivial in our society. 
Everything beyond is self imposed suffering by comparing oneself to others.But for what purpose? Just to have more than someone else? Just to be better than someone else?Nobody truly cares. Nobody cares about how fancy the technology is that someone built to make people click more ads online - even if that someone thinks he is doing god&#39;s work.We came to this earth naked and we will leave naked. Just like my parents did. Any material possessions and people will be left behind. Most of us will be forgotten 2 generations ahead or end up as UTF-8 characters on wikipedia.I can at least walk joyfully in the present and not suffer my imagination about the future. I can also make a conscious choice to not indulge in activities that destroy the planet for others. I don&#39;t think the older generations see it the way I do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes, you have reached the zenith of your career. Congratulations. You are self-sufficient and able to provide for the financial needs of your family. This is a true victory.Now, it is time to focus on people other than yourself. Most other advice on here is awful; it amounts to different directions to run on the hedonic treadmill.Instead, you have to give back now. What good is there to be done, that only you could do? What will be worse off if you don&#39;t lend a hand? This can range from finding better ways to support and mentor your children, to donating time to tutor students in programming, to building a well in Africa. Think hard about what you really care about, and then work hard to bring that into being."</p>
