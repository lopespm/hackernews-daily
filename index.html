								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was learning to program, I tried to make a toy artificial life evolution simulation. Particle organisms on a 2D plane had &#39;dna&#39; which was a list of heritable traits, like size, speed, number of offspring.  Bigger organisms could eat smaller organisms, but they burn energy faster. 0 energy = death. When two organisms of opposite gender collided and had sufficient energy, they&#39;d give some of their energy split among the offspring, with each offspring&#39;s &#39;dna&#39; values set to one of the parent&#39;s +/- 5%.As I was developing this, I hadn&#39;t figured out how I wanted to do food yet, so as an easy first step, I just had a constant amount of energy that was split amongst all organisms on the screen.  Lots of little dots buzzing around, was kind of neat but nothing too special. I left it to run overnight.When I came back I was very surprised:  previously i was running at about 30FPS - now it was running at about 4 seconds per frame.  The screen was filled with dense expanding circles of tiny slow organisms emanating from where organisms had mated and nothing else.My simulation evolved to outsmart my simple food algorithm: when food is divided equally among all organisms, the best strategy is to use minimal energy and maximize offspring count.  I had populated the world with a default offspring count of ~5 and they had evolved to the tens of thousands. The more offspring an organism had, the greater the amount of the energy pool would go to their offspring.It was a very cool &#34;Life, uh, finds a way&#34; moment - that such a simple toy simulation of evolution was able to find an unanticipated optimal solution to the environment I created overnight was very humbling and gave me a lot of respect for the power of evolution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;The Autoverse is an artificial life simulator based on a cellular automaton complex enough to represent the substratum of an artificial chemistry. It is deterministic, internally consistent and vaguely resembles real chemistry. Tiny environments, simulated in the Autoverse and filled with populations of a simple, designed lifeform, Autobacterium lamberti, are maintained by a community of enthusiasts obsessed with getting A. lamberti to evolve, something the Autoverse chemistry seems to make extremely difficult.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Permutation_City"</p>

electronic product or embedded software found in medical settings.For all the bravado about standing up to powerful interests, this shows you who the most powerful interests are in that space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I loosely quote Louis Rossmann, one of the issue of right to repair is that more and more companies (Apple leading the trend) are using slightly modified chips from manufacturers, and them make then sign contracts that prevent any part selling to anyone.So technically even you can replace those chips, you can&#39;t buy them.And next Apple if putting serial numbers to prevent that even if you get the part, you will have a non-functional device.This bill does not appear to address that.Besides, the &#34;information they need to repair&#34; is also where the devil will be. Companies like Apple provide instructions on how to unscrew the laptop cover with a screwdriver (literally), but won&#39;t provide any data sheets."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Normally the next step would be a vote on an identical bill in the state’s Assembly.But Thursday is the last day of session for the NY legislature, and the bill has not yet escaped committee, making a vote by the full Assembly unlikely.The battle for fair repair in New York will continue into next year’s session, with a strong record of success.So eventually... maybe."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Couldn&#39;t fit the whole tweet, so just to be clear, she&#39;s talking about manual, non-legal requests:&gt; One of the surprising things about working on the slander series is how few people in the field, even experts, know that Google voluntarily removes some search results. (No court order needed!) You have to visit this generic url: https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/3111061?...Down the thread, she adds this:&gt; Because so few people know about it, &#34;reputation managers&#34; are charging people like $500 a pop to &#34;remove damaging information from Google results.&#34; And ALL THEY DO is fill out that form for free. Someone tried to hawk this service to my husband after he came under attack.I didn&#39;t know about this service URL, and had just assumed &#34;reputation managers&#34;, if they did anything at all, were limited to SEO spamming.edit: Searched HN for mention of this link and found exactly 5 results, 3 of which look unique, and the earliest in Dec. 23, 2015:https://imgur.com/EEUJn9M"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to take this opportunity to share some relevant exercepts from In The Plex[^1] about Eric Schmidt, then-CEO of Google.&gt; One day Denise Griffin got a call from Eric Schmidt’s assistant. “There’s this information about Eric in the indexes,” she told Griffin. “And we want it out.” In Griffin’s recollection, it dealt with donor information from a political campaign, exactly the type of public information that Google dedicated itself to making accessible. Griffin explained that it wasn’t Google policy to take things like that out of the index just because people didn’t want it there. Principles always make sense until it’s personal,” she says.&gt; Then in July 2005, a CNET reporter used Schmidt as an example of how much personal information Google search could expose. Though she used only information that anyone would see if they typed Schmidt’s name into his company’s search box, Schmidt was so furious that he blackballed the news organization for a year.&gt; “My personal view is that private information that is really private, you should be able to delete from history,” Schmidt once said. But that wasn’t Google’s policy...I guess they&#39;ve since changed the policy a bit?[^1]: https://www.amazon.com/Plex-Google-Thinks-Works-Shapes/dp/14..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To Google&#39;s credit, it&#39;s literally the first search results for &#34;how do I remove myself from Google&#34;. It is a bit ironic that people looking to remove something for being too easy to find via search are being stymied by a simple search.Still, good to provide some visibility about it. I certainly never knew this was a thing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the mid-seventies at Swarthmore College, we were mired in punched card Fortran programming on a single IBM 1130. The horror, a machine less powerful than the first Apple II. My job six hours a week was to reboot after each crash. People waited hours for their turn to crash the machine. I let a line form once people had their printouts. I&#39;d find the single pair of brackets in a ten line listing, and I&#39;d explain how their index was out of bounds. They thought I was a genius. Late one Saturday night, I made a misguided visit to the computer center while high, smelled sweat and fear, and spun to leave. Too late, a woman&#39;s voice: &#34;Dave! I told Professor Pryor he needed you!&#34; We didn&#39;t know that Fred Pryor was the economics graduate student freed in the 1962 &#34;Bridge of Spies&#34; prisoner exchange. Later he’d learn that I was his beagle’s favorite human, and I’d dog-sit to find steaks for me I couldn’t afford, but for now I feared him. So busted! Then I heard this voice “See these square brackets? See where you initialize this index?” He was spectacularly grateful.One cannot overstate the rend in the universe that an APL terminal presented, catapulting me decades into the future. I quickly dreamed in APL. For $3 an hour for ten hours (a massive overcharge) I took a professor’s 300 line APL program translated literally from BASIC, and wrote a ten line APL program that was much faster. One line was classic APL, swapping + and * in an iterated matrix product for max and min. The other nine lines were input, output. The professor took years to realize I wasn’t also calling his code, then published my program.Summer of 1977 I worked as a commercial APL programmer. Normally one never hires college students for the summer and expects them to be productive. The New York-based vice president was taking the train every day to Philadelphia because the Philly office was so far underwater, and desperate to try anything to save himself the commute. He knew Swarthmore had a terminal, and heard about me. At my interview I made a home-run derby of the questions from the Philly boss. The VP kept trying to intervene so he could put me in my place before hiring me. The tough questions were “dead key problems”. How do you write the following program, if the following keys are broken?Our client was a mineral mining company, our task a reporting system. The reports were 2-dimensional projections of a 9-dimensional database. The accountants wanted all totals to be consistent across reports, and to be exactly the sums of their rounded components. I broke the news to our team that we needed to start over, rounding the 9-dimensional database once and for all, before generating each report. This took a few weeks; I wrote plenty of report generation helper routines. My coworkers overheard me say on a phone call that I was being paid $5 an hour, and at the time I didn’t understand which way they were shocked. I didn’t have much to do, the rest of the summer.The mining company VP found me one morning, to ask for a different report, a few pages. He sketched it for me. He found me a few hours later to update his spec. He loved the printout he saw, imagining it was a prototype. “It’s done. I can make your changes in half an hour.”At a later meeting he explained his own background in computing, how it had been key to his corporate rise. Their Fortran shop would take a month to even begin a project like I had knocked off in a morning, then weeks to finish it. He pleaded with me to pass on Harvard grad school and become his protege.Some Lisp programmers had similar experiences, back in the day. Today, APL just sounds like another exotic language. In its heyday it was radical."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back in university (1974), I took a course in AI. The prof wanted us to write a brute-force solution to solve the 8-queens problem -- any language!I wrote the solution in APL in about an hour and it only had 3 lines of code. The rest of the class spent days on their terminals and keypunches trying to solve it. Most solutions took hundreds of lines of code.I got a D from my professor. I questioned why and was told that it was unreadable, and that the solution was inefficient. This annoyed me because he didn&#39;t know APL, and I figured that  since I solved the problem in one hour, while the rest took days, it was very efficient.I protested the result with the department head (who liked APL) and ended up getting an A+. As you can imagine, all the rest of my assignments, written in a variety of languages, were graded by that AI prof with significant prejudice.I passed nonetheless. I loved APL and ended up working for one of the major APL providers as my first job out of school."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a theory on why we&#39;re seeing so much &#34;bad management&#34; for software engineers: most leaders at workplaces have not been engineers themselves at a company with a great engineering culture (I wrote about what I think this means [1]: it&#39;s all the high-growth small and large tech companies we know)The CEO, and the people under the CEO know and understand traditional, top-down management. Let the people with context and decision power make the big decisions, and pass this downwards. Works with finance, works with marketing, works with IT support, and should work with engineering as well... right?But it actually doesn&#39;t work with software engineers as well as it could. Or with designers. UX researchers. PMs... all these people would produce a magnitude more output when given proper context and autonomy.A few leaders read about this, and try giving autonomy. These results end up even worse than the status quo, as you can&#39;t just make it a free-for-all and expect it works overnight.And to prove this point: look at companies where the founder had worked at a high-performing company before. Before founding Twilio, Jeff Lawson spent years at Amazon (he was one of the first AWS PMs), and in his book Ask Your Developer, he writes about just how much this experience shaped him, and all the practices he adopted from Amazon.There&#39;s this really weird divide between &#34;forward-looking tech companies&#34;[2] who &#34;get it&#34;, and everyone else. Which heavily benefits this first group.[1] https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-developer-culture-tes...[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25717390"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In most companies, management is actually to blame for deliberately isolating engineers from discovering the customer&#39;s needs. News flash! Developers actually like the idea of figuring out and fulfilling needs with epic software solutions and are fairly neutral-to-downright-annoyed at spending their time creating something that no customer wants.I agree with the first statement but disagree with the second. Yes, management is often at fault for not involving or engaging developers. That said, I&#39;ve seen many really solid developers be motivated by solving complex technical challenges instead of work that actually creates business/product value. Of course, it&#39;s management&#39;s responsibility to harness that energy and align it with creating value... But just saying, a lot of really smart people are driven more by intellectual challenges than product impact."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Developers have opportunities to improve management by increasing management-visible headlines about user goals, and decreasing management-visible headlines about implementation details such as UI, WBS, wireframes, flowcharts, and tech.Try this thought experiment: Imagine you have team task list with headlines such as &#34;Add red button to top of home page&#34;. Imagine rewriting the headlines such as &#34;Customer wants to contact us&#34; and similar kinds of user stories.When managers continually see headlines with user emphasis, and do not see headlines with implementation details, then management improves and developer autonomy improves, because both groups are looking toward users.It turns out focus on user stories can help significantly, even more than some developers might intuit. Look at your task board headlines and the opening paragraphs of your management-visible writing-- can you improve your writing to emphasize user goals?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I disagree with so much of this! Though I can tell the author is coming from a lot of experience.How often is it that you don&#39;t know if you&#39;re expecting a map or a keyword list? I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever intentionally put myself in that situation (though it&#39;s nice that access supports both).They say to avoid piping result tuples, but I actually think their example code shows the strength and weaknesses of both approaches. I use pattern matching on tuples when you want more complicated behavior (that might be hard to read in a big else block for a with) and a nice with statement when there&#39;s &#39;one true path.&#39;In general, I think one of my favorite things about Elixir is that they&#39;ve done a good job of avoiding adding features you should never use. These all feel like personal judgements about tradeoffs rather than actual hard rules."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this article to bits. The elixir community loves blogging, but so much elixir content is absolute beginner stuff, and so much of the remainder is unopinionated, descriptive stuff. I&#39;ve found it really hard to strike on some good &#34;how to best do xyz, what are the tradeoffs&#34; style knowledge. This article is the first elixir thing I&#39;ve read in a long time that really made me go &#34;o wow yeah, I&#39;ve been doing that wrong&#34;. Cool stuff!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good stuff. I disagree about the first point, though, and have actually gone the opposite way, going from generic Access via `[]` to specific `Map.get` and `Keyword.get`.The reason is that the underlying data structures are quite different, and operations and access patterns on them shouldn&#39;t be agnostic.You should use Keywords basically only as options to functions, in my opinion, and that&#39;s just for historical consistency and interop with Erlang. Otherwise key-value pairs should be a map. And using `Keyword.get` and `Map.get` make it immediately obvious what the underlying data structure is, as well as prompt you to think about whether you should use the `!` version or provide defaults.Otherwise, I think the tips are all decent to great. I am a little on the fence with exceptions, though. I know there&#39;s a meme in the community of &#34;let it crash&#34;, but in my experience, that rarely feels like the right thing to do. I much prefer a Rust-style, &#34;Result-all-the-things&#34;. It seems hard, in practice, to rely on crashes and restarts to maintain the right state invariants."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you can afford a one off 1 second of latency for your SQL queries, then using logical replication with pgbouncer seems way easier :- setup logical replication between the old and the new server (limitations exist on what is replicated, read the docs)- PAUSE the pgbouncer (virtual) database. Your app will hang, but not disconnect from pgbouncer- Copy the sequences from the old to new server. Sequences are not replicated with logical replication- RESUME the pgbouncer virtual database.You&#39;re done. If everything is automated, your app will see a temporary increase of the SQL latency. But they will keep their TCP connections, so virtually no outage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Braintree (IIRC) had a really clever migration strategy, although I can&#39;t seem to find the blog post now.  They paused all traffic at the load balancer, cut over to the new DB, and then resumed traffic.  No requests failed, just a slight bump in latency while the LBs were paused.This app apparently had robust enough retry mechanisms that they were able just eat the errors and not have customer issues—Color me impressed!  I&#39;m not sure how many teams can make that claim; that&#39;s a hard thing to nail down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the areas where Postgres is so far behind MySQL is embarrassing. Zero downtime migrations in MySQL have been a common method for over 10 years. This solution is far from ideal due to the use of Triggers which can greatly increase the load on the database and slow down transactions. If you don&#39;t have a lot of load on your DB thats fine, but if you are pushing your DB this will bring it down.In MySQL they started with triggers with PT-OSC, but now there is GH-OST which does it with Replication. You can do something like this with Postgres by using Logical replication, but its still requires hand holding, and to my knowledge there is no way to &#34;throttle&#34; the migration like you can with GH-OST. Where I work now we are building all this out so we can have first class online migrations, but the chasm is still pretty big."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If this gets enough traction this could make historical maps so much more accessible. Instead of every historian writing their own magnum opus of a particular area and timespan, all the geographical information can be combined in a single system. Is there a system built in for keeping track of annotations/sources? How are debated topics/unresolved locations dealt with?What if different schools of thought exist for where something was in the past, could multiple hypothesized locations exist for a single object? Direct link with Wikipedia would also be usefulVery nice project, hope it becomes as useful and detailed as the present day OSM"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Being Dutch and a history-buff, I have one mayor gripe with historical maps, that sees land as &#39;moving lines&#39; on a fixed map. When I look at a historical maps (also in books), I often see the Netherlands represented in it&#39;s current form, i.e. containing land that is not even 50 years old, being prestent hundreds or even thousands of years. I get that it is an intricate history, and maybe too much effort in some cases, but please at least remove flevoland. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flevoland"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My favourite historical map resource on the internet is the National Library of Scotland&#39;s georeferenced side-by-side viewer: https://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/side-by-side/#zoom=5&amp;lat=56....View a variety of historical maps on the left, with the same area &#34;now&#34; on the right, with the pointer synced between the two sides so that you can trace roads, building outlines, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I might be missing something, but wasn&#39;t it part of the plan? Of course the goal was to offload the actual interpretation of the FLoC id to third-parties, as FLoC id themselves do not have any semantic signification.Not saying this is ok, but this was the plan from the beginning, being able to offload responsability far from Google. This article[1] actually shows what it&#39;s like for an advertiser.[1] :https://cafemedia.com/early-status-of-the-floc-origin-trials...EDIT: Did not finished the article before posting, they actually talk about cafemedia&#39;s work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is exactly how FLoC is supposed to work, and this is exactly what privacy watchdogs have criticized about it.The proper headline should be &#34;Ad tech films test FLoC&#34;."</p>
