								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can certainly see a lot of parallels with Oculus / Facebook.Perhaps unusually, I actually wanted FB to impress itself more strongly on Oculus post acquisition because, frankly, Oculus was a bit of a mess.  Instead, Oculus was given an enormous amount of freedom for many years.Personally, nobody ever told me what to do, even though I was willing to &#34;shut up and soldier&#34; if necessary -- they bought that capability! Conversely, I couldn&#39;t tell anyone what to do from my position; the important shots were always called when I wasn&#39;t around. Some of that was on me for not being willing to relocate to HQ, but a lot of it was built into early Oculus DNA.I could only lead by example and argument, and the arguments only took on weight after years of evidence accumulated.  I could have taken a more traditional management position, but I would have hated it, so that&#39;s also on me.  The political dynamics never quite aligned with an optimal set of leadership personalities and beliefs where I would have had the best leverage, but there was progress, and I am reasonably happy and effective as a part time consultant today, seven years later.Talking about &#34;entitled workers&#34; almost certainly derails the conversation.  Perhaps a less charged framing that still captures some of the matter is the mixing of people who Really Care about their work with the Just A Job crowd.  The wealth of the mega corps does allow most goals to be accomplished, at great expense, with Just A Job workers, but people that have experienced being embedded with Really Care workers are going to be appalled at the relative effectiveness.The communication culture does tend a bit passive-aggressive for my taste, but I can see why it evolves that way in large organizations.  I&#39;ve only been officially dinged by HR once for insensitive language in a post, but a few people have reached out privately with some gentle suggestions about better communication.All in all, not a perfect fairy tale outcome, but I still consider taking the acquisition offer as the correct thing for the company in hindsight."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"9 years @ Google, and I too came from a company acquired by Google. (In my case, Google did not keep our product or tech stack around, so.) And yes, I can say many Googlers are entitled. It&#39;s a fair descriptor. And the pace of work is slower than a startup. In general.And I too have many criticisms of Google. But.Google has entirely different revenue constraints. It can afford an entirely different way of working. That pace allows a more sustainable cadence of development. It can be a more humane place to work, in general.Google can on the whole accomplish its revenue goals without being a meat grinder. So why be one? I think there is a bit of a problem with this guy&#39;s POV where he&#39;s come to fetishize the actual process of the making of the sausage versus the sausage itself.Projects need not be run under insane stress if there&#39;s a steady supply of talent and money to make things happen. Google can afford that. Pace will be slower. Perhaps less competitive. But the core business continues to do excellently.For many of us Google is not an &#34;exciting&#34; place to work. But it&#39;s a pretty good job to have and it pays well and gives access to both great benefits and to interesting technology. And that compensation in _most_ people does yield a sense of responsibility for delivery. But maybe not the survival-of-the-fittest-meat-grinder panic that this guy somehow seems to love."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While he has valid points of how corp life is different from startup, he seems like a horrible, entitled person to work for.General attitude that comes out of it to me, is that your employees growth doesn’t matter, only his vision of product matters. He complains about people being entitled, and at the same time he complains that as CEO of subsidiary of one of the biggest company in the world, he cannot say offensive things in his talks.And most entitled one - he’s sold his company (that he actually didn’t own, from the beginning, like with most startups) and he cannot control it fully anymore? And complaining that he cannot fire people on the spot?He should check his entitlement before complaining about other being entitled by not wanting to put his product vision above their wellbeing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It feels a bit hypocritical when Apple laughs at FB for complaining about their new tracking pop-up yet when the shoe&#39;s on the other foot and Apple may actually have to compete on its own platform they double down and defend their right to be judge, jury and executioner.Apple competing with third party app stores on iOS is going to be amazing. No computer platform should be allowed to prevent sideloading or other stores from competing.This isn&#39;t the case on Windows.
This isn&#39;t the case on Android.Or Linux for that matter.It&#39;s more disappointing it takes 10 years for regulators to step-in and say &#34;that&#39;s bad, no more, open up your platform&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can hardly wait to use Amazon App Store to install Amazon and then open up the Epic Game Store to install random game and then open up EA Game Store to install random game and then open up Facebook App Store to install Facebook and then open up the Apple App Store to install the Blizzard App Store to install Hearthstone and then go back to the Apple App Store and update the Blizzard App Store so I can get the latest Hearthstone updates.Going to be super fun!My gaming computer is already filled with like 8 different app stores each completely different then the other and a variety of privacy/security issues on each. All of them need their App Store running in order to play their games, so half the time my computer has 4-5 App Stores running in the background so I can play a single game. And they are all electron/qt webkit apps cause nobody builds apps anymore so each one consumes about 500mb of ram.And each App Store also has their own chat system along with the others like discord.I don&#39;t agree that Apple should have a complete monopoly, but the alternative is not better. And while Android does have the main Google Play Store, and there isn&#39;t to many &#34;alternative&#34; App Stores at the moment. Just give it time, the same thing that is happening to TV Streaming/Game App Stores will happen on Android."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bit OT, but I still fail to grasp why Apple is allowed to restrict all browsers on iOS to the Safari rendering engine. Microsoft had to pay big because they didn&#39;t asked their users properly for alternative browsers, yet Apple doesn&#39;t even give other browsers a fair chance to compete on iOS.Consumers suffer because Apple controls about 50% of the mobile market and if Apple decides a certain feature will not be available in Safari (e.g. Push API), no other browser vendor can even offer a solution.Sounds to me like totally abusing their market position to uphold their anti-competitive behavior."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As usual, context matters. If you&#39;re trying to convey complex thoughts about abstract matters, then language is the way to do it. If you are trying to convey deep emotional states, then a photo or video is probably better. You cannot convert the 1st amendment into photos, and you cannot convert the Mona Lisa smile into words.Just try to use words to describe either of these photos and see how they fall short:https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-10/19/1...https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-10/19/1...Between recorded voice and written text, I personally prefer written language. I like the ability to consume at my own pace, go back and re-read tricky bits, and easily search or quote. Plus it&#39;s much easier to use TTS to convert text to speech than the other way around (at the moment). Maybe someday technology will remove this boundary but currently that&#39;s my stance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The question is whether these advantages are because text is a better communication medium, or because of the limitations of our technology?Take using a computer to type a word versus draw a picture: Effectively everyone who uses a computer can type a word, but I&#39;d bet less than 10% could draw a circle.But put a piece of paper in front of someone and effectively everyone can draw a circle.This points to there being a limitation in the technology for working with other forms of media, not the effectiveness of the communication medium itself.This isn&#39;t to say that text isn&#39;t also a better communication medium, but it is to say, until the technology has improved for communicating with other media, it&#39;s difficult to compare without basing the decision on the limitations of the technology.In other words, most of the perceived advantages of text are really advantages of text being easier to represent digitally (or generally reproduced, e.g., printing press), not advantages of text as a communication medium itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Text is not the oldest - nor easiest to use -, text is a heavy abstraction born somewhat recently in human history.The oldest and easiest is the visual in 3D, then comes the visual in 2D.Those exist since we have eyes.Our brain have dedicated and sizeable infrastructure for that. Children can communicate in 3D (gestures, posture, expressions, objects) and in 2D drawings before learning textural communication with great effort.Text is more regular and reliable in certain contexts (not always, sometimes a pictogram or others are better), when the circumstances are proper for that.Text has its uses, just like all the other forms, not being paramount, not at all!(I&#39;d also argue about that we could read old texts. Sometimes yes, but sometimes we cannot read present ones neither if the cultural and knowledge background is inadequate. Which is just aggravated by the ages)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Imagine having a business model so fragile that your only line of  defense is to obscure the cancellation process through these tactics. Do they really think that they can curve their churn this way?I mean best you’re doing is getting maybe another month or so of revenue from a customer who is just pushing the pain of cancelling because they are busy or lazy.And at the end instead of getting what could be a dormant customer who can sign up later again, what you get is someone who hates your company.What an incredibly stupid way to erode the brand of a publication, whose major asset to survive is precisely its brand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a similar issue with the Wall Street Journal a few years back, and despite having spent the majority of my career working on Wall Street, I’ll never buy a subscription again.I signed up for a really good deal for 6 months of digital + paper delivery, but my paper always arrived a day or two late, so before my 6 months were up I tried to cancel, but couldn’t figure out a way to do so on their website. I messaged support asking them to not renew my subscription, and told them that the paper always arrived late. They responded back that they were going to give me a free subscription until they could figure out the paper delivery. I should have held firm and cancelled, but it seemed lke they were trying to provide good customer service.Nothing changed with delivery, and I followed up a few times to see what was going on. I was told they were looking into it.One day, out of the blue, I received a large bill from them. I called to see what was going on and I was told that my trial was up and since I hadn’t cancelled that it had renewed. A proceeded to tell the about my problems with delivery and that customer service was supposedly working on fixing the problem and not charging me until they could. The person on the phone told me that that’s not possible since they don’t provide same-day delivery to my address. I recounted exactly what had happened, and they basically told me I was a liar, and would not refund the charge because the user agreement says they don’t have to, even though I called within a few hours of the new charge and subscription renewal.The part that really stung was that I was a PhD student and could get an entire year for less than what they charged me for a month. I’ve never had a company treat me so poorly before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just cancelled and it was relatively painless, to their credit.When they asked the reason, I said that political coverage was unfair. Left is OK, unfair is not.I don&#39;t consider myself &#34;on the left&#34; but I really don&#39;t mind a publication being left of center or right of center. If it&#39;s good, I will pay for it (I subscribed tp The Atlantic at least twice, and the New Yorker once, and probably others in a mix of print and digital).But the NYT has drifted too far down the path of politically-correct fashions, and away from robust debate and discussion of challenging topics and how they intersect with real events.It feels more like they want to persuade me to hold a set of opinions (which shifts rapidly), rather than informing me and letting me form my own. &#34;Persuade&#34; is even the wrong word; more like &#34;pressure&#34; or &#34;coerce&#34;. If it&#39;s all ads, so be it; but when I pay, I expect that I am the customer and not the product. So I don&#39;t pay as of the end of my billing cycle.Also, the NYT cheers on, and even participates in bullying. Scott Alexander being a recent example, but there are a lot more when it comes to politically-charged topics.I should reiterate that this is not a right-left thing. I would have remained subscribed if the NYT had simply drifted left, and concerned itself mainly with arguments betweed various left-of-center factions. Lots of worthwhile things to discuss and debate there, and lots of events to tie it to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am sorry about the position you&#39;re in. For the last several years I have been balancing taking care of my terminally ill wife who recently passed away, all while working remotely in the web hosting industry. It&#39;s hard to balance. Harder than you think. Setting boundaries will be vital to being successful in any WFH role.Now that that&#39;s out of the way: You need to focus. You&#39;ve described your abilities and that&#39;s fine, but you lack focus. Your qualifications are great, but your presentation is all over the place. You need a single one page resume that focuses on one aspect of your knowledge and experience, and lightly mentions the others. Make multiple resumes, each with a focus on one thing. Use the resume that&#39;s best for the job. I recently saw somebody who must have had 20 different resumes to match the jobs they were applying for. It worked.Also, you might consider looking into the Web Hosting business. If your temperament is as you describe, and you like talking on the phone or live chat, most web hosts will overlook any technical gaps. Those can be taught. In fact that can lend to your focus! Focus on the fact that you know things that can&#39;t be taught: Customer Service, talking down angry customers, talented writing, friendly and always willing to find a solution under dire circumstances. Those are GOLD. Once those are on the table, the rest is negotiable. I&#39;ll email you a link to at least one that is hiring full remote entry level.Additionally, you need to step up your confidence level. Let an employer know that your family is important to you and that you&#39;re dedicated to working hard so that you can support them- and leave it at that. They don&#39;t deserve the other details, and they aren&#39;t relevant.I hope this helps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey anon, I feel for you, and most of the answers here are giving you a 12-month plan when you need a 1-month plan.If you know Linux well enough to configure Wordpress, how about tech support for a hosting company?  Try making some short email approaches to old-school hosting companies (I used to run one).  They might be flexible enough to take a chance depending on how confident your approach is.They have lots of customers bashing away at Linux, making mistakes, often without the patience to see their own problems through.  Their business problem is that these customers need hand-holding but only pay a fixed, monthly fee.  (the hope is eventually they stop asking and keep paying for years).The combination you can offer those companies could be basic Linux knowledge (no need for advanced cloud stuff) and whatever flexibility you can offer them - especially if they&#39;re not in your time zone.The larger ones might be a tall order, all listing locations by default (Gandi, Leaseweb, GoDaddy, Hetzner etc.), but maybe someone here will have an inside track.I agree with other posters - never mention difficult circumstances in a job application, particularly a cold application.  Just talk about how keen you are to solve their difficult customers&#39; problems, how well you work in a team, and keep the initial approach brief.Good luck! And please update us if you can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One more angle since I haven’t seen anyone mention it.Instructions on how to bootstrap a software portfolio:Pick a language (sounds like you chose JS which would be my pick as well), buy a copy of cracking the coding interview, make a leetcode.com account, make a codepen.io account, and get to work.If you’re smart and dedicated you can teach yourself this stuff and these are the best tools to help you in my opinion.Spend your time solving problems on leetcode and then utilizing these techniques in codepen portfolio pieces.In my opinion with serious dedication you can have a junior swe worthy resume and portfolio put together within a year.[edit] since the question inevitably comes up with JS in my opinion you should not spend any time focusing on front end frameworks. Learn Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS, you will blow your interviewers away if you can solve their problems without a framework and it is overhead you don’t need as a beginner."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I previously submitted this story a few days ago[1], where it garnered some discussion and a bit over 100 upvotes, but never made the front-page due to some down-weights in HN&#39;s algorithm. I&#39;m reposting this story at Daniel&#39;s suggestion. He agreed it deserved a second chance to break out.--I noticed that it&#39;s commonly accepted that Bloomberg&#39;s 2018 stories on the Supermicro hack were bogus, costing them a huge amount of reputational damage. However, Bloomberg stood by the stories. I&#39;m very curious to see how this one will be received. I was never quite convinced by the naysayers or the denials by the government, Apple, or Amazon. I think it&#39;s quite likely that Bloomberg will be proven right in the end, this story having been accurate but suppressed for &#34;secrecy&#34; reasons all along.Notably, one of the criticisms at the time was that Bloomberg didn&#39;t name credible sources with first-hand accounts of the events — understandably given the sensitivity. This time, it seems they have been able to do so.Either way, I&#39;m thrilled to see an outlet do original reporting and stand by their work in the face of universal condemnation. We are better off for having strong dissenting views informing us and expanding the narrative. I&#39;m finding myself increasingly distrustful of the work of journalism outlets, but this (and those gone independent on Substack) gives me hope.[1]: Previous discussion here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26112436"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its weird to see a follow-up to this that doesn&#39;t even begin to acknowledge the broad skepticism of claims except for saying that the previous push-back from the alleged targets was a drop in the bucket.I don&#39;t doubt there are highly-targeted supply chain attacks that happen at the whims of state level actors but the specifics presented by this and its previous reporting still are difficult at best to believe with the reporting as it is presented."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an incredible visualization! Thanks for detailing how you tiled their huge dataset too. Packing the data into RGB channels as you did is really powerful - I&#39;ve only seen this done for elevation tiles. Do you have a code link to how you&#39;re performing the cursor-brush aggregations?This seems like it could be an awesome application of an cloud-optimized geotiff (COGs) for serverless tiling. I&#39;m curious if you ran across this tech in your research?I&#39;m not sure where your project will take you, but I&#39;d encourage you to continue! I got a lot of exposure to the vis.gl community when I worked at Uber, and still contribute - Here are some relevant links you may get ideas from.COG demo: landsat8.earthGPU tile processing: https://kylebarron.dev/deck.gl-raster/overview/Elevation tile decoding (also uses workers): https://loaders.gl/modules/terrain/docs/api-reference/terrai..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Crazy to see just how dense Europe is -- I&#39;ve been a few times and always assumed I was just &#34;in the popular areas&#34;, that&#39;s why there wasn&#39;t any open land. But no, CA for instance has many swaths of &lt;1k towers at the zoom level I tried, and to find similar density in Europe required going all the way over to rural Turkey/Belarus/Ukraine region. Pretty much all of the western European countries were entirely 10k+ at that same zoom level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m fond of https://www.cellmapper.net/ for a more local view. It&#39;s helpful for answering questions like &#34;why do my calls always drop when I drive into region X?&#34; and &#34;why is coverage shit in this area?&#34;, also &#34;what cell carrier should I get if I plan to move to X?&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is incredible. I&#39;ve been wanting a piece of software to stream high quality, low latency mac audio to my iphone, so I can use my headphones wirelessly while working. I&#39;ll have to play with it more, but I was set up in mere minutes and it works at extremely low latency.The fact that this does bidirectional audio is icing on the cake; can&#39;t wait to share this with some quarantined bands.Magic, well done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll chime in with the same intense positivity. In the early days of the quarantine I set up a &#34;walk in theater&#34; on my property where I wanted friends to be able to watch the film without bothering my neighbors with a massive stereo system. The natural option was headphones and I chose between setting up an FM transmitter and trying to get everyone to buy a walkman... or... trying to come up with a network streaming solution. I found the open source implementation of VBAN and tried to write a python script to launch the server and manage finding new connections. It failed absolutely miserably and I ended up setting up an amplified audio system in the rain, much to the trouble of my neighbors also.Needless to say, I love this. The only thing that&#39;s stopping it from being truly wonderful is an Android app &lt;3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ooh this looks great! I designed a pair of nice 3D printable headphones [1] and my plan was to make them Wifi headphones so I could roam the house while listening to them. I made a battery powered raspberry pi zero with a nice DAC and set up shairport sync as an Apple Airplay device. That works fine for Spotify, but there’s instances (watching videos while walking in and out of the office) where the latency is a problem. Maybe this will work for me![1] https://github.com/tlalexander/reboot-headphones"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case the title might lead to you expect he&#39;s arguing for the rules for social media influencers to be loosened to match those of movies and TV and radio, it is actually the opposite. He argues that those other media should also have the stricter disclosure requirements that current only apply to social media.The video is fairly long (about 30 minutes), but goes into a lot of the history of advertising (explicit, product placements, paid endorsements, etc) in radio, TV, and movies in order to make a thorough case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Depends on your country; I&#39;m quite happy with the UK&#39;s restriction on adverts, including a ban on advertising prescription meds at all, and restrictions on product placement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tom Scotts channel is pretty much filled with short, nerdy and well-made videos. Highly recommended."</p>
