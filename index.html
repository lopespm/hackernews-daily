								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You really don&#39;t need anything fancy to implement a queue using SQL. You need a table with a primary id and a &#34;status&#34; field. An &#34;expired&#34; field can be used instead of the &#34;status&#34;. We used the latter because it allows easy retries.1. SELECT item_id WHERE expire = 0. If this is empty, no items are available.2. UPDATE SET expire = some_future_time WHERE item_id = $selected_item_id AND expire = 0. Then check whether UPDATE affected any rows. If it did, item_id is yours. If not, loop. If the database has a sane optimizer it&#39;ll note at most one document needs locking as the primary id is given.All this needs is a very weak property: document level atomic UPDATE which can return whether it changed anything. (How weak? MongoDB could do that in 2009.)Source code at https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal/-/blob/9.2.x/core/... (We cooked this up for Drupal in 2009 but I am reasonably sure we didn&#39;t invent anything new.)Of course, this is not the fastest job queue there is but it is quite often good enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Redis to me is the magic solution to solve so many complex multiple process syncing issues, a global lock, rate limiter, uniqueness with a set, stasher of all the temporary things… no migration, quick solution to complex problems- streams of events to organize pending tasks, etc… to me it’s all about the temporal / temporary state my application needs to keep track in order to work in a multiuser - multiprocess and multi service environment… just a different tool for a different job then what I would use a database for… but really it’s computer science, to each is their own"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think one of the biggest advantages of using Redis for job queing vs Postgres comes down to library support.For example Python has Celery and Ruby has Sidekiq. As far as I know there&#39;s no libraries in either language that has something as battle hardened with comparable features for background tasks using Postgres as a backend.There&#39;s a big difference between getting something to work in a demo (achievable by skimming PG&#39;s docs and rolling your own job queue) vs using something that has tens of thousands of hours of dev time and tons of real world usage.I&#39;m all for using PG for things like full text search when I can because it drastically reduces operation complexity if you can avoid needing to run Elasticsearch, but Redis on the other hand is a swiss army knife of awesome. It&#39;s often used for caching or as a session back-end so you probably have it as part of your stack already. It&#39;s also really easy to run, uses almost no resources and is in the same tier as nginx in terms of how crazy efficient it is and how reliable it is. I don&#39;t see not using Redis for a job queue as that big of a win."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you happen to have a VR headset and are looking to play around with the toys described in the article, I recommend VTOL VR. It has pretty low system requirements, and takes advantage of VR to create a virtual hotas (It is much more effective than you would expect). The physics simulation is, to my understanding, very good. And everything described in this article is present in the game to be played around with.VTOL VR taught me about &#34;Radar Notching&#34;. The article briefly mentions how radar can actively detect the doppler shift of targets. If you think about it, the doppler shift of the ground would be neutral, right? Or roughly the speed of the aircraft. So lets say you&#39;ve been locked on by a fighter at high altitude and they&#39;ve fired a radar seeker at you. Your backdrop is the ground, it can pick you out because you&#39;re moving so fast. So what you do is bank your aircraft to fly at a 90 degree angle to the oncoming missile. Now your doppler shift is the same as the ground and you blend in, the radar filters out the ground because of it&#39;s expected speed, which is now the relative speed you are moving. You get &#34;notched out&#34;, and the missile will lose track."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The strength of the radar is plotted as distance from the center — the closer to the center, the stronger the detected radar signal, and therefore possibly the closer the transmitting aircraft.I believe this is wrong, the computer actually determines what are most pertinent threats and puts it on the inner circle and puts the rest on the outer circle.. The inner band (critical) is generally missiles in flight
. The middle band (lethal) is for radars actively tracking you
. The outer band is classified as non-lethal since these are radars searching for you, not actively tracking you.&gt; RWR also has an audio component. Each time a new radar signal is detected, it is converted into an audio wave and played for the pilot. Because different radars &#34;sound&#34; different, pilots learn to recognize different airborne or surface threats by their distinctive tones.Pretty sure this is wrong too, they all emit the same tones for tracking and another tone for searching tone...watch this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOLk_Je0NKg"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Becoming more religious has helped me identify religious tendencies in the secular world. Ideology doesn’t imply supernatural deities, and some worldly phenomenon can be elevated to a supernatural level.  Secular belief contains rituals, origin stories, deities, saints, priesthood, blasphemy, vice &amp; virtue just as religion does.One aspect of religion I appreciate is that these aspects are well codified and debated – i.e. much more explicit.In the secular world these aspects exist but they are implicit, making them difficult to debate and attack.Few people understand that most religions e.g. Judaism and Christianity have an apologetic discipline – a deliberate arm open to debate.The secular world would benefit from adopting more formal definitions of their belief system. I think that would reduce the conflict and neurosis that comes from engaging a nebulous system.If you believe you are not religious, it just means that you don’t have the cognitive tools to recognize the secular ideology that you have adopted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to point out that this is incorrect:&gt; It’s rare to hear someone accused of being un-Swedish or un-British—but un-American is a common slur, slung by both left and right against the other. Being called un-American is like being called “un-Christian” or “un-Islamic,” a charge akin to heresy.In fact to be unswedish is not just a common idiom it’s a positive one. It’s when you don’t show the typical negative Swedishness. You aren’t “accused” of it, you are congratulated.“-I went to say hello to all the neighbors in my building. -What a nice and unswedish thing to do!”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The themes here remind me of another politics-is-the-new-religion article by David French, &#34;America Is in the Grips of a Fundamentalist Revival&#34;. [1]In it he draws a distinction between religion and fundamentalist religion (which the author has a background with), with a key quality of the latter being a lack of a sort of humility, a certainty that they&#39;re right.  Which in turn leads them to be less tolerant of opposing viewpoints - because (in their view) they can see right and wrong so clearly, it pulls them to the position that &#34;error has no rights&#34;.That being said, I think it is easy to pay too much attention to the extremes.An analysis of the US&#39;s political problems is out of scope of a HN comment, but one thing I did recently was read books by two prolific authors on the US left and right [2] (who each have historically been aligned with one of our two political parties).  They both contained opposing narratives covering the last 100 years or so, but what was very interesting was how they both overlapped around certain key historical/political events.I think reading these books was quite helpful for my understanding of US politics in a way that isn&#39;t really covered by the news cycle (in the future, I&#39;d like to spend more time reading these sorts of books and less time on news).[1] https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/america-is-in-the-grip...[2] Paul Krugman&#39;s &#34;The Conscience of a Liberal&#34; and Charles Murray&#39;s &#34;By the People&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Men are not doing as well as women in school.  If you look in the wrong places on the internet, media, or daily life, all you see is negativity towards masculinity.  In addition, there doesn&#39;t appear to be any broad social system that is geared towards supporting men.  The fact that men don&#39;t tend to be a socially adept doesn&#39;t help.  This all feels like the perfect storm and there are plenty of people who act like &#34;men have had it coming and deserve any ensuing suffering&#34;.  I don&#39;t know how to fix this but I am sure glad I am no longer a young man."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got two nephews aged 34 and 32 who still live at home and play video games all the time and rarely leave their rooms. Neither has ever had a job that lasted more than a month or so. Neither ever learned to drive even though they live in a town with little or no public transit. They haven&#39;t had any education beyond high school. They seem wholly unprepared to navigate life without their parents. It&#39;s a slow motion tragedy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see this on the fringes of those within my circle of friends. I know one man in this age cohort who doesn&#39;t seem to have a job, just plays video games all the time, and I don&#39;t get it. But one thing I think about is what he has been exposed to: this is what he knows. I don&#39;t think this individual I&#39;m speaking of was raised with anything differently.In this same light, as I believe the two concepts are directly related: another friend of mine basically refuses to date anymore because he thinks the sort of culture of Tinder dating is a waste of time that favors women disproportionately.I suspect all of this is primarily cultural first, and not related specifically to work, the economy, pricing of good or services like buying a home and starting a family, which would come second.That being said, if we were just talking about young single men, well, of course they&#39;re staying at home. It makes no economic sense to move out and get an apartment. The cost of living in major metros makes renting nearly equivalent to paying a mortgage. Except no one is building affordable homes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article suggests that you should not play too aggressive and not take continents too early (maximizing Reinforcing Feedback), because other players will then unite against you (Balancing Feedback).However, this article fails to understand that in Risk, most players are not willing to unite. In fact, if player A and player B decide to unite against me and player A had his turn and stopped me, player B is highly likely to backstab player A and then emerge as the winner.I&#39;ve found that playing very aggressively, and really get as many continents as possible within the first few turns, is the best way to win the game. I always win if I can get 2-3 continents in the first few turns, and if I fail then the game is usually won by whomever did manage to do just that.Being a turtle or &#34;mongolian horde&#34; as we call it can be interesting, but your only viable strategy is to wait for an opening while everyone else stockpiles their continental forces. If you wait too long, you&#39;re just an annoyance to the other players, but you don&#39;t actually have a good chance to win."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In our gaming group, we decided Risk just isn&#39;t that good of a game. It&#39;s old and clunky and extremely long, there are 100 other better board games now. Our main plays have been Dominion, DnD, Gloomhaven, Wingspan, and Crokinole, all of which we greatly prefer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This author doesn&#39;t have much experience with competitive gaming and it&#39;s quite obvious. This is only a strategy he devised to play against his friends and relatives, most probably. He assumes a lot of player behavior, and what other explanation could there be? His bathtub example is very bad because there ain&#39;t no players, and when there&#39;s players the meta absolutely depends upon who you are playing against. there&#39;s not such a thing as an optimal universal strategy at all, in fact it makes a player predictable and low-skilled in most competitive games.Systems thinking without game philosophy understanding is very shallow.To illustrate my point of the strategy being entirely reliant upon opponents (meta): in cs:go, most unexperienced players will go through a hot spot (that&#39;s probably being targeted by pre-positioned opponents) without jumping, making themselves easy targets. this is the behavior you will find in low ranks. eventually, some of the players will learn that jumping may be a good tactic in these situations instead, to make it harder for opponents to hit headshot, and behavior becomes very common in mid-ranks. Eventually, though, mid-rank players will start to notice this tendency to jumping, and will position their crosshairs looking for a jumping headshot - they will progress in rank by doing so. At high-ranks, however, a lot of times it is expected that your opponent will be waiting for a jumping cross, and therefore the low-rank behavior would be the best one: don&#39;t jump. In conclusion, it&#39;s impossible to point out the best possible behavior without knowing who you&#39;re playing against and their skill in the game."</p>

It’s entirely unsurprising that academics raise academics, doctors doctors, Olympians Olympians, teachers teachers, etc.It’s equally unsurprising that the ambitious children of highly educated and prosperous families themselves pursue such a similar path and achieve similar outcomes. I’m an engineer and my spouse a scientist. Our kids have commensurately higher chance to pursue one of those or a closely related field due to exposure and biases."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Copyright 1991. This was probably making the rounds of homeschooling circles I hung out in.We tend to do a sucky job of teaching math to kids. A lot of elementary school teachers are women who were encouraged to go into early education because they weren&#39;t doing so well in math and this is very much gender bias.My ex husband wasn&#39;t good at math. No one told him he should spend his days teaching little kids because of it. He was a career soldier and he just got tutored in college (by me) for his math classes. He was just expected to work at it if it didn&#39;t come naturally and he did.So we just culturally pass around this idea that math is scary and little kids can&#39;t learn it rather than going &#34;Well, adults just need to up their game and, by god, explain it better.&#34;My oldest was math phobic by the time I pulled him out of school to homeschool. My one and only goal for math was to get him over his phobia.He loves physics. I hate calculus. Calculus makes sense to him and he has read calculus books for fun.I was good at explaining the math to him and he learned lots of solid math concepts even though he likely has dyscalculia and isn&#39;t good at crunching the numbers. But I got the concepts through to him and that&#39;s more important.He&#39;s what gets called &#34;calculator dependent&#34; in some circles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve taught 7-year olds, rich kids specifically in technology magnet program.The pre-requisite information necessary for this would be way above their heads. Adding fractions, conceptualizing fractions to graphs, graphing functions... and that&#39;s just the first part!Most 7-year olds can barely conceptualize fractions. First/second grade math curriculums are centered around basic multiplication, shape recognition and counting.7-year olds aside, I don&#39;t even think most of the high-schooler freshmen I&#39;ve taught would be able to grasp this content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know how I feel about this.  I&#39;ve always been good at math, and was one of five kids (out of class of 120) that took Calculus as a senior in high school in the early 1990&#39;s.  To even take Calculus as a senior, you had to have taken four years of math in the previous three years.  I was even the HS Math Champion&#34; for my state.However, when I took Calculus in High School, it was taught similarly to this.  Lots and lots and lots of math foundations, infinite series, areas under curves, and I was able to trudge through it but I didn&#39;t really grasp what it all meant or why I was doing it.  Finally, about 2/3 of the way through the year, I was working on a problem and had an &#34;oh, shit, this is just about how things are changing&#34;.  It was a Eureka moment, and entirely based on such a simple statement that was never brought up in lectures or our crusty 1960&#39;s texbook."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From How To Save a Planet, a podcast I like:Alex Blumberg: ...and, [pipeline company] Enbridge says, stopping the pipeline won&#39;t stop the development of tar-sands oil. The oil will just travel in less safe ways, like by rail.Ayana Elizabeth Johnson: But Tara says that argument is missing the entire point.[Attorney and activist] Tara Houska: The idea is always like, you know, we&#39;re replacing old ones that are leaking. How about instead of replacing them and expanding them—which is what you&#39;re actually doing—you decommission the old one and pull it out of the ground and clean up the earth that you&#39;ve contaminated?Ayana: I like that option better.Tara: And there&#39;s always, like, this premise of, well, it&#39;s gonna get shipped anyway. No, it&#39;s not. Like, that&#39;s the whole point. No, it&#39;s not. Your industry is on its way out. And that&#39;s the point. And we all know that. You can&#39;t sit there and say, &#34;Oh, well, it&#39;s gonna go by rail or it&#39;s gonna go by ship anyway. No, it&#39;s not. The tar sands are on their way out. And that&#39;s the reality.https://gimletmedia.com/shows/howtosaveaplanet/76h4r25"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oil pipelines do one thing - transport oil. Not water, not milk, not corn syrup. Just oil.Rail can transport anything. Containers, tankers, even rocket booster segments.Yes, we&#39;re absolutely taking a short term hit, but investing in general purpose infrastructure that can be adapted for new technology and demands is a good thing. The continental rail network started off with coal powered steam trains, then diesel, now diesel-electric and even some pure electric locomotives. Maybe this century it will evolve past fossil fuels as well.So yes, cancel the pipeline, but in its place invest in the safety and reliability of rail networks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see how we can ever get off oil practically and environmentally friendly without more nuclear energy generation capacity in the US and globally.https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-05/global_em...https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/Electric...https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/styles/medium/pub...https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/2016-05/global_em...https://c.files.bbci.co.uk/16D76/production/_108485539_optim...Transportation is 14% which is not insignificant. But EV transport still requires charging from the powerplant, materials, mining, disposal. I am hopeful we will overcome them but we will exchange pollution problems for new different pollution problems."</p>
