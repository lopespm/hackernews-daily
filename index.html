								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Summary:1. Capital Gain taxes are delayed until you actually sell the stock.2. Corporate taxes are being reduced because companies are moving profits to foreign jurisdictions.3. Estate taxes &amp; income taxes are being avoided by the creation of charitable foundations.The 2nd and 3rd points are very valid, and I wish the author had spent more time on them.  Unfortunately instead, the author spends much more time on point 1, conflating wealth with income, and avoiding the obvious argument that capital gains are eventually taxed - the rich are not escaping that....unless point 3 (foundation) occurs.  And that should be the main story.Squabbling over a wealth tax is not useful.  The real issue is that the super rich create these personal &#34;foundations&#34; that act as never-taxed income holes, and then use them as personal and political tools.In total, there&#39;s nothing very revealing about this article.  It&#39;s everything we&#39;ve already known.  IMO, we need to curb foreign tax havens, and severely limit tax exemptions for charitable donations.A more interesting question is how did ProPublica get a copy of Jeff Bezos&#39; tax returns.  Seems like a leak at the IRS?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article does not conflates income and wealth, stop saying that. This is NOT what it says. 
Thats&#39; the whole damn point, they say that the system &#34;tax the income&#34; is flawed because it allows to borrow as much as your wealth allows, and live your life exactly as if you had that in income, without ever paying the income tax.I am quoting &#34;Their wealth derives from the skyrocketing value of their assets, like stock and property. Those gains are not defined by U.S. laws as taxable income unless and until the billionaires sell&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unless you are a wage or salary earner, it is trivially easy to avoid having to pay taxes, at least in the USA. Same with the much lauded “inheritance tax” and even, to a lesser extent, sales taxes. It costs about 4000us a year to maintain the legal structures required to pay essentially no taxes, except sales taxes in some locations.  In many cases, for lower levels of income, just having a small business can negate income tax burdens.Taxation always has been, and continues to be, a burden for the servile class to bear. The rich or enterprising pay taxes only when they are ill prepared or choose to, often to reduce scrutiny.The &#34; I should pay more taxes&#34; rhetoric from the wealthy is merely virtue signaling, it is totally legal to pay more taxes than you owe, and you can even reclaim the money later if you need to. There is nothing preventing anyone from paying the taxes that they feel that they should owe, in excess of legal requirements.By and large, sales taxes are more evenly applied, but that too is far from perfect."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If we ignore all this culture war bullshit for a minute there&#39;s a really fascinating issue here.The concrete issue is flight search. When you google &#34;flight from a to b&#34;, rather then seeing search results linking to websites for flight search, the first thing you see is the results of Google&#39;s own flight search. Is that wrong? What about image search? When you search for &#34;skyline berlin&#34;, you&#39;ll see images of berlin&#39;s skyline, before you see links to other image search sites.Same is true for a lot other stuff. If you search &#34;timer&#34;, you&#39;ll see a timer, not links to various timers that look ugly as shit.As a consumer, I love it. So much easier.On the other hand, google could take over almost any business like this. At least, any business that is &#34;functional&#34; in the sense that the only thing you really want is to get some output based on your input.There&#39;s a clear tradeoff here between what&#39;s good for consumers, and concerns about democracy, the concentration of power, etc.. And also innovation. Why start a new company, if google can just take over everything?There are only two clear, non-arbitrary rules: Search engines are only allowed to show a list of links, or search engines can show whatever they want."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Terraform is such an underappreciated tool. It seems like so much of the hate surrounds HCL1 (back in Terraform before 0.12) and doesn&#39;t reflect modern Terraform.For example, after introducing `for_each` and dynamic blocks, it&#39;s possible to nearly entirely ditch variables files and local modules, and just add more infrastructure by editing a local YAML file. The only variables your Terraform code should have should be credentials / other secrets that are not loaded from environment variables by providers. A great public example of this usage pattern is supplied by https://github.com/concourse/governance to manage their GitHub repositories."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats to the talented people at Hashicorp.I love Terraform and have used it for years (before 0.12 I think). The workflow, meaningful diffs and reproducible &#39;infrastructure-as-code&#39; gave a user experience that really was a massive step up to what I was used to (basically cloud console and scripts in CI).In fact the Terraform workflow / philosophy inspired some of the design of an OSS &#39;data-as-code&#39; tool (https://www.getsynth.com/) that we&#39;re building a company around. We wanted to use HCL instead of JSON for our config to start off with, but the Rust HCL parsers when we started the project weren&#39;t really robust so we settled.Anyway, congratulations Hashicorp!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been sitting on the fence wrt Terraform and other such tools for quite some time now. After being _forced_ to finally write massive k8s YAML files (and ansible YAML files) for a consulting gig, I&#39;ve been wondering whether these tools should be developed as _libraries_, that you glue together using a full-fledged programming language, instead of shoe-horning a programming language in YAML.For example, could the following be library functions that you could glue together in the programming language of your choice: (a) get current state of infra, (b) calculate diff between desired state and current state, (c) perform a single step (safely) that represents a granular change in infra, (d) perform a series of steps representing infra changes with safe rollback?Does something like this already exist?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good essay overall, but this footnote in particular stood out to me:&gt; [2] Tiger parents, as parents so often do, are fighting the last war. Grades mattered more in the old days when the route to success was to acquire credentials while ascending some predefined ladder. But it&#39;s just as well that their tactics are focused on grades. How awful it would be if they invaded the territory of projects, and thereby gave their kids a distaste for this kind of work by forcing them to do it. Grades are already a grim, fake world, and aren&#39;t harmed much by parental interference, but working on one&#39;s own projects is a more delicate, private thing that could be damaged very easily.It&#39;s so true. I got obsessed with programming around 11, started off with my shitty vb6 programs and moved on to reverse engineering video games and writing hacks. I never told any adults what I was doing until I was nearly an adult myself, out of fear they&#39;d ruin my hobby like they did everything else. I remember thinking to myself how much school sucked and being determined not to let that poison the one thing I liked worked on. My parents thought I was a degenerate who did nothing but play computer games all day. Blew them away when I got my first programming job and eventually skipped college to start working right out of high school.I have a bunch of friends who say the same thing. They&#39;d find some new cool thing, show even the slightest interest in it and their mom would immediately start making them drill it three hours a day until they hated it and weren&#39;t interested in it anymore. It&#39;s a sad story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jared Diamond, in his book &#34;The Day Before Yesterday&#34;, talks about how children in Papua New Guinea when he was an anthropologist there would play at making a garden or raising pigs.  The kid would have a toy, wooden pig, and then eventually be given a piglet, and then gradually their &#34;play&#34; would become more realistic until it shaded into adult work.My daughter, as a youngun&#39;, wanted to play &#34;coffeeshop&#34; where she would set up a coffeeshop at home and charge her mother and I for drinks.  I think this says something about how much she saw the inside of coffeeshops while I was programming there.The main obstacle to still using the play-better-until-it&#39;s-real path, is that we don&#39;t have a good way for kids to see what adults are doing, in most jobs.  Otherwise, their natural instincts are still to &#34;play&#34; at doing what they see the adults doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another aspect of personal projects is that if they’re truly enjoyable they can be a kind of salve for burnout.* If you feel like you can’t even open your IDE, a personal project can generate the excitement that reinvigorates your passion.There’s also less of a speed limit with personal projects — the things like: “before you go down that road let’s talk with X; hold off on that idea for now; let’s wait until...”This freedom is conducive to learning new things. My career success rests heavily on skills I gained pursuing personal projects, where I was able to try ridiculously complicated or “out there” ideas. I’ve worked for people in the past who were strongly against me spending free time on personal projects, but benefited from all the skills I had gained doing so. Beware of this mindset — it’s fear based and leads to unsuccessful outcomes in other ways.* Side note is: careful not to burn out on what’s supposed to be a fun personal project."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; on the good side of things, getting an Intel CPU to enter the red state is not easy to accomplish. In fact, it should never happen unless there are vulnerabilities in the Intel Management Engine (ME), an almost undocumented subsystem present in all Intel CPUs since 2008 that Intel says is required to provide full performance.&#34;unless there are vulnerabilities or backdoors in the Intel Management Engine (ME)&#34;.There, fixed it for you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My initial guess was &#34;WRMSR, and the 64-bit version of WRMSR&#34;. Fortunately, this appears to be an actually new finding rather than the memorable case a few years back of someone claiming to have discovered something that was clearly documented in the datasheet.The whole idea that there&#39;s a &#34;red state&#34; and a bunch of others on a CPU, normally hidden, should immediately raise the attention of many who wonder what those extra modes can do, and more interestingly, why they&#39;re hidden. From the (very little!) research I&#39;ve done, it appears this is not unlike SGX where only Intel has the key[1] to some part of the hardware you bought from them, and based on some leaked internal documents, it&#39;s very plausible that this is indeed a backdoor which only they can use. Ostensibly, for debugging purposes. Here&#39;s a previous comment I made on this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26521359[1] If these keys were leaked, which I very much hope will happen at some point, no doubt the &#34;security&#34; community will be heavily against it and spread plenty of FUD about how it makes everyone&#39;s computers insecure. But IMHO it should be eagerly awaited and received with the same optimism as the other DRM key leaks (HDCP, HDDVD, etc.) --- it is a path to freedom."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Australian Broadcasting Corporation is covering it in more detail than the Reuters article, including some of the mechanics of how it was pulled off:https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-08/fbi-afp-underworld-cr...Apparently it revolved around duping Hakan Ayik, one of Australia&#39;s most wanted drug dealers now operating as an international kingpin from Turkey, to trust the app and recommend it to his associates.  It&#39;s a double whammy, in that the network has been blown wide open and the AFP is now telling Ayik to hand himself in to avoid recriminations from his associates.  No doubt there will be a movie about this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As to how the FBI got access to the messages, Vice says[1] after Vincent Ramos of Phantom Secure was arrested in 2018, a confidential human source offered Anom, which the source was developing, to the FBI (probably in exchange for immunity or a reduced sentence, in my opinion). The source then seeded Anom phones to his existing distributors as a replacement for Phantom Secure phones, and from their they made their way into criminal organisations.[1] https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgkwj/operation-trojan-shie..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What we&#39;ve learned is only what was in Austrlia&#39;s piece of the cake, given they started their day already. New Zeland had theirs already, too. I imagine thousands of arrests are still happening worldwide and several press conferences are going to be held today. Looking at the seal of the operation (https://www.anom.io/trojan_shield_seal.jpg), following countries participated in the operation:
Canada, Australia, US, Sweden, The Netherlands, Lithuania, Finland, Hungary, Norway, Austria, UK, New Zeland, Estonia, Scotland, Germany, Denmark.I expect this to be bigger than Panama Papers. Way bigger. I expect a few prominent politicians to be soon either arrested  or &#34;convinced&#34; to step down. I expect the US to have gained a lot of intel and leverage over those from the countries who did not participate in this. We will absolutely not learn about everything they discovered. CIA will and the respective intelligence agencies will.EDIT: Europol will hold their conference live on YouTube at 10 AM CST: https://twitter.com/janoorth/status/1402164252266409987EDIT 2: given how Serbia was in the top 4 of messages sent, I really hope that the info gathered will help Interpol fight child trafficking and exploitation in the EU.From the VICE article (https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgkwj/operation-trojan-shie...) quoted elsewhere here:&#34;Additionally, the review of Anom messages has initiated numerous high-level public corruption cases in several countries. The most prominent distributors are currently being investigated by the FBI for participating in an enterprise which promotes international drug trafficking, money laundering, and obstruction of justice.&#34;&#34;Late Monday, the FBI said that it would be holding &#34;a news conference announcing a massive worldwide takedown based on the San Diego FBI’s unprecedented investigation involving the interception of encrypted communications&#34; on Tuesday.&#34;"</p>
