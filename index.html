								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Peter from Snaplet here. A month ago I saw the CrunchyData post and wanted to play around with the code that made it happen, it wasn&#39;t OSS so I asked for help:&gt;  If anyone out there wants to work on an open source version of this full-time please reach out to me. [0]Paul reached out and we started working on it almost immediately. Check out the repo here: https://github.com/snaplet/postgres-wasmWe have a blog post about some of the interesting technical challenges that we faced whilst building this: https://www.snaplet.dev/post/postgresql-in-the-browserLike most things, this is built on-top of the amazing open-source projects that made this possible, but special mention goes to v86.js and buildroot. We just glued it together.My hope is that we as a community can own this project and make PostgresQL, and the software that runs on it, accessible to a larger audience.---[0] Request for collaboration: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32500526"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey HN, we’re excited about this launch. This was a collaborative effort with the team at Snaplet [0].postgres-wasm is an embeddable Linux VM with Postgres installed, which runs inside a browser. It provides some neat features: persisting state to browser, restoring from pg_dump, logical replication from a remote database, etc.The idea was inspired by CrunchyData’s HN post about a month ago [1]. We love the possibilities of Postgres+WASM, and so Supabase &amp; Snaplet teamed up to create an open source version. The linked blog post explains the technical difficulties we encountered, and the architecture decisions we made.We’re still working hard on this, but it’s at a good “MVP” stage where you can run it yourself. Snaplet are working on a feature where you can drag-and-drop a snapshot into your browser to restore the state from any backup. Supabase are exploring ways we can run the entire Supabase stack inside the browser. You can find the Snaplet repo here [2], and the Supabase fork here [3]. There’s very little difference between these two, we just have a different browser UI.Both Supabase team and the Snaplet team will be in here commenting if you want to know anything else about the technical details.[0] Snaplet: https://www.snaplet.dev/[1] Crunchy post: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32498435[2] Snaplet repo: https://github.com/snaplet/postgres-wasm[3] Supabase fork: https://github.com/supabase-community/postgres-wasm"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the things I love from this post is the collaboration on this kind of OSS projects.Making Postgres Wasm helped:- v86[0] to find a new bug- Providing a great deep-dive article that will trigger new ideas in the future- Showcase the possibilities of Wasm and how you can overcome the current challengesI really appreciate these projects are OSS :)Congratulations for the project![0] https://github.com/copy/v86"</p>

If this is a considerable source of your income, I would caution against only using Paypal or keeping a large amount of money in that account. There are too many Paypal horror stories out there to mention of people getting their accounts limited or shut down without recourse because their automated checks flagged accounts for suspected fraud or violating their ToS. Best of luck!"</p>

I think there is still a lot of untapped markets apart from Contact tracing which might use QR codes. So keep plugging and wish You and Your co-founder all the power in the world. Start Small.Stay small."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"App script? Nice!Let&#39;s say you weren&#39;t disabled, what job would you have/is best for a founder?Myself, I personally think coders should code for work and for their startup, this way you develop higher quality code in both sides, which creates better outcomes, you&#39;re always in the software soup so to speak, or in the phó in this case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After reading the article, I still don&#39;t understand the exception Apple purportedly gets from its tracking rules. As I understand it, Amazon is allowed to use activity in the Kindle app to show personalized ads in the Amazon Shopping app without using the ATT prompt. Isn&#39;t that the same thing as Apple using News app activity to personalize ads in the App Store?The part that is unfair is that no one but Apple gets to have an App Store or process IAPs, which has always been the problem with iOS. Trying to make it about ATT just seems like a red herring."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be clear, this is entirely about advertising within Apple&#39;s App Store (that&#39;s what Apple Search Ads is). It has nothing to do with ads on the internet or in Safari, or even within third party apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the reasons I pay a premium to use Apple&#39;s products is to not be part of an advertising ecosystem. I am disappointed that this seems to be changing. Ads in the App Store are one thing—ads in Maps, Books, and Podcasts as the article suggests may be coming in the future—will drive me to use premium (even if they&#39;re paid) alternatives. At a minimum, people who pay for an Apple monthly iCloud subscription should be able to opt-out (not just of tracking, which already exists, but seeing ads all together)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I worked in adtech, I proposed a simple solution to ad fraud on our platform - assume any UA coming from an IP range owned by a cloud provider was a bot and don&#39;t show them ads, don&#39;t count their impressions.Worst case, people using a VPN hosted on EC2 might not see an ad, but I was certain they&#39;d cope. Best case, higher quality traffic increases yields.The business team vetoed that, it would adversely impact their numbers in the current quarter, and well, a significant proportion of their total comp was bonuses tied to those numbers. Also, the shareholders seemed to be of the mindset that has infected cryptocurrency speculators where no matter what, the spice must flow, wait, I mean, the number go up.Then there were all the &#34;bonuses&#34; and &#34;incentives&#34; negotiated with big advertisers or publishers. We just referred to them as kickbacks, because they totally are, but labeling something in code as kickbackPercentage was verboten. Just in case.Advertising has always been corrupt. Bots just corrupt it a little further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you are paying any bill for ads, make sure you only pay for conversions.   Ie. unless the customer actually buys your product, then don&#39;t pay anything.   Eg. instead of paying $0.002 per view of your ad, or $0.10 per click of your ad, pay $6 per person who clicks your ad and then buys your product.That way, ad fraud doesn&#39;t affect you.    Plenty of ad providers allow such an option.   Internally, they convert your payments per conversion into payments per click and then payments per impression, but importantly this shifts the incentive to get rid of bots to them, not you - you no longer care.   The provider also has an incentive to send you customers who will actually buy your product, and to send the bots and web scrapers to their other clients."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Yet the digital advertising industry has grown so accustomed to working with inflated numbers that few are willing to unmask the fake clicksThat is a funny reason for why this phenomenon might have grown so big in the first place. The people in the ad-buying company who are in the best position to &#39;smell&#39; when the numbers are off are also the ones most likely to individually benefit from inflated numbers (KPIs, number go up,...).A principal-agent problem at its finest, that unfortunately might drag some white-collar workers into being at least morally complicit in cyber crime."</p>

His videos on YouTube are phenomenal at explaining not only the theory and techniques, but why you should care in the first place.Also, why should anyone study control theory? It&#39;s the math behind making real-world systems perform what you want them to do. In particular, robotics and autonomous vehicles rely heavily on techniques from control theory.If you watch Brian&#39;s videos, keep in mind that they bifurcated into two places: his original videos [1], and his more recent MATLAB tech talk videos [2].[1]: https://www.youtube.com/controllectures[2]: https://engineeringmedia.com/videos"</p>

I personally found it quite useful for intuitive understanding of how control systems work.Prerequisites: linear algebra"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my peeves with control theory, at last the way it&#39;s used by proponents I&#39;ve met, is that it&#39;s designed to react to the smallest input. This makes intuitive sense when trying to optimise performance, but in a system with natural variations around the mean (noise), this can easily lead to amplifying variation and worsening performance.The alternative is statistical process control. In practise, it performs about the same for basic tasks, but it gives you qualitative insights into many other things too: (registration-walled) https://www.qualitydigest.com/inside/operations-column/proce..."</p>

If frameworks like this one were more common in Java world, I may never have left.This looks really nice!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, it&#39;s clear from the text that it needs to be understood in the context of the PayPal User Agreement. I tracked that down assuming that it would limit PayPal&#39;s ability to charge you to their actual damages. But no, in fact the text is quite shocking:&gt; If you are a seller and receive funds for transactions that violate the Acceptable Use Policy, then in addition to being subject to the above actions you will be liable to PayPal for the amount of PayPal’s damages caused by your violation of the Acceptable Use Policy. You acknowledge and agree that $2,500.00 U.S. dollars per violation of the Acceptable Use Policy is presently a reasonable minimum estimate of PayPal’s actual damages - including, but not limited to, internal administrative costs incurred by PayPal to monitor and track violations, damage to PayPal’s brand and reputation, and penalties imposed upon PayPal by its business partners resulting from a user’s violation - considering all currently existing circumstances, including the relationship of the sum to the range of harm to PayPal that reasonably could be anticipated because, due to the nature of the violations of the Acceptable Use Policy, actual damages would be impractical or extremely difficult to calculate. PayPal may deduct such damages directly from any existing balance in any PayPal account you control. [emphasis is mine]As I read this (not a lawyer) PayPal claims that any violation of their acceptable use policy will result in an  a̶u̶t̶o̶m̶a̶t̶i̶c̶ charge of $2500 because that represents the &#34;minimum estimate&#34; of the damage your violation causes them.On top of being completely a completely unacceptable policy, the idea that any violation costs them at least $2500 is complete fucking horseshit, if you&#39;ll pardon my explicitness. There is absolutely no way I would ever do business with PayPal as a seller under any circumstances, even if it was my customers&#39; preferred method."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most people never want to acknowledge the sheer scope and scale of Paypal and Square&#39;s Cash app&#39;s usage as large scale money laundering, drug trafficking, and prostitution tooling. (and much more)They didn&#39;t really even try to stop it in the early days. You could setup an injectable immunomodulator merchant account in under 10 minutes with Square. People started entire pill mills using Square and Paypal. It was wild!Similar to Turo who allowed the vehicles of their users to be used by weak KYC&#39;d users. You never knew who was actually driving the vehicle.I had loads of interesting conversations with Ex San Quentin prisoners, was riveting to listen to some of them talk about the crimes committed with all the fintech startups.
