								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh wow... you have just given me some sense of comfort after feeling like a moron for over two decades.When I was growing up, my dad had visited Seattle and came back from the trip with a box of Microsoft Coffee. He claimed to have gotten it from a store called Egg-Head’s Software or Egghead Computing or something like that. (EDIT: Upon reading the full article it seems to have been Egghead Software.)I took it to my computer club and was laughed out of the room for it being fake. I believe he still has it somewhere, in storage...Needless to say, I have some friends to email given that I’ve been the victim of “my uncle works at Nintendo” style teasing about this for years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any reason to believe that this actually happened? Conveniently, it was published on April 1st. The story itself would be a great April Fools&#39; prank. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic story.  I joined Microsoft in 1997 but unfortunately I cannot confirm the story, I never heard this story before, but it doesn&#39;t surprise me, we had a lot of fun back then with all kinds of pranks, and Easter eggs, until one day it was all suddenly stopped, ship an Easter egg and get fired was what they told us.  That was a very sad day.  I can confirm that Microsoft was doing things with Java back then, I worked in an XML parser written in Java when I first joined Microsoft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh, man. The idea that TextEdit automatically parsed .txt files as HTML if they started with a certain file signature is problematic......but the fact that file:// schemes can access remote files by appending /net/ followed by a domain name is pretty shocking.I mean, the entire purpose of &#34;file://&#34; would seem to be to provide access to local/mounted files and only those.The fact that a Mac engineer thought it would be a great &#34;feature&#34; to allow file:// to access the entire internet is... kinda terrifying. Did that get patched, or was it only TextEdit?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two words: excessive complexity.It&#39;s always seemed strange that an application called TextEdit is actually more than a text editor. I strongly believe that content-type autodetection, much less HTML rendering(!), most certainly does not belong in a text editor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"File extensions are a kludge anyway. (And Windows 10 still hides them by default, because hey, backwards compatibility, and you wouldn&#39;t want to confuse Grandma who&#39;s seen the file be called &#34;grandkids&#34; since Windows 95..).Why should the filetype be dependent on the name? People even think renaming a .BMP to .JPG means now it&#39;s a compressed file!Old school Macs stored the filetype outside of a file, so you can rename the file &#34;grandkids.mp4&#34; and double-clicking it would still open it in the image viewer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hope that the federal government can provide incentives to keep reactors running that would otherwise close prematurely.5.1 gigawatts of American reactors are expected to retire this year: https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=46436It&#39;s a shame that the US is retiring working reactors while still burning fossil fuels for electricity. Reactors are far safer and cleaner than fossil electric generation. It&#39;s mostly the low price of natural gas that is driving these early retirements. Low gas prices have also retired a lot of coal usage -- which is good! -- but we&#39;d make more climate progress if those low prices didn&#39;t also threaten nuclear generation.Some states like New York already provided incentives to keep reactors running for climate reasons:https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=41534Federal policy could be more comprehensive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nuclear energy is the Amiga of energy sources.Ahead of its time, it was unjustly rejected and persecuted by the ignorant masses. Its advocates are bonded by the quiet pride that at least they weren&#39;t unthinkingly siding with those masses. (And they&#39;re right!) Meanwhile, as the Amiga stagnated for terribly unfair reasons, other, scrappier technologies like the i386 and UMG-Si grew from being worthless boondoggles (except in special circumstances, like spaceflight) to being actually far better and cheaper. But the Amiga advocates keep the faith, sharing their suffering and resentment. They inevitably try the alternatives a little and perhaps even start to like them. Gradually their denial recedes, decade by decade.But they know that however much fab costs go down and leave their beloved Amiga behind in the dust, you&#39;ll never be able to run nuclear submarines and Antarctic research stations on solar panels.— ⁂ —Wind, where available, undercut the cost of steam power (including nuclear and coal) a decade ago, and PV undercut it in equatorial parts of the world about four years ago, or in even more of the world if you don&#39;t include storage.  As a result, last year, China, whose electrical consumption has doubled in the last decade, built 48.2 gigawatts† of new photovoltaic capacity last year https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-climatechang... but only has, I think, something like 10 GW of nuclear plants under construction, scheduled to come online over the next several years.  PV installed capacity in China is growing by 23% per year, the same rate it has been growing worldwide for the last few years; with some luck that will return to the 39%-yearly-worldwide-growth trend that has been the fairly consistent average over the last 28 years.‡(A previous version was posted at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26218673.)______† China&#39;s PV capacity factor seems to be only about 13%, so those 48 GWp probably work out to only about 6 GW average.  It would be nice if China managed to site its new PV plants in places that could provide a capacity factor like California&#39;s 28%.‡ Why 28?  Because I haven&#39;t found figures yet on what worldwide installed capacity was in 01992 or earlier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a convert. I was anti-nuclear power, now I am pro with a boatload of caveats.As a person who changed their mind, let me offer this advice to the people commenting here. Don&#39;t pretend there aren&#39;t legitimate concerns with nuclear power. Accidents did in fact happen and, given enough time and more reactors, will absolutely happen again. That&#39;s not a reason not to build more nuclear power, but let&#39;s not play make-believe about it. Don&#39;t pretend that just because we are better at handling nuclear waste it is a solved problem. It isn&#39;t. A hundred-fold increase in nuclear power generation would be a roughly hundred-fold increase in nuclear waste that must be stored away from all life for several hundred years (until we develop technology to resolve the issue, likely long after we&#39;re all dead). And maybe most importantly, acknowledge that nuclear energy is far more expensive than other green energy options and, even if we could drive down the cost, it will not solve all our problems. It is, at best, a big part of the solution, not &#34;the&#34; solution."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know this is supposed to be a joke, but I feel like it&#39;s too close to reality to be funny.I recently ordered a custom tailored set of shirt, trousers, and belt. Their site was bragging about their great AI technology, but sadly I didn&#39;t notice that red flag early enough.The results were nothing short of disastrous. I sent in my measurements and they sent me a trouser with wrong measurements and a postcard that said that they adjusted my measurements with AI for a better fit. The belt they included was a completely different size than the trouser and I&#39;m still waiting for the shirt to arrive. And now I&#39;m fighting the usual uphill battle to talk to a human and get this mess fixed or get a refund.The core of Stitchfix is personalization, as they say. But that means an individual solution for each individual customer, and not AI for memorizing generic trends in a huge dataset."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m sad this is an April fools joke because a lot of the sentiment rings true and I love the slogan “move slow and make things.”Artisans make beautiful things and software artisans make beautiful software, but it’s hard to do it and still be a viable business.And artisans moving slowly isn’t arbitrary. They move slow on the things that matter. The things that shine when attention was paid to the details."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it’s an april fools joke. But I’ve recently “discovered” why this is nevertheless very true. If you move slow, you have a higher chance of meeting the right customer, of actually allowing your idea to grow and improve over time. Without being locked into it in one form or another. Moving slow allows you to work on it as a side project first. Which means no financial stress.And then making things. To me this means no paper prototyping. Not selling people on your idea without having anything tangible. Some may call it smart. To me it feels like gambling with your believability / integrity. There are only so many times you can do this before people get tired of you and your stories / dreams / business ideas. Just make something, show it to people when it’s actually useful. And feel good about actually having made something people liked. Instead of selling something people liked and then suffer the feeling of non-stop pressure, constantly _not_ being where you’ve told others you are.Happy april fools :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I distinctively remember buying my first blue LED in what must have been the mid-90s. I simply walked into an electronic parts store and bought a single spare LED. I don&#39;t think I had ever seen a blue LED in action before, it was completely new to me, so I was very curious.It was of the very common standard shape and size LEDs were during that time, and its case was colorless but cloudy, not clear. A good thing, because that meant the LED would emit its light along the entire casing, not just straight forward, making it much easier to look at. It also wasn&#39;t much brighter than other LEDs, that came later.When I applied power and saw it shining in that beautiful blue color, I was positively amazed. This was so much cooler and so much more beautiful than the red, green, and yellow LEDs I had been using before. I distinctively remember just leaving it attached to power, sitting on my desk, just for something nice to look at."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh, I remember when blue LEDs became readily available (late 90s for me) and I would mod all my stuff to blue.Had this MS ergo keyboard, with the LEDs in the middle hump, came with green.  So, I replaced with these 2.5 hi-blues and I was blinded by my own Numlock-Beam.  Had to cross a resistor over there to take the edge off.Anyway, I think HN should get a black-bar because the blue LED is so cool."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fact an article like this exists speaks to how bad the keyboard shortcuts for tools like tmux are. It shouldn&#39;t be revolutionary to use basic features of a program.I&#39;m a huge fan of a command window, where you type words to do a fuzzy search of all the commands in a program.Sublime text and jetbrains products have it down so well to the point of me not needing to memorize key shortcuts. I just have to remember the first few letters and I&#39;m good to go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using the tmux vi keybindings to copy and paste between panes is great if you haven&#39;t tried it.This copy/paste workflow is really nice for working with kubernetes on the command line.E.g., imagine that you need to delete a kubernetes pod.You&#39;d run a few commands like this:1. `kubectl get pods`2. Find the pod id, and copy it using mouse &amp; some shortcut3. `kubectl delete pod &lt;pasted-pod-id&gt;`Instead of this mouse workflow, you could do something like this in tmux:1. `kubectl get pods`2. Find pod id, `Ctrl+b [` to enter tmux&#39;s vi selection mode3. Navigate to the section you&#39;d like to copy; e.g. `k6ww` (up six lines and over two words, for example)4. Press space bar to start selection, and use common vim movements to highlight what you&#39;d like to copy (e.g. w or $)5. Press return/enter to copy the selection6. This text can be pasted with either Cmd/Ctrl+v (it gets copied to the system clipboard for me on macOS 11.2.1 with tmux 3.1c_1 from brew), or using the default tmux shortcut `Ctrl+b ]`. So that would allow you to type `kubectl delete pod Ctrl+b ]`.So yeah, it&#39;s a few more steps, but it&#39;s a lot faster for me.These are the relevant sections of my ~/.tmux.conf file:  # Use vim keybindings in copy mode
  setw -g mode-keys vi

  # Use emacs keybindings in the status bar
  set -g status-keys emacs

(I mention the `set -g status-keys emacs` config line just as an FYI since it&#39;s been really helpful for me with tmux. I&#39;ve never liked using readline-type inputs with vi-mode.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, copy/paste is a weakness of a workflow using tmux.With tmux you end up with four distinct copy/paste buffers: the OS, tmux, the shell, vi/emacs. You do get used to the mental gymnastic of juggling all those but it&#39;s not ideal.Same goes with managing the windows of the OS, tmux and vi/emacs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve always admired Java for managing to slowly but surely move the language forward while maintaining backwards compatibility and keeping the community together. When you look at how many other languages have faltered and lost momentum due to transition issues (Perl 6, Python 2/3), it really shows have difficult of a task it is.Progress can seem glacially slow at times - it’s always disappointing to see your favorite upcoming feature get pushed to a later release - but the current language is undeniably light years better than what we started with.Respect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the primary features I&#39;m holding out hope for eventually making it into the language is ValueTypes: http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~jrose/values/values-0.html and the current Valhalla Project: https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/valhalla/MainThe simplest example of why this would be valuable (edit: this was not an intentional pun), the Optional type could become stack based, such that you could ensure that the variable referring to the Optional type is never null. This would help reduce a common class of bugs in Java code stemming from NPE&#39;s."</p>
