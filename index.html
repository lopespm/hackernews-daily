Sorry for the annoyance.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing to consider is royalty rate. If you sell 5000 copies for $20 and earn a dollar per copy, you&#39;ve earned $5,000. (This math is based on 10% royalties on the publisher&#39;s portion, which is about half of retail. And no, fiction books don&#39;t sell for $20 typically, but I&#39;m using this number to make the math easy.)Now, if you sell 5000 copies of an ebook for $20 and earn 80% royalties, you earn $16 per copy, and earn $80,000. This is the royalty rate on Leanpub (disclosure: cofounder), but with Gumroad or blog + Stripe approaches you&#39;d earn an even better percentage (if you want to run your own store).For fiction, however, the dream combination is probably publishing in-progress with subscriptions. Currently it seems that Substack is the best for that. If you can get a few thousand people to subscribe for a few bucks a month, you could do well. The people at the top are doing really, really well: https://stratechery.com/2021/sovereign-writers-and-substack/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be interesting to have a timeseries plot of this sort of information. Did it used to be easier to make a living as an author? Presumably there was some point at which the ease of making a living as an author peaked. This article suggests that time is in the past, but how far in the past? Has the absolute number of people who can make it as an author decreased, or just the relative fraction of the human population? So many questions.I do also think that the expectation/standard of a $100k/year salary is a bit high. That&#39;s almost double the US median household income, for a job that can be done (some would argue is best done) from a house in the woods. I also know that some authors are turning to Patreon. N.K. Jemisen famously started a Patreon that allowed her to quit her job and begin writing full-time. I personally have donated &gt;$100 directly to favorite midlist authors who have made a big impact on my reading life.FWIW, I used to read more, but I still buy at least three or four full-priced books a year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From what I read in the proposal the core idea of it is solid. DNS is a vital piece of infrastructure, and we should take steps to ensure it keeps working. Putting together task forces to make sure it is secure therefore sounds like a very good idea.Root servers might be out of scope to some degree for this however. Interestingly enough the root servers also aren&#39;t mentioned in the proposal itself, nor in the annex listing essential services. They&#39;re only mentioned in the lead up, which is the argument for why it&#39;s needed. It somewhat feels like they left it in accidentally, especially with the parliament immediately amending to scrap it from the lead up as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In addition, by downloading this file, every Internet service provider can run their own root server.&#34;Any end user can do that as well.The truth is, root servers are not nearly as &#34;essential&#34; as the major TLD servers, like .com, .net and .orgWhat is essential is the ability to download the root.zone file.  At least if one wants to track any changes (seldom seen).I always have a copy of the current root.zone file.  If the public root servers all ceased operation I would not see any noticeable effects.However if the .com servers went down, I would have to use a local copy of the com.zone which is a much larger file to download (via FTP, HN&#39;s favourite protocol to make fun of).An easier alternative is to keep a custom zone file with all the domains that I use regularly.  Does any single end user really need access to the entire www. How much of the www does anyone think they have really seen.For example, I have zone files with every domain that is posted to HN, so I never have to worry about being able to read what gets posted here. I can read fast without making any remote DNS lookups."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I left the game industry for FAANG and I&#39;m getting paid 2-3x more. I&#39;m happy with this situation if I consider the big picture but, at least in my case, my game job was much, MUCH better than FAANG. No matter how many fancy drinks and energy bars FAANG gives me, if the pay in the game industry was higher I&#39;d have stayed without a doubt.What this means is that FAANG is actually paying what it needs to pay to get employees, otherwise many people would simply work elsewhere.There is a myth that working at FAANG is amazing for everybody, but most people I know there are actually kind of miserable and doing fairly dull work for which they are massively overqualified. Nonetheless, these companies have money and they want the &#34;best&#34; (in their eyes) people for everything, so they pay for it... Well, it&#39;s a decent deal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is ultimately a supply and demand issue. Google pays high salaries because they have to in order to hire the talent they want. Game devs apparently do not have to, because they are able to fill their roles for lower salaries. Don&#39;t pretend like all tech companies wouldn&#39;t love to lower dev salaries, they just can&#39;t because they wouldn&#39;t be able to hire.Game companies apparently have a meaningful differentiator, which is that working in a gaming context is something people actually value and are willing to give up potential compensation for. This seems especially true at the junior level, which depresses junior salaries relative to other tech companies.Also, comparing compensation against US FAANG hiring is beyond insane. They pay ridiculous salaries due to the extremely limited and competitive market for hires that meet their caliber. This has driven up salaries, but should NOT be treated as an indicator for what &#34;reasonable&#34; pay looks like across the entire industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just to have a bit of a counter argument from me, a game developer who loves games and has worked in the US games industry for the majority of my 20 years career:If your argument is &#34;You can make more at a FAANG company&#34; - well yeah, you can. You don&#39;t work in gaming because you want to make the top salary. You work in gaming because you love games and you enjoy having all your coworkers also love games and being able to talk to all of them about games and having your company culture revolve around games and gaming. It&#39;s games all the way down! It&#39;s a completely different work environment. As someone who loves games, the best years of my working career were when I was working on game teams, not at tech companies.Also, developer salaries in games is still plenty good. It&#39;s still great money. I never felt like I was losing out.Also the argument that it&#39;s &#34;grueling 80+ hour weeks day in and day out is&#34; is bullshit! The only time I ever worked 80 hours in a single week was when I was starting out in Quality Assurance and I was getting paid hourly so I was happy to make the extra overtime. As a salaried developer I don&#39;t think I was ever expected to work more than 60 hours a week, and then after the crunch was over we always got 1 or 2 weeks of extra vacation (&#34;comp time&#34;). To be clear, the normal working schedule was 40 hours per week. Crunch time is like 1 or 2 times a year, for maybe 1-2 months each time. And like I said, depending on how much you crunch, you would get extra paid time off afterwards. So for me, that was a pretty good trade. I&#39;d much rather work my ass off for a couple months and then get an extra 2 week vacation at the end of it.Maybe some game companies treat their employees like dirt and work them into the ground, but the ones I&#39;ve worked for, I never felt that way. Don&#39;t work at those terrible companies! There are plenty of &#34;good&#34; game companies out there who pay good salaries and have good working conditions.As someone who is older now with kids, my priorities are definitely different than when I worked in games during my 20s and early 30s. I would no longer be happy working those 60 hour weeks. I want a better work life balance. So I don&#39;t know if I could work on a game team like that anymore. But do I regret working there before I had a family? Absolutely not. #gamedev4life"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I stayed in a small town outside Chablis, France, many years ago. I rented a room above the only restaurant in town. There were a few businesses, mostly food-related and clothing repair. Everything just seemed slowed down. I watched a man in waders unload a dead boar he had just shot to the butcher at 9am. I watched two other men repairing brickwork on a foundation. I watched another woman tending a large garden, then go to work at a bar/restaurant. The stores were open for just a few hours. The shelves were free of random plastic trinkets and gadgets.It just seemed like it was 1/10th the normal speed, somewhat Luddite... and every task seemed oddly fundamental.I&#39;ve also encountered towns like this in Spain, Greece, Austria, Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Uruguay, Thailand and Cambodia.After reading these comments, I would never have believed that so many small towns exist that seem untouched by 24-hour stores and everything cheap and on-demand. It sounds inevitable that everyone is eventually pushed into hyperinflationary always-working mode. But yet, these places persist. I might even chalk it up to depressed economies and &#34;third-world&#34; nature, but my samples include all sorts of economies.I think we choose what kind of lifestyle we want, but it needs to be done at the community level. Without going all &#34;we should all be farmers hippie dippy portland nature fetishist&#34;, it does seem like decisions have consequences and it is possible to steer away from hyperactivity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The roots of this phenomenon can be traced back to the &#39;Protestant work ethic&#39; in the 16th Century - a worldview held by white Protestants in Europe that made hard work and the quest for profit seem virtuous. Sally Maitlis, professor of organisational behaviour and leadership at the University of Oxford, says that &#34;later, the drive for efficiency that arose out of the Industrial Revolution&#34;, as well as the way we prize productivity, have &#34;further embedded the value of consistent hard work, often at the cost of personal wellbeing&#34;.The roots of the valorization of work may well have been religious, and maybe Christian (though I very much doubt it&#39;s exclusively Christian in its origin), but it&#39;s definitely spread throughout much of the world, even among the non-religious and even atheist population.I can&#39;t count the number of times I&#39;ve heard people praise others as &#34;hard working&#34;... in all sorts of contexts, in many different parts of the world, native or immigrant, hard work is praised to the heavens and one of the best things you can say about a person is that they&#39;re hard working.I almost never hear the value of working hard being questioned, except when the subject turns to burnout.  Then everybody nods sagely and agrees that overwork is bad.. the next day they go back to praising hard workers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Six-day work week was standard like, what, 100 years ago? Now it just seems savage. And so will the five-day work week.I had the luck of getting a four month severance when a company closed, full salary, full benefits. I lined up a new job and just said I will start later.Let me tell you, going back into a tech job, 10 to 6-ish PM every day was no joke, after three months of not giving a fuck. It was torture. I could not understand how I did it until then. And there was that painful realization of &#34;what am I doing here for eight hours a day? I am clearly not using all of it. Give me four hours and I will do the same amount of work and go live my life&#34;.And that&#39;s when I knew that I am not going to be the guy on his deathbed, realizing that he worked too hard and didn&#39;t live, after winning the cosmic lottery of being born on such a rare place as planet Earth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Roger Cicala knows a lot about lenses and pushed lens manufacturers to have better testing and quality, he created https://www.lensrentals.com/ because he got sick with low quality checks of lenses:When I started Lensrentals I had a lot of conversations with service centers that went like this. Me: &#34;That lens you repaired still sucks&#34;. Person at service center: &#34;No, it’s within specs&#34;. Me: &#34;What are the specs?&#34; Service center: &#34;We can’t tell you&#34;. One day, after I raised hell with a factory service manager, he patted me on the head and said, “testing lenses is complicated; you don’t have the background to understand.”Any of you who has ever seen a physician after someone says something like ‘you wouldn&#39;t understand; it’s complicated’ knows what happened next. I had no option but to spend a couple of years buying testing equipment, offering internships to really smart optical engineering students, and developing a lens testing center and methodology that was as good as anything in the industry.He is also capable of writing about hard topics in a way that most people can understand them.Anyone interested in camera lenses should read also his previous posts https://www.dpreview.com/members/1329131098"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a bunch of full frame lenses.Recently I looked at some very old ones I haven&#39;t used in a long time. I thought they are faulty (soft).After some diagnosing I found that it is not the fault of lenses but rather in the meantime I have started looking at images at 1:1 in Lightroom and gotten used to ridiculously sharp images from new cameras.Have you ever watched an old TV show and despaired how unwatchable it is because of low quality of image? Yes, that&#39;s the same thing -- our tastes change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a couple of other big reasons related to differences between film and digital sensors.First film is much less sensitive to the angle at which light strikes it. There are some great, sharp old lens designs from leica, zeiss and others that show heavy light fall off in the corners on digital sensors. This is a big part of why even f1.8 or 2 lenses need to be more complicated.Next film grain itself has sharp edges which effectively sharpens images a bit and also limits the resolution and generally has a pleasing effect when viewed at high magnification. With digital you don&#39;t get that and lens flaws get a lot more obvious."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a lot of this analysis is tautological -- meaning that when you boil it down, you&#39;re just saying that things are as you have defined them to be.For instance, take a Big Five trait such as agreeableness. How do we know that a person is agreeable? Because we define agreeableness in a certain way and then measure the degree to which someone conforms to the definition. If that measurement includes questions such as, &#34;Do others find you easy to get along with?&#34; then of course there&#39;s going to be a negative correlation with loneliness, because you&#39;ve essentially defined it that way.I am the author of Correlated.org, which commits many different types of statistical errors for humor&#39;s sake, so this leaps out at me. By the way, for a surprisingly vast number of things, agreeableness is quite predictive. Food preferences, public policy positions, and even willingness to answer poll questions :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is making a subtle mistake; evolution doesn&#39;t mean like-parent-like-child.Evolution is likely selecting for, eg, people who have children at a certain ratio of introverted-extroverted.Introverted, disagreeable, high-contentious types make, for example, great scientists. A population (call it A) that produces a reasonable number of such people is at a huge advantage compared to the alternative that only produces extroverted agreeable types (call them B).Population B will be more competitive at breeding, but population A will win any conflict with B because they&#39;ll have a bunch of weirdos in the back room producing a lot of high quality science (a classic stereotype with some foundation in truth).Note that men are much more likely (something like 4x) to be &#34;completely homosexual&#34; compared to women [0]. I&#39;m betting this is because having a few men who opt out of the race to pass on their genes and focus on other stuff is a massive advantage to the society that hosts them. Look how much of a force gay men have been in culture for example.Locally catastrophic for breeding, globally optimal for society. The equilibrium isn&#39;t for all offspring to maximise their chance of breeding. The optimum is for the community to thrive.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_sexual_orienta..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of all of the personality traits I have attempted to change over the years, my introversion has remained the most stubborn.  It&#39;s a shame, too.  I can briefly emulate extraversion, at an enormous cost of mental energy and feel like a dog walking on its hind legs.  Nor do I seem to be able to extract the purported benefits of it.  And the list of approaches I have exhausted is, in retrospect, more than a little shocking.  It&#39;s the one area where &#34;fake it until you make it&#34; seems to have failed me utterly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pair programming generates visceral responses due to it being introduced as if it were fact, which for me always triggers my spidey senses. People who didn&#39;t like it were told &#34;you&#39;re doing it wrong&#34; or &#34;you didn&#39;t give it a proper chance&#34;. Dismissing criticisms out of hand only furthers distrust, regardless of the actual value of the idea.I played along and paired for awhile, but now steadfastly refuse to pair, ever. I work best within my own mind, and the distraction of talking to someone breaks my concentration such that I&#39;m unable to keep the big picture in my head anymore. The irritation of being that close to someone and having to engage with them for even half an hour is draining, and I took more frequent and longer breaks because of this (much to the annoyance of my pair-partner, who couldn&#39;t work while I was away).There may very well be people who work well in pairs, but rest assured that there are those who aren&#39;t built that way. Don&#39;t disparage them, don&#39;t discriminate against them, and don&#39;t play the moral superiority game with them. Accept their diversity and be a better team for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also worked at a company where pairing was mandatory for 8 hours a day. Plan was concocted by two tech leads who, of course, didn&#39;t pair themselves.The exhaustion was visible, and productivity was very low. Since everyone vocally thought it was a &#34;waste of time&#34;, there was a Fight-club-style &#34;rule&#34; where we couldn&#39;t talk about the downsides in public or even in Scrum meetings. We missed several deadlines for an MVP, code quality was abysmal and the product barely worked.It stopped when the CEO took issue with it. He gathered the team to ask &#34;why is the productivity so low?&#34;. There was an awkward moment where a junior dev was trying to answer but a tech lead was trying to tell him &#34;don&#39;t break the rule&#34;.It was an absolutely surreal experience, but not out of place in that startup.EDIT: I also remember one of the tech leads complaining during a Sprint Retro that some of us weren&#39;t reading Slack fast enough, and we said &#34;well, I was paring, I wasn&#39;t at my computer&#34;, to which he became a bit agitated and visibly angry. It was an awful place to work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve had incredible experiences pairing.There were whiteboards, snacks, rating each other’s themes, and jokes.What worked very well was to pair for conceptional problems, like architecture and defining modules and their interfaces. Commit some types and pseudo-code.We’d then break away and work at our own speed and in our own style using the common foundation.Come together to integrate and discuss.Pairing is also worth it’s weight in gold for debugging. It’s like a rubber duck, but doesn’t feel wrong.It is of course of utmost importance that both parties enjoy it. Else it’s pain and a waste of everybody’s time. I had a colleague who hated it like the plague. In which case short code/review cycles worked best.A good tool, if employed correctly. Like most things, really. And fuck management if they force it down on me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was in library school around this time (a couple years later, actually), and I remember that Wikipedia was a hot topic: can it be trusted, and why is the answer &#34;no&#34;?Bucking that trend somewhat, I was in the cautiously optimistic camp. By that time it was already more useful to me than the Encyclopedia Britannica, and getting better all the time. The trajectory was clear.It seems like, of all the exciting things from the early web, Wikipedia has been one of the only things that actually panned out the way it was intended. It didn&#39;t get commercialized, but it didn&#39;t go broke either. It didn&#39;t become a cesspool, or try to consume all of my attention. It just does the thing it&#39;s supposed to do. If there was a fire on the internet, and I could only save one website, it would be you Wikipedia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wikipedia is one of, if not the best thing(s) to happen to the internet. It achieved basically what the internet&#39;s aim was: to democratize information.Even when I have to learn something, ANYTHING, I&#39;ll go to Wikipedia, after which I read the sources of the article for in depth research. And while I dislike their political articles a lot, the science, math, history and arts articles are genuinely incredible to read."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone prove me wrong, but I think of Wikipedia as one, if not the largest cooperation of human beings on a very specific project. Most of the criticism it recieves is true, but it&#39;s a wonder that it could remain, and even grow in the state like it is.I wish more organisational involvement would happen on the editorial level - companies, governments, or education. I wish academia wouldn&#39;t despise it. There is so much untapped potential still."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If I were Apple, I would say “oops a couple security-sensitive  APIs slipped through that we forgot to open up for requests for access,” and quickly publish an expanded list of all of the entitlements they’re currently saving for their close friends. This is different, and more toxic, than all of the in—app purchase stuff — you’re telling indie developers that no matter how hard they try, they won’t be able to match the functionality of Apple’s special friends.Otherwise, well, there goes your narrative of having a level playing field. The problem with this is, the loss of trust results in a slow, unending decay that only becomes obvious in retrospect.It may not seem like it, but billions of dollars of value are at stake with little things like this. If you work at Apple, you should raise the alarm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another weird example is how Apple&#39;s own &#34;Clips&#34; app has a special private entitlement that bypasses the permission prompt for camera access.Would it hurt them so much to prompt for camera access the first time the app is started after installing it from the app store?I found that extremely worrying as it means I can no longer trust the app store to provide a safe sandboxed environment. Suddenly there&#39;s an app with this special no-cam-permission entitlement and your mugshot is uploaded when you believed the ios camera permission system would have protected you.Oh, but Apple would only ever grant that permission to its own apps? Better hope we&#39;ll never get a repeat of the PsychicPaper exploit!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is what bothers me most about Apple devices and software. They probably have the &#34;best&#34; devices out there in terms of user experience. I use an iPhone and iPad every day because of it. But they keep very tight control over what software can be installed and run on it in order to safeguard their views on UX and security/privacy.This means for me as a developer that it&#39;s hard to write software and tools for my own devices without having to deal with Apple in some way or root the devices. Some things are even clearly impossible because of these private entitlements: There is no way for me to explore the CarPlay API&#39;s to experiment with my own ideas.A small part of me hopes that the Epic lawsuit and recent developments can lead to more abilities for sideloading on iDevices."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a saying in French, attributed to André Gide:&#34;Choisir, c&#39;est renoncer&#34; (to choose is to give up).That said, the title posted here is disingenuous: &#34;decide&#34; is not at all related to death, it&#39;s related to &#34;cut&#34; or &#34;remove&#34;, it just so happens that that root is coincidentally used with prefixes leading to &#34;remove life&#34;. So at best it has deadly siblings, not origins.In fact, I cannot see that title on the linked page, it seems to have been substituted from &#34;Choices&#34;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If people are interested in etymology, I highly recommend the youtube channel Alliterative which goes over etymological connections and teaches history through language.It&#39;s a fascinating channel and very unique style of videos. Here&#39;s one of my favourites, on colors:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaDc5J2LD08"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting. The german word entscheiden (decide) is also based on scheiden (to part) as in Scheidung (divorce) and dahinscheiden (to die slowly). And even more meanings from the same root-word."</p>
