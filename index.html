								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, what an awesome dive into some of the technical aspects behind one of my favorite tools for using the web. And I do think of it that way these days, it&#39;s fairly stunning on some sites to switch off all the block and see how they become genuinely unbrowsable. I remember seeing Gorhill discuss a few times over the years some of the reqs for uBO during certain times (like why it could no longer work with Safari following changes Apple made a while back), but so cool to have it all collected in one place.Having said that I&#39;ve also been fairly stunned recently to see how much difference a simple DNS blacklist system can make too. Not because it&#39;s a big technical achievement but because it isn&#39;t and in principle seems relatively trivial to work around. But as I&#39;ve been switching all my routing from UniFi to OPNsense, I&#39;ve gone ahead and tried out Unbound&#39;s basic built-in blacklisting. While it&#39;s no uBO, it works on every single device and browser including in apps and it seems like it really shouldn&#39;t, that more parties would just be proxying ads through their own infra and DNS. Been kind of an interesting illustration of technical vs economic influences in an ecosystem. I can see how proxying would add complexity and cost to setup so it must just be that few enough people do it the ad industry can&#39;t be bothered.But should that ever catch on (and it could, Raspberry Pi seems fairly well known) I expect uBO to be able to keep up with the cat-and-mouse long after DNS has been left behind. This piece helps underline how incredibly important maintaining a critical level of diversity in the browser ecosystem is. Just shortly ago there were a bunch of complaints again about Apple not allowing Chrome to be on iOS because it &#34;holds back the web&#34;, but what &#34;holding back the web&#34; looks like is certainly a matter of perspective..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a shame uMatrix was discontinued.uBlock Origin comes close, and surpasses in some ways (I used both for that reason) but lacks separate control of cookies, images, scripts, etc. So you can&#39;t accept a particular third party&#39;s images without also accepting its scripts, cookies, etc.I mention it mainly in the hope that we can popularise its maintained fork &#39;nuTensor&#39;.After trying uBlock (as in attempting to also cover what I used to use uMatrix for) for a few weeks I think it&#39;s insufficient and nuTensor is the better option for me, but it quickly won&#39;t be if ~nobody uses it and it falls by the wayside.Alternatively uBO could support the few details it lacks from uM? It seems like the problem basically was difficulty/time constraints in supporting both.. but I don&#39;t know why they were ever separate? There&#39;s plenty of overlap. If uBO had uM&#39;s granularity in &#39;advanced mode&#39;, that&#39;d be perfect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;At browser launch, Firefox will wait for uBO to be up and ready before network requests are fired from already opened tab(s).&gt;This is not the case with Chromium-based browsers, i.e. tracker/advertisement payloads may find their way into already opened tabs before uBO is up and ready in Chromium-based browsers, while these are properly filtered in Firefox.&gt;Reliably blocking at browser launch is especially important for whoever uses default-deny mode for 3rd-party resources and/or JavaScript.Oof.  TIL.  That makes blockers kinda crippled in chromes, if you expect them to actually block things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; For example, I once joined a team maintaining a system that was drowning in bugs. There were something like two thousand open bug reports. Nothing was tagged, categorized, or prioritized. The team couldn’t agree on which issues to tackle
&gt; I spent almost three weeks in that room, and emerged with every bug report reviewed, tagged, categorized, and prioritized.Honestly, this is one of those traps a team can fall into, where nobody feels empowered to ignore the rest of the business for 3 weeks to put the bell on the cat. The only person without deliverables and due dates is the new hire. And it takes a special kind of new hire to have the expertise to parachute in, recognize that work needs to be done, and then do it with little supervision.But he&#39;s right in general, that you can get some surprising things done by just putting in the time and focus. Which is why it&#39;s so utterly toxic that corporate America runs on an interrupt driven system, with meetings sprinkled carelessly across engineer calendars."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I joined a mentoring program targeted at recent college grads, I expected to be teaching things like interview prep, resume writing, negotiation skills, communication skills, and how to deliver results in a workplace.For about half of the mentees, that&#39;s roughly true. However, for the other half much of my mentoring ends up being about time management, following through on commitments, and putting in the effort required to get a job done. A surprising number of young people are graduating college without ever having had to work any job. It&#39;s particularly difficult for talented coders who breezed through easy CS programs until they land in a work environment where tasks are challenging, expectations are high, and the only way to get things done is to sit down and put in the effort.One of the best skills anyone can learn is how to sit down, focus, and get work done. In my experience, it&#39;s increasing challenging to convince young people that this is an acquired skill that they can practice and develop. There&#39;s a growing perception that traits like work ethic, focus, and motivation are fixed attributes that one is born with (or without) rather than abilities that are developed over time. It&#39;s frustrating to watch some mentees map out meticulous diet and exercise programs to improve their physical strength, but then turn around and tell me that they&#39;re only capable of coding for 2 hours per day as a sort of fixed upper limit. Like everything, the ability to work and focus can be developed over time with practice and dedication. It&#39;s worth it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s funny. I was talking with the team on a call, yesterday, and one of them was telling me we should hire someone to do &#34;the boring stuff,&#34; so I would be free to do &#34;the fun stuff.&#34;I said no. I&#39;ve been shipping (as opposed to &#34;writing&#34;) software for over thirty years, and, if there&#39;s one thing I&#39;ve learned, is that &#34;shipping&#34; software is about 60% - 80% &#34;boring&#34; stuff. I can avoid it, if I&#39;m only interested in &#34;having fun,&#34; but if I want to &#34;ship&#34; my work, I need to power through the grind. I also don&#39;t believe it&#39;s stuff I&#39;m comfortable entrusting to others. When I&#39;m at the car wash, I inevitably see someone driving a car -often not the fanciest ones- through the wash, because they don&#39;t trust the attendants. I guess I&#39;m that guy.I really enjoy knowing that my work is out there, in the wild, and not just in a pitch demo. I consider it a craft, and I love to finish projects. That means that I need to take the time to break out the 2000-grit sandpaper.That makes it a lot less of a &#34;grind,&#34; to me.But that&#39;s just me. YMMV."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Article aside, EVERYONE with a marketing/technical blog should have an intro like fly.io does: a one paragraph explanation of what the service does.It gives context for the article and immediately creates the possibility of converting people off nothing but the article, right off the gate.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic writeup: technical details, context and framing, all in clear, informal, plain-English prose. It&#39;s profoundly effective, and vanishingly rare. As for Fly&#39;s solution per se: like many great ideas it seems simple bordering on obvious, in retrospect. I&#39;m impressed and more interested than ever in bringing fly.io into my wheelhouse.Final thoughts:CLI-first: flyctl reminds me of `vercel` (fka Zeit `now`), which is a big compliment&gt; &#34;VM build-and-boot process on a second deployment is faster than the logging that we do&#34;  
... ie, well-suited for lambdas / serverless functions at CDN edge -- which is of extreme relevance and interest to me and everyone else working on minimizing latency with modern webapp architecture... exciting times!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those who don’t know much about this field, this seems incredible. The reality is that this a tech demo that Neuralink is using to practice the basics. For other research groups in this field, this is tech from 20 years ago.The current state of the art is humans, mostly quadriplegic people, with chips which let them control robot arms with enough accuracy to pick up small delicate objects, play games, and type by thinking words. Current state of the art implants let people get tactile feedback too - they can intuitively know the position of the arm they’re controlling and feel the amount of pressure on each finger tip.I had the pleasure of meeting a man with an implant in 2016 and the technology he was using was incredible. He could pick up a grape with his arm without crushing it and then eat it. If the arm was in another room, he could feel around with it to find objects. He described how the arm just felt like a part of his body when it’s turned on.To use SpaceX as an analogy: this isn’t a first flight. This is more like a static test fire. If Neuralink follows the SpaceX trajectory of driving down cost/increasing innovation, it results will be really out of this world. Stuff that would just sound bonkers right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to be very similar to the early 2000s demos at Brown University/Cyberkinetics[1].  In 2008 they demonstrated it in humans[2] after lots of work getting FDA approval. The core difference here (from my non-expert reading) seem to be electrodes are along a thread rather than on a chip.See https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJJPbpHoPWo for a video of the pong demo in humans.The motor cortex seems to have a clear, learnable signal though it is rather noisy sampling &lt;1000 locations.Mary Lou Jepsen at Open Water has ideas about how to do this non-invasively [3].[1] https://www.braingate.org/publications/[2] https://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/2006-07/06-...[3] https://www.ted.com/talks/mary_lou_jepsen_how_we_can_use_lig..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That was difficult to watch. While the technology is impressive, it is sickening to watch. The part where they can pair the phone via bluetooth made me want to vomit. It is obviously unnatural, but I can&#39;t quite put my finger on it. Something about seeing that animal, oblivious to what&#39;s happening, and that implant with the ability to directly record thoughts and/or remote control. The whole thing doesn&#39;t sit well with me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN! I wrote an article about this initial support series and what it took to make things work properly on this machine:https://asahilinux.org/2021/03/progress-report-january-febru...It still applies to what got merged; the past month was spent on clean-ups, fixes, and review feedback, but there are no major changes to the approach. This initial merge was quite complex as it has to touch a number of subsystems and core kernel code in order to support the M1&#39;s quirks, and it was CCed to ~20 people. Now that it&#39;s done we can more efficiently work on individual drivers and subsystems, so I expect the pace to pick up.If you would like to support my work on this project, I do have a Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/marcanI also streamed initial development on YouTube and will be resuming streams next week (patch feedback and git rebasing and munging doesn&#39;t make for very interesting streams, but now I&#39;m back to coding). Coming up I have some driver support other people have been working on, and then I&#39;ll be writing a minimal hypervisor that can run macOS as a guest, to help reverse engineer the hardware - this will be important for reverse engineering more complex drivers cleanly, especially the GPU kernel side.Until now we&#39;ve used a serial cable to debug/load kernels (needs a DIY arduino thing, an proper design I&#39;m working on which is still vapourware, or another M1 box), but Sven added support for the USB device controller and I&#39;ll merge it into our bootloader soon, so from this point on anyone will be able to do quick kernel iteration, debugging, and hardware exploration with just a standard USB cable and any other host machine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Story about him (from the Guardian, via Reddit):Hargreaves was a yeoman aboard the destroyer HMS Wallace on which Philip, son of Prince Andrew of Greece, had been appointed first lieutenant - second-in-command - at the age of 21. In July 1943, engaged in the Allied landings in Sicily, the ship came under repeated bombardment at dead of night and its crew realised that they would probably lose their lives.It was then Philip conjured up a plan to throw overboard a wooden raft with smoke floats that would create the illusion of debris ablaze on the water. As he hoped, the German plane was fooled into attacking the raft while the Wallace sailed to safety under cover of darkness.Hargreaves recalled the terrifying events of that night on the website: &#39;It was obvious that we were the target for tonight and they would not stop until we had suffered a fatal hit. It was for all the world like being blindfolded and trying to evade an enemy whose only problem was getting his aim right. There was no doubt in anyone&#39;s mind that a direct hit was inevitable.&#39;There was no question but to accept that on the next run or the one after that we had little chance of survival. I had been through so much that the feeling of anger and frustration was as great as the fear I and everyone else felt.&#39;It was less than five minutes after the aircraft had departed and - if the previous space in time was approximately the same - we had about 20 minutes to come up with something. We couldn&#39;t steam far in that time, not even far enough to make the aircraft think we had moved.&#39;He continued: &#39;The first lieutenant [Philip] went into hurried conversation with the captain, and the next thing a wooden raft was being put together on deck. Within five minutes they launched a raft over the side - at each end was fastened a smoke float. When it hit the water the smoke floats were activated and billowing clouds of smoke interspersed with small bursts of flame gave a convincing imitation of flaming debris in the water.&#39;The captain ordered full ahead and we steamed away from the raft for a good five minutes and then he ordered the engines stopped. The tell-tale wake subsided and we lay there quietly in the soft darkness and cursed the stars, or at least I did. Quite some time went by until we heard aircraft engines approaching.&#39;The sound of the aircraft grew louder until I thought it was directly overhead and I screwed up my shoulders in anticipation of the bombs. The next thing was the scream of the bombs, but at some distance. The ruse had worked and the aircraft was bombing the raft. I suppose he was under the impression that he had hit us in his last attack and was now finishing the job.&#39;We lay there waiting for him to leave, which he did, and, in view of the solitary attacks so well spaced apart, we were convinced he would not return.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Judging by the comments in this thread, it seems a lot of people are still unaware that:1. Gain of function research primarily uses samples collected from nature, and seeks to stimulate their evolution in as natural a way as possible to learn how viruses evolve in nature. If such viruses were to escape the lab, they would appear &#34;natural&#34;2. It&#39;s not xenophobic for people from the US to suggest the possibility of a lab leak, because the US was itself funding gain of function research on novel coronaviruses in the Wuhan BSL4 lab3. Lab leaks happen more often than most people realize[1][1]https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/3/20/18260669/deadly..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The virus does have an inexplicable feature: a so-called “furin cleavage site” in the spike protein that helps SARS-CoV-2 pry its way into human cells. While such sites are present in some coronaviruses, they haven’t been found in any of SARS-CoV-2’s closest known relatives.This is false.  First of all it should be stated clearer that there has been parallel evolution across several branches of coronaviruses which have independently evolved a furin cleavage site (so there is evolutionary pressure and advantage for coronaviruses to follow this path):https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187350612...And then the statement is just wrong.  The related sarbecoviruses found in Thailand have similar furin cleavage sites:&gt; The RacCS203 S gene is most similar to that of RmYN02 (Supplementary Fig. 3a). The two viruses shared part of the furin cleavage site unique to SARS-CoV-2 (Supplementary Fig. 3b) and have an almost identical RBD aa sequence with only two residue differences out of 204 aa residueshttps://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21240-1"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whatever actually happened, people have a pretty hard time with random chance.  They need someone to blame, and a good reason as to why something bad can&#39;t happen to them.  If the reason is &#34;it just happened randomly&#34;, that&#39;s uncomfortable.  There&#39;s nothing you can do to fix the problem, you just have to accept that every 100 years there&#39;s a 0.3% probability that you&#39;ll die from some random incurable disease.  But if the reason is &#34;some scientist was careless&#34;, then they can put that scientist in prison and society is saved from all future pandemics, and they can stop worrying.  Of course, that won&#39;t actually fix the problem, but it doesn&#39;t need to, it just needs to make people feel better.Especially for claims like this, they&#39;re nearly impossible to conclusively disprove, so people will cling to it regardless of whether or not it&#39;s true.  You&#39;ll see this come up again and again forever."</p>
