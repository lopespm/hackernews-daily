								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s remarkable how similar Swift and Rust are w.r.t syntax.Rust, Swiftlet x = 42;
let x = 42let x: i32 = 42;
let x: Int = 42let _ = 42;
let _ = 42let pair: (char, i32) = (&#39;a&#39;, 17);
let pair: (String, Int) = (&#34;a&#34;, 17)let (some_char, some_int) = (&#39;a&#39;, 17);
let (some_char, some_int) = (&#34;a&#34;, 17)fn greet() {
    println!(&#34;Hi there!&#34;);
}
func greet() {
    print(&#34;Hi there!&#34;)
}But, the languages are so different, for instance in Swiftlet x
x = 42let y = 13
let y = y + 3Wont fly for instance. I am trying to come up with the simplest explanation possible for this but I can&#39;t - goes to show how much I understand either of the languages."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Python programmer with limited experience with compiled languages, Rust code was more intimidating to read or look at than C++, Java or Go. After only an hour, I am overwhelmed by the sheer beauty and mature design of this language - it almost reads like Python or as well as any compiled language can. I cannot believe that I am smitten by Rust within an hour. Its features seem, obvious. My experience with Go was frustrating since I felt like I had to give up elegance for practicality. I did not expect to learn 1-2% of Rust when I woke up today. My thanks to the author.I&#39;m curious what other what other developers who primarily use Python think of this article and Rust in general?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There is a special lifetime, named &#39;static, which is valid for the entire program&#39;s lifetime.I&#39;ve heard this many times before, but as the guide[1] says:&#34;You might encounter it in two situations... Both are related but subtly different and this is a common source for confusion when learning Rust.&#34;&#39;static means different things for references and trait objects.ie.&#39;a: &#39;static --&gt; reference with lifetime &#39;a lives forever and can never be dropped.T: &#39;static --&gt; Type T has no references in it; it is effectively &#39;entirely owned&#39; by the owner of an instance of T.These are totally different things with the same name.(I believe technically there are actually three; `&lt;T: &#39;static &gt;` is a type constraint and `T + &#39;static` is a trait bound, but that both mean the same thing as far as I know)[1] - https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime/sta..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny, I actually have an open Pinetime in front of me right now. I use it for my masters thesis and it&#39;s a really nice project. If you want to try out some embedded development (that you can actually show to friends who don&#39;t aren&#39;t developers), I think this is the perfect project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be the perfect target for the products of a company like Pine. A long-time geek who uses open-source software on nearly all of his devices, a tinkerer who doesn&#39;t mind recompiling a kernel or picking a solderer to make things work, and someone who seeks for absolute flexibility from his devices with zero corporate compromises.Unfortunately, the mediocre hardware used in their devices keeps holding me back.First came a phone with a 9-year-old A53 Cortex chipset. Then a tablet with the same outdated chipset. Then a laptop that ships with a Rockchip RK3399 with 4GB of RAM, in an era when 4GB barely suffice to run a browser with a few tabs. And now they are releasing a smartwatch with a 64 MHz core and 64 KB of RAM - some specs you would have expected from a very cheap smartwatch released 7-8 years ago.Why should I use a device whose hardware is almost a decade old at the time of purchase? And how do they even expect anyone to actually use these devices as their primary daily drivers, and not as proofs of concept, nice toys to tinker on every now and then or show off to friends?I understand that Pine wants to use 100% open hardware, and that comes with heavy compromises, but are these compromises worth it?If you ask even the geekest user out there whether they prefer a device whose source code is 100% pure and doesn&#39;t contain any binary blobs, or a device that doesn&#39;t start freezing/lagging after a couple of minutes of normal usage, I bet that anyone would opt for the latter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, just to make sure I understand this correctly.- This is basically a commercial smartwach (the Colmi P8) that is based on a well documented SOC, the nordic nRF52832- The open source version comes with an enclosure that is not glued shut, so that it is easy to access testpoints on the pcb.- Development is done by accessing the nRF51 SWD interface with pogo pins or similar. The programming interface can be a standard SWD interface such as an STLink cloneOk, sounds easy enough. It should be possible to just buy one of those smartwatches and crack them open? But OTOH the developer version is not much more expensive.The main question is now: What software to run on it, that goes beyond a few experiments? Is there any kind of open source smartwatch OS that would run on this?Edit: Corrected typo, of course I meant SWD interface, not SWM. (SWM or rather SWIM is for STM8)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m curious what kind of thermal camera he&#39;s using.I bought a Therm-App Pro 640x480 a while back and it&#39;s quite good - and reasonably priced compared to Flir - along with a github repo for different false color palettes. But what&#39;s really weird is it seems to not be available anymore. I&#39;m guessing export restrictions or massive demand for thermal cameras during Covid along with supply chain issues. IIRC it is also 25 frames a second, which is unusually high for thermal cameras due to export restrictions.Edit: Here&#39;s a post on creating panoramic images with therm-app. https://www.flickr.com/groups/therm-app-users/discuss/721576..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cunning. He took panoramas with thermal camera and simultaneous black and white photos and coloured the b&amp;w photos with the data from the thermal camera. Interesting examples of insulation. I wonder how the result compares to the standard Flir auto blended images. Msx?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some ideas on this topic:1. Inconvenience based solutions don&#39;t address the problem: using apps to restrict phone use, physically hiding the phone etc. Once you leave those carefully constrained conditions, you are more vulnerable than ever. Not to mention the contradiction with the core issue that it&#39;s a symptom rather than a cause.2. Turning abstinence as an ongoing status condition (e.g. &#34;X days since I did Y&#34;) is a trap. It sets you up for later failure by burdening you with a perpetually unfinished objective with psychological consequences that only increase as the &#39;highscore&#39; increases. This could work with things that are less easily accessible like heroin, but it&#39;s not going to work with something as easily accessible as a phone or computer.3. The solution that works with 1 and 2 is probably urge surfing as it tackles the issue directly4. It&#39;s easier to think of it as an addiction to browsing rather than an addiction to the phone itself. You have to catch yourself during any browsing moment in any context to eventually make progress. Be intentional in almost every action instead of going on auto-pilot, although obviously resting at the end of the day is fine. It&#39;s more a general philosophy than a hard rule meant to exhaust you.5. The eventual goal is a rich life where you no longer feel the need to distract yourself"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The paper they are basing the opening sentence &#34;phone addiction is one of the biggest non-drug addiction(sic) in human history&#34; on is written by a Doctor of Business Administration, a dean that has &#34;particular industries of interest are banks and non-profit organizations&#34; in his bio and a third researcher with 2 publications total, including the article in question (published 2011).This may in no way weaken the point that some of the brightest minds of today are working on producing digital Skinner boxes, black on top, with humans as the rats, interfaced via phones.But basing an attempt at a strong argument about the addictive nature of cell-phones on an article with low relevance in scientific fields specializing in addiction could be described as suspect (most citations on g.scholar on the piece could be delineated as in the fields of business and management )."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I basically discourage addiction by making things “difficult” for myself on my phone:- Minimal web bookmarks (i.e. I have to type in most web sites I want to visit; this is just enough of an encumbrance that I won’t flip open things like Reddit every 30 seconds).- I never install apps meant for content consumption, I use their web sites.  (This is usually a better experience anyway, since the vast majority of them are somehow worse than their web sites, packed with ads/notifications/spying/crap that no one should want anyway.)- Certain web sites I refuse to use at all on mobile.  This gives me a much larger and more useful view anyway, and I can enforce sanity with a lot more plug-ins that way.- As of latest iOS, I shove most apps into the Library so they are not even on my home screen.  That way, they are straightforward to retrieve with a swipe-down search but not as easy as just tapping them open.  I find that I use them slightly less this way.- I turn off many notifications, since app-makers have long abused them anyway (as virtual ads, or designed in some way to suck people back into their apps for no reason; I drew the line when apps started outright lying about things, e.g. red dots implying messages that were not actually there, etc.).- I set it up so that my lock screen will not show most things without an extra step."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Larger companies that employ more than 20 people, have revenues above $5 million and a physical presence in the US, are exempt from the act. Churches, charities and other non-profits are also exempt.So it seems that the cost of money laundering has gone from a few thousands dollars for a Delaware C-Corp to running a fake business that employs 20 people and has an office. The minimum to launder under this scheme is $5m per year.This seems like the government stumping on small money launderers while giving the big guys a tax: employ some people, and rent some real-estate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"WSL2 was promised as a good working extension for a Linux dev environment on windows by my peers. Sadly, a whole host of issues specific to my dev environment meant that it was useless as I’d spend more time fixing it than getting any valuable use out of it. More importantly, this became the very reason I switched to arch full time, and haven’t looked back since. I still hope that it becomes what it was promised to be, although I don’t see myself going back to windows any time soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After constantly getting caught in bugs between WSL and Docker, i&#39;m now running Ubuntu Server headless with a Windows VM (with GPU passthrough) on top.The biggest issue across all these things is filesystems. There is simply no good way to share a filesystem between Windows and Linux that is both 1. fast 2. fully correct - i.e doesn&#39;t break some code.SMB/NFS just never work super well because they are slow, or programs think they are local filesystems so things break (e.g VScode won&#39;t detect new files created on the linux side of a SMB mount without a manual refresh). Plenty of details on getting permissions right too. Not to mention extended attributes which differ slightly and break stuff. Network file systems in general are just too different to local FS&#39;s for programs to work seamlessly.The 2 non-ideal solutions I&#39;ve found are 1. keep all files in linux + edit over network using VSCode Remote or IntelliJ Remote support or 2. keep a copy of the dev workspace in windows, and use something like unison (or manual git) to sync."</p>

From the time that you had to have Acrobat Reader installed because most of pdfs created with Acrobat (writer) weren&#39;t really compatible with other readers, or that time that everything interactive on the web was in Flash (even our governmental websites for example Social Insurance Institution dropped Flash few days ago).
My SO recently bought Adobe Lightroom and low and behold - you cannot install it on case sensitive filesystem (in 2020) and help page says: &#34;well just install it on case insensitive filesystem&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my good friends did a lot of research on PDFs as part of his graduate research. Older versions of Adobe Writer (maybe even the current one too?) would always append and never overwrite. So if you edited pages, it would add those edits to the bottom of the file. As long as you did everything in the Writer workflow and didn&#39;t Save As a new file, you could see a history of old edits. You can even find stuff that&#39;s blacked out in some government documents."</p>

You can still find enough indie music and games and movies to spend all your free time on.Similarly, if you know where to look and whose papers to watch out for, you can read more interesting stuff. The existence of more bullshit makes the filtering somewhat more effort, but it&#39;s bearable.Most papers are never deeply read anyway, outside of the reviewers. Even citations don&#39;t mean someone really read the paper in depth.So, most medíocre, boring papers get ignored.It&#39;s an illusion to expect that every researcher can pump out multiple really interesting non-boring papers every year. So we pretend. We write, we cite, we present, overiflate, overpromise etc. It must look like there is steady hard noble work and toil. It&#39;s like a ritual. The scientists are writing all these papers so tax payers can sleep well that their money is paid for hard work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing to keep in mind is that some of the papers which reviewers consider very marginal turn out to be breakthroughs. For example Jim Allison, who later won the Nobel Prize:&#34;Allison was hoping to be published by one of the leading peer-reviewed research journals. But nobody at Cell or Nature or any of the A-list, peer-reviewed journals was willing to publish the findings of this junior academic from Smithville, Texas. “Finally, I ended up publishing the results in a new journal called The Journal of Immunology.” It wasn’t Science or the New England Journal of Medicine, but it was in print, and in the world.“At the end of the paper, I said, ‘This might be the cell antigen receptor, and here are the reasons why I think that it is the T-cell antigen receptor,’ and I just listed it out, all the reasons.” It was a bold announcement regarding the biggest topic in immunology. “And nobody noticed it,” Allison says. “Except in one lab.”&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/meet-jim-allison-the-texan-who-j...So you really need to publish the marginal stuff to make sure the breakthrough stuff gets published as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"But on the other hand, with a severe replication crisis in science (https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replicat...), isn&#39;t it a good thing that we have a bunch of boring papers that are close to stuff that&#39;s already happened? It&#39;s not people replicating others&#39; findings exactly, but it at least gives points of comparison that can help to weed out some of the problematic work out there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Chief of Advertising Integrity&#34; does anyone take that title seriously? Forget advertising, Facebook and it&#39;s CEO himself has no integrity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a corporation, Facebook truly seems to be trying to improve its behavior for the benefit of society at large, but the company is finding it very difficult to do The Right Thing, because it would reduce future revenue growth, shrink long-term profitability, and hurt the company&#39;s competitive standing against the many other companies that are trying to eat Facebook&#39;s lunch every day.In the extreme, Facebook&#39;s choices appear to be: (a) act in the best interest of society and get f#cked by competitors; or (b) remain a dominant force in the market, but as a side effect, f#ck everybody. All options for Facebook appear to be a mix of those two horrible choices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook is a company that never stood by small businesses. It&#39;s also the company that manipulated users into a free basic services just to create their own walled garden in the internet.Still, sardonically they created two ad campaigns: Apple vs free internet and vs small businesses. Their whole marketing stunt was laughably wrong. No wonder their chief left the company."</p>
