								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN!I built this small app in my spare time to aggregate books recommended on Hacker News. I personally find books recommended on HN to be super helpful, so I think this is the way that I can contribute back.This book aggregation idea is not new. A bunch of sites have done similar things [1, 2, 3].Yet one common limitation of those sites is that they have limited recall (i.e. not able to get a comprehensive set of book mentions), and thus don&#39;t paint an accurate picture of what the top books are. They&#39;re all based on insufficient rules, e.g., looking for Amazon Links. As you can see from my app, people often do not include Amazon links when recommending a book.I wondered, why can&#39;t we just match book names? Well, not so easy. Some books have pretty short names, e.g. Meditations [4], or Steve Jobs [5]. Some book name might as well be the name of a movie, e.g. Ready Player One [6]. Simply matching the names of the books would produce a whole lot of irrelevant results.This is where Deep Learning comes into play. Recent advances in large NLP models (transformers and BERT in particular) have made machine language understanding unprecedentedly accurate. It enables me to fine-tune a BERT model on a couple thousand labeled HN comments and predict accurately whether each word in a comment is part of a book or not - a task commonly termed as Named Entity Recognition (NER).As a result, my app is able to present a whole lot more results while maintaining desirable accuracy. For example, NER works pretty well on the tough examples I mentioned ([4, 5, 6]). Compared to prior sites, my app captures 9-50X more mentions and thus presents a much more complete picture of what books are recommended on HN.Furthermore, I&#39;ve made sure that the comments are presented well in the UI because the recommendations are just as useful as the books. I highlighted the mentioned book name, and used a custom NLP-based ranking function to sort the comments. These are non-trivial improvements over prior sites, which I hope you can find useful.Nevertheless, this app is not without limitations: 1) matching book names would fail when two books have the same or similar names; 2) although not often, this approach would wrongly classify some short stop-word names [7] and 3) sometimes NER fails to see that the commenter actually hates the book. These problems can be alleviated with more Deep Learning. For 1), one can use BERT to learn the authors mentioned which can be used as a filtering criteria. 2) and 3) should be fixable with more training data (currently there are only ~4,000 hand-labeled HN comments).Lastly, I&#39;d like to especially thank my gf who helped me label ~1,000 comments, which boosted the model accuracy by 5 percent! I also want to thank the people who create and maintain the HackerNews big query dataset [8]. And of course, thank everyone on HN who recommends books to others.Hope you enjoy this app!  Feedback and suggestions are welcome :)[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15169611[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10924741[3] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12365693[4] https://hacker-recommended-books.vercel.app/category/0/all-t...[5] https://hacker-recommended-books.vercel.app/category/1/all-t...[6] https://hacker-recommended-books.vercel.app/category/0/all-t...[7] https://hacker-recommended-books.vercel.app/category/12/past...[8] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19304326P.s. The amazon links are NOT sponsored. This app is free of monetization."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice. The Hacker News archive contains a wealth of great information. I&#39;ve previously performed similar extractions like OP but with grep and SQL. I&#39;ve also looked for people who have accurately predicted the stock market (I did identify one pro investor. He&#39;s now into NFTs). I&#39;ve found so much cool stuff, spending whole nights looking for interesting users and reading their entire post histories and being blown away by many insightful posts. I&#39;ve been considering making a blog consisting entirely of insightful HN posts that I come across."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You mention the Amazon links are not affiliate links. As a default, that&#39;s a nice move, but I believe you are within your rights to add a toggle to enable affiliate links. The money probably isn&#39;t the point but it&#39;s nice to make enough to buy even a single beer or coffee from a side project, and honestly I believe just about everyone would toggle the option if they found the tool useful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a minor counterpoint: I&#39;ve come to dread blogs and newsletters because so many of them are written by grind culture freaks who only write faux-insightful SEO&#39;d content as a way to build an audience to sell snake oil to. These days the only blogs I trust are the ones I see on the top of HN or lobsters, which is unfortunate because I have interests beyond tech and I find it very, very difficult to find good blogs I can read about those interests.I think that shows there is a problem with blogging that goes beyond just the medium. Consider that blogging is a decentralised ecosystem, so you have no central place for discovery outside of Google specifically and search generally. Being on the top of Google is an attractive proposition because it means many eyeballs and lots of ad revenue. Therefore it is natural that many new blogs exist to game the search engine, hence the term &#34;blogspam&#34;.Some of the same incentives exist with large social media sites as well, but on Twitter and the like if you mute/block enough big people and follow only those you care about, your feed will eventually become clean enough to look at every day. So I think it is much more important to solve the discovery problem with blogs if you want them to get more traction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah blogs are still here, BUT: (like email (sob) and telephone-calling (hooray)) a lot of people that once did blog don&#39;t anymore.Not in the &#34;I had kids so my blog went dark for a few years&#34; sense, but in the sense of &#34;ooh twitter was invented and now I just emit a halfassed one-sentence brainfart or 5-second tiktok cellphone video and get way more dopamine hits&#34;.I&#39;ve been reading blogs and perusing my self-curated NetNewsWire RSS feeds for 20+ years, and blogs never went away, RSS never died, Google Reader getting googled didn&#39;t really matter, etc.And there are probably technically more blogs now than ever before.But still, the blog kinda died, in the sense that it would be a lot more surprising to learn your friend&#39;s 80-year-old grandma has a blog today than it would have been in 2011.It went from an increasingly-mainstream thing to a decreasingly-mainstream thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, blogs are still very much there. I began blogging in 2006 and I still continue to write blog posts, mostly to take notes, share my thoughts, etc. I still follow my favourite bloggers via RSS feeds. I don&#39;t think the culture of blogging ever went away. The blogosphere along with its tag clouds are still very much there.I think what has changed in the last two decades or so is that a lot of new users have come on the Internet and this new generation of users spend most of their time in walled gardens thereby making the bloggers look like a small minority."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A more relevant metric to consider - monthly mortgage payment to monthly income ratio.Average interest rates in 2007 were 6.34% vs ~2.80% today. [1]* 6.34% / $2,000 monthly payment / 20% down (~$65k) &gt;&gt; $328,319 price of home* 2.80% / $2,000 monthly payment / 20% down (~$98k) &gt;&gt; $489,794 price of homeHomebuyers will make purchasing decision based on their monthly mortgage payments, instead of the home price.When interest rates fall, the home&#39;s price goes up but the monthly payment can stay the same. Therefore, increases in home (and other asset, since lower bowering costs can drive institutional investment in assets higher and non-linearly) prices can be driven higher without any change in supply / demand dynamics.Some hypotheticals to consider:* as rates approach and touch 0, what will drive up home prices then?* what happens when rates go up?[1] http://www.freddiemac.com/pmms/pmms30.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it doesn&#39;t directly affect the average person&#39;s purchasing power, the same dramatic increase is happening in other asset values as well. [0] One interesting thing to note is that 2019 EV / EBITDA values were already &#34;high,&#34; before the coronavirus was spreading.I suspect these two phenomena have different causes overall, but low interest rates are a common factor that cause all asset prices to increase.On the housing side, I suspect consumers purchase the house that their cashflow can comfortably support, not necessarily the one where they believe it is correctly valued, because the assumption that house values only increase means purchasing a well constructed house is almost never a &#34;bad deal.&#34;I&#39;m not sure what the &#34;solution,&#34; is, but knowing that voters hate when their home values fall does not give me confidence that prices will decrease in the long term.[0] https://www.statista.com/statistics/953641/sandp-500-ev-to-e..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I live in Austin TX and got one of the mailers last year.  I was wondering how you pulled it off.The handwriting on the outside does make it look personal but, once you open it, it is obviously computer generated due to the consistency of the writing.  If anything, I&#39;d say the writing in inside undermined the message because nobody is going to handwrite a letter to solicit that business.  You should test only doing the signature only and see if impacts your response rate.We also got a couple of &#39;we want to buy your home&#39; mailings.  It does feel like it impacts our open rate but I can&#39;t tell if it is just due to novelty.I think the main reason it &#39;works&#39; as a business proposition is that the City is doing blanket increases and relying on protests to catch their mistakes.  They do this (in part) because they are forbidden from using actual MLS data.  It costs me 3-4 hours to do a protest so outsourcing it makes sense if your time is valuable.  But when it came down to it, I wasn&#39;t willing to let them represent me -- something about it felt off -- and I wound up just accepting the increase.The system doesn&#39;t feel broken -- just wasteful.  How else are you going to do a property tax?  I do wonder if this goes the way of medical billing (overcharge at first because you know you are going to lose some to protests) or it creates a watchdog effect that make the City limit the increases to an amount that is not likely to draw protests."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really impressive and fun to build I&#39;m sure. I bought an Axidraw last year to play around with making fake signatures of fake people and as well we were getting a ton of Etsy orders and we always write a hand written note, but we couldn&#39;t keep up at Christmas time and my wife&#39;s wrist was breaking, so it saved our bacon when we had to write like 600 notes in 6 weeks.The fact that you have to keep replacing the sheet and realigning is definitely a drag, but we made a system that worked well enough for us. Making the SVG letters is a pain and we are working on designing our own font from my wife&#39;s handwriting, but you can at least SVGize a picture of your writing and then touch it up in an editor.Gives a good excuse to buy lots of different fun pens and paper, but yeah it&#39;s annoying when a pen stops writing half a letter and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s just an ink thing or a pressure thing.We&#39;ve gotten positive reviews that mention our handwritten notes at least and lots of comments on great service and such, so we think it makes a difference."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is honestly very cool from an engineering perspective, it feels highly unnecessary and even disingenuous. the whole point of sending a handwritten letter &#34;in this day and age&#34; is to signal that real effort was put forth for this communication which indirectly shows its importance to the sender.The difficulty and tediousness of the action is precisely what gives it it&#39;s perceived value in the eyes of the receiver.And while it&#39;s arguable that building such an elaborate contraption to mimic handwriting is in itself a signal of the importance of the communication, it still gives off a sense of disingenuousness to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; seems to compare the Firefox version number with 65 ... I’ve no idea what the purpose of this isI previously worked on JS infra at Google.  Google uses a lot of shared JS libraries that date back over a decade, and those libraries have accumulated lots of workarounds for browsers that nobody cares about anymore.  (One especially crazy seeming one from today&#39;s perspective is that there&#39;s a separate implementation of event propagation, I believe because because it dates back to browsers that only implemented one half of event bubbling/capture!)It&#39;s very difficult to remove an old workaround because1. it&#39;s hard to be completely sure nobody actually depends on the workaround (especially given the wide variety of apps and environments Google supports -- Firefox aside, Google JS runs on a lot of abandonware TVs), and2. it&#39;s hard to prioritize doing such work, because it&#39;s low value (a few less bytes of JS) and nonzero risk (see point 1) without meaningfully moving any metrics you care about.In all, how to eliminate accumulated cruft like is a fascinating problem to me in that I can&#39;t see how it ever gets done.  And it&#39;s not a Google thing.  Even the newer cooler startup I now work at has similar &#34;work around old Safari bug, not sure if it&#39;s safe to remove&#34; codepaths that I can imagine will stick around forever, for similar reasons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Technically, color me impressed.Business-wise, I&#39;m skeptical:- Alternative browser engines have always fallen behind, eventually.- Open-source is a huge win for most embedded applications.- Having a big company backing something is a huge win too, since something like Webkit ain&#39;t going away.I think one possible outcome here might be an acquisition. Microsoft was forced to eat crow with Edge adopting Google&#39;s engine. This would be an opportunity for Apple, Microsoft, or Amazon to leapfrog Google. A GPU or multicore-accelerated browser could make the iPhone/Macbook/etc. much more responsive than Chrome.Another might be some open-source strategy, but I don&#39;t quite know what it might be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"*Closed source browser.Flow is yet another project pulling on open source resources, and the browser market created from open browsers, and trying to privatize it. Imagine if google could just make whatever internal changes to chromium and nobody knew about it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not directly relevant to the article, but it&#39;s probably a public service to have this here:
If you&#39;re in the U.S., do not consent to a search! Ever!If the police ask permission to search you, your car, or your house, say &#34;I do not consent to a search&#34;. Followed by, &#34;Am I being detained?&#34; If the answer is &#34;No, you are not being detained.&#34; then leave immediately (unless at your house, in which case go inside and lock the door).Police are good at making you feel as if you have to consent. They might say, &#34;We&#39;re going to search your car now.&#34; Makes it seem like you don&#39;t have a choice and it&#39;s happening one way or another, yeah? Well it&#39;s not the case. That was your cue to say, &#34;I do not consent to a search&#34;. Saying &#34;I do not consent to a search&#34; might prevent a search or make evidence obtained during that [illegal] search inadmissible. Or it might be found that the police had probable cause or other reason to make the search legal, in which case you lost nothing.Record + immediately upload such an interaction if you can.As an aside, I appreciate like 90% of the work the police do."</p>

I develop mostly via SSH and RDP so I found that any connection was important and total bandwidth wasn&#39;t the highest priority. Also in the US, way better coverage of 4g. Because of that invested fully in 4g and not at all in 5g.* 11 in 1 Panorama External Antenna (LG-IN2447) around $500. 4 internal cradlepoint antennas, see photo below. In retrospect would not have invested so heavily in wifi antennas and bought more 4g. I also added a little antenna lifter to make sure it has line of site of all cell towers, I wanted it to be the highest point on my sprinter van roof.* Cradlepoint IBR1700 1200M-B around $900 on ebay. Runs on 12 volt, a ton of antenna ports has 1 internal modem that supports big US carriers, came with an additional modem that does the same for carrier aggregation. A bunch of different ways to configure the router to aggregate links, mostly I switch back and forth manually, I found that if there was an issue it would be obvious and I could just switch the link. Cradlepoint software wouldn&#39;t handle issues and signal strength that well. Honestly one carrier has been plenty good for me though and between ATT and Verizon, I only have issues in the national parks where there are cell dead zones.* Verizon and ATT 4g cell plans. I added 1 line on my family plan for Verizon and the same with a friends family plan with ATT for $20 a month each. Took some phone calls into support to get it to work but after some escalations in the support chain I have unlimited 4g data. Total bill is around $50 a month.* Still room to add more sim cards and more antennas. It honestly works great though, get 20-150 mbps basically everywhere.Photo of my antenna and cradlepoint router/modem:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a pretty impressive setup. Recently I lived in an RV for a year and my setup was much more janky than this...Basically consisted of a gl.inet router that I plugged in a old Moto X4. This allowed me to get wifi from whichever campsite we stayed at (always garbage) and then I would pay for 100GB from Cricket and T-Mobile. I would swap sims when I would run out of data about half way through the month.Then I discovered I could get unlimited data on Cricket with a regular phone plan if I changed the TTL on the router. Ended up being the most stable option for the last few months."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lived and worked remotely from a van in Australia for a year... in 2008. It was pretty different back then. We kitted the van out with a solar panel  and batteries. There was some 3G service available near roads, and something like CDMA a little more widely. But at times we&#39;d end up driving miles of dirt track to try to find high ground to pick up a signal. My gf would hold the 3G receiver up and look for signal. During one of these treks, trying to turn around on a narrow dirt track way outside of Tenant Creek, the side of the road collapsed like a sand dome under one wheel of the van and we began listing to the side. I had to hold it up with my shoulder so the whole van wouldn&#39;t fall over on its side. My gf got out, causing it to tip even more, and started throwing herself against the back of it, while I tried to rock it out of the ditch. It was at this point that I noticed that what I had thought was a tree branch (odd, since there were no trees around), was actually a 4-5 foot long black snake that was moving rather quickly toward us up the road. I guess that gave us the adrenaline burst we needed, because we miraculously heaved the van free and jumped inside just in time. I started it and unceremoniously drove right over the snake.Another funny story... One night camping off a road, not in a campsite, we heard a ruckus outside the van where we had our table and cooking  stuff set up under a tarp. It was pitch black out. We kept a katana under the platform bed for protection. So I opened the rear door and jumped out in my boxers and sandals, holding this sword, and found myself looking at a large kangaroo that was rifling through our cookware. I got back in the van and said, forget it, I&#39;m not fighting that thing... we&#39;ll just have to clean it up in the morning."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I offer phone support for a niche accounting app (https://quailhq.com), and everything in this article rings 112% true to me -- but especially this:&gt; ...all sorts of people call you, and I’ve really learned a lot by talking with users directly on the phone.Sometimes users call me because they want to report a bug, or they&#39;ve forgotten their email address. Sometimes they want business advice (!), or they have a niche feature they want to request.&gt; This may be a virtue of the Japanese, but, basically, everyone who calls is civil and polite.Hahahaha. Haha. Hah. Ahem. The biggest surprise to me when I started offering support (first email, and then later by phone) is how _aggressive_ people can be. My app has two classes of users -- one free, one paid -- and the paying users are almost invariably polite and efficient while the free users can be really quite...hard to help. &#34;YOUR SHITS BROKE FIX ASAP&#34; is my favorite password reset request, etc.All of my users are American (or Australian), which might have something to do with it. Happily, once you break through that aggressive exterior and people realize you&#39;re just a person trying to help them out they almost invariably do a 180 and become helpful and polite, and we get whatever it was straightened out together.It&#39;s almost like there&#39;s something cultural happening in America that&#39;s making everyone assume the worst when interacting with people they don&#39;t know..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would abstract this topic to: talking to your users is important, and phone is a high-bandwidth medium.In particular, it seems like this developer recognized that phone connects them to their less technically savvy users, who - by being most different from the dev himself - can give him the most valuable outside perspective. Depending on your market, if you&#39;re trying to sell into non-techies this could provide hugely valuable insights.In general, the closer you are to the development side of things, the more you have a very specific (and I guess &#34;correct&#34;) model of how your system works. By default, all of your documentation/support forms/etc implicitly reflect this model. But if your users model the thing in their brain differently, then your help/form aren&#39;t the most helpful in educating them or eliciting their true feedback/problem.One final thing - I have seen &#39;magic&#39; where developers who chafed at tickets coming in from support staff (withdrawn, user error) would all of a sudden get excited about rebuilding something when the user themselves or even the support person, just explained in a higher-bandwidth way why the problem is real. It&#39;s easy to read a ticket and go &#34;oh that&#39;s dumb, they should just do X&#34; but on the phone/in person you go more into like &#34;oh, this is a really reasonable/nice/smart person who&#39;s trying to use my system to do something important, and it&#39;s not letting them.&#34;Gets a totally different type of results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I ran my own business I had a product in the thousands of dollars price range. Phone support for this product would almost always be an interesting conversation where I learned a lot about customer needs.I also had a $25 PDF tool with a trial version. For that product a lot of the callers had no clue what the product actually did or tried to get a $5 discount or some other nonsense. I quickly stopped taking calls for that product because it was so unpleasant.My lesson was to offer phone support only for high price, low volume items. Phone support for cheap things attracts a lot of unpleasant people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That&#39;s excellent advice that many have learned the hard way...Honestly even as a non-manager it&#39;s a very bad idea. When I was a junior one of my colleagues was called to the manager&#39;s office. I assumed it would be for some mundane project scheduling or whatever, so I jokingly said &#34;you&#39;re getting fired&#34; as he was going there. And he was.This is one of these memories that come back to haunt you late at night when you&#39;re trying to sleep..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a more general advice - person in position of power should not joke about causing harm. Whether is is manager joking about firing employee, stronger person joking about beating up weaker one or parent joking about throwing child out of house when they misbehave. This kind of humor works only when it is coming from weaker position and even then only in certain situations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No one told me this prior to becoming a manager, and I did make this mistake once and immediately regretted it.It seems like obvious advice, but the circumstances where this sort of thing could happen are described very well in the article.I revert to humour in awkward situations, like a lot of people, but I quickly realised that there are some things that you can’t joke about when in this position.Thankfully I don’t think the team member took any offence by it (although how would I know) - we had a good rapport and relationship, but I immediately realised my “joke” could be taken so many different (wrong) ways that I made a conscious decision to be much more careful after that.Like many things in life, it seems blindingly obvious in retrospect but not necessarily when you’re caught up in the moment."</p>
