I th8nk this line is telling: &#34;Since there are no known victims/ targets for the ransomware group, their Tactics, Techniques and Procedures remain unknown.&#34;I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a risk if any great outbreak here. A bunch of scriptkiddies took some open source project and modified it with some silly instructions.Alternatively, I could see this used in one of those scam calls. They set up remote accesslike normally and then months laltrr the6 infrct their victims and the &#34;trusted Microsoft technician&#34; gives them a call to steal even more off their money. This time there&#39;s an actual piece of malware that gets removed, solidifying trust in the scammers even though they were the ones to infect the victims in the first place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I took pandemic time to learn some knots, and then forget a bunch of them that didn&#39;t offer enough distinct utility to me.  I highly recommend the Farrimond Friction Hitch: https://www.animatedknots.com/farrimond-friction-hitch-knotIt&#39;s simple and fast to tie (with a little practice for muscle memory), and with an extra turn has exceptional friction preventing loop collapse in some situations where even a bowline would have an issue.  However, by relieving tension on one side of the knot, like a taut-line hitch it can slide.I use it for its common application of tensioning, but I also find it useful for cinching. It can go anywhere a cord lock might have been useful in but a few seconds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My favorite knot is the Zeppelin Bend: [1]It&#39;s used to tie the ends of two ropes together.It&#39;s super easy to tie, super easy to untie (when you want to), and will not untie accidentally.[1] - https://www.animatedknots.com/zeppelin-bend-knot"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like Knots3D, but there are some alternatives that made it easier for me:1. The Klutz Book of Knots (it&#39;s a book with holes around the pages so you can practice the knots next to their instructions). I think it&#39;s supposed to be a kid&#39;s book, but I bought for myself few years ago and was probably the resource I used the most.2. I find it _much_ easier to learn how to tie a knot by watching someone&#39;s hands while they explain what they&#39;re doing. KnottingKnots on Youtube is incredible at that:
https://www.youtube.com/c/KnottingKnots/I think the knots I use the most, both in everyday life as well as for hiking are (from most used to least used):  - Trucker Hitch
  - Bowline knot
  - Clove hitch
  - Figure of Eight knot (bend too but less often)
  - Sheet Bend
  - Prusik knot
  - Square knot
  - Taut line hitch"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great article and great collection of links!I have taken up coding simple SVG icons by hand, and it&#39;s easier than it looks. Also, a great feature of SVG is the &lt;defs&gt; element, which lets one define shapes anywhere in an HTML page, and reuse them anywhere else (ie, not inside the same SVG).So for example one can have an SVG element at the top of the page that lists a bunch of symbols in a global defs element, and reuse them at will some other places, without loading anything externally, or copy-pasting anything.Used shapes can also be transformed: different colors for fill or stroke, scaled up or down, rotated, moved, etc.&gt; Good news, you can achieve fractional ratings with only CSS and inline SVG. Samuel Kraft explains how it works.The technique presented in that other page is overly complex and convoluted.Fractional stars can be done very simply in pure SVG with gradients. Here&#39;s an example of a grey star filled at 40% with red:    &lt;svg xmlns=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2000/svg&#34; viewbox=&#34;0 0 60 60&#34;&gt;
      &lt;defs&gt;
        &lt;polygon points=&#34;30,0 10,60 60,22 0,22 50,60&#34; id=&#34;star&#34;/&gt;
        &lt;/defs&gt;
      &lt;linearGradient id=&#34;gradid&#34;&gt;
        &lt;stop offset=&#34;40%&#34; stop-color=&#34;red&#34;/&gt;
        &lt;stop stop-color=&#34;grey&#34;/&gt;
        &lt;/linearGradient&gt;
      &lt;use href=&#34;#star&#34; fill=&#34;url(&#39;#gradid&#39;)&#34;/&gt;
      &lt;/svg&gt;

In order to change the fill one just needs to manipulate the offset attribute of the first stop.If there are many stars it can be tiresome to attach a different gradient to each star; what I do in that case is define 8 gradients from 10% to 90% fill, and reference them as needed for each object that needs to be filled to approx. that percentage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These are great! I found out recently that GitHub supports SVGs in your profile README so couldn&#39;t resist setting up a huge animation on mine[1], you can&#39;t run JavaScript in SVGs unless they are inlined with the HTML but maybe it would be possible to setup a GitHub action to automatically generate it periodically.https://github.com/jnordberg"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"sounds like the same experience I have with pretty much every language I&#39;m not used to.I just want to try this C++, download, unzip, oh it&#39;s windows so .project file.

You don&#39;t but there are several magic spells you must execute and runes you must set in the rigtt places. Oh ... I think I got that setup but it getting this new error.....I&#39;m sypathetic it sucks but it&#39;s not unique to js"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience also. As a backend engineer trying to create a front end app, the whole toolchain of JS, bundlers, minifiers, Typescript, React... is basically; works if you have one magical init script that wires up everything, and much more than you really need since its tailored for more complex apps, but if you need just simplest thing, like run Typescript app in browser, well, good luck with that! Hundreds of tutorials (unofficial blog posts) on internents, none of them work.   
Front end dev work is broken.Also, funny experience: asked few senior FE devs how to configure React, webpack and TS manually, absolutely nobody could do it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"JS tooling has come a long way in the last couple of years, Vite for example is so much better than everything that came before. Esbuild is incredible and clearly the future of all JS build tools.The trouble is that to people who are only just outside JS ecosystem it’s not very accessible. If you are a PHP, Python or Ruby developer who cut your teeth in the era of jQuery or earlier (prototype.js &amp; script.aculo.us!) it can be quite difficult to make the transition.Combining the modern JS environments with platforms like Django, Laravel or Rails often means having to install and setup from scratch a full Node/NPM toolchain in parallel with your backend toolchain. I believe this is some of the reason for such a disconnect between the the “backend” and “frontend” unless you go 100% JS. I think it&#39;s pushed a lot of devs who used to think of themselves as &#34;full stack&#34; towards the backend.I’m trying to fix this with Tetra (https://www.tetraframework.com) for the Django ecosystem, the plan is to eventually bundle a esbuild/postcss/sass/less toolchain along with built in tools for installing JS dependancies so you can completely live within the Python/Django environment. It will manage all the complexities of JS tooling for you.The vast majority of developers don&#39;t want to think about tooling, they just want to build something quickly and get it out there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was going to criticize &amp; point out how usb-c chargers at and over 100W are just so small, but there&#39;s a photo comparing it to an iphone &amp; ok, it looks adequately impressively dense! (I have a &gt;2 year old 100W charger that is 66x64x30mm, this 250W unit is 170x50x25)It&#39;s been such a great synergy. Energy efficiency has been a concern already yes, but I really view usb-c chargers as pushing the consumerization &amp; massification &amp; development of this technology to the superb, common, un-exotic levels it&#39;s come down to. We just got tired of doing less good, actively explored trying to use a somewhat harder to drive switching semiconductor, &amp; have reaped great rewards. Miniaturization mandated optimization &amp; we all win. I really think the interchangable-parts/modularity &amp; resulting competition that usb-c begot started this ball rolling.(Hoping USB-PD, with it&#39;s bump from 20 up to 48V, once again proves another huge win!)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"$145 is pretty steep, and I&#39;d like to see the Vpp (also called ripple) before considering this. I currently use picoPSU (ASIN B005TWE5E6), 50W and 80W versions to power 7th and 8th gen atoms and celerons. I use a &#34;UPS&#34; style 12VDC PSU connected to a fairly large sealed lead acid battery - about 4x the volume of a standard UPS battery. As far as my measurements go with the induced noise from the PSU for radio reception work, it seems to work pretty good. I&#39;ve looked at using SBCs instead, but you&#39;re never really going to get away from buck/boost on boards, since some things need 3.3 or less volts (memory, etc). The picoPSU also have survived for years up in elevator attics with all of the machinery and dust. never had an outage caused by the picoPSU or the attached 12V UPS stuff.I wonder if it is possible to run more than one board off the same PSU. I know you can run a board off multiple PSUs, but is the inverse true? If i ever get a new batch of these 25W TDP computers racked, having 2 of these connected to two UPS and 6 computers might be cool. It&#39;s just the ATX connector that needs population, i use NVME whenever possible, no GPU, no cards, just USB and ethernet onboard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context: I’ve been working with iOS full time since a few years before Swift came out.A few startups ago we built our app using SwiftUI 1.0. At that time, while 90% of it was fantastic, 10% was either unworkable or extremely unreliable, causing for some maddening bugs. The documentation was laughable so for these reasons I chose to do the app for a subsequent startup in UIKit.Fast forward to my most recent company; decided to give SwiftUI another shot (targeting iOS 14 &amp; SwiftUI 2). I am 100% glad we did. It’s been pretty incredible; we’ve built a reasonably complex banking app at a pace not possible with UIKit. The animations in particular are crazy good to work with; we’ve got some very complex animated flows that would have taken weeks and thousands of lines with UIKit… with SwiftUI it was about 5 days.It’s definitely not without its downsides; documentation is still slim at best, but there’s plenty of blogs and resources (https://swiftui-lab.com/ is the most helpful IMO) available now. There are also still some maddening bugs that appear in production and take a day or two of head scratching only to discover it’s a bug in the framework (most recently; using #available causes code to crash on the platform it’s protecting against lol), but there are always workarounds. Still, time wasted on these has been vastly outweighed by the weeks / months of time saved.Finally, you can always use UIKit as an escape hatch through UIViewRepresentable.iOS 15 is at 85% adoption, so we plan to drop support for 14 somewhat soon, which will give us an even more robust framework as well as async await APIs. Not feasible for most companies I know, but even supporting 14+ Will be pretty reasonable when iOS 16 drops in September."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You could write an opposite article featuring people using SwiftUI that have never touched UIKit or iOS code before and it would be nothing but glowing praise.That&#39;s kinda like my story. Covid started and I wanted to learn something new so I started with Swift/SwiftUI. 2 years later I&#39;ve been doing tons of crazy custom stuff in my portfolio tracker app https://stocketa.com (not launched yet) - I kept a thread with my progress since the first day I started my journey: https://twitter.com/Stammy/status/1527288954935922688 (scroll up).This was last june but I wrote about my experience with SwiftUI at the time: https://paulstamatiou.com/getting-started-with-swiftui/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really looking forward to what comes of it, but I have chosen to do my current major project in UIKit.A couple of reasons:1) The documentation for SwiftUI, when I started (about two years ago) was awful. I was shocked at how bad it was. I believe that it has since improved.2) I knew of no major apps (even Apple ones) that had been done with it.I already knew that UIKit was up to the task, and held my nose, while I set things up. It&#39;s working out extremely well, but (of course) I&#39;d like to rewrite the whole thing (a sure sign that I&#39;m approaching ship).I like things like the MVVM pattern, but it&#39;s been my experience that it&#39;s really not such a good idea to implement it in UIKit, because UIKit was designed explicitly for MVC. I have learned that those ugly-ass UIViewControllers are really important, and I circumvent them at my peril.I&#39;m able to release fairly basic Apple apps in UIKit, in just hours, so speed of development isn&#39;t compelling.What is compelling, is the ability to design a reactive system for a complex app (like the one I&#39;m writing now). AppKit has allowed this for some time, and it&#39;s possible to force UIKit to do it (but it isn&#39;t really designed for that).I really wish that SwiftUI had been a bit more mature, when I started this system, but I would have also needed to rewrite the two server SDKs I use, anyway. It wouldn&#39;t have worked, no matter how hard I bang my heels together.But I&#39;m looking forward to it.One thing that I&#39;ve learned, is that it&#39;s really OK to wait for things to mature. Companies always screech about how we need to jump on the bandwagon, but that&#39;s all hype. I have taken OpenDoc courses at Apple DU. I also busted my ass, getting my app ready for Copland. I have scars from Apple hype.I did take a big chance, by jumping directly into Swift, but that has turned out to be a good decision."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing to note is that the 2021 population is an estimate, and if you are a Census buff as I am, and compare the Census&#39; 2019 estimates to the 2020 actual populations (as calculated from the census), there are often very large differences.The article also says that CA&#39;s estimate of the population decline is much smaller, and arguably CA itself would have more accurate data for this particular metric (residency and voter rolls).So while I&#39;m sure the gist of the argument is true, there is probably a larger margin of error on the calculation than you&#39;d think at first glance. I&#39;m not quite going to say the article is sensationalist, but if you look at the totality of the data (house prices, rental prices, CA&#39;s population estimates, etc), I&#39;m not sure the &#34;SF is in freefall&#34; narrative holds up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think remote work is often understated in reasons people move away. When you go into the office every day, it&#39;s pretty obvious that you have to live in whatever city you live in. But with remote work, the question becomes &#34;if I don&#39;t have to live here, do I want to keep living here&#34;. For many (including myself), the answer was a definitive NO.Sure many headlines and news segments make it seem that it&#39;s the crime, the high rent, and all these super visible indicators and while I&#39;m sure that factored into the decisions of some, for many it was that they just wanted a change and got the golden opportunity to do so.EDIT: It&#39;s not even that one may even &#34;want a change&#34;, it&#39;s when you&#39;re presented with the opportunity to make a change, the gears in your head start turning as to what options you have at your disposal. I would imagine many people that moved had previously no intention to but just got the opportunity and decided to take it while it lasted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you compare rent trends of SF vs NYC or LAhttps://www.zumper.com/rent-research/san-francisco-cahttps://www.zumper.com/rent-research/new-york-nyhttps://www.zumper.com/rent-research/los-angeles-caYou&#39;ll notice a huge difference between in SF and the other cities. Rent prices still hasn&#39;t gone back to pre pandemic level."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the consequences of the effectiveness of click-bait titles on youtube is that searching for videos you watched historically is extremely difficult, because quite often the primary thing in the video is never mentioned in the title. The descriptions are almost universally used to store common links that are about the channel not the video and the consequence of this is that click-bait titled content is very hard to find after the fact. The other problem is quite a lot of channels are testing one title and then changing to another, the video wont then be found using the initial title and so even if you do remember elements of the title the channel may have made that impossible to use some hours or days later as another title with better performance was used.I can see a need for search in the contents of the videos but I don&#39;t want to specify the channel, I likely don&#39;t know especially since channels can also change their name."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey HN! I just launched VideoMentions Search, a free tool that allows you to search YouTube to find videos that contain specific spoken words.Here&#39;s how to quickly try it out -Let&#39;s say you want to find every video on The Verge&#39;s YouTube channel within the last several months in which &#34;MacBook Pro&#34; is mentioned. Here&#39;s a pre-populated search to accomplish that:https://videomentions.com/search?channelUrl=https%253A%252F%...If you follow that ^ link, then click the button to perform the search, you&#39;ll see all matching videos, with every single mention of &#34;MacBook Pro&#34; highlighted.My favorite part is that all the highlighted matches are timestamped. So you can click on any of them to jump to that exact moment in the video when that keyword was said!VideoMentions Search is great for these scenarios:- You want to find all videos within a YouTube channel that mention your brand, your product, or the topics you care about.- You remember watching a video where a certain topic was discussed, and now you&#39;re trying to remember which video it was to rewatch it.- You run your own YouTube channel and want to quickly find the exact moments in your videos where you cover certain topics, so you can link others to that content.I have wanted a way to search YouTube based on spoken words for a while. I couldn&#39;t find a tool that provides that capability though, so I built it!I hope you find VideoMentions Search useful! I&#39;d love to hear any feedback you have on it. Please let me know!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very interesting tool could see myself using it a lot.Couldn&#39;t help but search the guy that uploaded 2 million vids to yt, sorry if it breaks anything.It would be cool to search for a specific quote like &#34;buddy of mine&#34; (frequently said by Joe Rogan). Also searching for parts of a word (similar to regex options?) might be difficult to implement but would be super useful as an option i.e if i searched for any word that starts with yc with a correct pattern (or given option on the UI) i could find results for both &#34;yc&#34; and &#34;ycombinator&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"And this is why Whonix is critical - because even when you pop the browser, you still have another layer of protection - the gateway VM.Tails browser on [almost anything] is one browser exploit away from beaconing out directly from your IP, and has done so rather frequently over the years.Whonix stuffs the whole browser and such into a workstation VM, which is only connected to the gateway VM - which &#34;torifies&#34; everything coming in that port.  So even if you pop the workstation and have root, you still can&#39;t beacon out directly without going through the gateway - you&#39;d have to find an exploit in that bit as well, with only network access.  Not impossible, but a lot harder.And then package all that into Qubes and use it that way, because a disposable Whonix VM set is probably the safest way to browse the web...And still disable Javascript."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just a heads up for Android users: The Play store version is a few releases out of date, to get current use FDroid and make sure Guardian Project repo is selected (it&#39;s not by default).Question for the Mozillans/Googlers: How is it that Firefox Nightly are fast-track released multiple times a day to Play Store but stable Tor Browser updates are stuck for weeks? Is there a &#39;skip the review&#39; option for nightly releases?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a JavaScript engine bug and JS is disabled by default. Still important, but I question whether anyone who enables JS in Tor is worth compromising."</p>
