And maybe even longer with what will undoubtedly be awesome futuristic speech recognition--or mind-reading!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These stories usually spur more enthusiasm for buying cryptocurrency, but ironically those buyers aren’t interested in spending cryptocurrency using their MasterCard.They’re hoping other people will buy cryptocurrency from these announcements, driving the price up. Or, more likely, they’re just hoping other people will buy cryptocurrency and not use it in these spending systems.Spending cryptocurrency would result in selling that cryptocurrency, which would drive the price down. That’s not what cryptocurrency investors actually want.Should also note that MasterCard crypto transactions almost certainly won’t be settled on the blockchain. Not with $8 Bitcoin transaction fees.  They’ll just be denominated in cryptocurrency and people can deposit/withdraw in certain cryptocurrencies. MasterCard only needs to buy and sell on the blockchain as needed to provide an FX window. The actual transactions would be stored in traditional database systems (aside from customer deposits/withdrawals, just like Coinbase)Why? Because MasterCard would get to act as an exchange and collect exchange fees. Exchange fees are a great way to charge consumers for spending their own money in 2021, when normal credit cards actually pay people 1-2% to use them. Cryptocurrency’s inefficiency is their financial upside."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The game Paypal currently plays with Crypto is the closest thing to printing money I have ever seen:Their users can &#34;buy and sell Bitcoin&#34; and pay &#34;no fees&#34;. How does Paypal make money? &#34;From the spread&#34;. The difference between bid and ask. And who sets the spread? Drumroll ... Paypal!Since you cannot transfer your bitcoins out, when you sell your bitcoins, Paypal pays you whatever they like.So far, Paypal only offers this in the United States. And do the Americans take this offer? Yes! They buy over a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin per month on Paypal. If this continues, it means that every American from toddler to senior buys $50 worth of Bitcoin per year.Other companies in the finance industry will want the same free lunch. Run on crypto in 3..2..1..This will continue until the first companies will start to offer you to transfer your crypto out. Then slowly the market will normalize. Now everyone has crypto. In their paypal/mastercard/bank/whatever account and/or in their own wallet.Looks like chances for broader crypto adoption are pretty good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Correction: The Fed&#39;s policies have taken $50T of wealth from the Bottom 90%.When you bail out irresponsibly over-leveraged and nearly bankrupted banks and corporations, and pay for those bailouts with tax-payer money, you steal from the poor and give to the rich.Most importantly, when the Fed decides to print money ad nauseam, they create massive asset inflation, which steals from the poor and gives to the rich. This is because those dollars that are printed go directly into bonds, equities, and assets that only a small amount of the population owns a significant amount of. When money is &#34;printed&#34; the Fed actually injects money into financial markets through buying assets. This asset inflation caused by money printing gives more money to the rich to buy more assets, thus driving up the prices of financial products, real estate, and all other valued assets in society. Thus, cost of living skyrockets, but only the rich are actually increasing their net worth (which is increasing exponentially). All of this happens while minimum wage, and most wages, are stagnant.Wealth inequality and social unrest in America is DIRECTLY related to corrupt and/or incompetent (you choose) Fed policies. It amazes me why most people do not grasp this. I think it is lack of education."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the things that ruffles my feathers about this genre of made-for-mass-consumption clap-trap is this sort of proclamation:&gt; Other nations are suffering less from COVID-19 because they made better choicesWhich other nations? As someone who regularly reads francophone european news, I can assure you it isn&#39;t any nation in Europe. OP goes on to cite minimum wage, overtime pay, state-funded healthcare/childcare/education, and more powerful unions as choices Americans could make to improve their economic standing.But broader economic outcomes such as wealth inequality in Europe has followed a similar trajectory to that of the US over the past 40 years, and since the start of the COVID crisis, civil liberties have been decimated by the technocracy&#39;s crisis response, medical outcomes even with their much-vaunted state healthcare systems are not significantly better than in the US, and small businesses are failing and people are falling into poverty at astounding rates. The ECB prints euros in lock-step with the Fed&#39;s dollars.My intent isn&#39;t to make an argument for or against Euro-style social security features, but merely to remind that even with those features, Europe is not presently faring better than the US. Arguably coronavirus-related economic and social outcomes (medical outcomes notwithstanding, depending on the nation/state) in Europe are even more onerous than in the US at present.Furthermore, this whole episode could sweep far-right parties into power in Europe. It&#39;s essentially a given, for example, that Marine Le Pen will run against Macron again in 2022, and not at all certain that she will lose…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The framing in the article is ahistorical. The post-WW2 period was a period of exceptionally _low_ inequality. If you look back to just the 1800s there were swings in inequality comparable to the present day. We&#39;re now moving back to the historical baseline.There are some contributing factors to the shift in inequality, a major one being that labor is now oversupplied compared to the post-war period, and the competition is driving wages lower. The U.S. has much higher immigration rates now, which contributes to the oversupply of labor. The late 1800s and early 1900s had similarly high immigration and high inequality. [1]Whether the historical baseline for inequality is the best amount of inequality is a different question though. It&#39;s clear that as redistribution flattens the income curve there is dead-weight loss as highly productive people stop wasting their time doing taxable work. It&#39;s also clear that investing in children who would otherwise be malnourished or lack education or healthcare is a net positive for society. It&#39;s not clear to me that the current level of inequality is the wrong one - we&#39;re admitting a lot of immigrants who are vastly improving their life prospects as a result, the economy is growing, and technology is amazing. Spending more money on health care would have limited benefits [2]. I don&#39;t really have a strong opinion on whether inequality should be higher or lower (it&#39;s hard to find a good-faith analysis in these terms), but the Time article uses an arbitrary timeframe and doesn&#39;t shed any light on the question.[1] See Ages of Discord for a much more detailed dive into this. http://peterturchin.com/ages-of-discord/[2] Robin Hanson gives an argument with lots of evidence here: https://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/09/10/robin-hanson/cut-med..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I still cannot get over this product.  They whole selling point of a dyson fan is the &#39;air multiplier&#39; tech, which creates a low pressure zone that propels air through the ring.  According to dyson, this tech can move 15x more air than the fan in the base of the unit.  Why in the world would you build an air filter around a system that does not directly interact with 93% of the air it moves?https://www.jameco.com/Jameco/workshop/Howitworks/dysonairmu..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have tried the box fan + air filter. It&#39;s way too noisy and ugly. I ended up just getting a generic tower hepa air filter for a few hundred bucks. I have not tested whether or not it&#39;s more effective than the box fan, but it&#39;s way quieter and it looks way nicer, and that matters to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought an expensive Dyson air purifier for a couple of reasons. It has a remote so I can turn it on from bed. It looks attractive. The sound profile is much different than a box fan for sleeping at night. It can analyze the temperature, humidity, and air quality in real time and turn on if it notices air quality is getting bad. It also oscillates.That said yes it was expensive, but it replaced needing a fan for cooling and an air purifier, and if I needed a heater it could have done triple duty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personally I&#39;ve been really happy with my split 60% keyboard from UltimateHackingKeyboard [0]. It also has open source electronics files and firmwareI backed them on CrowdSupply some years ago and although it took a while to be delivered have used it extensively since and even purchased a second one for at home &amp; the office. A huge positive while waiting for it was the regular, informative status emails from the founder.Now they are on to v2 [1] with backlighting and better keycaps.The &#34;Agent&#34; firmware is also regularly updated and makes customising the keyboard a breeze. I won&#39;t go extensively into the functionality here but it&#39;s worth checking out.I am in no-way affiliated with UHK but if anybody is looking for a split, open source, customisable keyboard I would highly recommend.[0] https://uhk.io/[1] https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/blog/2020/11/05/introduc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why are so many keyboards tiny like this? If I want a small keyboard, I will just use a laptop.I have a huge desk, I don&#39;t want a 12&#34; keyboard with 2 weird small space keys, and the arrow keys smashed into the right side."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Over twenty years I&#39;ve spent too much money trying to get a keyboard that really worked for me... and I finally gave up and I now use the cheapest disposable crap from hole-in-the-wall electrical / electronics shop that I can walk to.Nearly all the DIY keyboards I&#39;ve seen are ruthlessly minimalistic and I really would prefer a larger keyboard with more keys, so I don&#39;t have to remember lots of meta-key combination short-cuts.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve memorised all the keyboard short cuts in a given piece of software in a decade... I just don&#39;t really use one particular thing enough to make it worthwhile.That keyboard with the active LED keycaps came out in what... 2006?  I expected a regular keyboard with small set of active keycaps for macro keys would have existed by now. Come to think of it, I never used an Apple laptop with that active TouchBar thing either but that doesn&#39;t seem to have achieved enduring popularity.  but I guess there&#39;s no real market for that either."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice. Using it for pavers makes sense, too. It will have some elasticity, which is fine for pavers but bad for structures.There are a few variants on this idea already. One is just to compress trash plastics into blocks, with no sand.[1] Another is a process more like brick making, where the material is melted.[2] That process is 20% recycled plastic, 80% sand etc.There are problems. UV deterioration. Cracking at low temperatures (probably not a problem in Kenya). Flammability. Poor adhesion to mortar. In the end, it&#39;s still polyethylene.[1] https://www.byfusion.com/[2] https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I4238.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people here are asking the same question and I can&#39;t find it addressed anywhere: how does this product not heavily pollute the environment? Since the bricks contain plastic they are prone to flaking and the formation of microplastic particles, which can last for thousands of years and get into the digestive systems of animals and humans. Also, the plastic might crack from constant UV radiation under the Kenyan sun. Could somebody explain what the rationale might be for putting 1000 plastic bricks/day into the environment or if there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regarding SQLite&#39;s performance, some things I&#39;ve found very useful:Use WAL mode (writers don&#39;t block readers):  PRAGMA journal_mode = &#39;WAL&#39;

Use memory as temporary storage:  PRAGMA temp_store = 2

Faster synchronization that still keeps the data safe:  PRAGMA synchronous = 1

Increase cache size (in this case to 64MB), the default is 2MB  PRAGMA cache_size = -64000

Lastly, use a modern version of SQLite. Many default installations come with versions from a few years ago. In Python for example, you can use pysqlite3[0] to get the latest SQLite without worrying about compiling it (and it also comes with excellent compilation defaults).[0] https://github.com/coleifer/pysqlite3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Solutions such as Kubernetes tout the benefits of zero-downtime deployments but ignore that their inherent complexity causes availability issues.&#34;This is completely accurate. I&#39;ve seen several teams do kubernetes, only to both spend 50% of their dev time on ops, AND cause outages due to kubernetes complexity. They do this all while boasting about zero downtime deployments. It&#39;s comical really."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “But nobody writes production applications with SQLite, right?&#34;We&#39;ve been doing it for 5 years now. Basic tricks we employ are:Use PRAGMA user_version for purposes of managing automatic migrations, a. la. Entity Framework. This means you can actually do one better than Microsoft&#39;s approach, because you don&#39;t need a special unicorn table to store migration info. A simple integer compared with your latest integer and executing SQL in the range is all it takes.Use PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL alongside PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL for maximum throughput while supporting most reasonable IT recovery concerns. If you are running your SQLite application on a VM somewhere and have RTO which is satisfied by periodic hot snapshots (which WAL is quite friendly to), this is a more than ideal way to manage recovery of all business data while also giving good throughput to writers. If you are more paranoid than we are, then you can do FULL synchronous for a moderate performance penalty. This would be more for situations where your RTO requires the exact state of the system be recoverable the moment it lost power. We can afford to lose the last few minutes of work without anyone getting yelled at. Some modern virtualization technologies do help a lot in this regard. Running bare metal you need to be a little more careful.For development &amp; troubleshooting, being able to copy a .db file (even while its in use) is tremendously powerful. I can easily patch up a QA database I mangled with a bad migrator in 5 minutes by stopping the service, pulling the .db local, editing, and pushing it back up. We can also ask our customers to zip up their entire db folder so we can troubleshoot the entire system state.Being able to use SQLite as our exclusive data store also meant that our software delivery process could be trivialized. We use zero external hosts, even localhost, for our application to be installed or started. We don&#39;t even require a runtime exist on the base operating system. Unzip our latest release build to a blank Win2019 server, sc.exe the binary path, net start the service, and it just works. Anyone can deploy our software because it&#39;s literally that simple. We didn&#39;t even bother to write a script because its a bigger pain in the ass to set powershell execution mode.So, its not just about the core data storage, but also about the higher-order implications of choosing to use a database solution that can be wholly embedded within your application. Because of decisions like these, we don&#39;t have to screw around with things like Docker or Kubernetes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have any specific knowledge of this event but I did work for a smart cities company for a while and can explain some of what hypothetically leads to messes like this.Most municipal infrastructure automation is run by SCADA systems. SCADA systems are designed to be closed ecosystems by default, which means they don&#39;t have access to the internet. Cables are run and point to point connections are made to transport these signals. If you&#39;ve seen a big shiny aluminum box on the side of the road, that&#39;s a SCADA system.Consumer demand has changed a lot since SCADA was first thought up. These days people want to be able to log into a portal and see their billed water usage by the day. Cities want to be able to turn off a meter remotely at the click of a button rather than rolling a truck. They want pressure loss, contaminate, and fault detection. They&#39;d like to balance pressure in the water system dynamically. They want to perform detailed reports on total water loss, which means instrumenting pumps, retrieving telemetry data, auditing that data against every home usage, identifying faults, and producing a report out of it. All of these things don&#39;t work very well with closed ecosystems as they generally require a certain amount of external information. In response, cities have either crafted their own devices because they don&#39;t have the money to hire an integrator to design and produce them a device that will survive extreme weather conditions, be fault tolerant, make minimal use of power, and employ standard security measures or they hire an integrator. Even certain integrators can do shotty work.The takeaway from this isn&#39;t that SCADA is bad or the infrastructure version of &#34;the sky is falling!&#34;. It&#39;s that we desperately need to be thinking about how different generations of systems can be modularized and be built upon to minimize cost while maximizing security, capability growth, and reliability.For the folks talking about &#34;who tests what&#34;, I don&#39;t know what I can talk about in regards to specific programs but I feel confident that I can say that the FBI tracks this vigorously and works with companies that work in public infrastructure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife is a sewer commissioner for a tiny sewer district up in the mountains. It is a state of the art facility from a water treatment perspective since the treated water exits into a mountain stream. However, they recently needed to update their control systems because they all currently run on Windows98 and can no longer get spare parts from their vendors etc..At her request I sat in on a meeting with their vendor to ask some stupid questions (but less stupid than what the commissioners would have asked) about their proposal for updating the control systems.Some crazy things discovered:* it&#39;s all windows, all the time. I don&#39;t know why but I find this disturbing, but apparently all the drivers for these systems only work on windows. I guess Linux is only just starting to penetrate this market.* yes, remote access is a thing (even in the old system), especially in this case where the plant it under 20 feet of snow half the year. They claim the system can only monitor things, not control things, but I wonder how locked down that really is. Security is via a VPN.* the vendor at play here seems to be a tiny shop of a few people that basically serve a few dozen sewer treatment plants in the area. They deal with replacing the hardware and programming these interfaces in.. kind of a crazy local cottage industry I just wasn&#39;t really aware of.Having a background in web services / unix left me pretty unprepared to really do much more than ask some stupid questions around security / obsolescence, but the vendor had reasonable answers to my concerns. Just a very different world than what we think about every day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is negligence on behalf of the water authority.10+ years ago I used to do demonstrations of this specific attack for govt and other critical infrastructure owners. 
In our demo, we had a two small vats of coloured &#34;chemicals,&#34; with pumps controlled by a bank of PLCs, an HMI and a network of a bunch of vulnerable VMs. We would walk people through how to exploit trivial web vulnerabilities that would get them to the HMI and cause the pumps to reverse and cause a chemical spill from the vats. The look on their faces when they caused a vat to overflow themselves with very little skill, was their &#34;scared-straight&#34; moment.It was 90&#39;s, even 80&#39;s level hacking. There is no way the managers didn&#39;t know this was possible and likely. They&#39;re only acting surprised. What this really looks like to me is a test run for something more coordinated and worse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Kudos to this kid. How many of us are getting bored to death by the constant coverage of politics yet suffer silently? At least he had the good initiative to write to NPR to offer feedback on something that was important to him. Nice job, kid!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not a parent yet. For the parents out there: is there a way of making sure my future kid will like dinosaurs? I have so much to discuss with that kid!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook recently announced that they are going to modify their feed algo to reduce the % of political posts that show up.NPR should do this to.Actually, a better idea would be to focus all political coverage to a day of the week, Tuesday.If every organization talked about politics only on Tuesday, then it would give citizens an easy way to stay sane by just ignoring that day.We now know there are huge mental health tolls for getting wrapped up in this stuff, yet we continue to self-flagellate. Would love to see smart ‘leaders’ realize this and respond accordingly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Besides being a great technical write-up, this does an absolutely fantastic job of doing low-key recruitment for Skroutz. It shows some of the main tools and technologies that the company uses on a day-to-day basis, provides a window into the way that they approach problems, makes a compelling case that you&#39;d be working with some talented engineers, and showcases a culture willing to engage with the open source community.The hiring pitch isn&#39;t in your face, but there&#39;s a &#34;We&#39;re hiring!&#34; button in the banner, which fairly unobtrusively follows you down the page, and then ends with a &#34;hey, if you&#39;re interested in working with us, reach out.&#34; Overall, it just feels really well done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great write up.  Think I&#39;ll get the kids, sorry technicians to walk through this.  Actually, I think I&#39;ll learn just as much but I have to keep a little bit aloof as MD!Networks are tricky to run and networking is proper hard to do.  TCP/UDP int al are pretty bloody good at shuffling data from A to B.  I find it quite amusing when 20 years is considered old for a bug.The Millenium bridge in London is a classic example of forgetting the basics - in this case resonance and being too clever for your own good.  It&#39;s a rather cool design for a bridge - a sort of a suspension bridge but flatter and some funky longitudinal stuff.  I&#39;m a Civ Eng grad.  It looked too flat to me from day one.When people walk across a bridge and it starts to sway, they start to lock step and then resonance, where each step reinforces the last kicks in and more and more energy causes sway, shear and what have you forces.  It gets worse and worse and then failure.  Tacoma Narrows is another classic example of resonance but due to wind - that informed designs that don&#39;t fly!Civ Eng is way, way older than IT and we are still learning.  24 years is nothing for a bug.  However, IT is capable of looking inward and monitoring itself (unit tests, ping etc) in a way that Civ Eng can&#39;t (OK we have strain gauges and a few other tools).The real difference between physical stuff and IT is that the Milli bridge rather obviously came close to failure visually and in a way that our other senses can perceive - it shook.  The fix was to put hydraulic dampers along its length.In IT, we often try to fix things by using magic or papering over flaws with &#34;just so&#34; stories.  Sometimes we get the tools out and do the job properly and these boys and girls did just that: the job properly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a great article!
I wonder why such problems don&#39;t show up on windows.. is it because they have so many developers or that windows has to reboot at least every two weeks?"</p>
