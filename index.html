								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember during my undergraduate physics years at the University of Otago, we had a visiting guest speaker - I think it was Dale Bridenbaugh around 1976 when he had resigned as a manager in GE&#39;s nuclear division worried that their plants were not safe [0].  He had just also toured Australia as a guest speaker toward the anti-uranium effort [1].At the time, Robert Muldoon was Prime Minister of New Zealand and was pursuing &#34;think big&#34; projects for NZ including a planned nuclear power station.  As one of the &#34;GE Three&#34; [2], Bridenbaugh blew the whistle that the quoted price tag of the
power plant did not include necessary safety precautions which he eloquently explained would cost at least an order of magnitude more (greater than the GDP of NZ).  Of course the whole idea made no sense in a country blessed with hydro and geothermal resources.  In the end the project was abandoned for total cost of ownership budget reasons rather than nuclear issues.I wonder what has changed since then?[0] https://www.times.org/nuclear-power-back/2018/3/8/the-long-t...[1] https://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/82alternatives.html[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GE_Three"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is an overall good development, and I wish the company luck. Its really not the solution.While scale is what killed nuclear, the people who initially decided on scale, did so for good reason. You lose a huge amount if you scale down, specially with PWRs.These small PWRs try to get some of that efficiency back with factory production, but at best it just evens out. The advantage is the added flexibility. So I don&#39;t think that putting traditional PWR in a tube is really any kind of series solution to transform our energy system.However there are good things coming out of this. For example, NuScale went threw a process managing multiple reactors from the same control room. That is the same thing that essentially all GenIV reactors want to do as well. Having managed to get that concept threw the regulator will make it massively easier for anybody that follows.Its a damn shame that we don&#39;t have GenIV reactors since the 80s. We had the technology and every reason to use it. We could be living in a nuclear age right now, and I consider it the largest failure of humanity that we failed to do so. People in 100 years will look back and think we were insane that we did not use the technology we discovered."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Its important to be reminded regularly that there are perfectly legal ways for people with lots of money to endlessly bully people that annoy them. These people/companies have lawyers on retainer that they&#39;re already paying so its essentially free for them to file bogus suits and motions to cause havoc in your life. What are you going to do? Sue them back? Thats the world they live in, and its a world that as a small time person or corporation you can not win in (long term).Look at Gawker and Peter Thiel--no matter how you feel personally about what they did, what they published about him was absolutely legal. As a background task his lawyers destroyed that company by keeping them tied up in court cases and funding any one with an axe to grind against them until they were gone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I opened up the article mildly curious about which internet personality was about to make the outlandish claim to the biggest victim crown for internet clicks.I&#39;m heartbroken it was Steven Danziger, they guy that took on big oil, gave them a black eye, and went to (house) jail for it.Even though his case is one I&#39;ve followed for years, it even escaped my own memory.Also, someone mentioned Snowden and Arrange.  for comparison. Although they can be thought as same, remember these two, unlike Danziger, took on the govt, the intelligence apparatus, and its guns.  They should have known full well that when you play high stakes poker you are risking a ton.Danziger OTOH, was taking on a private corporation. His case is big, but no too different in scope than say Erin Brokovich&#39;s case against PG&amp;E &amp; Hinkley(2), or Jan Schlittchmanns case vs WR Grace and Beatrice Foods(1). The plaintiff counsels won in both cases, without consequences to their life or careers.Arrange and Snowden were morally righteous however they probably knew the size of the sacrifice they were about to make and made the decision to proceed anyway. I doubt Danziger had any idea that what he was getting into would cost him his career.(1)   https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anderson_v._Cryovac,_Inc.(2) https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hinkley_groundwater_contamin..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth noting that there is another side to the story. As Wikipedia notes (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Donziger), significant evidence of Donziger&#39;s fraud ended up being captured by a friendly documentary crew that had been following him around.The Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague found that the evidence placed before the Court was &#34;the most thorough documentary, video, and testimonial proof of fraud ever put before an arbitral tribunal&#34;, and that [Donziger] did engage in blackmail and bribery of Ecuadorian judges.The situation is complex, and I certainly don&#39;t have any insight into the true rights and wrongs of the case. And there&#39;s certainly evidence that points towards Donziger&#39;s innocence too. But Esquire&#39;s take is, I think, entirely unbalanced, and discounts out of hand the idea that any of the many, many court cases Donziger has lost (in multiple legal systems and in front of multiple judges) may have been at all correct."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Update from AWS: they lost power to (part of?) a single DC in the use2-az1 availability zone.10:25 AM PDT We can confirm that some instances within a single Availability Zone (USE2-AZ1) in the US-EAST-2 Region have experienced a loss of power. The loss of power is affecting part of a single data center within the affected Availability Zone. Power has been restored to the affected facility and at this stage the majority of the affected EC2 instances have recovered. We expect to recover the vast majority of EC2 instances within the next hour. For customers that need immediate recovery, we recommend failing away from the affected Availability Zone as other Availability Zones are not affected by this issue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The dog has a lot of false positives from the cameras being triggered by car headlights or small animals.My real dog has the same feature, so you’re at least doing a good job mimicking nature, heh."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I bought a house I picked up a dog dish and put it by my walkout basement sliding door.  Also the pond next to my house has old tennis balls show up in it now and then so I put them next to the dish.According to the local cops break ins in my area are mostly just kids going into open garage / garage side doors / back doors that are left open and stuff to steal is out and obvious and so on.I figure just the sense of hassle / unknown of &#34;who knows how this dog is&#34; might be enough of a deterrent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To add credence to this post, I once heard an interview with an incarcerated burglar who claimed that dogs where the one deterrent that scared him off. He said that an alarm as only as good as the response times of the police and he&#39;s usually in and out of there in five minutes anyway. But who wants to risk it with a dog? Better to just move on to the next house.A few more tips:- Best place to hide valuables is in the kitchen pantry. Master bedroom is the most common place, but who is gonna think to go through your snack food.- A lot of burglaries happen in the winter in the late afternoon or early evening when it is starting to get dark out, but before the homeowners get home from work.- Your house is only as strong as the weakest link. Fancy locks can be bypassed by breaking a window. Design your security system to handle low level burglars (who probably don&#39;t know how to pick a lock), not foreign spies. For most people, this also holds true for online security."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Camera software is an area that is frustratingly closed off, and where manufacturers regularly differentiate new/more expensive cameras with firmware differences: subject detection, auto focus, drive modes (pre-capture, higher frame rates, etc), file format support (HEIC, compressed raw, colorspaces), ui features (how custom modes work, menu systems, etc).Competition in this space driven by a provider that doesn&#39;t have a motive to convince users to buy the next new camera (ie: open source software) would be very useful to users.Sony and Panasonic cameras (and perhaps other manufacturers) are running Linux (and release some of the third party source code they include in their products, but the amount of reverse engineering that has been done on those camera&#39;s software.Canon uses a custom RTOS (DryOS), and lots of work has been done to extend the existing Canon firmware to enhance its capabilities (Magic Lantern[1] and CHDK[2]), but as far as I know fully open software for these devices doesn&#39;t exist.Camera capabilities these days are highly software dependent, and the functionality of dedicated cameras is held back by subpar software development practices and a lack of pressure to make things better.1: https://magiclantern.fm/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is there any way we can make Remote Attestation providers liable for any losses incurred while using their services? Can we make it so that banks, record companies, and individuals can sue Microsoft or Google if their system doesn&#39;t deliver on the promise? If we still see cheating in on-line gaming even though all machines are attested, can we we get our money back?I feel like part of the problem is that Remote Attestation providers get to have their cake and eat it too: they make a theme park, set up boundaries, and charge admission under the premise that it&#39;s safer to play in their walled garden than in a public park.But if a bad actor slips through their gate and picks a few pockets or kidnaps a couple children, the operators get to say &#34;not our problem, our services have no warranty -- read the EULA&#34;.I feel like in the real world, if a park operator explicitly bills itself as &#34;a safe place to play&#34; it&#39;s their problem if someone goes on a crime spree on their property -- there is some duty to deliver on the advertised safety promise.But somehow, in the software world people can control admission, control what you do and somehow have no liability if things still go off the rails. It&#39;s just a sucker&#39;s game.Of course, I&#39;d rather not see remote attestation happen, but maybe part of the reason it keeps creeping back is exactly because there is zero legal downside to making security promises that can&#39;t be kept, but incredible market advantages if they can sucker enough people to believe in the scheme."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem isn&#39;t the capability of remote attestation.  The problem is who&#39;s using it, i.e. who&#39;s defining what &#34;security&#34; means.  As noted above, for a company, &#34;security&#34; often means intentionally inhibiting my freedom, not actually securing anything I care about.We would benefit from a better public discussion of what &#34;security&#34; encompasses.  Else, we risk conflating &#34;what MS wants me to do with my computer&#34; with &#34;preventing hackers from stealing my credit card number&#34;.Imagine a world where you could submit personal information to a company, with the technological assurance that this information would not leave that company... and you could verify this with remote attestation of the software running on that company&#39;s servers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unpopular opinion:Hardware-based attestation of the running software is an important security feature, especially in a world where data leaks and identity theft are rampant. Let&#39;s say I&#39;m a healthcare provider, and I&#39;m about to send sensitive medical data to a third party vendor. Wouldn&#39;t you prefer that this data only be able to be decrypted by a computer that can prove to the world it booted a clean OS image with all the latest security patches installed?If the vendor wants to install some self-built OS that they trust on their computer and not update it for 5 years, that&#39;s their business, but I may not want to trust their computer to have access to my personal data.Remote attestation gives more control to the owners of data to dictate how that data is processed on third-party machines (or even their own machines that may have been compromised). This is useful for more than just DRM."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made this site.Copying a comment I made on HN a few weeks ago:The ADS-B signals that many aircraft broadcast include not just the aircraft&#39;s GPS positions, but also a measure of GPS accuracy (strictly speaking, ADS-B doesn&#39;t talk about GPS specifically and can handle any sort of navigation technology; I&#39;m sure there are some planes out there reporting positions based on inertial navigation systems, with correspondingly low accuracy, or GLONASS-derived positions, or whatever, but my understanding is that right now something on the order of 99% of aircraft with ADS-B are using good old GPS so I&#39;ll just keep using the term GPS in this description). If you go to https://globe.adsbexchange.com and click on just about any aircraft, you&#39;ll see an info sidebar on the left of the screen. Scroll down until you see the ACCURACY section, and you&#39;ll see values labeled NACp, SIL, NACv, NICbaro, and Rc. Those are all self-reported measures of the accuracy of the data being sent by the aircraft[1]. NACp is &#34;Navigation Accuracy Category for position&#34;, and is a good measure of whether the aircraft&#39;s GPS is working well. (A somewhat obscure feature of ADS-B Exchange lets you see a map of all aircraft that are currently reporting poor navigation accuracy for their GPS: https://globe.adsbexchange.com/?badgps)To make the maps, I process a day&#39;s worth of data from ADS-B Exchange to find all the aircraft reporting poor navigation accuracy and then I color map hexes (using H3 hexes) according to the proportion of aircraft passing through that hex that reported bad GPS accuracy. Specifically, I&#39;m counting an aircraft as experiencing &#34;interference&#34; if it at some point reported good navigation accuracy and then reported low accuracy. Doing this helps filter out aircraft that just have an ongoing issue with their GPS equipment, or don&#39;t even have GPS.When I do that, areas where there is systematic interference—almost always jamming by military systems—become obvious. There are a few conflict zones (Syria, Cyprus, Israel) that have been experiencing jamming for years, and the U.S. often has smaller scale military testing, especially in the West and Southwest. You can also see the jammers that are apparently setup around Moscow to prevent drones from flying near Oligarch dachas[2].I started making these maps in February before Russia invaded Ukraine because I thought it might provide an early warning of an invasion. I didn&#39;t see that, and in fact this technique doesn&#39;t do a very good job of mapping GPS jamming around the actual war zones because civil aviation stopped over Ukraine, so there are zero or few aircraft with ADS-B reporting their GPS accuracy[3]. Without that data, I can&#39;t make a map.Sometimes I do see changes, like when Russia suddenly started jamming around Kaliningrad in March 2022, causing interference in many Baltic states and leading to Finland to cancel some flights[4]. Then a few days later, they just stopped.I don&#39;t think too many people have realized yet what an amazing source of GPS interference data is available using ADS-B! It&#39;s like having thousands of sensors roaming the planet, broadcasting GPS accuracy data every few seconds. I sometimes wonder if I would disrupt someone&#39;s nascent business model if I started publishing my maps regularly.1. https://twitter.com/lemonodor/status/1493789598077440000

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A quick update on some of the infrastructure behind the map: One day of being on the front page of HN has used up half of the Mapbox free quota of map loads. To sustain this level of traffic would cost me something like $2000/month just for Mapbox. Since this is a non-profit project that I do in my spare time, something is going to have to give."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fascinating. Really cool to see a map of GPS signals on Earth and the site looks really good, too. Love the colors and interface! Awesome :)Can anyone narrate any of the jammed signals? Like for instance what would be jamming in the ocean between Tripoli and Benghazi? Or what would be jamming around San Antonio, TX?"</p>
