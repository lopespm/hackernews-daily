								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All: speech here isn&#39;t very free when the server can&#39;t stay up, and it&#39;s smoking right now, for obvious reasons.I&#39;m going to prune some of the top-heavy subthreads and possibly restrict the page size a bit. There are over 2500 comments in this thread, and if you want to read them all you&#39;re going to have to click &#34;More&#34; at the bottom of each page, or go like this:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31025061&amp;p=2https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31025061&amp;p=3https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31025061&amp;p=4https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31025061&amp;p=5...and so on. Sorry everyone! (Yes, fixes are coming, yes it&#39;s all very slow.)Edit: also, if some of you would log out for the day, that would ease the load considerably. (I hate to ask that, but it&#39;s true. Make sure you haven&#39;t lost your password!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So Twitter was at $70 per share a year ago. So what? Jack Dorsey was CEO a year ago, too. The share price was $33 less than a month ago.But, despite an absolutely incredible roller-coaster news cycle, things have been definitely trending down at Twitter ($33/share last month), which was reflected in its share price. The current executive team (and Dorsey) had wasted time focusing on things that didn&#39;t matter instead of things that did matter.Boards have several fiduciary duties to the shareholders. As an all-cash offer, this generates for the shareholders a substantial return with NO RISK, and so the board has a serious legal obligation to carefully review this offer and make a decision.If the board elects to reject this offer, then their reasons for doing so need to be very clearly elucidated, because, as Twitter is a public company, they would have to see something in their crystal ball that the rest of the market does not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Chris Anderson of TED asked Elon a lot of the questions and concerns being discussed here. Check it out if you want to understand his perspective and goals with twitter.“Having a public platform that is maximally trusted and broadly inclusive is extremely important to the future of civilization”To that end, he committed to transparency. For example, changes to tweets or users would be made visible and apparent so there&#39;s no more behind the scenes manipulation. The algorithm itself would be open sourced. Anyone could view it on Github and suggest changes or point out issues.https://youtu.be/cdZZpaB2kDM?t=666"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like this post.While the author clearly feels bad about the fact that they&#39;ve lost his community and that GitHub didn&#39;t restore it (which is honestly what any of us would&#39;ve felt under similar circumstances), they&#39;re also focusing towards the future and using their personal experience as a parable all of us can learn from.Lesson 1 on UI design I think is really important. I often think scary popup boxes are enough to get people to think about what they&#39;re doing, but this example clearly demonstrates that what&#39;s important is to use design not to scare (alone?), but to convey the information which makes a dangerous action dangerous as well. I also really like the fact that when the action isn&#39;t dangerous, the distractions (&#34;Type this repo&#39;s name&#34;, etc) just go away. It&#39;s super intuitive, and (for a newbie designer like me) really helps build an intuition for various design principles put in action.Lesson 2, which was to use soft deletes, is something I have more thoughts about. I assume that the cascading done on GitHub would be done on a FK constraint, but I&#39;m not really sure how you&#39;d do a &#34;cascading soft delete&#34; without making some kind of manual cascading logic? If anyone&#39;s aware of a standard way to accomplish this, please do let me know. Of course, the best way may just be to simplify the model so they aren&#39;t needed at all haha.As designers and developers we&#39;ve been given a chance to sharpen our toolkit. Thanks, HTTPie! You&#39;ve gained a new star :)Edit: Changed GitHub couldn&#39;t restore to GitHub didn&#39;t restore, as pointed out by @ncmncm (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31033758#31034195)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of our own quest to stop users from deleting their entire projects by accident in our product.1st iteration: delete button with a confirmation box (standard stuff). Users click through the box in autopilot mode and still delete their entire projects.2nd iteration: someone came up with an idea: confirmation box + an additional checkbox (if it isn&#39;t checked, the delete button is disabled). Users still manage to delete projects by accident. When we asked them how that happened (we&#39;ve set up so many hurdles!), the user says, just like in the article, that they thought they were deleting a different (test) project.3rd iteration: I suggested showing the number of objects in the project (just like suggested in the article) so that the user knew they aren&#39;t deleting a test project.I moved on to a different project since, but the saga probably continues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;the biggest accidental community loss in open source history&#34;This was very much drama for very little.Sure, some might follow the project to know about updates, but if people care that much if they are using the latest version of a CLI tool then they will certainly check it out again later.Very very few people of those who followed the project cares, and close to nobody cares what percentile the project ranks as by number of stars on github. Heck, even the author cares so little that he let himself mess around mindlessly while ignoring warnings and forgetting what the project was called.Github warned about the action, and even required written confirmation to make sure it was the correct repo. The author also makes a point about naming being different for orgs and private, but if the github repo had any meaning then the author must have been very aware of what the name of it was.Sure, github can add even more roadblocks and confirmations for those who are very careless despite all the warnings, but I don&#39;t want that personally. It&#39;s a tradeoff, and I think github has the right balance.But sure, the situation is mildly annoying for those few who actually care.But the dumbest part: The complaint about github not using time to restore backups to correct the mistakes of the author. Sure, they probably could, but how will they decide if a user should get special treatment? If they start bringing out backups for some users then there will be a lot of others expecting and asking for the same thing, and more.Some might say that it won&#39;t be a problem, but considering that the author is already expecting github to restore their backups for him because github restored their own backups only proves the problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are some sites that are so useless and they have never ever helped me once, yet somehow they are always in the top 10 results1. w3schools2. pinterest3. microsoft answers and all microsoft websites actually (it always looks like the person asking the question is asking exactly what i want, but unlike stackexchange, there are seldom any useful answers)4. all the code clones for SO5. all alternative to / review sites like capterra, g2, alternativeto, etc. They might have some good suggestions but they always hide the link to the software/site and instead link it to their spammy page. So you have to select part of the link and then re-search it on Google. Doing this for OSS projects can sometimes lead to a whole new rabbit hole.6. The best of lists. Google for the love of god, please ban them.. they are always always SEO spam and product placements. Often the blog post itself says &#34;to put your product on this list pay us a $1000 and we will include them in our list.&#34;7. Quora and similar answer sites.. okay it&#39;s a mixed bag but you have to be very careful on these sites as most often the answers are just spam. I never read any answer with a link in it.  But I think it&#39;s more Quora&#39;s problem than google. But if google is strict with them they may do a better job at moderating I guess. Also now quora hides answers and asks for a payment. Did they learn nothing from experts-exchange!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know google search is probably not the same as google flights, but I spent a few hours recently (over a few days) using google flights and it was a delight to use compared to the Expedia children.We had a bereavement in the family and had to book multiple independent tickets because we could not travel together. This was just after the Ukraine war started so prices had gone through the roof. Exact number of days was not that important as compared to the price and the duration and using google flights UI to slice and dice the data was such a joy. Want to freeze the airline and look at the alternatives - which include from and to dates, number of days of trips, or freeze any other parameter and analyze others, the response was sub-second. Did not eventually book through them since I did not want to get into the google payment system (they offer booking through others that I did not explore).On the opposite side was Expedia children where they would show a price of 2800 and when you click the price invariably it has gone up to 3600. Again. And again. And again. Not sure if that problem existed with google although I paid the exact same price as the airline as shown by google, it could just be a coincidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The one thing I wish that Google offered would be the ability to blacklist sites for a period (coud be fixed - say 6 months).So damn annoying when the top search results all lead to shitty SEO-optimised sites that use a whole page to blather on and on, leading to a tiny information nugget at the end. No value, just excellent SEO scamming.As these scam artists get better and better at this, Google gets less and less useful.When I see a site like that, I can be quite sure there is no value to me from that site. I want to blacklist it - not forever (though I&#39;d settle for that) but so I don&#39;t see it in search results again.The crazy thing is that this could even be a benefit for Google themselves. They could aggregate these signals and use them to identify SEO scammers, since their algorithms clearly can&#39;t. I&#39;m sure that Google aren&#39;t happy with the lacklustre performance of their search in modern times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"About 10 years ago, I had a internship at Newell Rubbermaid. As part of the experience, the entire group of interns across all the brands got to have lunch with the CEO and basically ask him anything we wanted.At some point, someone asked about his biggest regret. We all expected some business blunder, but he said that he was offered an executive position by Kraft to lead their Asian segment, and that his wife really did not want him to take the job because it would require them to move to that region. He regretted not listening to her, because it ended up being the catalyst that dissolved their marriage.We were all stunned silent, and you could tell that he was genuinely remorseful and so vulnerable in that moment. There are only a handful of moments in that internship that I vividly remember, but that was by far the most impactful one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of folks are misinterpreting this article, or just using it as a jumping off point to get something off their chest.This article is not literally about the dirty dish. It&#39;s not even about compromise. Rather, the article is really about having healthy communication with your partner.The author&#39;s wife was trying to communicate to him: &#34;when you do X, I feel like Y, and it hurts me.&#34;But he wasn&#39;t hearing it. Not really. Now maybe his wife wasn&#39;t communicating as effectively as she could. But the author seems to indicate that she was and that he could have done more to recognize what she was saying and to empathize with her. He didn&#39;t get it, and now he clearly regrets it. It&#39;s too bad a healthy relationship didn&#39;t come out of that, but sometimes there&#39;s just too much damage.My wife and I have been together for 33 years, married for 26 of those (we met in HS). I&#39;m extremely fortunate that she&#39;s empathetic, compassionate, and has the patience of Job. Because it turns out that for a large portion of our marriage, I behaved like an asshole. She&#39;s not confrontational, while I thrive on it. We had a rule never to let a day end angry at each other, but mostly due to faults on my side she wasn&#39;t always heard because I wasn&#39;t open to listening to her. This built a lot of resentment. It came to a head years ago, but we worked through it and our relationship is healthier than it&#39;s ever been.&#34;You&#39;re not wrong Walter; you&#39;re just an asshole.&#34;The hard work in a relationship isn&#39;t compromise. That&#39;s table stakes. The hard work is communication."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My relationship just ended for mostly similar reasons (it wasn&#39;t just glasses in the sink, it was a few other things I did that she considered disrespectful that seemed minor to me)I was the only one working and paying for the apartment, her hobbies, and school, but things like the above would escalate into long arguments that I would ask to defer. The problem was, I would sometimes forget details that were important to her if we postponed an argument for a few days, so she wanted to have them now and that was disruptive of my work (I WFH, she studies from home). I might miss an entire day of work because of some minor thing that exploded into a 6 hour argument, while I was trying to disengage the whole time, but couldn&#39;t.A couple weeks ago I had enough, and decided I needed more autonomy, and moved out. I didn&#39;t want that to be the end of relationship, but for her it was the end.Not sure what my point is, I just wanted to get it off my chest. Sometimes these seemingly minor things may just be a sign of deeper incompatibilities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like they&#39;re trying to make an insidious suggestion about the usage of these. IMO, there&#39;s likely a good reason - user experience.At a hardware level, grabbing the microphone can take time. Even worse that timing is inconsistent across devices, workloads, etc. That leads to a bad experience when unmuting and needing to delay your commentary. The solution to this is to keep the microphone on, but mute at a software level. This way the mic is always hot and ready to relay audio as fast as the software can switch.I&#39;d be somewhat willing to bet continue to stream audio is also a quality assurance mechanism. Some networks will shape traffic according to load. A quick jump in bandwidth can introduce unexpected jitter and latency. By continuing to stream audio (but not necessarily process or re-transmit), video conferencing can better ensure an un-interupted experience.----With that being said, if you really care about privacy, consider getting a hardware mute microphone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google Meet at least it&#39;s very obvious to tell they do this because if you talk while muted, they will show a pop-up saying that you&#39;re talking but you&#39;re muted.Whether this functionality is justification for more nefarious data usage remains to be seen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Deaf person, the notification annoyed the heck out of me and there are not even an option to disable the notification. I muted my mic because I am Deaf and I don&#39;t use my voice to communicate with my fellow Deaf friends over Zoom/Teams.And there is no option to disable Zoom joining-room audio (the one that when you join the room, Zoom present the option to ask which microphone you want to enable). Why would I need to enable the microphone if I am signing to my Deaf boss? Deaf communities have major grief with those notifications.At least, I can disable the microphone access in my macOS and Zoom won&#39;t complain. However disabling mic permission in iPadOS will make Zoom to whine about it. Every time I join a meeting, it will let me know that the microphone access is disabled and &#34;kindly&#34; asked me to enable it. In Windows, I can deny the microphone access to Zoom in the Windows setting, however for some reason that made Zoom to crash."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d just like to add to this:  I find it absolutely reprehensible that The White House is trying to blame this on Russia, even coining a phrase &#34;the putin price hike&#34;.Inflation is hurting Americans, and the war in Ukraine is killing Ukrainians.  The idea that these people would try to use one of these things to advantage themselves politically instead of addressing the suffering that their policies are causing (and changing course) is reprehensible to me.There is a daily White House press briefing that I suggest everybody watch (you can 2x speed through it).  Here is a link to today&#39;s: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07-AMwJbXQYJust the way that they talk about this is so...vile.  8.5% inflation is a nightmare.  You&#39;re in charge.  Take ownership of that, and for the love of god stop trying to use the massacre of innocent people in Ukraine is a political tool for youself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stepping back from the numbers and into the realm of personal anecdotes:1. I was listening the radio a couple weeks ago and the DJ invited people to call in and talk about the mask mandate being lifted (in Toronto). Woman calls in, says she went to the grocery store, got three bags of groceries, $146. The dj asks &#34;and... were people wearing masks?&#34; &#34;oh yeah, some were&#34; says the woman before going on to explain how she paid $14.50 for a roll of aluminum foil. The topic was masks and the caller didn&#39;t even want to talk about that, the cost of goods was her top and only issue.2. Standing in a park, an older gentleman is walking by with two small bags of groceries in his hands. I look at him to greet him as he passes, but he walks straight up to me as though he wants to address me. He stops in front of me, looks right in my eyes, lifts his groceries and says &#34;FORTY DOLLARS! Too much money!!&#34; (English was not his first language.) I directed him to the discount grocery, he confirmed that&#39;s where he is already shopping, and it&#39;s a green grocer with dry goods so I know his bags contained no (costly) meat, just vegetables and maybe some bread, pasta, or eggs.I frequently hear of &#34;inflation&#34; etc. on the news or economic reports, but this is different. I have never been approached by strangers on the street who are so frustrated and shocked by price hikes they couldn&#39;t walk all the way home without telling someone, even a stranger. This economic situation is different from any I have experienced in my ~40 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest story here is in shelter prices.https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-pri...March saw a continuation of a year-long trend in which YoY shelter inflation accelerated by almost exactly an additional 0.3% each month. March came in at 5%, 0.3% higher than February&#39;s 4.7%, and so on.Shelter is the largest category in the CPI basket, and it is critical for a reason. It isn&#39;t coming from Ukraine. It mostly isn&#39;t coming from supply chain bottlenecks and shipping container shortages. It isn&#39;t discretionary. And most importantly, it&#39;s a deeply lagging indicator with a long way still to go to catch up to the current activity in the housing and rental markets.My expectation is to see this trend continue. Base year effects (in the second derivative) might slow it down a bit, but by June we could be looking at almost 6% inflation in shelter alone.And remember -- a linearly increasing growth rate is faster than exponential price growth.Interest rate hikes may help, but the dynamics are such that they&#39;ll need to make things worse before they make things better."</p>

Most of them are just bash scripts, many of which have now reached a complexity so high that I wish I&#39;d started writing them in a different language but it&#39;s too late now. The majority of the rest are Python.Off the top of my head, the most used ones are:* A replacement front-end for &#34;tar&#34; and various compressors* A script to synchronize my music library to a compressed version for playing in my car* A secure-but-readable password generator* A system to batch compress folders full of video files. (For ripped blu-ray discs, mostly.)* A replacement front-end for &#34;ffmpeg&#34;, see above* A &#34;sanity check&#34; program for my internet connection to see if the problem is me, or Comcast* A front-end for &#34;rm&#34; that shows a progress bar when deleting thousands of files. (Deletes on ZFS are unusually slow.)And lots more tiny things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes. And it’s a strange one.I made a program to gender swap any text you put into it and then got a book deal to rewrite and illustrate Fairy Tales. It’s been published around the world.https://genderswappedfairytales.comThe idea is to shine a light on the original versions but it also creates a lot of never-written-before characters. A lot of brave princesses and lady-beasts, but also men desperately wanting children and being rewarded for kindness.I wrote the gender swap algorithm in Swift. It seemed like it would just be a simple auto replace type thing when I started but there’s some weird things in English, for example with his/him/her/hers where they don’t swap back and forth sensibly and you have to understand the context.It was his &gt; it was hers.It was his sword &gt; it was her swordSo I ended up down this rabbit hole of natural language processing to break up each sentence into verbs, nouns etc to work out the correct words to use. Even tried training an AI to do it based on the finished swapped text but a whole bunch of rules worked more reliably."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I made myself a Chrome extension called Headlamp that puts a red dot by each link, button, text box, etc., and clears them as I click or type while I’m  testing a web app.When I hand off a build to a client, if all the red dots are gone, I know I’ve at least TOUCHED everything.If I’m working with another engineer, we can both see the dots in our browser and collaborate to clear them all while we test."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This isn&#39;t Tor-like multi-hop (but is similar to other multi-hop VPN providers out there). A proper multi-hop would happen across two different vendors in control of two different networks, as it were.The iCloud Relay paper outlined a pretty private and secure design [0] (and the intention to standardize it via IETF would probably make it simpler to self-host such a solution [1][2]). Among the VPNs, orchid.com&#39;s distributed VPN stands out as a cross-provider multi-hop solution whose privacy guarantees are closer to Tor&#39;s.Eventually the hope is HTTP (www) itself bakes in desirable privacy properties, so regular users don&#39;t have to pay the cost of multi-hops [3].[0] Overview: https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/111/materials/slides-11...[1] https://ietf-wg-masque.github.io/[2] https://tfpauly.github.io/privacy-proxy/[3] https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-ohai-ohttp/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use (and really like!) Mullvad, but have never tried the app, preferring to use my existing OpenVPN clients with the profiles Mullvad provides.This isn&#39;t because I have any reason to mistrust their app, but just because if I&#39;ve already got a perfectly serviceable client on my device, why add another binary to do the same thing?But I would be interested to hear, from folks who have used the app, what you like and don&#39;t like about it. In particular, I&#39;ve had some headaches setting up split tunneling/proxying via OpenVPN - I was never all that good at its config language - and I&#39;m wondering if the Mullvad app might make those easier to achieve."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a happy Mullvad user. But I have one concern.Recently, Instagram &#34;tagged&#34; my account as either based in Russia or using Russian currency. I&#39;m based in Western EU and set up the VPN to connect to the same country or neighboring ones.I&#39;m trying to figure out if some endpoints belonging to Mullvad have been shadowbanned by Meta/Instagram.  
Is there someone else who uses Mullvad to surf on Meta products whose account has been impacted by sanctions directed at Russia?My first guess is that it&#39;s a mislabelling problem or bots going rogue for an unkown reason. And, IG support is taking too long to clarify what&#39;s the culprit. So, I&#39;m making all kind of hypotheses to reach a logical explanation before getting an official answer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"BBEdit still has the best multi-file search-and-replace feature of any editor I&#39;ve ever used. Tons of options, a visual pattern builder, multiple simultaneous search source directories and the option to save search sets, it&#39;s saved me innumerable hours of tedium.It&#39;s worth the price for that one feature alone."</p>

  * the excitement with controlling a virtual world using a graphical user interface.

Still exciting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; My first attempt uses the small alpine image, which already packages thttpd:  # Install thttpd
  RUN apk add thttpd

Wouldn&#39;t you want to use the --no-cache option with apk, e.g.:  RUN apk add --no-cache thttpd

It seems to slightly help with the container size:  REPOSITORY       TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
  thttpd-nocache   latest    4a5a1877de5d   7 seconds ago    5.79MB
  thttpd-regular   latest    655febf218ff   41 seconds ago   7.78MB

It&#39;s a bit like cleaning up after yourself with apt based container builds as well, for example (although this might not always be necessary):  # Apache web server
  RUN apt-get update &amp;&amp; apt-get install -y apache2 libapache2-mod-security2 &amp;&amp; apt-get clean &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists /var/cache/apt/archives

But hey, that&#39;s an interesting goal to pursue! Even though personally i just gave up on Alpine and similar slim solutions and decided to just base all my containers on Ubuntu instead: https://blog.kronis.dev/articles/using-ubuntu-as-the-base-fo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love stuff like this.People will remark about how this is a waste of time, others will say it is absolutely necessary, even more will laud it just for the fun of doing it.  I&#39;m in the middle camp.  I wish software/systems engineers would spend more time optomising for size and performance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is remarkably a good hack and I did learn quite a bit after reading the post, I&#39;m simply curious about the motivation behind it? A docker image even if it&#39;s a few MBs with Caddy/NGINX should ideally be just pulled once on the host and sit there cached. Assuming this is OP&#39;s personal server and there&#39;s not much churn, this image could be in the cache forever until the new tag is pushed/pulled. So, from a &#34;hack&#34; perspective, I totally get it, but from a bit more pragmatic POV, I&#39;m not quite sure."</p>
