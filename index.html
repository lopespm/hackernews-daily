								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The filed letter (https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1418091/000110465922...) isn&#39;t the knockdown argument I would be expecting.Musk is saying, you haven&#39;t demonstrated your numbers are accurate.  But having signed the merger agreement and waived due diligence, I think he needs to demonstrate that they are _not_ accurate.  Complaining Twitter rate-limited his API access (which would be very foolish on their part) or that their bot measurement standards are &#34;arbitrary&#34; doesn&#39;t seem to get there.The letter complains that Musk asked for data allowing him to &#34;independently verify Twitter&#39;s representations regarding the number of mDAU&#34; -- but where does the agreement provide for that verification as a condition of the deal?  Maybe Twitter didn&#39;t provide sufficient information for Musk to &#34;independently verify&#34; that number -- that means nothing without showing Twitter had a duty to provide that information, or that Musk had a right to his own verification.  (Any lawyer agreeing to the other side&#39;s verification of such a thing probably isn&#39;t a very good lawyer.)The last paragraph, complaining about firings and hiring freezes and departures, seems positively desperate.  Who seriously cares about this stuff?&#34;I relied on your numbers but now they seem soft&#34; is different than &#34;I relied on your numbers but now they are clearly wrong&#34;.I have enormous respect for his engineering and business skills, he&#39;s accomplished some remarkable things.  But he doesn&#39;t seem so great as a dealmaker.  Perhaps he&#39;s badly advised, but hey, he chose his advisors.I would think Twitter will sue for specific performance, and they probably have a case.  And Musk is liable for their full market cap, and any trial would depend on a legal team that has a hard time writing a clear letter.  I think Musk is in trouble here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone thinking he can pay the 1B$ termination fee and walk away, it&#39;s not that simple.The 1B$ is a &#34;reverse breakup&#34; fee, and applies when an outside force (like SEC or financing) prevents the deal.  That 1B$ has nothing to do with any choices on either side, and is unlikely to factor into this process.At this point they&#39;re clearly going to trial, and it&#39;s not unlikely that the cost to Elon will be somewhere in the neighborhood of the difference between the fair current market value (~20B$?) and the purchase price (~44B$).My guess is it&#39;ll end up being ~10-15B$."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s been amusing to see the flip from people saying Musk can’t buy Twitter to Musk must buy Twitter.Buying Twitter the way Musk did right before the most telegraphed recession in modern history was colossal stupidity. I have no insight to Musks liquidity, but if Twitter is able to force him to complete the sale in the middle of a raging recession then how much of his empire would be diminished by forced liquidations. And was this decision made so he could promote Shivon to CEO of Twitter? That could make it the most expensive (including the cascade of losses due to liquidation) gift to a mistress (?) in human history.But Musk has a habit of escaping justice (see ‘pedo’ case which was egregious) and I have a feeling there would be little appetite to damage his empire due to the job losses it would cause, especially in a recession."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The utterly inefficient and overpriced Canadian telecoms exist only because we allow one specific behavior:1. A new local player comes to town, builds their own infrastructure (e.g. connects one building to fiber) and starts offering competitive service.2. Rogers/Shaw/Bell/Telus immediately offer better terms for the residents of that building.3. The competitor runs out of money and leaves.4. The telecoms revert to their usual pricing.This hurts competition, this hurts customers, this hurts long-term infrastructure resilience, but not a single politician ever comes close to even admitting the problem. I understand you cannot do it on the federal level where both major parties are on the telecoms&#39; payroll, but it could be a very low-hanging fruit for someone running for a municipal position to address. But nope, identity politics, words, feelings and fighting climate change with paper straws seem to be what the electorate wants instead. Sad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People in other countries probably don&#39;t understand just how powerful - and depended upon - the big telecoms are here in Canada.They have no presence outside the country - they are so bloated and inefficient they couldn&#39;t compete - but they are omnipresent here.There are lots of people who depend on Rogers for home Internet, home phone, mobile phone, TV, and home security, not to mention business services that consumers also depend on, like the payment networks that are down.Plus their media properties, which probably come in useful when the government starts to think about allowing more competition or decreasing the taxpayer money being funneled to them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see a lot of people noting the lack of communication and updates from Rogers.To me it would be shocking if they were providing updates. Canada’s telecommunication monopolies are not known for their customer service and, even worse, they seem to have internal corporate cultures of entitlement and arrogance that drive an “F U” attitude in general when it comes to external communications and accountability. So you won’t see a post mortem. You won’t see timely updates. You certainly will never see some kind of status page!I’m sure Rogers will be forced to do a post-mortem for large commercial clients where contractually required, but I highly doubt we will hear a word from them about the cause of this or what was/is being done to rectify it. They probably have an ETA but feel no obligation to share it.Rogers isn’t alone. I would expect the same behaviour from Bell or Telus. Canada has serious issues when it comes to its big telco carriers and it represents major risk to the Canadian economy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well, I knew right from the start when secure boot was first introduced that this is going to happen sooner or later. This is a slippery slope, and I&#39;m sure eventually we&#39;ll have computers which will make this not only the default, but also the only way to boot.The war on general-purpose computing is well underway, and I fear we&#39;ll lose it. The billions of already completely locked down computers (e.g. every iOS device) does prove that people just don&#39;t care, and many (including people here!) will even defend it that they prefer it that way. Eventually we won&#39;t have a choice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first thing that pops into my mind is &#34;Abenomics&#34;:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abenomics&gt; IMF affirmed that Japan&#39;s nominal GDP contracted by $1.8 trillion during 2012–2015 while real GDP contracted at an annual rate of 6.8 percent[58] in the second quarter of 2014, after the Consumption Tax hike came into effect in April. This fall is the worst since the devastating earthquake and tsunami disaster[59][60] hit Japan in the first quarter of 2011 when the GDP shrank by an annualised 6.9 percent.So, his economic policy might have been as bad as an earthquake + tsunami.That said, he was not the only one supporting this policy, and nobody deserves to die for a mistake."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sympathise with the author. Why should one have to put up with mails like this? I understand the argument of being professional, but it&#39;s very draining to have to absorb personal attacks and ill-mannered outbursts while never being able to respond in kind.Given that the sender didn&#39;t provide constructive feedback, is seemingly not contributing financially, and can simply choose to not use the application, I don&#39;t see why a response in kind shouldn&#39;t be given.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"By this point in humanity&#39;s development, their brains had developed the ability to automatically block the parts of reality screaming for their attention, results of an economic system based on coercive consumption. Attention grabbers bifurcated into subtle, nefarious actors intent on slipping past in-brain ad-blocking and the shouters, turning up the volume and animations to make ads impossible to not see. People were subtly crippled, partially blind, now. Yet it was, after all, the mind&#39;s defense mechanism against an increasingly hostile environment trying to rob it of its most precise resource: attention.That was, of course, until they banned psychic violence in the &#34;Goddamn, get out of my brain&#34; amendment in the late 21st century."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The explanations like banner blindness, etc. make sense to me, but I think there&#39;s still a problem in our society or species in general that people simply do not read things thoroughly. And when confronted with a problem, instead of going back and reading things thoroughly, they blame someone else.How many of us software engineers have had this exact experience: Someone runs into an issue with your software that can&#39;t be papered over because of inherent complexity, and they report the problem to you. You tell them the solution, and they tell you it should be documented. You tell them it is documented, and you even tell them where. They tell you it should be more prominent.I&#39;ve had this happen where the warning was in bright red, bold letters at top in a separate box that said &#34;WARNING!&#34; but even after I sent them the link telling them it was documented, they still didn&#39;t see it.I&#39;m sure this banner could improved. I&#39;m not sure the problem could have ever been avoided or solved entirely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“‘There is a game of puzzles,’ he resumed, ‘which is played upon a map. One party playing requires another to find a given word — the name of town, river, state or empire — any word, in short, upon the motley and perplexed surface of the chart. A novice in the game generally seeks to embarrass his opponents by giving them the most minutely lettered names; but the adept selects such words as stretch, in large characters, from one end of the chart to the other. These, like the over-largely lettered signs and placards of the street, escape observation by dint of being excessively obvious; and here the physical oversight is precisely analogous with the moral inapprehension by which the intellect suffers to pass unnoticed those considerations which are too obtrusively and too palpably self-evident.’”—From “The Purloined Letter” (1845) by Edgar Allen Poe"</p>

Hopes and prayers. Elections are ongoing. Unforgivable act. Doctors are working hard to save Abe. Not appropriate to address the political situation at this moment and I am not comfortable to do so.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is there some hardware limitation of AMD Ryzen laptop processors that prevents a high-res display?Every time I see one of these laptops (like the recent HP linux laptop, etc), I think they look really interesting except that I wish they had a higher res display - I&#39;ve not seen any Ryzen laptop with what I&#39;d call a premium display - something high DPI."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Ryzen 7 5700U is Zen2 based: https://www.cpu-world.com/CPUs/Zen/AMD-Ryzen%207%20Mobile%20...Not that great a deal when Zen3 based notebooks (5400/5600/5800U) have been out for over a year already.It is baffling to me why AMD chose to have the odd-numbered 5000 series (5300/5500/5700) with Zen2, and the even-numbered 5000 with Zen3."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They block any connections from HK so I&#39;m not allowed to access the site. The number of sites blocking any connections from certain countries like Hong Kong as increased lately, it&#39;s becoming rather frustrating and I can&#39;t really see the reasoning behind it."</p>
