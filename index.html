								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After seeing posts like this on HN for years, this one officially scared me enough to completely migrate off Gmail altogether. I’m in the process right now of removing my gmail from any online account.Pro-tip: if you use a password manager, it’s as easy as searching for your Gmail address. For all other accounts, I’ve been able to find them by searching for the phrases “verify your email” or “verify email” or “verification” in Gmail.Just imagining the nightmare that would happen if I got locked out of my Gmail account (10 years of accounts)…I can’t believe I didn’t do it sooner.You can also do a full export of your Google data, which I highly recommend.Switched to fastmail recently for my personal domain and could not be happier with the service. It costs money every month, so they have actual human support if anything goes wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mea Culpa I&#39;m in the industry. I knew we should have had backups. She is brilliant but not technical and while the backups would have been expensive and difficult due to size, I should have built multiple NAS and distributed them geographically and used Syncthing to keep them updated.To be clear we were legacy G-suite users and have converted to paying customers, so it was a free service while this happened, and is a paid service (I guess is youtube part of that?) now.I just assumed if there was a problem we could youtube-dl everything, it didn&#39;t occur to me that control of the account would be suspended arbitrarily with no recourse for literally no reason. Despite reading about similar things here for years.I guess I just thought those were lightning strikes, and I was focusing my time outside of work on the new SPA rollout we were working on for the company. I understand excuses like armpits are something we all have and they all smell, so I&#39;ll just say I fucked up and own it.I appreciate all the advice and I understand why you are all saying what you are saying.This was spur of the moment post (I didn&#39;t think it through) and I hadn&#39;t updated my contact information on my profile. I&#39;ve done so now.Thanks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the account can still login in any capacity, please attempt a takeout of the the youtube account.https://takeout.google.com/settings/takeout/custom/youtube?p...This will generate a link that could possibly have an archive of every video uploaded by that account.You don&#39;t have have any contact information listed on your account page. Please do so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Open core&#34;, seems to mean the low level libs (useful for sure) are FOSS while the full featured apps are proprietary.  This is kind of unpleasant since it creates a tension between a natural desire to build featureful apps with the low level stuff, and not wanting to &#34;bite the hand&#34; that supplied grist-core.  Similar things happen with other partly-proprietary programs like ansible.Aren&#39;t there already some FOSS alternatives to google sheets?  No idea about airtable, don&#39;t even know what it is.As for simple ways to write a form app, ActiveAdmin is one of the few things I like about Rails."</p>

I know this is public information, but the information itself has been relatively opaque for generations.Beyond mild curiosity, the only paying customers for a service like this will be groups like employers, schools, creditors, landlords etc. It removes the pain around paid background checks, and it includes data that was already legally expunged.The fact that it includes data that was legally expunged actually makes this service more valuable than traditional background checks to certain types of people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, this scratches a lot of my itches about Git. I teach a Git course at my alma mater, and the things that confuses people the most (the index, how to undo mistakes etc etc) all seem addressed head-on. At first glance, this seems substantially easier to teach than Git.The Git compat seems like a great idea for this to really take off. My team is totally PR based though so if/when doing (Git compatible) feature branches lands in JJ I&#39;m excited to switch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting ideas! I especially like the automatic rebasing and associated ideas.It&#39;s a bit strange to see &#34;jj st&#34; will automatically add all files to the &#34;working copy&#34; commit. This means that when I initially create my project, run &#34;npm install&#34; to install 500 MB of dependencies, and then run &#34;jj st&#34; to figure out what to include in my first commit, the command is going to copy all of that into a commit object for no reason. I don&#39;t think I like that behavior, to be honest. Is this a requirement of any of the other unique features? Could this be turned off, or modified to be an explicit operation?[append]To be clear, the fact that it&#39;s `jj st` is actually a big part of the problem for me: this is the command I use to figure out what to put into my `.gitignore` in the first place! I don&#39;t think that any of the &#34;read-only&#34; commands should be making these kind of changes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34; It also means that you can always check out a different commit without first explicitly committing the working copy changes (you can even check out a different commit while resolving merge conflicts).&#34;That&#39;s really interesting. Having to manage stashes is annoying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Using Windows with a Microsoft account introduces all sorts of issues that only power users tend to come across, and power users are who Windows Pro is targeted for.For example, RDP&#39;ing to a Windows Pro computer with a Microsoft account becomes a lot more difficult. Another example is that Windows still needs a local username and password, even if you&#39;ve logged in with a Microsoft account, and this can get out of sync if you change your Microsoft account password online, meaning you now have a different local password to your online account.It&#39;s a frustration that power users don&#39;t need and this is probably going to force me to relegate Windows to a VM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Never again windows with Microsoft accounts. I have two windows 10 licenses, one home and one pro. I made the mistake of associating the licenses to my Microsoft account and now  there is no way to move the pro license from the old PC to the new one. The Microsoft support site is a complete joke of unpaid chatterers that send you on wild goose chase, the web is full of SEO bullshit site that keyword-dance around the issue... Windows 11 for me is Windows Never, and I am well under to way to ensure that the 100 odd laptops at $company run Ubuntu next thank you very much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Windows 7/8 are the last good versions of Windows IMHO. Yeah they have security issues, but I run them in a virtual machine not connected to the Internet where I need things like iTunes and MS Office. Some games don&#39;t run in a VM very well because of the overhead and abstraction (unless they&#39;re lightweight or not resource intensive). I have a separate Alienware laptop for gaming on Windows however.My hypervisor OS is a Linux Mint install, with Virtualbox. I use Mint as a daily driver. I also use Cloudready[0] for interacting with the Google ecosystem. I can&#39;t recommend Cloudready enough, although I think Google bought out[1] Cloudready and it&#39;s now called Flex[2][0] https://www.neverware.com/freedownload[1] https://cloudreadykb.neverware.com/s/article/Neverware-is-no...[2] https://edu.google.com/intl/ALL_us/products/chromebooks/chro..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well I, and my family took several tests with this firm - and I am very upset about this.I will be speaking to a barrister today or on Monday to explore what, if any, remedies we can seek over this in court.Please if anyone could recommend a London-based barrister who specialises in this sort of matter by DM or in reply that would be much appreciated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem here is that it sold the DNA to third parties.  The government &#39;data watchdog&#39; appears to be stepping in to stop this overt failure.Of course, all the testing agencies are collecting DNA.  The records will be somewhere.Do we think that government agencies will be able to access these?  Will the NHS?  Will government access even be stated in the agreements that they signed to be &#39;government-approved&#39;?  Will the data be available to other companies down the line for research?  Or when they are bought up by a big corporation?The point is that this is another erosion of privacy, another cat is out of the bag.  It is all very foreseeable.Once we sanction the collection of private information, eg DNA for health! to prevent child abuse! to stop terrorism! the over-reach is never withdrawn.  Government access to your dna, online record, etc, etc - becomes the new normal.  All while the actions of the government are ever more hidden - eg secret courts, collection of data, etcIn every instance of privacy erosion, a plausibly valid excuse is supplied by the government.  But it is a one-way street.  Why we continuously accept government justifications of excessive over-reach amazes me.  But that we do in general (I don&#39;t!) destroys privacy for everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can&#39;t ask for (nor give) a consent that broad: &#34;use my dna for whatever research you want by whoever&#34;. Having been involved a bit with asking for informed consent in a hospital, it&#39;s sooo difficult to design a specific- and useful-enough consent form for legitimate not-for-profit medical research. I hope these jokers go to prison for a long time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This isn&#39;t discussed much, but I think homes would become noticeably more affordable for families just by having the government stop subsidizing the mortgages of investment properties (e.g. only one mortgage subsidy is available for each family). This isn&#39;t even getting into tax write offs which are too complicated for me to understand the consequences of changing.As it stands, mortgage rates being below the rate of inflation make housing a very attractive investment.The sources of mortgage subsidy that I am aware of are secondary market purchases:  * Federal reserve mortgage purchases
  * Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac mortgage purchases

A big portion of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve is buying billions of mortgages every month. The Fed is trying to start unwinding this now, but they have had trillions of mortgages on their books since the GFC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Housing will never be relatively cheap until it’s easier to build a house. It will never be easier to build a house until zoning is more lenient.No state is incentivized to make zoning more lenient. Therefore it falls on the federal government, who lack the authority.The only thing they can do is something similar to what they do with the highways and threaten to take away funds unless all plots of land can be zoned for up to 4-family houses (FHA limit).Potentially quadrupling the amount of housing will do it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wanted to highlight the alternative approach take by China. I don&#39;t agree with what their government, does but its useful to see what they&#39;re doing.China has essentially realized they&#39;re in a demographic crisis so they&#39;ve enacted the following policies:- Stopped their speculative debt fueled housing bubble, this I hope makes it affordable for their citizens to own homes, without prices skyrocketing.- Stopped for profit educational institutions, this is so that education and specifically tutoring aren&#39;t exclusively for the rich.I think they&#39;re enacting policies for childcare as well.Given in the US investors are buying up property, and costs of both education and childcare are skyrocketing. I don&#39;t see how the US won&#39;t avoid a demographics crisis as well.The US can&#39;t mandate its industry to follow a similar approach, but can&#39;t the government provide stimulus or some other Manhattan Project type drive to encourage entrepreneurship and companies to start and resolve these underlying issues?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hmmm... I&#39;m skeptical.  Not necessarily because I don&#39;t think that pneumonia could be detected by testing VOCs in breath, but because I&#39;m currently working on a project that uses sensors to do breath analysis and my amateur research has informed me that it&#39;s fairly hard to get right (which is why my primary goal is to identify deltas rather than achieve numerical accuracy).For one, VOCs can be present in breath for other reasons besides some sort of infection in the lung, and VOCs are incredibly hard to differentiate with just a sensor.  The fact that they tend to be faint in human breath even at their highest (in contrast to O2 and CO2) doesn&#39;t help.  Even the most expensive PID sensors for VOCs (they get up into the several hundreds a pop) can&#39;t really tell you whether the predominant gas is acetone or alcohol or acetaldehyde or hydrogen sulfide.  So you&#39;ve got to figure out whether the presence of VOCs is truly an anomaly and not just a part of ketosis.  In which case you will also need to measure at least VeO2 to see whether the VOCs correspond with the Respiratory Quotient.The &#34;e-nose&#34; project, as described on the MakeZine article, doesn&#39;t appear to do that.  It does have an alcohol sensor.  But these sensors aren&#39;t particularly sophisticated.  They use semiconductors with heating elements to detect the presence of gases, and there is almost certainly some overlap between the alcohol and VOCs sensors.If VOCs are produced by pneumonia, then yes, it&#39;s conceivable that even just the VOCs sensor alone would detect this.  But can this group of sensors used in the e-nose differentiate pneumonia from catabolism?Maybe? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯After all, this thing uses AI.  And maybe AI can recognize something that a human can&#39;t by simply looking at a line graph.  I dunno...  Such things should be tested against known inputs before being suggested to diagnose anything."</p>

Obviously, this kid is very bright, but giving kids the tools to understand how the ideas they&#39;re learning can be applied in the real world is so satisfying. They aren&#39;t blinded by previous failures, or the current market, or what can and can&#39;t be done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anybody have a link to what the kid actually did?  I skimmed the video, looked at the diagram, read the original MAKE article, and it seems like the kid did a science project and it doesn&#39;t actually diagnose pneumonia.  Am I missing something important?The reason I&#39;m asking is that I see a lot of these (used to judge science fairs, worked with smart undergraduates who build their own equipment) but most of it overstates the technical advances made by the kid."</p>
