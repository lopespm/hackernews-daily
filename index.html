								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"IMHO this is a sensible decision, one that reflects the clear underlying intention of the statute. Article 5(1) of the Directive says:&gt; [certain acts] shall not require authorization by the rightholder where they are necessary for the use of the computer program by the lawful acquirer in accordance with its intended purpose, including for error correction.Essentially, they have ruled that other Articles in the Directive do not supersede this Article, and that reverse engineering to correct an error can be necessary.This court, the CJEU, has good form on sensible decisions regarding computing. For example, SAS vs World Programming (C‑406/10) allowed reverse engineering for interoperability. That case, also, was the court upholding the clear intention of the statute. Moreover there was UsedSoft vs Oracle (C-128/11), allowing the resale of software licences, including the right to download the software where necessary, upon purchasing a second hand licence."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My take on this is that Ireland is now willing to come into compliance because post-Brexit, they now have a monopoly on &#34;urban core that could sustain an HQ for multinationals in a natively-English-speaking country in the EU.&#34;In other words, they relied on tax advantages as a differentiator for companies to choose Dublin over London for their EU HQ.  But now, what would you choose if not Dublin?  Obviously Paris and Berlin are candidates but if you&#39;re a straightforward multinational, or certainly a company that is actually based/headquartered in the US, you&#39;re going to experience a lot less of a shock in a natively-English-speaking country.So it seems to be that Dublin wins now, tax advantage or no tax advantage.  Which likely makes drawing the ire of other countries for being a &#34;haven&#34; less worth it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With Hollywood Accounting[1], you make taxable profits transform into untaxable expenses that you pay to yourself for services you rendered to yourself, and Ireland has been a common destination for this sort of money to flow.  Hollywood accounting can take several forms. In one form,
  a subsidiary is formed to perform a given activity and the
  parent entity will extract money out of the film&#39;s revenue
  in the form of charges for certain &#34;services&#34;. For example,
  a film studio has a distribution arm as a sub-entity, which
  will then charge the studio a &#34;distribution fee&#34; — essentially,
  the studio charging itself a sum it has total control over and
  hence control the profitability report of a project.

[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hollywood_accountingEssentially, Apple USA makes billions selling iPhones in the USA, then pays those billions to Apple Ireland for the right to put little Apple logos on iPhones. Likewise, Google USA pays billions in US ad sales profits to Google Ireland for the right to use Google tech for Google search.When the Irish loophole closes I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll think up another &#34;One Weird Trick&#34; to make taxable profits mystically transmute into untaxable expenses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always been baffled as to how this is seen as a multi-national issue.  The US could always implement unilateral minimum VAT and profit[3] taxes on corporations forcing them to effectively pay whatever proportion the US demands to continue doing business in the world&#39;s largest consumer market.  Just because you&#39;re only paying 3%[1] profit[3] tax in Bermuda doesn&#39;t mean you can necessarily skate around the remaining 12% when doing business in the US - the US could just pocket that additional 12% if nobody else wanted it.  Implement a policy like that and the competitive tax advantage of havens disappears overnight and all this BS disappears.We[2] have tax loopholes because we want to continue to have tax loopholes.1. BS example I&#39;m unfamiliar with the actual numbers.2. Where &#34;We&#34; is lawmakers or maybe society as a whole as weighted by political power.3. Edited: s/revenue/profit/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Facebook is an abomination which ate up the entire Web in some 3rd-world countries. For many no access to Facebook means loosing connection to everything including services essential for their offline life. Even in a very developed EU country I already happen to face cases when something is only available via Facebook because some companies don&#39;t bother having their own websites/emails/phones (often on purpose - to improve their Facebook rank).This is a very serious problem - hyper-centalization in hands of one corporation which can fail you intentionally or not. Facebook is becoming sort of the Chinese system (AFAIK standard WWW is almost nonexistent in China, they mostly use apps within social networks which are easier for the government to control) for the whole world.Looking more broadly it&#39;s another layer of the malicious trend to wrap the things in more and more layers.First we had native desktop apps (which always could communicate data to network servers). Then we have wrapped the apps in the browser (which essentially is an OS on an OS) but we had our pages on independent servers. Then we invented &#34;social networks&#34; and are putting everything in there.We could just improve desktop apps tech (including discoverability, delivery, interoperability, portability and UI design flexibility) but we chose the browsers. We could stop here, use the standard WWW and improve experience of using RSS/Atom/RDF/XMPP/etc but we gave up our pages/subscriptions/contacts to Facebook."</p>

[1]Former hedge fund manager and financial book author Patrick Boyle explains what these Pandora Papers mean in a video [2].There are rumors and speculations that both the Panama and Pandora Papers leaks were released by the CIA. The leak is so massive and so many entities were hacked that only a nation state could have pulled it off. And given who was and who wasn&#39;t implicated in this and given which news orgs received these papers, it&#39;s pretty obvious that CIA or NSA or some other part of the US IC community was behind these leaks.

There&#39;s tons of discussion here on some health issues, diets, stuff like that, where I would never have found such good discussion (even the anecdotal evidence is interesting and useful) and where you can really walk away being better off from having read it. If that means tolerating the occasional thread about how appropriate politics is in the workplace, or how bad everything is for mental health, I&#39;m more than happy to keep coming back here for that.edit: by the way, I&#39;d be quite interested in what a thread like this posted 8 years ago would look like.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; If the bee is placed under federal protection, farmers or developers who harm the insects could face up to $13,000 in fines each time one is killed, Live Science reports.Note that the article identifies systemic causes (use of neonicotinoids, habitat loss) as causes, and correlational evidence (&#34;States with the most significant dip in bee numbers have the largest increase in the use of pesticides like neonicotinoids, insecticides, and fungicides&#34;), but the enforcement mechanism they mention is centered around individual actors after specific killed insects where it&#39;s presumed that attribution is clear. Does this make any kind of sense?1. Would we know when bees are killed? The evidence that we know how to gather, so far as I can tell, is mostly counting live bees, not finding dead ones. Are there examples of small, highly mobile insects with ESA protection where we&#39;re actively seeking out and finding dead individuals?2. Is it typically possible to attribute bee deaths to single actors? If a bumblebee is found at location X, we might guess that it would have ranged over an area with radius r around that (but we&#39;re not sure what its actual territory would have been) which includes N properties, N_d of which have been developed and N_p of which use pesticides, who is responsible?3. And if the best scientific understanding is about broad practices (habitat destruction, pesticide use, ...) am I correct in my belief that we don&#39;t have any real mechanism of holding a class of individuals (e.g. Maine farmers who used neonicotinoids during a given time period) responsible for an impact to a bee population (e.g. it&#39;s estimated by experts to decline 5% in a given year) in the absence of a specific pile of dead bees?With this, as with a number of other large issues, I think we need new concepts around group responsibility. We have a concept of class action lawsuits, where a large group identified by a criteria (e.g. people whose data was exposed by Equifax) can be plaintiffs, because individuals meeting that criteria can elect (or not) to be represented in that group. We do _not_ have a concept of a large group of people identified by a criteria (farms using particular pesticides, developers of properties in the urban-wildland interface) being held responsible for harms that proceed from that criteria."</p>

Though it seems New York should be included since it says &#34;The bumblebee species have declined by 99 percent in New York.&#34;Also noteworthy&gt; In the Midwest and Southeast, population numbers have dropped by more than 50 percent.To nobodies surprise, the culprit is pesticides. Interestingly the west&#39;s bumblee population isn&#39;t listed as being in trouble."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We think with our weak technologies and chemistries that we can play God.However, it is so far from the truth - in an attempt to create more vegetation we have decreased a critical component needed to help said vegetation grow.Technology should be used carefully when in the environment of the unknown. Trials and observations should be conducted in limited capacity with a long window of study. Only then can we know of the consequences for our actions of disrupting naturally evolved and perfected equilibriums - be it that of the Earth or man’s immune system."</p>

Many people asked me if I worked to be on board, and the answer was &#34;no&#34;, Maersk did not allow it.  The officers were mostly East Germans who needed a job, while the strictly segregated, &#34;A-Bs&#34; were almost all Pacific Islanders of some kind. The conditions were clean and professional, but I got the feeling soon that this was not a desirable job. The officers would spend at least 60 days on duty, often more.. without a vacation day, but had a weekly day &#34;off&#34; or two, except the Captain who is technically working at all times.I enjoyed the travel and had a good voyage, with many small things to say about it at another time. As I learn about &#34;business&#34; and the world, I understand more about labor abuses, even with &#34;respectable&#34; companies. And, your outrage does nothing, because people who mistreat others professionally are quite used to the complaining, including yours. I am not at all surprised at this article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ocean is a different place in so many ways.My cousin is a Merchant Marine Engineer. Some big ships can&#39;t leave port without one, yet they are in short supply. So he&#39;s paid a lot per voyage. Two or three multi-week voyages and he&#39;d done working for the year.Early on in his career, an officer would request his passport. To make things go faster in port, all the passports could be presented at once for quicker clearing of customs etc.Of course he learned immediately, this meant he could not leave the ship in foreign port. And the officer sandbagged when he requested his passport back. The result was, he was essentially held captive for several months aboard ship, several times longer than he was contracted for. And the ship could count on having an Engineer for every leg of the journey.Now he knows better, keeps his passport on his person at all times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like many here, I can attribute where I am in life today largely to TI calculator programming. I made many friends on Cemetech with whom I still keep in touch, including a few named in this article.I racked up thousands of posts on the Cemetech and United TI forums and spent countless hours hanging out in the game Blockland which was also popular among those folks in the mid 2000s.To me, one of the most impressive folks in this list is calc84maniac, who joined the scene a year or two after me, but quickly surpassed me in skill, becoming a z80 ASM whiz at the age of ~13 or so, whereas some of the other (very talented) folks were at least STEM university students.I know a few people in this article such as SirCmpwn are on HN, too, so hopefully they chime in this thread.Some of the most memorable things about programming in BASIC on these calculators were the absurd constraints. Your whole program was limited to a few kilobytes. You only had 27 floating point variables, a few lists of floats with a maximum length of 999, no real functions or stack or anything, etc. You’d shave bytes by taking advantage of syntactical quirks that the interpreter happened to accept, like not closing parentheses at the end of a line.I don’t have much of value to add other than expressing some serious nostalgia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since we&#39;re swapping TI calculator stories...In 8th grade Geometry class circa 2007, I had an awesome teacher and loved the subject. I found an extra TI-83+ laying around the house from my brothers. I found a guide online and started building simple programs.A few weeks later, there was a quiz. I asked the teacher if it was permissible to use calculator programs on the quiz. He thought a moment and said it was fine as long as I wrote them myself.So I wrote a very simple program that probably did little more than guide which formula to use in a basic decision tree.It was the hardest quiz of the year, it was just difficult content. My class has 1 A, 1 B, 1 C, and about 23 F&#39;s. I was the B.After that, graphing calculators weren&#39;t allowed.Mad respect for Mr. Gass. He had two Apple IIe&#39;s and had programmed Wheel of Fortune and Jeopard! for review days ahead of tests. He had a couple TV&#39;s around the classroom so everyone could see the game well, and would turn on Bill Cosby during some working sessions because at the time, he was a well respected man.Mrs. Gass was also a math teacher. Some students who had both teachers made shirts which advertised &#34;I passed Gass twice&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ohh, TI stories! Here we go!&#34;Hey, distantaidenn, I wanna talk to you after class.&#34; These were the words of my then high school math teacher. I wasn&#39;t worried, I was a good student. Little did I know, this would shape my career for the next 20 years. When after class came, my teacher handed me a brand spanking new TI-83. &#34;We&#39;re gonna be using these in class from now on. Take this home for the weekend, learn how to use it, and teach the rest of the class.&#34; I held in my excitement, and took the device, along with its 1-inch thick manual.I pored over the manual. Before I knew it, I had mathematical functions dancing across the screen. All of our current math equations set up to accept variables and spit out answers. I didn&#39;t know it at the time, but I was &#34;programming.&#34; I began to dabble in TI-Basic -- I had no idea what it was, but apparently, it was the language this giant calculator used, and I&#39;d have to learn that language to make this machine do my bidding. So I learned it. The next year in school, I signed up for an elective Programming class, and lo and behold, it was in Basic -- I thought to myself, this looks familiar, I know this! I finally made the connection that I had been &#34;programming&#34; the whole time. From then I was hooked.Fast forward to university, I gained a degree that was as far from programming as possible, but I always had my scripts. I was the guy that could talk to computers. I was at home on the command line. And I knew enough html and JS to make a shitty web page, if necessary.And here I am now, still engineering and managing, and making (I&#39;d like to think) not so shitty products for a living."</p>
