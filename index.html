								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Think folks are missing the point here.The idea of this thread isn’t that bicycles are uniquely singled out for ridicule.These article snippets all come from a time when the bicycle was just invented and usage was growing fast (eg like any new tech). In fact, I think they were taken from a defunct Twitter account called pessimists archive.The point is that mass media will always court controversy and bemoan any new change in behavior regardless of what it is.Those headlines look silly now, but they are the Industrial Revolution’s version of “AI/smartphones/social media/video games/ridesharing/etc are ruining everything” articles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why I cringe a bit at those bemoaning the horrible, awful, traumatic fate of journalism. Journalism is stupid. It always was stupid. It always will be stupid. That&#39;s not to say it has no value. But the reader has always been and always will be responsible to sift through the heaping mounds of dumb and find that value. I&#39;m not exaggerating when I say, the New York Times, our paper of record has published some of the stupidest things you may ever read. Papers schilled for business, hacked for parties and confabulated for themselves since always.On the other hand, the decline of local journalism is a serious crisis. Particularly the death of local investigative journalism. I would be very surprised if in 30 years or so we don&#39;t look back and see a noticable increase in local corruption correlated with the decline in local journalistic accountability."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not surprised in the slightest at these newspaper headlines in the linked tweets. They seem par for the course where I live.I sold my car at a profit two months ago and have been walking, cycling, and riding the bus where I need to go. Occasionally my trip calls for an Uber/Lyft. Wow, I have become a pariah in some people&#39;s eyes. People have made comments to my face about how it&#39;s odd I don&#39;t own a car and how it would be best that I get another. Someone scoffed when I answered their question of how I got to their place from mine when I told them I took the bus on a direct route.People do seem to be publicly supportive of me biking for short trips and for exercise, but they&#39;re mostly still in the phase of being introduced to the idea that someone could survive only biking. Biking as a primary form of transportation is still a foreign concept to them. I live in a very central part of the city, but this is a car dominated Texas city.Unfortunately, biking infrastructure and car etiquette is extremely poor around here. I find myself having to carefully choose my routes and am unable to reach certain places by bike that are quite close because it&#39;s not worth the risk. I hope cars begin to open more to the idea of bicyclists being around. A lot of great people I know have expressed negative sentiments towards bicyclists, so I have to believe there&#39;s a larger cultural issue at play."</p>

You pay a fee relative to some metric and the organization acts as insurance against parent trolls by fully defending any patent lawsuits that are obviously unjustified. And to keep costs low, membership in this organization would be public to deter patent trolls from even trying to sue a member in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I was carefully looking for prior art to invalidate the patent, I&#39;d look at Verizon&#39;s patent portfolio:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hum_(system)Their Hum product seems to do exactly what the patent troll claims to own a patent on.  It plugs into the OBD2 port and calls emergency services after a collision.Also, Nissan patented something very similar in 2004:US Patent for Vehicle emergency notification system and related method Patent (Patent # 7,323,972)https://patents.justia.com/patent/7323972"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is it incorrect to say that ethereum is now entirely centralized with some extra steps?Like, you have this proof of stake thing, but the only reason it works is because there&#39;s just a small number of validators, which is just going to be the ethereum foundation and friends.edit: putting this at the top because nobody is responding on topic. I am NOT talking about the class of people who stake 32 eth to validate nodes. I am talking about the class of people with the ability to declare that the people with stakes did not validate correctly and therefore lose their stakes. My understanding is that this is a very small number of people and is mostly just the ethereum foundation.edit edit: The term for this class is apparently called slashers, not validators."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If anyone wonders why many &#34;regular people&#34; are uncertain about doing anything with cryptocurrencies, look at the top of this article for the reason. It&#39;s not that people are incapable of understanding the subject, but that the purveyors of the subject constantly coin new words and meanings.  * Ethereum is moving to proof-of-stake! The transition, known as The Merge,
    must first be activated on the Beacon Chain with the Bellatrix upgrade.
    After this, the proof-of-work chain will migrate to proof-of-stake upon
    hitting a specific Total Difficulty value.
  * The Bellatrix upgrade is scheduled for epoch 144896 on the Beacon Chain –
    11:34:47am UTC on Sept 6, 2022.
  * The Terminal Total Difficulty value triggering The Merge is
    58750000000000000000000, expected between Sept 10-20, 2022.
  * Note: as announced earlier, the Kiln testnet is being sunset. Operators
    will shut down on September 6, 2022."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This doesn&#39;t surprise me and matches my own experience. Rust literally makes a codebase nearly void of most bug classes with the exception of logic bugs (Unfortunately, in a huge codebase, there can still be tons and tons of logic bugs).Still, when I migrated my Python codebase to Rust I got rid of whole classes of bugs and honestly code faster in Rust on a &#34;per debugged line of code&#34; basis. In Python, every line MUST be run or could trigger an exception (and so many do and it is hard to see). This now requires a test harness that tests every single line which is a huge pain. In Rust, the things that can obviously panic are pretty easy to see and are limited (unwrap, expect, indexing, etc.) making it much easier to write robust code, even with a more limited test suite."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Dev velocity, which was supposed to be the claim to fame of Python, improved dramatically with Rust.I don&#39;t doubt this in the least. I&#39;ve been a professional Python developer for 15 years, and I can&#39;t believe Python ever had the reputation for &#34;high dev velocity&#34; beyond toy examples. In every real world code base I&#39;ve worked in, Python has been a strict liability and the promise that you can &#34;just rewrite the slow parts in C/C++/Numpy/etc&#34; has never held (you very often spend at least as much time marshaling the data to the target language format than you gain by processing in the faster language and you have all of the maintainability problems of C/C++/Numpy). Python trades developer velocity for poor runtime performance.I don&#39;t think Rust is the paragon of high dev velocity languages either, but it seems to be more predictable. You don&#39;t have something that works as a prototype, but then you run into a bunch of performance problems (which virtually cannot be worked around) when you go to productionize, nor do you get all of the emergent quality and maintainability issues that come about from a dynamic type system (and last I checked, Python&#39;s optional static type system was still pretty alpha-grade).I strongly recommend avoiding Python for new projects. Use Go if you&#39;re looking for an easy GC language with max productivity and a decent performance ceiling. Use Rust if you&#39;re writing really high performance or correctness-is-paramount software. I&#39;m sure there are other decent options as well (I&#39;ve heard generally good things about TypeScript, but I&#39;d be concerned about its performance even if it is better than Python)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I was one of the 3 hackers who wrote the LSM that predated Rocks at FB, and as a result I distinctly remember when Rocks overtook it in features by trading off performance, and again when it met and exceeded the performance while keeping the greater capability. RocksDB kicks ass and has for a long time, I’d recommend it to anyone in the market for that sort of thing.FAISS is also great, and has been for years. I don’t doubt that someone has done a meaningful rev on it.But as someone who likes Rust and wants to like it more: don’t lead with that. The software speaks for itself. Or should."</p>

I could get the things done that I needed to do but it was always painful and time consuming.I&#39;ve worked out how to do in Caddy everything that I did in nginx though that took alot of time and effort, but I tend to create quite sophisticated web server configs.At this stage there&#39;s nothing really that nginx could offer that would bring me back from Caddy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"More details here:https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2022/08/code-speech-and-tornad...&gt; In keeping with our longstanding defense of the right to publish code, we are representing Professor Matthew Green, who teaches computer science at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute, including applied cryptography and anonymous cryptocurrencies. Part of his work involves studying and improving privacy-enhancing technologies, and teaching his students about mixers like Tornado Cash. The disappearance of Tornado Cash’s repository from GitHub created a gap in the available information on mixer technology, so Professor Green made a fork of the code, and posted the replica so it would be available for study. The First Amendment protects both GitHub’s right to host that code, and Professor Green’s right to publish (here republish) it on GitHub so he and others can use it for teaching, for further study, and for development of the technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Person that has worked on the defensive side of Money Laundering here.The Tornado Cash sanction has been fascinating to watch and my key takeaway has been that there are two camps: that TC is a Money Laundering service or a Privacy service. Both are talking past each other, when it can in fact be both. Each camp see the service as their primary concern and consider the other camp as an unintended secondary.I am seeing a lot of bad takes. &#34;Money laundering requires all three aspects&#34; particularly irks me because you can just point to KYC regulations to disprove that. 
&#34;Code is just code&#34; is another, but that is just because the code isn&#39;t why someone would be sanctioned or arrested. In the same way that The Pirate Bay was just code, its is how complicit they were in the offence that will get them.Ultimately, the dichotomy feels like a problem unique to public blockchains, and will only be solved with a ZK L1 chain, whatever that looks like. The solution would require the blockchain equivalent of end-to-end encryption, one where intermediaries have zero knowledge but doesn&#39;t require co-mingling of dirty and clean money.While I think money laundering is a more serious crime than piracy (at least the predicate offenses can be). Watch this play out like Megaupload, never ending legal issues for the first parties, and a technical solution like Mega."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Say what you will about the project and the space in general - the idea that any code licensed to you under an open source license can cause your derivative work to be subject to sanctions that were intended for the code’s original authors… would have a chilling effect on innovation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I found the source article much more illuminating: https://lab.sciencemuseum.org.uk/colour-shape-using-computer...I don&#39;t find the headline graph that convincing. Firstly, it&#39;s only based on items in this museum&#39;s collection, which is quite a biased set as it says in the article.Secondly - if you actually look at the colour chart closely, you can see that although there is a trend of more grayscale objects in the collection, within the coloured section there&#39;s also a trend away from almost everything being some shade of yellow, orange or brown towards a much broader range of hues. Blues, greens and purples seem much better represented.It looks to me like ~70% of the colours were basically &#34;brown&#34; in the 1800s, and now ~40% are white/gray/black. Seems more a reflection of modern objects being made more out of metal and plastic and less out of wood than anything else. Again, this is putting aside the clear bias in the samples here.I&#39;m sure there are trends going on (and the car colour one seems legit to me) but I think this overblows it a little. Fashion ebbs and flows."</p>

If the McDonald&#39;s leaves the building, the &#34;boring&#34; one will be worth more/ can extract more rent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I purchased a pink (well, metallic fuchsia) Jeep Wrangler this year, and reactions are wildly positive. I get compliments from random strangers at least once a week.I think people appreciate color, they just don&#39;t want to buy something that they perceive as harder to sell because of it. (Plus, of course, a couple buying a car may both like bright colors but like different bright colors.)Update: I should link to a piece I wrote about the Jeep and reactions to it, inspired by a Bob&#39;s Burgers episode.https://opposite-lock.com/topic/52688/tuscadero"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is exactly what the engineers behind FoundationDB (FDB) wanted when they open sourced. For those who don&#39;t know, FDB provides a transactional (and distributed) ordered key-value store with a somewhat simple but very powerful API.Their vision was to build the hardest parts of building a database, such as transactions, fault-tolerance, high-availability, elastic scaling, etc. This would free users to build higher-level (Layers) APIs [1] / libraries [2] on top.The beauty of these layers is that you can basically remove doubt about the correctness of data once it leaves the layer. FoundationDB is one of the most (if not the) most tested [3] databases out there. I used it for over 4 years in high write / read production environments and never once did we second guess our decision.I could see this project renamed to simply &#34;fdb-sqlite-layer&#34;[1] https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-document-layer[2] https://github.com/FoundationDB/fdb-record-layer[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OJb8A6h9jQQ"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Relevant reading about FoundationDB building a SQL database on top of a distributed key-value store: https://www.voltactivedata.com/blog/2015/04/foundationdbs-le...
(That one replaced SQLite&#39;s btree, this one puts pages of the btree as values in the key-value store.)Another approach using FUSE, making arbitrary SQLite-using applications leader-replica style distributed for HA: https://github.com/superfly/litefs (see also https://litestream.io/ for WAL-streaming backups, that&#39;s the foundation of this)"</p>
