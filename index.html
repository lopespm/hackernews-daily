								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Guess I&#39;d better say a few things.First, I deeply appreciate that so many on Hacker News have come out for this.  Enough to awaken me from a sound sleep on a Tuesday evening!I don&#39;t really care that much about selling Klein bottles over Amazon - it&#39;s mainly to reach parents over the holidays.  But I do wish that Amazon would do something about this kind of thing.Finally, I&#34;m very low on stocks of glass Klein bottles. It&#39;s weird for me to ask my friends not to buy the things I&#39;ve worked so hard to make, but I guess I&#39;d better.  I hope to have more manifolds in mid to late summer.Warm wishes all around,-Cliff (way late on a cloudy Tuesday evening in Oakland)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A perfect example of why I buy less and less from sites that support 3rd party sellers.The problem is even once reliable sites like newegg.com are now playing these games.  If I wanted the Ebay/alibaba experience I can get that!  Why large retailer sites dilute their brand and frustrate customers in the fruitless chase of &#34;being like Amazon&#34; in catering to 3rd party sellers  amazes and annoys me.At least most other sites let you weed out the 3rd party sellers fairly easily.  What&#39;s really annoying is with Amazon, even if you are buying from &#34;Amazon&#34; it could be ultimately supplied to Amazon by some hackney 3rd party and not a trusted wholesaler or the original manufacturer.  And as Cliff Stoll found out, Amazon doesn&#39;t care either.Talk about coasting on your reputation.  It will be interesting to see how much trust they have to piss away before it affects them enough for them to finally pay attention to stuff like this :/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That sucks. Nice write-up of how this scam works, I wasn&#39;t aware of the details previously.Also, if anyone is unaware, this is this Clifford Stoll: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Stoll - who wrote this brilliant (and true) book: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo%27s_Egg_(book) - which is a really good read and perfect for HN."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Attempts to litigate any license violation are going to get precisely nowhere I bet, but I find the actual license violation argument persuasive.This is an excellent example of how the AI singularity/revolution/whatever is a total distraction and that a much bigger and more serious issue is how AI is becoming so effective at turning the output of cheap/free human mental labour into capital. If AI keeps getting better and better and status quo socio-economic structure don&#39;t change, trillions in capital will be captured by the 0.01%.I would be quite a turn up for the books if this AI co-pilot gets suddenly and dramatically better in 2030 and it negatively impacts the software engineering profession. &#34;Hey, that&#39;s our code you used to replace us!&#34; we will cry out too late."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly I think a large part of the value add of machine learning is going to be the ability for huge entities to launder intellectual property violations.As an example, my grandfather (an old school EE who got his start on radar systems in the 50s, who then got his radiology MD when my jewish grandmother berated him enough with &#34;engineer&#39;s not doctor though...&#34;) has some really cool patents around highlighting interesting parts of the frequency domain in MRIs that should make detection of cancer a whole lot easier.  As an implementation he did a bunch of tensor calculus by hand to extract and highlight those features because he&#39;s an incredibly smart old school EE with 70 years experience cranking that kind of thing out with only his trusty slide rule.  He hasn&#39;t gotten any uptake from MRI manufacturers, but they&#39;re all suddenly really into recurrent machine learning models to highlight the same sorts of stuff.  Part of me wants to tell him to try selling it as a machine learning model and just obfuscate the fact that the model was carefully hand written rather than back propagated.I&#39;m personally pretty anti intellectual property (at least how it&#39;s implemented in the states), but a system where large entities that have the capital investment to compute the large ML models can launder IP violations, but little guys get stuck to the letter of the law certainly seems like the worst of both worlds to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see the point of this tool, independent of the resulting code being derivative of GPL code or not.being able to produce valid code is not the bottleneck of any developer effort.  no projects fail because code can&#39;t be typed quickly enough.the bottleneck is understanding how the code works, how to design things correctly, how to make changes in accordance with the existing design, how to troubleshoot existing code, etc.this tool doesn&#39;t make anything any easier!  it makes things harder, because now you have running software that was written by no one and is understood by no one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work at Code for America on the Tax Benefits team, and we&#39;re working on a different website to apply for the Child Tax Credit. (See https://www.getctc.org/ and https://www.getyourrefund.org/. )
From the original article:
&gt; Alas, all [People&#39;s Policy Project&#39;s website] can do is funnel users into Intuit&#39;s terrible [child tax credit] site.
Today at work, I&#39;m learning how to use the IRS&#39;s e-File SOAP API in the hopes that we can build a flow that is easier to use than Intuit&#39;s.
Feel free to subscribe to our newsletter. :) https://info.codeforamerica.org/newsletter
See also https://www.codeforamerica.org/news/meet-code-for-americas-n... for how we&#39;re thinking about this work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Intuit is consistently one of the least ethical actors in tech. They have a monopoly position in many of their products and take advantage of some of the poorest people through misinformation and lobbying.Facebook &amp; Uber have received most of the heat over the past few years. Intuit has strangely avoided the same level of scrutiny."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s telling is that TurboTax&#39;s UX is really, really, good, deceptive pricing aside. Like, so good I almost enjoy using it to do my taxes.The very fact that Intuit has clearly invested money into making a beautiful interface for a tax program, a program that people use once a year, just goes to show how profitable the current arrangement is for them, and how determined they are to keep the average taxpayer from switching to any competing tax filing ecosystem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This makes me laugh exactly because the number of jobs I&#39;ve seen advertised after I&#39;ve left them to do other things because they weren&#39;t challenging enough, only to see that the prerequisites posted for the &#34;new&#34; job would&#39;ve screened me out before I even had the chance to interview and are far beyond what is necessary to do the job well.99% of the jobs that high quality developers could do that they&#39;re screened out of are because of poor concepts of what is needed to be successful.If someone has decent problem solving and analytical skills, can understand the problem domain and has the capacity to learn a new language/framework/construct in a short period of time (which frankly most of us can, and do with frightening regularity), unless you have something miraculously niche and technical, they&#39;re capable of doing the job. All you need to worry about is are they a competent developer and whether they&#39;ll be a good personality fit for the team.They say we rise to the level of our incompetence, but most developers never really grow out of solving problems and only get better with time and experience.Most degrees and professional certifications are meaningless to people who only care about the knowledge - there&#39;s no point in chasing paper that&#39;s out of date the minute the course is designed. We don&#39;t want that knowledge, it&#39;s old. We want current information which the courses and qualifications haven&#39;t been designed for yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a job for nearly 20 years.  Good job, good people, really hard to leave.  The folks at the company who hired me at the time (dot.com era) &#34;Just wanted people who could think about second order effects&#34;.  They didn&#39;t care about resume much.  They wanted &#34;thinkers&#34;.I worked in tech support and had a great relationship with engineering and etc.  They&#39;d ask tickets get assigned to me because they knew I was honest and thorough when it came to documentation and etc.  It was a good gig.Eventually we were acquired and before selling the company off as pieces they laid a huge % of people off, including myself (it was ok, I was ready to move on / and would eventually change careers).The company that got a bunch of the engineers eventually needed support people and the engineers reached out to me to apply.   I applied.But the job requirements had changed, masters degree required.  I no longer qualified (I didn&#39;t / don&#39;t even have a degree).  I applied, but didn&#39;t make it past new company&#39;s filters.  The engineers were told that if I didn&#39;t make it through the filter they wouldn&#39;t consider me.20 years doing that job in one form or another, and there&#39;s maybe a handful of people who know the proprietary side of their equipment... but no masters = not even considered for job.This was a technical job to be sure but it was largely IP (and some proprietary stuff) networking troubleshooting.   You could take capable high school students and they could do it with some good guidance.The hiring people industrial complex is insane."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"General SE hiring comment: One thing I realized, for most IT/SE jobs, the more accurately you describe your current stack in the requirements (or maybe the person you are replacing), the smaller your candidate pool is. You might even find that your candidate pool is exactly the people you are already working with.Which makes it problematic when we make HR people do the initial screening. They would filter out a lot of good candidates just because they used Python instead of Java, or had been working on a C++ project one year less than the person leaving the team.Could it be then that this is a communication problem between the Engineering team and the HRD? After all, the Eng&#39;g team writes the requirements for the job post, HRD just checks it and makes it look attractive.(Though honestly, I don&#39;t think this general comment applies to the job post in Carmack&#39;s tweet. Honestly I can&#39;t fault the job post for the way it was worded. I say the higher you are in an SE-org chain, the less this is a problem.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like SparkFun and I don&#39;t like patent trolls, but I have to say that SparkFun&#39;s mockery of the patent doesn&#39;t make sense. It is pretty clear that this patent was written by an engineer describing their actual system in great detail followed by one fairly narrow claim. I&#39;ve seen many patents that are mostly written by lawyers, and I don&#39;t see any influence of lawyers in this patent.SparkFun&#39;s criticism is kind of painful to read. The diagram that SparkFun claims is SPI is not SPI. The discussion that SparkFun claims is malloc is entirely unrelated to malloc. SparkFun claims that when the patent discusses processing multiple streams of data that it&#39;s discussing variable length arrays, but it&#39;s not. They claim that a MAU doesn&#39;t exist, but a MAU is a multiplier-accumulator unit. SparkFun seems to be entirely confusing the motivation of the engineer filing the patent in 2008 with the motivation of the patent trolls. I&#39;ve seen many patents that are fluff and nonsense, but this one is a solid patent.The infringement claim is probably bogus; I don&#39;t see any evidence that the pcDuino infringes the one narrow claim in the patent. I hope that SparkFun can quickly get rid of this lawsuit. I don&#39;t get any enjoyment out of criticizing SparkFun&#39;s post, but having spent the time to look over the patent, I feel that I should comment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &gt;    The cost is further reduced by employing only static or dynamic ram as a means for holding the state of the system. [...]&gt; Dynamic ram? Can I poke fun at them for not knowing what RAM is? Yes I can.&gt; The above paragraph succinctly describes malloc(), which is perhaps one of the most fundamental advancements in modern computing. The problem is that Al didn’t invent it. Memory management (the ability to take RAM and then give it back when your function is done) goes back to the dawn of computing.No, this is wrong.Nathan is referring to dynamic memory allocation, which is what malloc does, but that isn&#39;t what this line in the lawsuit is talking about.Dynamic RAM, or DRAM is RAM that stores state in a capacitor. This is what your laptop uses -- DDR4 SDRAM is &#34;Double data rate (version 4) synchronous dynamic RAM&#34;. In DRAM, the charge on the capacitors slowly dissipates, so DRAM needs to be &#34;refreshed&#34; periodically, which is why it&#39;s referred to a &#34;dynamic&#34; RAM.Static RAM, or SRAM, is RAM that stores state in a register-like structure (usually cross-coupled inverters). It&#39;s &#34;static&#34; in that it doesn&#39;t need to be refreshed -- as long as the supply voltage is maintained, the bits stored in an SRAM will remain intact.I agree that this patent lawsuit is bullshit, and I really hate to derail the conversation, but I&#39;m surprised by Nathan&#39;s misunderstanding here, given that SparkFun makes embedded boards that use all kinds of memory. SRAM/DRAM isn&#39;t unusual terminology. The distinction doesn&#39;t even matter in the context of this line in the lawsuit, but if you&#39;re going to make a point of nitpicking about something, you should really make sure that you&#39;re actually right about it first..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Me: software engr, retired; also patent agent who worked in Google Patent Litigation.A rookie mistake is reading the TEXT of a patent. A pro looks only at the claims. The text is only there to &#34;support&#34; the claims, which boils down to using the same words. Cynical, I know.Claims unfortunately look like gibberish if you&#39;re unschooled, but &#34;construing&#34; them is an early step in a trial, and often if you get a bad claim construction you give up. I worked on tons of claim construction briefs.I&#39;ll read those claims a little later this evening."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience at least talking to some younger people there is a clear dichotomy: despite all the talk about Gen Z being &#34;digital natives&#34;, people new in their career are much hungrier to get back into the office because they don&#39;t yet have good career networks built up and they&#39;re eager for mentorship. It is older, or at least more established workers who are less keen on that.I don&#39;t think FAANGs will have any trouble hiring a boatload of eager, hardworking college grads in September even if they lose multi-digit percentage of their current workers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I honestly don&#39;t know whether these articles are over-stating their case, and neither do I know how typical my own experience is, but for some reason it bothers me that the tone of the HN discussion is so reflexively dismissive.I understand that a lot of people will respond to a question of whether they intend to quit their job with a &#39;you bet!&#39; even at the best of times, but I&#39;m seeing a lot of people quitting and switching right now, as different company plans are crystallized for the &#39;new normal&#39;.In my current company (for another 2 months) I was interviewed to join a team of 12 tech developers, and a couple of months ago the first of the switchers quit to leave for another company specifically because they were guaranteeing remote-first work.Then another five of us quit over the following few weeks. We met up last week for a goodbye lunch in the park: half the team that I joined a year ago leaving the company over the Spring and Summer.Is a 50% quit-rate normal? Maybe each of us had slightly different priorities and plans for the future? But I do know for sure that people are reflecting more than I&#39;ve ever experienced before, about their work environment, the balance in their lives, and prioritizing other things than 40-50 hours each week sitting in front of a screen, inside an office."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They sent around a form at my work asking everyone what their preference would be. The first guy replied to everyone with his preference: 100% wfh. Since he replied-all, so did everyone else. We got through about 20 employees, all stating their preference as WFH before a manager shut down the reply-all.A week later we got an email saying people wanted 2-3 days in office."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I lived in HK 2018-2020, leaving around the passage of the “national security law”.I think HK is a perfect case study of a line of fallacious thinking popular among westerners: the idea that peaceful protesting or rule-abiding political opposition is generally effective.This is wrong for at least two reasons. The first mistake is failing to recognize that many governments (case in point) are not nearly as vulnerable to bad PR, so generating a bunch of sympathetic imagery (photos of student protestors getting gassed or whatever) might not actually be useful in swaying political outcomes.The second mistake is assuming that most (putatively) peaceful protests in the western world are actually the impetus for political change, and not just part of a legitimization strategy for political changes that were already in development before the protest started."</p>

Then go recognize the Republic of Taiwan as an independent country.Unfortunately the CCP is probably right in their assumption that our politicians are to greedy and spineless to make anything beyond a soundbite gesture.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most interesting idea I heard about the hand-over of HK is that UK should have offered a UK permanent resident (or even a citizen) status  to all HK residents, once China started the pressure.Of course, HK&#39;s population is 11% of UK, not a small deal, likely such a bill won&#39;t pass anyway. But I also see it as a missed opportunity to bring in some world-class human capital."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s my beef with estimates.I can give you a really really accurate estimate, but in order to do so we&#39;re going to have to spend a lot of time going through the request, building and verifying actual requirements, designing the solution and then validating it.The process will require dev resources, business resources and probably people from the support team and will take a lot of time.I&#39;m happy to do it. It&#39;s actually my favorite part of the job. But the business invariably doesn&#39;t want to spend the time and money to do that.They&#39;d generally much rather start with a fairly vague description of what they need and let the devs keep throwing stuff against the wall and see what sticks.Good and accurate estimation is not just a dev function. It requires buy in and input from the entire business stack."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Estimation that isn&#39;t based on previous data - I think the article that follows this one refers to it as &#34;Evidence-Based Scheduling&#34; - is almost entirely a waste of time.We analyzed our five+ year history of estimates vs actual time, and our standard deviation was larger than our mean. It was ridiculous how wrong our estimates were. The problem was in what was being estimated - coding time. Developers would get asked how long a task would take, and only think about the time spent sitting in front of a computer, typing code, and not the other time - waiting for other resources or people to finish tasks that you depend on, sick days, software and hardware issues, etc.The only way to accurately take those unforeseen factors into account is by analyzing previously completed tasks that have similar scope. Even then you can only get close.A couple people have mentioned weather forecasting as a similar endeavor - but meteorologists don&#39;t just guess, they analyze previous data.Estimation that isn&#39;t based on concrete data is a fool&#39;s game."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paid overtime will fix scheduling. Scheduling is bad because the cost falls on the employees, not the employer. If crunches resulted in time and a half, double time, and triple time, scheduling would get fixed.As I&#39;ve pointed out before, film scheduling is an established discipline. Making a movie is much more complex than a software project. There are a lot of moving parts. Things get changed. There are people problems, weather problems, and transportation problems. Most importantly, if a film project goes into crunch mode, everybody starts getting paid overtime. This reduces the tendency to underestimate.There are also third party estimates. Hollywood has something called &#34;completion bonds&#34;. A completion bond is an insurance policy for the investors. Either they get a showable movie into theaters, or the completion bond company has to pay the investors. A completion bond costs about 5% of the cost of the film.Completion bond companies do their own estimates. Estimation inputs are &#34;script, budget, shooting schedule, (and) résumés of key crew.&#34; To survive, they need a net error near zero - they must overestimate and underestimate about equally. Consistent underestimation would put them out of business.Since they do a lot of this, they have scripts and financial data from previous movies. They can look up &#34;car chase, metropolitan area, 2 minutes screen time&#34; for how much that cost the last 50 times someone did it. They also have director info, like &#34;director X averages 2.5 takes per scene&#34;. All this info is collected across multiple film companies.The completion bond company has the right to intervene if the project starts to go over budget. Worst case, they can fire the director and take over the production. This is rare, but it happens. &#34;Malcolm X&#34; by Spike Lee (1992) and &#34;Bad Girls&#34; are examples. &#34;Malcolm X&#34; was an epic movie, a bit too epic - it runs 3 hours and 22 minutes - and somebody had to say no to Spike Lee. &#34;Bad Girls&#34; (1994) was just a botched production, and the bond company put in their own director to try to salvage something. It still lost money, but did reach theaters.That a completion bond company can fire the director puts teeth in this system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like the conspiracy theory/practice distinction and I hope Ed will write more on how we could pay more attention to the latter.Noam Chomsky presents lots of evidence about outrageous acts of American government in his books, and he always claimed that it all comes from official and open government sources. Yet most people are either unaware or refuse to believe it anyway.These are conspiracies done openly, because almost nobody wants to go through and find the smoking gun in the heaps of otherwise boring government documents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Conspiracies happen constantly because people conspire to do nefarious things all the time. However nowadays the framework for evaluating those nefarious things (conspiracy theories) has been completely negated by those in corporate media conflating it with insanity and baseless, nonsensical accusations.And there&#39;s a reason for that, which Snowden touches on. Namely, the world in its current form is largely run by such nefarious schemes. The bad guys won a long time ago. And by taking away the language we might even use to talk about what they did, and the scale of it, they have further insulated their power."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve noticed people treat conspiracy theories with the same level of validity or non-validity regardless of the facts or details.Things like flat earth conspiracies have now inexplicably been lumped into the likes of those who believe in things like.https://www.npr.org/2019/09/09/758989641/the-cias-secret-que...Or just question in general the motivation behind the decisions made by those in charge.There are some very obviously dumb conspiracies that have no basis in reality, there are some possibly far out there conspiracies that could have some merit and then there&#39;s conspiracies that seemed ridiculous but actually turned out to be true.The world is not black and white...it&#39;s very grey.Again, I find it odd these things tend to all be labeled under one giant &#39;conspiracy theory&#39; label. Much like any theories, some are possibly valid, others very obviously not.Categorizing these things together as has been done in recent years makes no sense."</p>
