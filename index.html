								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a huge fan of TikTok because after years of content stagnation and dullness, the internet is fun again. Especially places like Twitter and Instagram are outrage and depression inducers for me, consumed together it feels like the society is collapsing but everyone is living a perfect life at the same time.The China thing is touchy but I want the west to beat them by being better, not by being dismissive and protectionist.I guess by now everyone has heard of their legendary discovery algorithm so I&#39;m not going there but recently I noticed that some of my favourite creators from the Youtube etc. are on TikTok and their material is much nicer to consume there. Why? I think this is because of the short and fast phased nature of the TikTok content. Instead of publishing 10 to 30 min videos(AFAIK Youtube encourages that, it is also good for the revenue), they put together a short video that shows the gist of the subject. They will also be much more responsive, quickly replying with short videos to the comments. It&#39;s a very dynamic place.One exception for me is Nile Red, I love watching his 40 min chemistry videos. Actually, there are a few more YouTubers who&#39;s content works best on YouTube but I&#39;m watching far less and I have more spare time now.Maybe the medium is the message still holds? Maybe people are now ready to hear the message of the TikTok?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like to think of TikTok as the crack cocaine of addictive social media. I used to think my dopamine receptors were burned out by the constant barrage of memes I received from reddit, Facebook and Twitter but TikTok proves they can refine that product to make it even more potent.When I visit reddit now it feels behind in the same way Facebook used to feel behind. Facebook&#39;s video feature (which they shove into my feed as the third or fourth card during scrolling) is 90% stuff stolen from and that I already saw a few days ago on TikTok. But absent their algorithm it isn&#39;t nearly as effective.I often have to remind myself how good TikTok&#39;s algorithm is. After using it for just a couple of days I can tell it knows more about me than I am comfortable with, even though I just scroll the FYP (For You Page) without logging into an account. The unbelievably narrow category of content it serves me clearly panders to my personality in a way that almost lets me believe I have a majority opinion. It creates a nearly perfectly personally tailored media bubble.A lot of people from my generation (Gen X) and even from the older Millennial&#39;s don&#39;t use it, thinking it is just for the kids. That is probably for the best. If you are susceptible to media addiction I suggest never downloading it. TikTok: Not Even Once."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of positivity in this thread, and I don&#39;t think that&#39;s entirely a bad thing, but I think TikTok is the worst of the social media platforms in terms of addictiveness, based on my peers.As a recent grad, so many of my friends are heavily invested in TikTok and have been since quarantine began, some of them for a bit before. The amount of time they spend there is absurd. Consuming 30 second content for three hours can&#39;t be good for concentration, right? It helps add to the &#39;always online&#39; mindset that has grown more popular with social media and smart phones.Instead of going for a walk, some of my friends would opt to lie in bed and watch TikToks, creating empty, basically non-existent connections with people across the world. Connections with people across the world are awesome, and one of the best things about the internet, but TikTok connections are basically UDP.Most TikTok content I&#39;ve been shown is shallow, the same way so much social media content is shallow. My having to get to the point immediately, we leave out key details and we want to catch your attention before you scroll away. Of course there is the other end of the spectrum with YouTube where a 2 minute tutorial takes 15 minutes.I try not to use much social media, and honestly, I probably should limit my time on HN more as well. Doom scrolling is a real thing, and TikTok is not immune to that. I&#39;ve seen plenty of dread inducing content that comes from TikTok as well.TikTok keeps you logged on, as it&#39;s supposed it. I just don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good thing. If you can control and limit your usage to something that&#39;s healthy for you, then I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a problem. For me though, that healthy limit is 0, because I know myself and I have little self control with social media in the past."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Total Cookie Protection, built into Firefox, makes sure that facebook.com can’t use cookies to track you across websites. It does this by partitioning data storage into one cookie jar per website, rather than using one big jar for all of facebook.com’s storage. With Enhanced Cookie Clearing, if you clear site data for comfypants.com, the entire cookie jar is emptied, including any data facebook.com set while embedded in comfypants.com.This seems exactly right: now that we have partitioned cookies, cookie clearing should clear cookies for the whole partition."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you disallow third party cookies, then there is no use for this per website cookie jar. I&#39;ve browsed the web like this for decades (since Opera 9, IIRC), and I had problems with at most 5 websites. YMMV, of course.In my opinion, the simplest way to deal with cookies is to disallow third party, and to keep a white list of authorized websites. Cookies outside this white list should be deleted manually or automatically after a few hours. Extensions for this probably exist, but I&#39;ve had bad experiences with extensions breaking or becoming intrusive, so I made my own where I hard coded the domains that I want to keep."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This would be even more better  with a “Forget this site” button that could be added to the toolbar (if the user wishes to). Clicking on it would clear everything for the site and close the tab.The nested menus to access it aren’t very convenient.I do use CookieAutoDelete to handle this for closed tabs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looking great, I&#39;ve been a long time Mac user and I think I actually like elementary&#39;s evolution of the UI styling (from when it started as a pretty direct clone) better than I like Apple&#39;s in Big Sur. Tried elementary before (Luna and Freya IIRC) and while it hasn&#39;t replaced my Mac for development or my Windows desktop for gaming, I&#39;m definitely keeping an eye on it.Can&#39;t help but notice that the Sound indicator&#39;s dropdown doesn&#39;t line up with the icon above it. But the fact that a single UI glitch is a notable item now says a lot about the overall quality. Very tidy, still customizable, and a suite of built-in software that ought to cover most users. Good stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a big update for a relatively small community distro.  Kudos to the team.A summary of some of the cooler features:Performance:  General performance improvements on all hardware resulting from optimizing for Pinebook Pro and Raspberry Pi - namely, reducing and asynchronizing inter-process communication between desktop components, removing unused code, and reducing disk I/O.Firmware:  Linux Vendor Firmware Service now built-in, enabling firmware updates from within the OS.Flatpak:  all-in on flatpak, all AppCenter apps are flatpaks, as well as some Elementary apps like Web.Portals:  apps must explicitly request permission to get access to files or interact with other apps.  Can tweak these permissions in System Settings.Mail:  The Mail app now sandboxes html emails.Multi-Touch:  Extended from supporting just desktop to various apps now too.Multi-Tasking:  Better hot corners + new window and workspace controls.CalDav:  Tasks and Calendar now designed around the CalDav format, making importing and sharing of tasks and calendar items with other CalDav apps easier.Dark Theme:  system-wide, applies to GTK apps too.Terminal:  smart-paste protection extended from sudo pastes to multi-line pastes.More OEM/Vendor friendly:- Installer is simplified and streamlined - network connectivity, user account creation, and updates moved out of the installer and into the installed OS.  Better for vendors &amp; OEMs.- Startup is intentionally non-Elementary-branded, better enabling OEM/Vendor branded startup splash screen — &#34;we don’t need to constantly advertise your operating system to you&#34;.There&#39;s a separate blog post on hardware-specific improvements here:  https://blog.elementary.io/hardware-improvements-coming-to-e..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised they spend so much (presumably) time and effort on applications, especially &#39;Web&#39; and &#39;Terminal&#39;. How many users are actually going to use &#39;Web&#39; as their browser?That said, I wish them all the best, because I use &#39;Files&#39; (but not the distro) since it&#39;s the best I&#39;ve found for the odd occasion where I think using a GUI file manager will be easier than the command line. I still wouldn&#39;t say it&#39;s good, just the best I&#39;ve found. (Not opening everything on a single-click is a vast improvement!)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;But [Apple executives] said they expected any [implication by malicious actors] attacks to be very rare and that in any case a review would then look for other signs of criminal hacking.&#34;Oh, all right: Apple, already being in possession of hard evidence of a hideous crime and already being required by law to forward such evidence to proper authorities, will also - pro bono publico! - sacrifice significant amount of time of a significant number of their in-house computer forensics experts, each enjoying a significant billing rate, to relentlessly look for &#34;other signs of criminal hacking&#34;, until there is no significant doubt that the accused is, indeed, guilty.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I stopped using stock Android and went back to iPhones because I thought Apple cares more about privacy than Google does. Not exactly correct in all cases I know (ie. they both suck in terms of privacy), but it seemed like Apple users are buying in, so it might work.Now I think my next mobile OS is going to be GrapheneOS.Like others have mentioned, this is as big of a warning as anyone&#39;s going to get to get out of that locked-in ecosystem. On that note, the outrage is kind of useless if you don&#39;t skip buying the next iPhone. You should fully own what you fully pay for."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of comments asking what is &#34;Soviet/Russian Math&#34; actually like, and how is it different.I was lucky to get an education in three systems (Soviet Math, Romanian Math School (influenced by both French and Soviet Math school), and finally in a world top 40 university in North America.I would summarize the Soviet/Russian Math/Physics approach like this:  - understanding of the mechanism/intuition behind the equations/methods is paramount
  - teachers are astute at spotting students who memorize blindly, and will intervene to correct that
  - while rigorous about notation, the mathematical representation always comes after understanding, not before
  - the progression of teaching (order how material is introduced) is very well thought out
  - the old soviet textbooks are generally less verbose than North American ones (less fancy), but high quality in their expression, typesetting, and ESPECIALLY (!!!) the quality of the exercises
  - the Soviet Math textbook exercises are something to behold: they have funny/memorable setting (like jokes), they are short and easy to express, the numbers are chosen in such a way that the result will be a nice whole number, or pi, etc. Basically as a kid you can read one of those problems, lay down, close your eyes, and work on it in your head.

That being said, I did like some of the aspects from the so called &#34;Western Math&#34; (in my case Canadian university):  - teachers are more approachable, more friendly
  - textbooks can be gorgeous (nice colorful plots, etc)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went through the Soviet/Russian school system with all the advanced topics being covered in high school as others described here. My moment of zen was on my third year in one of the top tech universities in Moscow. There were quite a few students coming from Novosibirsk University who were comfortably ahead of the curve when it came to math. When they showed their transcript (&#34;zachetka&#34;), they had ~3000 hours of Calculus in the first few years against our ~120... As they described it, each day after the usual roster of lectures and seminars, they would spend 4 hours in class in the evening solving math problems with a teacher. While we might have spent a few hours doing homework every now and then, it was nowhere near this. Not to mention doing it in class with a teacher who would likely also give them more challenging problems and valuable feedback. The sheer amount of time and mental effort was staggering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a weird article. I think this idea of &#39;Russian math&#39; is very nebulous, and is probably used as marketing tool nowadays by some schools abroad. I have graduated from one of the top physics/maths high schools in Russia, and yes we had great math education there, but that was an outlier. Outside a handful of schools the math education is pretty dismal.
And even in the good math schools there are different ways of teaching maths. I.e. there is a famous system of &#39;sheets&#39; where the actual teaching of formal theory is very limited, while most of learning is done by solving problems (given to you on a sheet) and then presenting solutions to the teacher. But it wasn&#39;t used in our school for example.What definitely exists in Russia (or at least some big cities) is a system of free after-school classes, where you can go and learn how to solve olympiad-type math problems and become more interested in maths. That is definitely extremely useful to identify a few people who are talented in maths."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I live in a master planned community (Daybreak, Utah), and while you can definitely scoff at the building quality (state of things everywhere right now, it&#39;s all done fast and with low quality materials), it&#39;s been fantastic, especially during the pandemic.The whole neighborhood is designed to be walkable, with parks, pools, trails, train stations, grocery stores and restaurants (added in the later phases, which are being developed right now) within 5 minutes of your doorstep.It gets a bad rap from locals on the outside, but talk to the people living here (mostly expats from out of state) and nearly all of them say the same thing:&gt; &#34;We love it here!&#34;and&gt; &#34;Why aren&#39;t more communities built this way?&#34;I will say though, the US is poorly equipped for bicycle commuting. Even our neighborhood doesn&#39;t have many dedicated bike paths, opting instead to share the road with cars. Most diehard cyclists I know will tell you it&#39;s a matter of &#34;when&#34; not &#34;if&#34; you have a scary encounter with a driver. And with the amount of gigantic trucks on the roads out here that people use as their commuter cars, you can imagine these encounters don&#39;t typically end well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately this project lacks two things which are essential to a long-lasting, sustainable, and human-friendly town.1) Architecture that inspires, elevates the soul, and will last the test of time. All I see is soulless pre-fabs. It looks like you&#39;re living in a shopping mall.2) The freedom to create buildings and institutions that are meaningful to the residents who reside there. Churches, schools, sporting clubs. Trusting the company behind this to provide for your every need is naive. Maybe it will work for some people. But will people want to move and raise children here?Creating one-off experiences is not the way to create the sustainable towns and cities of the future. This is like Airbnb taken to an obscene level. We should be designing car-free towns where people can buy property, design beautiful homes, participate in a small local economy, work locally and start small businesses, create the local institutions that their children and their children&#39;s children will participate in. I don&#39;t want to rent my space in a town I&#39;m only partially attached to. I want to put roots down, and build things that will last."</p>

I&#39;m not affiliated.---It&#39;s also a super basic intro to proper google-fu (which you can google to find others&#39; takes on how to become somewhat effective at, erm, googling). Back when I used to blog on Microsoft-related topics, it was common to construct extremely narrow queries to find exposed confidential documents in Skydrive accounts which we could then sift through to find bloggable material.e.g site:[skydrive domain] filetype:.pptx &#34;Microsoft Confidential&#34; etc.Or one which still works:https://www.google.com/search?q=&#34;Microsoft+Confidential&#34;+sit...lmao I&#39;m going to have some fun tonight."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Folks - these routers are secure. There is nothing to see here, move along.Here&#39;s the user manual for the TP-Link AC2300 &#34;Archer C7&#34;, as found in the google results:https://static.tp-link.com/2019/201912/20191231/7106508598_A...Step 2 of first time setup forces a default password change. There is no way around this step.The defaults for the router also do not allow router access from the WAN port.This means:1) These routers all have secured passwords that are non-default.2) These routers were deliberately placed on the internet by people that knew enough about them to do so.Just because it&#39;s not how you would configure your router doesn&#39;t make it wrong. There are legit reasons to place a router on the internet, so long as it&#39;s secured properly... how else would you remotely manage a router at a different physical location, for instance.__Lastly__ click &#34;Next Page&#34; on the OP search results. The estimated 7,000+ results becomes 21. Many of which are HN aggregators reporting on this thread here.So... out of the possible millions of routers TP-Link has sold in this model line, less than 21 are on the public internet - many of which no longer load via IP address (indicating they are no longer publicly accessible), and the rest have professional CNAME&#39;s attached, indicating professional management.Nothing here..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Did the cops give the scooter shop a citation for failing to record the source of the stolen article on https://www.leadsonline.com/? (This post from last month recounted how a laptop repair man in New York City got in trouble for this law https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27810019 specifically Administrative Code §20-273 https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/newyorkcity/latest/NYC... (electronics record required for each purchase AND sale of second-hand articles) and Rules Title 28 §21-07 https://codelibrary.amlegal.com/codes/newyorkcity/latest/NYC... (electronics record must be at a designated website leadsonline.com)). The previous post was about the unintended consequence of the law on law-abiding shops, but here we should see the intended consequence that it should shut down shops that fence stolen goods."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Non-Apple solution: An ESP8266 which opens Wifi-station &#34;STOLEN_BICYCLE_owner@hotmail&#34;. But only for few minutes everyday at 9:11 . Should last for years with small battery.You can go hunting yourself or hope somebody else sees it. If you manage to connect to this network, you can connect to 192.168.1.11 and turn it permanently on/off and also turn audible beep on, for final pinpointin.And now that the ESP wakes up everyday, it could also look for public Wifis and send and receive emails. From the Wifi-providers name you can get a rough idea of the location."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Although NAFTA was heralded by the U.S. government for reducing barriers to trade, as The Counter previously reported, the pact devastated rural economies in Mexico, flooding the market with cheap, government-subsidized U.S. corn and gutting domestic corn prices by nearly 70 percent. This shift led an estimated 2 million farmworkers to abandon the countryside to seek work in big cities or across the border in the United States.&gt;On December 31, 2020, Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador signed a decree that could enable Mexican farmers to reclaim their livelihoods within their home country. The order calls for the phase-out by 2024 of two pillars of American agribusiness: glyphosate and genetically engineered (GE) cornThe problem that US corn grown using high yielding strains is too cheap, so the solution is to ban growing high yielding strains domestically? I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;s going to work.The actual text of the decree is here: https://www.dof.gob.mx/nota_detalle.php?codigo=5609365&amp;fecha...The google translated version says nothing about banning genetically engineered corn, just banning glyphosate? The second order effect is that nobody buys RR corn seed, since you wouldn&#39;t bother spending more for it if you can&#39;t then use glyphosate to knock down weeds. But that&#39;s only for corn grown in-country. All the media coverage seems to think it&#39;s banning corn imports, which I believe would require repealing NAFTA."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought the main health problem with GMO crops (other than overzealous IP management and such) wasn’t even that they’re engineered - it’s that we engineer them to deal with heavy pesticide usage, proceed do so in a way that it’s impossible to clean out, and then consume that food.(and the insect apocalypse, but that’s an indirect effect on human health)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is just my impression, so do tell me if I&#39;m incorrect, but I always got the impression that those North American countries like Mexico and USA rely a bit too much on corn, to the detriment of a more diverse set of crops. Renewable fuel? Corn. Cattle food? Corn. Staple carb? Corn. Sweetener? Corn.Aren&#39;t they putting too many eggs in the same basket?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One Google employee, who asked not to be identified for fear of retaliation, typically commutes to the Seattle office from a nearby county and would likely see their pay cut by about 10% by working from home full-time, according estimates by the company&#39;s Work Location Tool launched in June.&gt; The employee was considering remote work but decided to keep going to the office - despite the two-hour commute.This seems like a nice little meditation on the loss aversion heuristic. I doubt many people would accept a 25% increase in the amount of their time that&#39;s committed to work in exchange for a paltry 11% pay increase. But if you frame it as a 10% pay decrease in exchange for a 20% reduction in how much of your life is devoted to work, it suddenly becomes a lot less palatable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Class A office space in Manhattan is about $70/sqft, and the average office employee gets 150 sqft allocated (desk, hallway, conference room, supply closets...) Google is probably 170. That&#39;s $11900 annually that they save by not having an employee take up office space.No, it&#39;s not fungible on a small scale, but it&#39;s certainly fungible on a large scale: reduce your office needs by 100 people and you can rearrange desks and sublet that 17000 sqft.Google has other famous in-office benefits that cost per-person, so $12K per remote is a baseline savings. If Googlers had any collective bargaining power, they wouldn&#39;t be getting salary reductions: they would be getting extra expense money for desks, chairs, and ISP upgrades."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cost of commuting on the environment is extremely high. We should be offering incentives to companies to switch to remote work. If 20% of jobs permanently switched to remote, the impact on carbon emissions would be immediate, and extremely positive."</p>
