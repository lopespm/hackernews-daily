Getting into email, bank, etc. is one thing, but what if you own property with someone who is suddenly and irreversibly brain damaged? I strongly recommend filing a lasting power of attorney in advance if your risk of this is non-negligible. My mother is living a nightmare due to it right now as she assumed being someone&#39;s spouse would let you take responsibility for an incapacitated spouse.. wrong!My father had a stroke so debilitating that he lost language entirely, lives in a brain care unit 24/7, and has zero chance of regaining even the most basic idea of a life. But by not being biologically &#34;dead&#34; he retains a lot of legal protections that don&#39;t really suit his situation and my mother is unable to sell her home without the permission of the Court of Protection. We filed for said permission 14 months ago.. and, you can guess the rest. With a lasting power of attorney, she&#39;d have been able to organise her life properly within weeks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I started my career 2008 building real estate and stock news websites. Back then, sooooo much of my days were spent making things &#34;IE compatible&#34; using techniques like:- creating sprite sheets of transparent png corners and sides that one could arrange in a table around an element to create drop-shadows and rounded corners- putting single pixel, transparent gifs at the end of floated containers because clearfix used a &#34;before&#34; CSS selector that earlier IEs didn&#39;t know about.- writing CSS rules like  -ms-filter: &#34;progid:DXImageTransform.Microsoft.Alpha(Opacity=75)&#34;; to make something semi-transparent...And so much more. Back then, we were certain we&#39;d open a bottle of champagne once IE is not a requirement anymore.Today, fortunately, I have a different Job and Microsoft makes different browsers. But looking back, I wouldn&#39;t have believed this day to arrive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was a time in 1998-99 when Internet Explorer 4 / 5 was actually the best browser by far. Netscape 4 was unstable and had completely botched all the fancy new features: its implementation of CSS (brand new at the time) was so bad that even font sizes didn&#39;t work right, its homegrown &#34;layers&#34; API for JavaScript DOM access was awful, and many web developers were wishing they could somehow get away with only supporting IE.25 years after the release of IE4, I&#39;m just glad both of those browser codebases are now dead.IE was really done in by Microsoft&#39;s &#34;Longhorn&#34; OS project. After Windows XP, Microsoft was planning a very ambitious update that would completely reset core APIs. File systems would be largely replaced by an OS-level database, and the Win32 GUI API would be replaced by an XML-based UI framework codenamed Avalon.A new Avalon browser would ship with the OS, and thus IE + HTML would become legacy technologies as Microsoft confidently assumed most developers would flock to building their web apps in Avalon instead.To Microsoft strategists, it seemed that they had succeeded in containing the web: Netscape was dead, Mozilla had almost no users, Apple was shipping their IE in Mac OS X, Google wasn&#39;t on Microsoft&#39;s radar, and the HTML standard process was stalled. So while a lot of content was being delivered as HTML4, there didn&#39;t seem to be any reason left for Microsoft to invest in IE — they&#39;d already nailed the browser, owned the market, and would push Avalon as the next step.Fortunately, Longhorn failed. Some parts of the project eventually shipped years late as Windows Vista. Avalon became WPF + XAML and still exists in Windows, but the dream of a XAML browser replacing IE was dead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like good marketing but reading this press release and looking at the courses in their degree program I feel like I&#39;m missing what&#39;s different here (other than some reference to supply chain management).Most of the coursework here seems to be very similar to what was available over a decade ago at the state university I attended for graduate school (my concentration was semiconductor device theory related). While I think this material is very interesting I don&#39;t know that the demand is going to be there for this type of field. Companies like Intel have dedicated smaller departments for process development which do the more academic work (for example the D1X facility).My experience with fabrication organization is the need is much more process engineer and technician focused rather than semiconductor engineers. The high volume hires are in improving reliability, reducing cost etc. I don&#39;t think you really need the EE degree for this, more likely industrial engineering, chemical engineering or statistics.This said, Purdue has always had a very strong program in the more device oriented semiconductor courses (Until his passing Robert Pierret the fellow who wrote some of the best and most used grad textbooks on devices called it home)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have fond memories of my semiconductor physics classes. The were not easy whatsoever, rather intense.As cvccvroomvroom had mentioned, I had my VLSI chip fabbed at the MOSIS facility in Westborough MA, during my EE tenure at UMASS Amherst in the 1990s as part of a state-wide chip design competition (yeah - didn&#39;t win..). There was much activity on VLSI and computer system design at that time, things have certainly changed in the US.I recall many entries were implementations of various (and obscure) mathematical algorithms, mostly in the frequency domain (hence DSP chips), that tried to solve problems that are now trivial in SW today.My school did win occasionally, others were mostly MIT and WPI - I think in a large part due to the excellent professors at all competting schools and the work ethic of the students.My final submission was the design for an Arithmetic Fourier Transform processor - trying to remove the need for expensive ROM by aliasing the signup up-frequency - which I did the barrel-based ALU for, and thank the grad students for including me in the project.cvccvroomvroom: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31756704#31760353

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny article in that it doesn&#39;t discuss lifecycle costs.  A side-by-side comparison of the cost of grids powered by nuclear power plant relative to those powered by wind/solar/storage is what I&#39;d expect to see from a &#39;paper of record&#39; like the NYTimes.Except in some specific cases (Finland, other Arctic regions with long periods of low sunlight) I&#39;m pretty sure this cost comparison comes down firmly on the side of wind/solar/storage.  Storage is the main cost barrier for 100% renewable-powered grids, but this is also an area where technological development is possible.Much of the discussion of energy in the American media is pretty poor these days.  For example, the solar tariff issue on China sourced PV - there are simply no US companies making panels of comparable quality (monocrystalline Si lasts longer and is more efficient).  Concepts like requiring Chinese manufacturers to open factories in the USA if they want to sell in US markets would make sense but probably would violate some trade provision or other.Another factor that this article should have mentioned is the reliability of the global uranium ore -&gt; fuel rods supply chain.  Costs vary significantly based on the purity of the ore (18% is the top, 0.1% is the economically viable limit) and like oil, uranium ore is not globally distributed (unlike sunlight and wind).As far as Russia/Ukraine, the real agenda the US government seems to be pushing there is using that conflict to rapidly increase LNG exports to Europe from the US West/South coast, even though energy prices are spiking due to inflation (and plausibly due to exports of crude oil from the USA, allowed under that 2015 bill lifting that restriction).  A far better plan for Europe would be to go 100% renewable asap, meaning no need for fossil fuel imports from any party.  Yes, that&#39;s technologically possible, but would require massive economic investment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At least they are finding nothing and confirming they are finding nothing. Less scrupulous operators might be always finding something even if its not there. So that&#39;s a sign of good science.Maybe there&#39;s something they haven&#39;t found because there&#39;s so much data?
Mix things up and look again? Change assumptions?Or as someone I know likes to say to various smaller humans: have you looked around the couch? Really? Are you sure? Have you had a good look? this is how the tv remote usually subsequently reappears as there is a difference between just looking and having a good look.The best science also happens when you&#39;ve looked, not found it but now know where not to look. Even better science happens when you know exactly why it shouldn&#39;t have been there at all. Surprising science happens when you find the errors in your assumptions and discover it can sometimes be where it previously was not expected to be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago, I went to a public interview/chat with Rainer Weiss in NYC. He described years of work in which the LIGO team found inventive ways to make their systems more precise. They just kept knocking down orders-of-magnitude. Still, after taking new measurements, they found nothing. No gravitational waves. Then the interviewer asked him if he was discouraged at this point in his career. I loved his response. He said, &#34;No, it was a more meaningful zero.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Stagnation of scientific fields is normal and can last many years. In that time, little anomalies pile up, are swept under the rug, and largely forgotten. To admit anomalies can ruin careers, after all.Eventually someone (often very young/inexperienced) comes along and upends the field by proposing a different model or doing the experiment whose weight breaks the camels back.What&#39;s new here is the scale of the work. It&#39;s not clear how you upend a field where the price of entry is measured in billions of dollars."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Extra shoutouts to the folks at Sentry who also flipped rust-minidump on as their default backend and had to deal with way more exotic issues than I did (and fixed them!) because although Firefox sees some horrendous stuff and gets a bajillion crash reports, it&#39;s still one application with one basically stable minidump writing configuration.They have to deal with basically random apps doing whatever they want and it sounds like hell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for this work!I&#39;ve been involved with minidumps in one way or another since around 2010. Was at a startup at the time that had a browser based on Chromium and we needed crash reporting for our own app. So I wrote a pretty simply backend that received minidumps, ran them through the breakpad processor and shoved the output into Splunk. That was our crash-reporting system.Circa 2013 the company gets acquired by Yahoo which at the time was using Crittercism for its mobile apps but Yahoo wasn&#39;t happy with it. Somehow I was now the mobile app crash reporting expert at the company though so I built a whole new in-house crash reporting solution.For iOS I wrote an SDK around PLCrashReporter because unwinding stacks on the client works out way better on iOS than dealing with a minidump.For Android I had to deal with both JVM (er, Dalvik, er ART) stack traces, easy enough, but also native code crashes. For the latter I used breakpad&#39;s crash handler and minidumps. But it turns out that minidumps from Android devices are almost useless for two reasons:1) If the crashes originate in managed code or calls into managed code you can&#39;t trace back through the managed code frames from a minidump. Especially if you don&#39;t have frame pointers.2) You basically cannot get the symbols for all the different flavors of Android. Without symbols any stack trace that breakpad reconstructs is pretty useless.Eventually I abandoned minidumps on Android and instead unwinding on the phone using corkscrew, wait no, libbacktrace, wait no, libunwind. But that still doesn&#39;t give useful stack traces very often. In the end, I ended up capturing logcat output when restarting after a crash which actually tends to have the most useful stack traces.Which is all to say, both Apple and Google make it really hard for a mobile app to find out why it crashed. Both Android and iOS create a crash report for any app which crashes, but the app can&#39;t access those. So we&#39;re all shipping apps with third-party crash handlers built-in that try to capture a stack or minidump in-process and make sense of it later."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this article hits on some truths and gets a handful of things wrong.  First, they are correct that we are in a dynamic profession that requires constant learning and expanding.  No doubt the people who choose to stay in software are likely to be people who are curious, life-long learners where this is a benefit of the profession rather than a drawback.  That said, one thing I noticed from teaching computer science while a graduate student is that the poor students think about languages and libraries as key skills, while the better students think about the data structures, algorithms, and design principles.  These slightly more meta-level concepts are far more stable and timeless, while the underlying implementations of them are constantly evolving.  If you think of each new library as &#34;having to learn a new skill&#34; I can imagine burnout and overload are more likely, but if you figure once you know 3D graphics you can pretty easily pickup any new graphics engine, then it might even seem fun to explore different takes on the same old concepts.  It&#39;s like hearing a new band in your favorite genre.As for attributing burnout as the core issue here, I would strongly disagree with this idea.  When teaching undergrads I noticed immediately that a good portion of each student cohort was basically there because they were interested in making money in the future rather than exploring the ideas of computer science.  They were no doubt going to get frustrated or bored and move into management or some other profession rather than continue to expand as an engineer.  This is totally fine, and they are probably richer for having learned what they did, but I don&#39;t know why we can&#39;t just see this and appreciate it for what it is rather than portraying it as the drama of burnout."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A fascinating premise, and matches what I saw as an engineering director. The best just get bored and move on.I think many teams are unaware how much extra value is possible by retaining existing employees vs hiring new ones. Each year I&#39;d try to make sure I was &#34;making them an offer they couldn&#39;t refuse&#34; with new interesting challenges, new tech, plenty of personal research time, as much pay increase as I could possibly give, etc. A lot of engineering managers think that it&#39;s no big deal to just hire new staff, but even going from average turnover of two years to three years is an massive improvement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is no shortage of swe. What I see and what I have experienced first hand is that companies, especially the more hyped/small ones, pretend to be FAANG and gets very picky when interviewing. They often employ FAANG style interview.Now, if I really have to spend that much time prepping to interview at your unprofitable company (that most likely will go under) don’t you think that I would try my best to work at faang instead ?As matter of fact, I was rejected at plenty of these small insignificant companies, but end up having offers as L6 at FAANG.Be humble and you will find plenty of good engineers out there.I know tons of good swe that don’t want to interview/ work at mega FAANG, and if I was running a business I would definitely try to attract those talents by being different. Offering a “normal and reasonable” interview process along with better perks, flexibility and wfh.Instead, they all want to run bizzilion of micro services in k8s"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At this point in history, if anyone honestly thinks that maximizing shareholder value is a good highest goal for a corporation, they are just blind.It&#39;s clear in situations like this to see that the only reason Amazon is doing this is for power and money, and probably just money.If we want to survive another 100 years, corporations have be brought to heel somehow, and if that means legislation to curtail stock buy backs instead of re-investment, or altering what fiduciary responsibility means to include the wellbeing of employees, not just  shareholders, I&#39;m fine with that.But this current system is taking us nowhere good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The returns that capital demands (and the government obliges to) are ultimately unsustainable. That&#39;s the core problem here.Rising wages? There has been no meaningful real increase in wages in 40 years despite a massive increase in productivity. Profits keep going up and up. The expectations for profits keep going up. The problem here is that the people who make companies possible don&#39;t get to share in the proceeds of what they contribute to.Rising wages and lower profits would actually represent in workers actually getting an actual real increase in wages and getting a greater share in the fruits of their labor. But no, that&#39;s unacceptable. We have to raise prices to maintain the profits and effectively erode those wage increases.The real failure here is the government.Take rising energy prices. The government could take action to hasten development of existing leases and/or restrict the export of refined petroleum products. Oil hasn&#39;t gotten more expensive to produce. Oil and gas companies are simply raking in massive profits.What we actually need is a system like Norway where we don&#39;t simply give away natural resources like this for private investors to profit off. At least in Norway, the government is making a ton of revenue from the increased prices, which it can direct back to people who need it.Housing? Shelter is or should be a human right. What we&#39;re allowing to happen here through investors buying up housing stock (and jacking up the prices), second homes, AirBnB and so on has reached the point of being a human rights violation IMHO. Also those skyrocketing rents do even more to erode the income of particularly lower income people to keep them living paycheck to paycheck.This is modern serfdom in action. The government acts at the behest of the capital-owning class regardless of party and part of that is having a compliant labor pool. This is turning into the West&#39;s version of Pakistan&#39;s brick kilns.After going into massive debt for college, having to pay a huge amount for your car, gas and rent and so on, you&#39;re absolutely showing up to work. That&#39;s the point.A budget shortfall is built into your existence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can argue either side to this, and make a good case.My personal preference is to trigger a recession and reduce inflation. The easy cop-out solution is to say a &#34;big f*ck off&#34; to pensioners, lower middle class, and poor people and let inflation soar, but I believe that long term this would be more destructive to the general economy. Better take the long term view here and not kick the can down the street."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prediction higher interest rates will reverse the following trends:* Private car leases at near zero interest rate will stop. At one point it was sometime cheaper to lease than to buy a car for cash* Housing bubble. Near zero central bank/bank interest rates has inflated a housing bubble. Higher interest rates will decrease housing prices since fewer buyers will be able to afford higher interest mortages.* Tech bubble. Cheap interest has also funded some startups with non viable long term business ideas* Electric scooter rental companies. There will be fewer electric scooters since the interest rate to lease them will be higher. Electric scooter rental companies will afford fewer scooters.* Less investment companies buying up farmland. It will be more expensive to finance these deals* High leverage tech stocks over schiller p/e 15 rate will deflate.* There was no exponential startups growing forever. There was however debt growing an exponential rate. The world is still linear.
Linear power production.* Graphic cards for gaming will be more available for gamers again. Reason crypto currency mining will decrease deflate by higher interest rate not flowing as much into crypto.* Tech bubble less tech startups will effect cloud vendor footprint. Fewer tech startups less need to rent cloud services."</p>
