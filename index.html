								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Built-in unit types are underrated. F# has them. Other languages should seriously consider adding them, despite the fact that feature bloat is a serious language problem and they&#39;re relatively niche: they are that useful, and I honestly don&#39;t think they would interfere much with other features.Something like:    unit type Meters = m
    unit type Seconds = s

    function sleep(time: Int[s]): void

    val speed = 5.4 m/s // Type = Float[m/s]
    val distance = parseFloat(prompt(&#39;enter time&#39;)) * 1 m // Convert unitless to meters just by multiplying
    val time = distance / speed // Type = Float[s]
    print(&#34;${time}&#34;) // Prints &#34;# s&#34;
    print(&#34;${time / 1 s} seconds&#34;) // Prints &#34;# seconds&#34;

    val complexUnit = 7 * 1 lbf/in2 // 7 lbf/in2
    // != 7 psi (too hard to infer) but you can write a converter function
    function toPsi&lt;N : Numeral&gt;(value: N[lbf/in2]): N[psi] {
        return value * 1 psi*in2/lbf
    }

It requires extending number parsing, type parsing (if the brackets aren&#39;t already part e.g. in TypeScript), and extending types to support units of measurement at least if they are statically known to be subtypes of `Numeral`.Naming variables with their units doesn&#39;t solve the issue of mis-casting and using units incorrectly, and newtypes are too inconvenient (and sometimes impossible without affecting performance) so nobody uses them. Even as a very software-focused programmer I encounter units like seconds, bytes, pixels, etc. all the time, they are almost never newtypes, and I get bugs from forgetting to convert or converting incorrectly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work at a company with two database fields, speed_kmph.The documentation read &#34;speed_kmph - This field contains the travelling speed in MILES PER HOUR - please do not be confused by the name&#34;.Woo, great job guys."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Java and Kotlin have a nice Duration class. So in Kotlin you can do  delay(duration = Duration.ofMinutes(minutes = 1))

which is equivalent to  delay(timeMillis = 60_000)

Using the optional argument names here for clarity; you don&#39;t have to of course.Sticking with the JVM, a frequent source of confusion is the epoch. Is it in millis or in seconds? With 32 bit integers that has to be seconds (which will set you up for the year 2038 problem). However, Java always used 64 bit longs for tracking the epoch in milliseconds instead even before the year 2000 problem was still a thing. Knowing which you are dealing with is kind of relevant in a lot of places; especially when interfacing with code or APIs written in other languages with more 32 bit legacy.Things like network timeouts are usually in milliseconds. But how do you know this for sure? Specifying, them in seconds means that there&#39;s less risk of forgetting a 0 or something like that. So, using seconds is pretty common too. You can&#39;t just blindly assume one or the other. Even if you use the Duration class above, you&#39;d still want to put the magic number it takes as a parameter in some configuration property or constant. Those need good names too and they should include the unit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These translation issues will be familiar to anybody learning a current, very much alive language, especially if you&#39;re reading informal forums (say, Youtube comments). You have the same types of abbreviations, more-or-less voluntary misspellings and jokes or references that only make sense from a certain cultural standpoint.I&#39;m sure most foreign language students will sympathize with the very frustrating and demoralizing situation where you read a sentence, understand every single word but you still have absolutely no idea what it&#39;s trying to convey because you&#39;re missing some idiom, reference or alternative meaning of one of the words.For the English monolinguals reading this, imagine studying English and stumbling upon the sentence &#34;I fell for her&#34;, except that you only know the literal meaning of the verb &#34;to fall&#34; so while you understand the words in isolation the sentence remains completely opaque and meaningless to you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone interested in learning Sumerian, there is really nice introduction &#34;Learn to Read Ancient Sumerian&#34;[0] by J. Bowen and M. Lewis, which gives you rough ability to understand some grammar and also read cuneiform. It&#39;s extremely niche topic and I can guarantee that you&#39;ll have absolutely no use for this knowledge[1], but if you&#39;re into learning exotic languages, this can be fun. At least it was for me.[0] https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Read-Ancient-Sumerian-Introduct...[1] To some extent you can see the same cuneiform symbols in later Akkadian texts, but forget about the grammar."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Engineering is doing what you can with what you&#39;ve actually got. If what you&#39;ve actually got is an inherited tremendous ball of spaghetti css, a need to change just one thing on the page, and scant prospects for future changes in the area, then it may be good engineering to use &#34;!important&#34; to make your change over a more complex solution. This is in fact the situation I find myself in at work somewhat often, although luckily I can&#39;t recall the last time I had to use &#34;!important&#34;. But I wouldn&#39;t issue a blanket disendorsement of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think one concept that&#39;s slowly coming into focus for me is just how many  engineers want you to experience _their_ experience and spend your time reveling at how clever _their_ stuff is. As if they think you wake up and want to do CSS work.  CSS is not the goal. The website I&#39;m building isn&#39;t even the goal. The goal is to solve some problem.Everything that I have to do to solve that problem is an unfortunate (but inevitable) reality.  But let&#39;s be clear: the goal is to minimize as close to zero, how much time you have to spend doing these things.CSS, like all code, is a total liability. I want to spend as little time designing and writing it as possible. Which is why I hate CSS: it demands you know the exact current and future (hahahaha) structure of your webpage. `!important` is not some panacea, but I cackle at the ignorance of suggesting that the user is wrong for misusing it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s the source for this, I do see they&#39;re the CSS co-designer, was this requirement originally written somewhere?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience is very similar. I tried the first iterations of Gnome 3 and was very disappointed.At some point I tried Windows+WSL but that was a complete disaster.A couple of years ago I decided to try Fedora+Gnome+Wayland. It is an outstanding experience. Everything is smooth, the UI is beautiful. Now with PipeWire and Libadwaita things are getting even better. After some stagnation, the Linux desktop is gaining momentum again.There are a lot of hate comments for Gnome in this post. My advice for those reading is: Try it for yourself! Most of the haters haven&#39;t used Gnome since 2004. Just try it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is unfortunate that so many of the early comments are negative. Either Wayland is the future, or something that learns from Wayland&#39;s mistakes and leverages its ideas is. There is a really fertile field right now for experimentation in the world of compositors but I think people have been scared away by the long dark era of X Windows + binary graphics drivers. Maybe we&#39;re going to see a lot more of it on HN in the next decade?What kept me off Wayland was the screenshots thing, but the argument in favour of the idea is strong. The downside is Wayland&#39;s conception of permissions and interactions is too basic and crippled adoption for a few years but the fundamentals (blocking cross-application snooping) is going to be necessary. Operating systems have to be less trusting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had to go back to GNOME on Xorg. GNOME on Wayland won&#39;t run my 4k display at a consistent 60Hz, which results in horrible issues in games and emulators, as well as massive numbers of dropped frames in 50/60Hz videos. It is set to run at 60Hz in the display settings, but actually seems to run somewhere in the 50s.The easiest way to see this is checking the &#34;stats for nerds&#34; while watching a 60fps YouTube video and noting the persistent dropped frames. glxgears also doesn&#39;t maintain a consistent framerate.This doesn&#39;t happen in Sway, so I can only assume there is some bug in Mutter that has persisted across several versions of GNOME and Fedora. So Wayland might be great, but my experience with GNOME on it has not been."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was in Taiwan we saw Gogoro scooters in the wild.  The battery is swapped at a kiosk in a couple of minutes.  Riders pay a subscription for the scooter and access to the battery kiosk.Seems like a really great option.  I would love to have that in my city.  We have dockless bicycles and scooters but a more capable and personal option would be awesome.  I&#39;d sign up in a heartbeat.Sadly my city planners do not seem aware of motorcycles as a transportation option.  We have no laws or infrastructure to encourage them or take advantage of the benefits.  At a state level we at least get to cut ferry lines, but that seems to be the only perk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if the electric car market (i.e. Tesla) is ripe for disruption.I read the article and thought back to the demo [1] Tesla did years ago of automated battery swap.  Tesla did it as a stunt; they publicly stated that they didn&#39;t plan to market that.As a Tesla owner, I don&#39;t want battery swap as long as I am paying for the battery as part of the price of the car.  I&#39;d be worried that my brand new max-range battery would be swapped with old worn-out batteries, and I would feel like I lost value.However, on road trips, I would much prefer a 5-10 minute battery swap over supercharging (which they no longer give me for free).  The electric car experience would essentially be the same as the IC experience.If Tesla (or someone) sold me a car without a battery, and I had to buy a battery &#34;subscription&#34;, I might go for that.  I&#39;d get a huge discount off the base price of the car, and now I wouldn&#39;t be concerned about swapping since it&#39;s not my battery.  I&#39;d do my normal day-to-day as usual, and on road trips or unexpected usage, I could swap out in minutes.  I could get on board with that.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H5V0vL3nnHY

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another fan of Beyond Compare here, but I want to point out something everyone else has missed so far, which is that BC is great for comparing all sorts of files, not just code.For example, I use its &#34;Table Compare&#34; feature to compare log files from different machines, sorted by timestamp.  This lets me easily see the order of operations in a distributed system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Meld since years ago, and it&#39;s my default go-to diff viewer. The visual style they implemented helps me a lot to reason about how lines have been added or deleted from documents in the side by side comparison. Very neat!The directory contents tree diff is also really useful.I wish they made it even easier the basic case of comparing aribtrary text. Maybe it should be the default mode after opening the program, instead of having to click on a couple buttons, because I use it a lot to manually paste pieces of text. For example, logs from a server during testing, to compare what went different between runs.Another welcomed addition would be &#34;ignore masks&#34;. Some kind of regex input that could be used to quickly tell Meld which parts of the text to skip comparing. That way, comparison of log files could be made where a timestamps column would be ignored."</p>

I suppose they always made it clear that they were not going to let their investment in Starlink stop them launching competitors constellations.I am still somewhat surprised by the UK governments investment in OneWeb, I hope the strategy pays off and it becomes an important national infrastructure project. My thoughts where that it may be about providing a future proof network for the remote areas of the UK but we aren&#39;t exactly a big country so I&#39;m not convinced that&#39;s the case. The rubbish that was written about it being a route to our own GPS system after Brexit forced us to leave the Galileo program was clearly all fluff to make it sound more impressive and tie it to a post Brexit strategy in some way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Galileo too, quite likely.https://twitter.com/SciGuySpace/status/1505879400641871872 (Eric Berger / Ars Technica)- &#34;Notable: Important space officials in Germany say the best course for Europe, in the near term, would be to move six stranded Galileo satellites, which had been due to fly on Soyuz, to three Falcon 9 rockets.&#34;- &#34;This will almost certainly be resisted by France-based Arianespace. However it may ultimately be necessary because there are no Ariane 5 cores left, and the new Ariane 6 rocket is unlikely to have capacity for a couple of years.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sounds like a potentially great business clarity move:&gt; We are a B2B solution, not the indie version of YouTube‚ÄùBut this part -- bait&amp;switch, with only one week to decide or move, (if that&#39;s accurate) -- is not what you want from your B2B solution provider:&gt; ‚ÄúI was already paying $200 a year, which I think is pretty expensive,‚Äù [...] if she wanted to keep hosting her content on the site, she‚Äôd need to upgrade to a custom plan. Her quoted price: $3,500 a year. She was given a week to upgrade her content, decrease her bandwidth usage, or leave Vimeo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We have used Vimeo for some corporate clients&#39; customer facing websites.This is because Vimeo&#39;s embed offers:1) No recommendations at the end2) Customisable player controls3) Control over where it can be embedded, etc4) No adsThe downside is that they don&#39;t have much transparency over TOS / content policy removals. We had a random violation in one instance where the uploader recorded a screencast of something. Our best guess is that the system flagged it because the screens showed a UI with a user&#39;s profile and some dummy information which was likely understood to be real private information."</p>
