								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"- Scan containers and Pods for vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.- Run containers and Pods with the least privileges possible.- Use network separation to control the amount of damage a compromise can 
cause.- Use firewalls to limit unneeded network connectivity and encryption to protect 
confidentiality.- Use strong authentication and authorization to limit user and administrator 
access as well as to limit the attack surface.- Use log auditing so that administrators can monitor activity and be alerted to 
potential malicious activity.- Periodically review all Kubernetes settings and use vulnerability scans to help 
ensure risks are appropriately accounted for and security patches are applied."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some useful guidance here, although worth noting that some of it is a bit dated (k8s security can move quickly).Most notably from a scan through, they&#39;re mentioning PodSecurityPolicy, but that&#39;s deprecated and scheduled to be removed in 1.25.There will be an in-tree replacement but it won&#39;t work the same way. Out of tree open source options would be things like OPA, Kyverno, jsPolicy, k-rail or Kubewarden."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to study and focus on security a lot more and keep up with trends. After several interviews this year I realize a lot of jobs prioritize leetcode over everything else. It&#39;s pretty annoying and makes me wonder if the focus for tech works is leetcode above all else then no wonder so many companies have insecure apps and servers."</p>

Even if you&#39;re sure you will never need one or more of those features, get them all. Wifi and Bluetooth and NFC are strictly optional, and probably not worthwhile.If you need color printing, send it to a printing company. There might even be a local one. It will be done at a higher quality, with better ink and good paper, than you can do at your office or house -- unless you are big enough to utilize a whole flock of printers, or you are a professional. If you are a pro, you don&#39;t need this advice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There should be a law that states for any subscription product I should be allowed to buy a fixed-term version with no auto-renewal. In the past two days I&#39;ve had the following experiences:  * Wanted to buy a Font Awesome &#34;Pro&#34; license for their icons. The only way to do this is a 99/year subscription. Reading the fine print says that I can buy it and cancel it the next day and still have lifetime access to the version at the time of my purchase. Why make me jump through the hoops?
  * I wanted to support a writer on Substack by subscribing for a year. But I can&#39;t, I can only start a perpetual sub. So I subbed and canceled 1 day later. Then I got a &#34;why did you cancel?&#34; email. I didn&#39;t really
  * I saw a cool open source project I liked and wanted to donate. They only had a Patreon link. Patreon only has recurring subs. So I had to email them and ask for their PayPal so I could send them $100.

I really wonder how much of SaaS revenue is people who have forgotten to cancel. I would guess 25% industry-wide."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of good thoughts in here. The one I personally want everyone to take away is that most plastics are not recycled.Unless it’s glass, fibre, or aluminum, you are lying to yourself if it’s going into the blue bin.Glass-contained milk delivery seems great. Someone needs to start a company. Sure it won’t be sexy or use AI but it’s useful.I have a local co-op that delivers local produce. It’s amazing to see a pile of naked produce show up in a repurposed apple crate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s good to just delete the packages. Same goes for Android Apps in the Google Play Store or for Chrome Extensions.These compromised packages should have their page set to a read-only mode with downloads/installs disabled, with a big warning that they were compromised.This is specially troublesome with Chrome Extensions and Android Apps, where it is not possible to get to know if I actually had the extension installed, and if I had, what it was exactly about.Chrome Extensions getting automatically removed from the browser instead of permanently deactivated with a hint of why they can&#39;t be activated again, and which was the reason why the extension got disabled, is a problem for me. How do I know if I had a bad extension installed, if personal data has been leaked?This also applies to PyPI to some degree.----Eventually the downloads should get replaced with a module which, when loaded, prints out a well defined warning message and calls sys.exit() with a return code which is defined as a &#34;vulnerability exception&#34; which a build system can then handle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why our build systems don’t use public repositories directly, and why we always pin to an exact version. Any third party dependencies (js/python/java/c/you-name-it) are manually uploaded to our Artifactory server- which itself has no internet access. All third party libraries are periodically checked for new versions, any security announcements etc, and only if we are happy do we update the internal repo.It has been a bit of a challenge, especially with js &amp; node and quite literally thousands of dependencies for a single library we want to use. In such cases we try avoid the library or look for a static/prepackaged version, but even then I don’t feel particularly comfortable.I should really start specifying checksums too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems to me like one low hanging fruit to make a lot of these kinds of exploits significantly more difficult is protection at a language level about which libraries are allowed to make outgoing HTTP requests or access the file system. It would be great if I could mark in my requirements.txt that a specific dependency should not be allowed to access the file system or network, and have that transitively apply to everything it calls or eval()&#39;s. Of course, it would still be possible to make malware that exfiltrates data through other channels, but it would be a lot harder.I am not aware of any languages or ecosystems that do this, so maybe there&#39;s some reason this won&#39;t work that I&#39;m not thinking of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To chime in with my own anecdotal opinion that is likely to anger some people... in my experience most developers do their best work after about 6-8 months of starting a job at a new company, and that comes to an end after about 24-36 months of working at the same company. After that the vast majority of people just stagnate, get complacent, the job stops being interesting to them and they move on.After observing this I don&#39;t really mind hiring people to work for 2-3 years and then have them move on to another role, and most people I hire I do so with the expectation that I&#39;ll get a good two years of work and not much more.A very small percentage of people continue to improve over the long term, and those people I am happy to continue increasing their pay, but I don&#39;t really go out of my way to retain employees and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly worth it to do so.This blog post mentions a kind of impact based compensation structure, and while I can respect the idea behind it, I am skeptical that they&#39;ve managed to find a deterministic and impartial way of measuring &#34;impact&#34;. I don&#39;t presume to have such a system so I pay based on what I observe in the market and let the market decide what the value is of software developers. For example, I genuinely don&#39;t know if software developers have more of an impact than the product designers, or the legal department even though I pay software developers much much more. What I do know is that it&#39;s much easier for me to hire a competent lawyer or UX designer than it is to hire a competent software developer and there are many more competent lawyers and designers out there... so I pay them less, regardless of whatever objective measure of impact may exist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t really understand this article, or the current trend of job hopping. I&#39;m from the generation where you have one job, maybe two, and that&#39;s it: I&#39;ve had 7, but I really only ever wanted one good job.For some perspective: when I left Intel circa 2010, I was a Senior Staff Engineer fighting to get promoted to Principal Engineer (followed by Senoir Principal, then Fellow, then Senior Fellow, hahaha). FYI I loved Intel for the first 10 years, and hated the last 12.I made $130k base salary, $70k typical bonus (EB+ECBP), and stock options (most of which were worthless). This was after over two decades there, started in &#39;88.Recently, a friend (12 years younger than me) was hired by Intel to work in one of the ML groups. He asked if the starting salary was fair: they offered him $400k. I was angry, jealous, and shocked. I have friends that are STILL there, grinding away at sub-200k base salary after nearly 30 years, and they are too scared to leave.So this idea of coders flitting from job to job just seems so alien to me. I&#39;m obviously from a different generation. I don&#39;t even know what I would ask for pay if I ever left consulting. Headscratcher."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are several factors:1. Organizations will often see bumping up an employee&#39;s pay to match another offer as some variant of extortion and it&#39;s they view this as disloyal. Never mind that the other offer clearly shows they&#39;re now below market. I didn&#39;t say it makes sense;2. There is friction in changing jobs and companies and people will generally have a threshold for making that jump (eg they won&#39;t switch for less than a 20% raise). So over the entire pool of employees it&#39;s cheaper to let a few go than give everyone a raise when many wouldn&#39;t leave;3. Companies have a philosophy that you do the job you get promoted to first and then you get promoted to it and paid subsequently. Worse, often it takes time for things like equity to catch up. You may get a discretionary grant when you get promoted or you might not. And it can take years of annual refreshes to get to the total comp off a new hire at the same level;4. Organizations seem to make the standards higher for existing rather than new employees. I think this is in part to avoid level and compensation inflation;5. Up to a certain point there is an expectation of growth. Some of this is formal (eg up to T5 at Google).  Some of it is more informal. They make the determination that even though you&#39;re at a terminal level and that&#39;s fine, if you&#39;ve been there for years you&#39;re probably not going any higher so you won&#39;t be one of their future leaders or stars; and6. Diversity. Tech companies have explicit goals around having certain minorities essentially over-represented compared to the demographics of, say, CS graduates. I guarantee you such explicit goals create perverse incentives that extend to how they handle retention."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a bit of a story behind this. Oculus is owned by Facebook, but the Facebook website and the Oculus headsets/software are by different teams working in different states. When Facebook bought Oculus, they decided to get rid of the Oculus-specific account system and use only Facebook accounts. The Facebook account requirement took effect with the launch of the Oculus Quest 2, which launched in October 2020.October 2020 was the month before the US election, and the peak of both disinformation/influence campaigns, and of Facebook-the-website&#39;s efforts to combat those campaigns. So the spambot detector sensitivity was turned up to max that month, and if you tried to create a new account, there was a large chance you&#39;d be mistaken for a bot and banned immediately. So a bunch of people who weren&#39;t Facebook users got fancy new VR headsets, tried to create Facebook accounts in order to be able to use them, and got immediately banned. The support department for Facebook-the-website was not at all up to the task of dealing with this. This kind of wrecked their product launch; instead of the press coverage and public reaction being about how great their hardware was, it was about all the people who couldn&#39;t use their hardware because of account issues.So now Oculus has a completely separate support department for Facebook account issues, which acts less like it&#39;s supporting a free website and more like it&#39;s supporting a $300 piece of hardware. And if you have an account issue with the website, and you want to use that support department instead of the bad one, then buying a Quest 2 is not such a bad idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FB had an internal help system called &#34;Oops&#34;. It was meant for employees to get help for friends they knew in real life. It was discontinued not long ago (EDIT: maybe not according to a child comment). There were just too many requests for help.Facebook has a corporate structure that simply will not prioritize any effort longer than 6 months unless a senior company executive (Mark, Sheryl) supports it. Even if it affects the bottom line - and there were plenty of examples where large customers could not spend significantly more money with Facebook because of software bugs - they won&#39;t do anything about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Utility services start off as luxuries, and are private and unregulated.  This was true with telephone and electric companies.  When these services get to a certain point where there are real consequences for not being able to access the system, they need to have public regulation to ensure access and customer service.  ISP internet service has definitely reached this point, and I think that there&#39;s a strong argument that Google &amp; FB accounts (particularly for businesses) have reached this point as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is more than a privacy disaster. It is so far so vaguely worded (maybe deliberately?) that the government can target everyone in the ecosystem with penalties:While the language is still evolving, the proposal would seek to expand the definition of “broker” under section 6045(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include anyone who is “responsible for and regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets” on behalf of another person. These newly defined brokers would be required to comply with IRS reporting requirements for brokers, including filing form 1099s with the IRS. That means they would have to collect user data, including users’ names and addresses.The broad, confusing language leaves open a door for almost any entity within the cryptocurrency ecosystem to be considered a “broker”—including software developers and cryptocurrency startups that aren’t custodying or controlling assets on behalf of their users. It could even potentially implicate miners, those who confirm and verify blockchain transactions. The mandate to collect names, addresses, and transactions of customers means almost every company even tangentially related to cryptocurrency may suddenly be forced to surveil their users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anybody who has followed cryptocurrency in the last year knows that major US financial institutions and hedge funds have become heavily involved. The regulations coming are entirely to do with making the legal burdens of individual custody onerous enough that users place their coins on completely centralized exchanges to manage legal risk, all so these institutions have access to these coins for manipulation purposes like borrowing for shorting. The ONLY regulation you will see is on the average user so they can suck up coins like Daniel Plainview drinking your milkshake, NOT on market manipulation or trading habits of institutions which is the key driver of malicious activity and harm in the cryptocurrency space."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The downsides listed are just cryptocurrency lobbyist talking points.“Require new surveillance of everyday users of cryptocurrency;”What everyday users? There’s nothing you can do with this stuff except speculate, gamble and build obfuscated Ponzis.”Force software creators and others who do not custody cryptocurrency for their users to implement cumbersome surveillance systems or stop offering services in the United States;”Not offering these services seems like a positive outcome.”Create more honeypots of private information about cryptocurrency users that could attract malicious actors;”Losing your money to malicious actors is a standard part of the crypto experience already. Endless scams and ransomware don’t seem to worry the author.”Create more legal complexity to developing blockchain projects or verifying transactions in the United States—likely leading to more innovation moving overseas.”Ah, blockchain innovation, which is somehow so vital to the shining future of mankind, yet has utterly failed to produce anything of technological or economic value with the billions already invested. Overseas sounds like a fine place to continue this pseudoinnovation charade."</p>

Because security personnel are delegated enforcement authority, instant challenges to them are treated as breaches of security; challenges can only be made administratively, even though the act of enforcement can change the fact situation sufficiently to render the administrative challenge impossible or moot (ie people give up because pursuing the administrative route is often not worth the trouble).The security officer&#39;s dilemma is that doing their job requires them to not think very much about what they are asked to do. If they begin to have thoughts of their own about what is ethical or not and decline to assist an authority figure who asks them to do something unethical, then they risk loss of their security status and are suddenly treated as a security problem themselves. It&#39;s int he interest of authority figures to excuse and cover for minor lapses of security officer behavior so that when the authority figure wants something illegitimate, they have leverage over their security apparatus. Overly scrupulous security personnel don&#39;t get promoted.It&#39;s worth considering that a high portion of our economy is based on the use of guard labor (not including regular law enforcement) and that this may have or perpetuate distorting economic effects: https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Economics/Faculty/Glenn_Lo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because my engagement with unions has only been positive, I am interested in the amazing number of people who seem motivated to say how negatively they feel about unions. I get that in an oppositional sense, if you don&#39;t want what a union wants, then they tend to cast into the bad, but for the middle ground who are not VCs, owners, Managers, and are candidates for union membership, I find it really strange how much people cast them into a class of &#34;money grabbers for no benefit&#34;Do people feel the same about life insurance, car insurance? Its not that you actually intend being harrassed or sacked (fall ill, have a car accident) It&#39;s that you don&#39;t want to find yourself on the wrong side of an employment dispute (accident claim) without some insurance.Unions may be taking your hard earned money. They may be doing things which you don&#39;t like (do I love my car insurance company?) But, they have a neccessary role in risk management.We talk about risk management in the ICT sector all the time. Why can&#39;t we talk about risk management for labour hire?Amazon used &#34;dirty tricks&#34; to win this election. I am sure the Union bust some minor rules too, but overall I am reasonably confident that the vote was neither free, nor fair. I also do think there is no latent 100% pro-union vote out there, and that a large number of the polled workers don&#39;t want a union, or the cost of the union, or the risk of jobloss from Amazon if they join the union (which is illegal but still has a risk of happening) -So I don&#39;t for a minute believe a re-vote will magically reverse the signal with an overwhelming result.What interests me, is the basis for opposition to the union in the first place. Do people really think the garment workers in  New York were backing the wrong horse? Do people think the machineguns which Ford arranged to turn on a union march in Detroit didn&#39;t happen?&#34;oh, that would never happen now...&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s impossible for me to have a positive view of Amazon (the company) at this point. There&#39;s way too much evidence pointing to the contrary."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congratulations to the Vue team, this is definitely a big win for them.Reading through the RFC is really interesting. They specifically call out the dependency on Facebook as effectively being React&#39;s Single Point of Failure, citing their negative experiences with HHVM.And for all of the love that people give React&#39;s big shifts (like hooks), the RFC specifically counts this against them, given that best practices have shifted so drastically in the last few years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d clap harder if Vue weren&#39;t so desperate to become React and focus on their own strengths. React certainly appealed to a lot of devs who at best disliked working with HTML &amp; CSS, but Vue welcomed everyone with an excellent gentle slope to gently move devs away from direct Dom manipulation and embrace reactive paradigms. Folks with small shops could now refactor their codebases with relative ease.If only the Vue team could understand, we don&#39;t want React features. We&#39;ll use React when we want them. We want Vuejs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like I&#39;m in an alien world when it comes to Vue - it has this weird pattern of making strings do loads of heavy lifting.The Github Commits[1] example on their documentation has a load of stuff that just doesn&#39;t sit right with me.Things like    v-for=&#34;record in commits&#34;

to loop over something is insane to me - this isn&#39;t code, this is a string inside a html attribute! How can you get any sort of good type analysis/variable checking/syntax highlighting inside this?Similarly, accessing properties like    :href=&#34;record.html_url&#34;

has the exact same issues - what if there&#39;s a typo here? My IDE can&#39;t highlight that this is wrong because it&#39;s *not code* and is just a string.Maybe I&#39;m just the odd one out here, but vue (and angular) love to use strings as a makeshift programming language, which to me is a major smell.^[1]: https://v3.vuejs.org/examples/commits.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"China is not &#34;smashing its tech industry&#34;. It&#39;s cracking down on private Internet companies that acquired too much power through network effects. This is completely consistent with CCP doctrine. Anything that central has to be state-owned.Xi declared this year that while digitization is important, “we must recognize the fundamental importance of the real economy… and never deindustrialize.” Right. China, remember, has a national industrial policy. It&#39;s expressed in the national 5 year plan, which is taken seriously and used to set priorities.What those priorities are is no secret. The current 5 year plan, the 14th, lists them.[1] Specific technology goals are in blue boxes.  Semiconductors, gas turbines, biotech, new energy vehicles, robotics, advanced agricultural equipment. Internet services are mentioned in the Plan. One key line section out here: &#34;We will strengthen the economic supervision of internet platforms in accordance with laws and regulations, clarify platform enterprise positioning and regulatory rules, improve the laws and regulations concerning the identification of monopolies, and crack down on monopolies and unfair competition. ... We will intensify anti-monopoly and anti-unfair competition law enforcement and judicial efforts and prevent the disorderly expansion of capital.&#34;If you think this isn&#39;t to be taken seriously, go back and look at the 13th 5 year plan and check off the completed items.[1] https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/t0284_14th_Fi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; China may simply see things differently. It’s possible that the Chinese government has decided that the profits of companies like Alibaba and Tencent come more from rents than from actual value addedExcellent observation, and I hope, for China&#39;s sake, that this is the reason.The United States is likely in for a long-term rude awakening when it finally realizes that an economy predicated on negative-value-add activities like clicking heart icons on photos, repackaging financial securities into products with impossible-to-detangle risk profiles, advertisement and addiction optimization, and political outrage, will not remain any definition of &#34;global superpower&#34; for long.Facebook and Netflix are excellent examples of companies that contribute greatly to our GDP whilst simultaneously draining our reserves of actual capital and mental health."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There are certainly those in America who believe that Facebook and Google produce little of value relative to the profit they rake in; maybe China’s leaders, for reasons that will remain forever opaque to us, have simply reached the same conclusion.Arguably, capturing most of your country&#39;s top talent with absurd salaries and putting them to work on world-critical challenges like... how to generate more revenue from advertisement or... how to create as many &#34;phone-addicts&#34; as possible... could be quantified as producing tons and tons of negative value.If China&#39;s crackdown on &#34;consumer-facing tech&#34; is about this, that could be a very good thing for China long term.I grew up wanting to work on NASA and putting stuff on space, and during university got offered 10x the NASA salaries at FAANG companies, and was to week to just say &#34;no thanks&#34;.10 years later I am starting to wonder what my legacy is going to be."</p>
