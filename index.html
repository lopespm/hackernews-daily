								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bummer. I often use like vs dislike ratios as a gauge on whether a video is worth watching. If I see a 3,000 up / 48 down video on a topic I&#39;m interested in there&#39;s a really good chance the video is great.I&#39;m a small time creator (~13.5k subs) and don&#39;t care at all about upvotes or downvotes being public. There&#39;s only been a handful of videos out of hundreds that received more downvotes than expected because the video was posted on a place out of my control and folks didn&#39;t like that. Almost always if a video naturally gets downvoted it&#39;s because you either released something bad or unrelated to what your channel normally expects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a damned shame. I use dislikes to gauge if a video is relevant to the topic at hand.For example, I like fixing stuff and use Youtube for unfamiliar items. Often videos with a high number of dislikes are Spam (usually a bot reading text from some website), Videos where the person handwaves through the steps, videos where the fix is improper, or videos where the creator spends more time monetizing than working through the problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So just to make sure I&#39;m reading this correctly (this is not my area of speciality so bear with me):This is Apple-hosted MDM, yes?I took a brief spin through this world on a consulting project a few years ago and I found it SUPER weird that Apple didn&#39;t do this already.  You had to do this weird dance between Apple Business Manager and the MDM solution (we ended up with SimpleMDM but looked at a bunch).  I kept saying &#34;Am I missing something?  Why doesn&#39;t this service come directly from Apple?&#34; and everyone was as puzzled about this as I was.  So I guess they&#39;re finally closing the loop here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Smart play to focus on businesses with fewer than 500 employees, as those are the most likely to grow in the next 3-7 years into larger accounts, and they don&#39;t have the 12-18mo sales cycle and shennanigans of an enterprise.It&#39;s a strategic departure from being a consumer luxury product company, and the shift to enterprise suggests they&#39;re out of ideas, but at the rate they&#39;re losing consumer growth I&#39;d say they&#39;ve still got another 150 years.
Leveraging the apple store as a service point is a huge deal, as it may compensate for the additional hardware premium their products cost.I&#39;ve worked in a large number of organizations as a consultant and the microsoft ecosystem is basically unusuable to me now. Between performance issues and thoughtless design, I switch back to my apple devices to do simple things and get real feedback from actions while I&#39;m waiting for the microsoft platform to respond. As a result, I manage client work on MSFT, and do real work on my mac. With Apple getting into this space, I can&#39;t see buying another microsoft product unless I actually hated the people I was hiring to use it.The essence of the apple experience is that by their products being designed to be responsive no matter what, you are always engaged and working on them for the feedback, whereas some MSFT error message means I&#39;m going to go do something else for 15-20m while I get past the gumption trap. Current one is having to reboot the machine to reset a VPN driver just to check client site email. MSFTs problem  isn&#39;t from lack of a solution, it&#39;s that the problem exists at all and as a user I am even aware of it.I have lots of issues with Apple&#39;s social decisions, and am switching out of their ecosystem because of it so I&#39;m not an uncritical fan, however, this announcement means they aren&#39;t just getting into enterprise, they&#39;re getting upstream of it and in 10-20 years they will have replaced a lot of it. They&#39;re dropping in on a macro trend wave that is how work itself is going to be different."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The challenge for Apple is going to be their unwillingness to integrate with others. Business Manager only integrates with MS Azure Active Directory for IAM. The vast majority of small business do not have Azure Active Directory. They either have nothing, or they have Google Workspace.Apple needs to not just launch a competitor for AD. They need to properly support integrated directory services with a broader range of systems.Aside from that, they don&#39;t have an endpoint security solution, which is a necessary part of this package, ultimately, if they care going to replace JAMF, who is the real target/loser here.If Apple can do those two things... well... I&#39;d switch in a heartbeat. Why? Well, their support story is going to be way better than JAMF. Also, I hate having multiple vendors when I can have just one.For those saying that Apple has no room left to grow... I expect this isn&#39;t the end of this for Apple going after business users. They need to roll Claris into the mix, stop acting like Numbers is a spreadsheet, and finally launch a cloud platform.There&#39;s many billions for them to make here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"First thing I did when I first read the story was check my editor. I already had the &#34;Zero Width Characters locator&#34; plugin installed, but that covered less than a handful of specific space character type codes.Still, the result was good: Looks like IDEA editors like Webstorm show invisible characters with colored background and a warning.My test was from that first article and also now from this one copy the example code they contained or linked to from the browser into an open file.Screenshot: https://i.imgur.com/ColuRNB.png"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey, you have missed U+FFA0 HALFWIDTH HANGUL FILLER which has about the same property as U+3164 HANGUL FILLER!Surely I expected this coming ever since I&#39;ve seen the purported Trojan &#34;attack&#34;, as the Hangul fillers are pretty much the only characters that are (X)ID_Start and have no visible glyphs [1]. If (X)ID_Continue is also considered ZWJ and ZWNJ would be another contenders. Attacks using those characters have much better chance than the Trojan &#34;attack&#34;, but you need a very specific code to execute the attack. It should be obvious that a typical coding convention easily prevents them.As much like the purported Trojan &#34;attack&#34;, this kind of attacks need a better code review and tooling. You don&#39;t need to remove non-ASCII identifiers from existing languages: they have their uses when an entirety of your team speak languages not using Latin script. But you should be able to catch a new use of non-ASCII characters throughout your code base and compare that with your expectation.[1] The Hangul filler comes from a legacy mechanism of KS X 1001 for unencoded Hangul syllables (it had only 2,350 out of 11,172 modern syllables). The half-width Hangul filler probably comes from a duplicate encoding of the filler in the IBM code page 933 to ensure round-trip conversion. Both are never used in practice, except for probably the Hangul filler that was briefly implemented by Mozilla and removed due to the compatibility issue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;d be really awesome if microprocessors, even at a low-end process node like 130 nm, could be made with room-sized machines or smaller. There&#39;s a lot of space for companies wanted to manufacture their own MCUs, for instance, without relying on massive supply chains.I think this&#39;ll happen at some point, as silicon manufacturing hits final roadblocks and becomes increasingly commoditized, but it&#39;d be nice if it were sooner rather than later.(This would be nice for self-sufficient decentralized communities being able to produce their own microelectronics as well.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apple and Google transformed mobile into a poisonous experience. Apart from being constantly spied, you don&#39;t get to decide what you can do with your own device. You can&#39;t install software unless is approved by them and if it is, you have to also pay them.As a developer, if you target iOS and Android your app should not compete with their apps, you have to get it approved and you have to get them a 30% cut for nothing.Why can&#39;t installing software on mobiles work exactly like on desktop?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few things people seem to be missing in this thread:- This ruling doesn&#39;t allow for supplanting IAPs, as the it only prevents Apple from prohibiting external links to alternatives. So apps still aren&#39;t allowed to have in-app payment alternatives, they can have a link to something else, and AFAICT they can still mandate an IAP option should be present if the app has such a link, like they do with &#34;Sign in with Apple&#34;.- If that sounds familiar, that&#39;s because it is: this isn&#39;t too far off from the agreement Apple reached with the JFTC that allowed &#34;reader apps&#34; (think Netflix, Kindle, Spotify) to have a link to an external website to set up user accounts: https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/09/japan-fair-trade-comm...- This is extremely unlikely to hurt Apple&#39;s profit margins all that much, because the judge also rules that Apple was entitled to a licensing fee, which it could still claim for payments made outside Apple&#39;s IAP system. This point is probably why Apple is fighting the ruling, because with external links they might have to put a lot of effort into getting their cut, as opposed to what Google did with their payment alternatives - i.e. adding a &#34;service fee&#34; to in app transactions but allowing alternative payment services. (This might not apply to the exception carved out for &#34;reader apps&#34;)Essentially, nobody wins. Even in the best case scenario, Apple will probably keep a significant portion (but not all) of its cut, developers still have to pay through the nose and users will probably stick with Apple&#39;s IAP if the provider can&#39;t make a significant difference, and can&#39;t sideload apps that the App Store won&#39;t allow. Yay!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wonder how someone could get this ruling applied to Google Play...In other news, I spent some time this month implementing monthly billing subscriptions.  Stripe was easy and I could rapidly test almost every scenario (cancellations, deferments, non payment,el etc).  Apple and Google?  Good luck, you basically have to test in production to figure out all the corner cases for your users.As a solo dev, being able to choose my payment processor would let me focus on delivering real features and value instead of app store toil."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The current state of the Windows Store is a holdover from the early 2010&#39;s where &#34;number of apps in our app store&#34; became a huge KPI and something for the CEO to tout to the board of directors. Apple and Google kept bragging about these numbers at their respective developer conferences/yearly refresh unveilings and therefore Microsoft was all too happy to accept any and all apps into the Windows Store at the time in an attempt to appear relevant.Times have changed, though, and you could argue that now many people would like less app clutter and easier discoverability of the apps they actually want. What end user is benefitting from all these carpetbagger apps squatting on Firefox&#39;s brand? I don&#39;t know what the policy or action looks like to clean this up without instituting heavy hand moderation of the Windows Store but I feel like something has to be done.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve gone down this rabbitole before, and yes, there are things that take two hours, and there are things that take a lot more. The problem is the scope - ie. are you trying to do what you said you&#39;ll do (miniature software to log urls), or are you adding 100s of requirements to the scope (gui, filters, privacy,...).We had a bunch of .xml files containing some data, and someone wanted a .csv file... sure, an hour max, and it&#39;s done. Fire up some perl, loop, xml-&gt;hash, take the data needed, print line by line, done... less than an hour.&#34;Hey, can you add just this and that, and separate folders for this and a total and rolling sum?&#34;...yeah sure... hour or two.&#34;and this and that?&#34;...sure, another hour...&#34;Can this be made for that department to use.. just add a simple gui&#34;...and we&#39;ve gone from an hour or two, to weeks or months of work.  Nobody wanted a gui application made for &#34;normal users&#34;, with all the checks and verifications and documentation and everything when you made a request... the scope was a simple one-off script, and that actually took an hour or two.  This is like requesting a bicycle, than wanting to add a hitch for a boat trailer and making it higway-legal. And the added problem is, that your script never intended to do &#34;all of this&#34;, and you either have to rewrite it from scratch, or you software looks like &#34;the Burrow&#34; (from harry potter)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’d point out this isn’t a problem with estimation per se but with requirement gathering.  The students didn’t press him for more specific requirements before offering an estimate.  The real challenge though comes when the customer doesn’t know their requirements.  They legitimately think they “just want a simple app to record urls”, but actually want all the other things listed.  The thing that sets good developers apart is being able to tease out those requirements without being a jerk or making legitimately simple requests overly complicated, then deliver."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I’ve often wondered why, in a poor country where women work as hard as men to feed their children, feminine softness is so highly prized. As for me, I no longer consider it a valuable attribute.Isn&#39;t this its own answer?  It&#39;s prized precisely because it is unattainable for most."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, what a beautiful piece of writing. The sayings from that period, the weaving of &#34;recipes&#34;, and the little girl&#39;s mindset add a lot of color to this piece."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a good read. Gonna have to keep an eye out for her memoir. There&#39;s starting to be a flourishing of SE Asian voices with Viet Thanh Nguyen and Ocean Vuong. I hope more come, especially more women. Hopefully more cinema too; it&#39;d be wonderful to have responses to the America centric and sympathetic portrayals of Vietnam."</p>
