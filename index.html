								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is great to see this happen.It&#39;s also fascinating that the crux of the Apple&#39;s case against NSO hinges on NSO engineers that accepted iCloud&#39;s terms and conditions.From related NYT article:&gt;The sample of Pegasus gave Apple a forensic understanding of how Pegasus worked. The company found that NSO’s engineers had created more than 100 fake Apple IDs to carry out their attacks. In the process of creating those accounts, NSO’s engineers would have had to agree to Apple’s iCloud Terms and Conditions, which expressly require that iCloud users’ engagement with Apple “be governed by the laws of the state of California.”The clause helped Apple bring its lawsuit against NSO in the Northern District of California.https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/23/technology/apple-nso-grou..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The framing of NSO as &#34;state-sponsored&#34; cannot be overstated, and Apple didn&#39;t miss the chance to do just that.A hard blow to Israel&#39;s policy just as much as it is to NSO itself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I always thought stuff like this happened to OTHER founders, but would never happen to me. But my board fired me six months after closing our series A.The advice in this article is 100% spot on. I didn&#39;t know any of this. I was totally focused on building my company. But if you raise money you can&#39;t do that anymore. 50% of your time will always be occupied with working on your next round of funding or managing your board of directors.I noticed super early that VCs were not &#34;helpful&#34; at all like they had claimed during the fundraising process.So I got fired, and I thought, &#34;well, at least I still have my founders stock!&#34;Then a year after I got fired the series A investor led the next round of funding and decided to value the company at $0, so I got diluted by 99.99%. Sounds illegal, right? Well, it probably was, but what am I going to do about it? They have billions of dollars and I had no money.I just let it go and started something new - bootstrapping of course. On the bright side, the new CEO ran the company into the ground. Meanwhile my new company is doing well and I love my job.Anyway, do what this guy says to manage your board and just plan on being fired at some point if you raise VC money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is something you should really understand if you&#39;re starting a company. The board isn&#39;t your &#34;friend&#34; while individual board members may be, as an entity it probably isn&#39;t. The understanding that individuals can be &#34;good&#34; and the composite can be &#34;bad&#34; is usually encountered by most people when some government is doing something &#34;bad&#34; but the people who live where that government is in power are known to be &#34;good.&#34; We see a lot of companies that have &#34;good&#34; employees but act in a &#34;bad&#34; way as a company.So with that in mind, you have to understand that none of your &#34;friends&#34; would fire you, but the &#34;board of directors&#34; (even if composed of people you consider friends) could easily decide to do that.Tom Lyon used to joke that it was only on your third startup that you funded yourself that you are really in control. The wisdom of that took a while to sink in for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It may be gauche to express this opinion on HN of all places and I hope it doesn&#39;t come off as tonedeaf disrespect, but does anybody notice VC is falling out of favor unless absolutely necessary?I am noticing a lot of bootstrappers that are emerging with the ethos that VC isn&#39;t what it used to be for some markets, and often a poor choice of the right VC can be a detriment to a project&#39;s longevity, with some teams choosing to avoid it at all costs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The rapid, long-lasting and highly noticeable cosmetic effects made Botox a near instant success. In small doses, the same nerve damage that causes fatal paralysis in poisoning cases, helps to remove forehead creases and crow’s feet, with the only side effects being an inability to express emotion using your face,…ironic that many celebrities who publicly advocated a clean living, chemical-free lifestyle, were also early adopters of a treatment that involves injecting the deadliest substance on earth into your face (looking at you, Paltrow). If any of them were surprised at this seeming paradox, they certainly didn’t show it.Loved the subtle irony here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The lethal dose when consumed orally is around 30 billionths of a gram, which if you want a relatable comparison, is about the same as if you cut a single poppy seed into ten thousand equal pieces and ate one of them. It is an amount so tiny, it really doesn’t make sense.That&#39;s right - it makes no sense. How could such a small amount of anything do enough damage to shut down your entire body? According to wikipedia, it works by &#34;cleaving key proteins required for nerve activation&#34;. Unless there&#39;s some self-replication mechanism, how does that even work?edit: I went and did the math. At an LD of 30 nanograms, that&#39;s about 1.2 billion actual molecules of this stuff to die. I guess that&#39;s enough to shut down a sufficient number of nerves that you just can&#39;t function anymore.The math: lethal dose / per molecule weight (molar mass / avogadro)(3.0e-10) / (149323.05 / 6.0221409e+23) = 1209888406.377984"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can someone genuinely explain to the the desire/interest to use HTMX/Hotwire/LiveView etc?I was writing web apps when rendering templated HTML views on your server was standard, and you had controller endpoints that returned HTML content, or things like Rails &#34;Unobtrusive Javascript&#34; where you had code like:  $(‘#user-list’).html(“&lt;%= j render(‘index’, users: @users) %&gt;”)

As an automatic callback to some action.Whether or not you love or hate this model of development is irrelevant, because if at some point you need to render on a client other than a browser -- you have to start from the beginning and write an API now.IE, so that your Android/iOS app in Java/Swift or whatnot, can ask your backend for data and render it using the tools available on that platform.When we turned apps into pure API&#39;s and just exchanged data with them, it opened up the ability to be platform-agnostic.I guess I don&#39;t understand why someone would choose to build an app that sends HTML over the wire instead of JSON/XML/whatever, that any client can render. All it means is that you have to write this functionality later when you want it, in addition to now having this HTML stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After reading some HTMX criticism, there&#39;s one point people seem to miss. Making HTML your application interface does *not* prevent you from having a JSON (or something else) API. If anything, it probably forces you to split your functions better. e.g:  def get_user_data(user_id: int) -&gt; Dict (JSON-looking data):
      ...

  def render_user_view(user_id: int) -&gt; HTML:
      user_data = get_user_data(user_id)
      render_template(&#34;user_detail_view.html&#34;, context=user_data)

If you need the user data in a JSON API, nothing prevents you from exposing `get_user_data` as a JSON endpoint. You can also use WebViews in a mobile app.People tend to overestimate the &#34;interactivity&#34; needs of their apps and underestimate what they can achieve by just swapping HTML. HTMX also lets you swap &#34;Out of Band&#34; [0]. This makes it easy to model more complex interactions (like &#34;reactions&#34;), for example, updating a counter somewhere else in the app when a form is submitted. Reactive frameworks can also become a Rube Goldberg machine if an app is not properly designed from the beginning. Then you start fighting rendering loops, build dependencies, components&#39; side effects, etc.Personally speaking, HTML-driven apps are not just about easy vs. hard development, it&#39;s also about your users [1]. Maybe a big React app runs fine on 8 CPU cores and 32 GB of RAM, but very often, your users just want to read some content, maybe submit a few forms, and leave. They may not want to download 2 MB of JS so that the page can render boxes with text, even more if your browser can already do that if you give it some HTML.[0] https://htmx.org/attributes/hx-swap-oob/

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree that the way modern JS (need to?) download half the Internet for a semi-useful app is annoying, wasteful and dangerous.However, I still remember the hell that was updating the state and keeping the rendering in sync with it when using jQuery. Native JS of course doesn&#39;t improve on that, and (judging by the description - no experience with it) Alpine.js doesn&#39;t either. For me, the paradigm of rendering from the internal state is what makes React (and Vue,...) useful. Too bad that npm ecosystem sucks and that everyone is inventing new shiny useless new things all the time... But React makes non-trivial single-page apps possible.Of course, if you need server-side rendering (for example because of SEO) then the equation changes, and maybe using Alpine.js makes sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be fair, as a daily user and (to some extent) app developer, in my experience Flatpaks have solved the problem of library fragmentation and app distribution on Linux.While my experience on Snaps was mostly negative (due to bugs, virtual &#34;loop disks&#34; per every app affecting the system performance, etc.), I found that Flatpak finally lets me install essentially any app on any distro.For example, the Elementary OS &#34;AppCenter&#34; apps are now available in any other distribution, thanks to the Flatpak remote. Testing daily GNOME apps has become as easy as installing their Flatpak reference, and letting them update automatically.Regarding memory, storage and power consumption:- The base runtimes (which are the heaviest bit) are downloaded only once per system, e.g., one for the KDE Plasma ecosystem, one for Elementary, and so on. The first app you install will pull them, so I do not see it as much more bloaty than having an enormous bundle of system-wide dependencies (e.g. if you install a KDE app in a primarily GNOME environment) as would happen otherwise.- Memory and CPU-wise, Flatpaks are very light containers (which do not require loop disks, or anything else) which should have almost no overhead. I never witnessed any loss of performance, at least.- Bug and crash-wise, I experienced a tremendously stable and &#34;flat&#34; experience on Flatpaks. That is, if there is a bug in one app on one distribution, the bug will exist on all, or vice versa. This is not as common as it should be in containerized app install tools, and makes debugging overall much easier.The only drawback are updates taking longer than on other platforms, probably because compressed deltas are not yet available unlike in other major package managers.With this, I don&#39;t want to describe Flatpak as a panacea in everything, but at least for GUI apps, it solved a lot of distribution fragmentation issues in my case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with all of this and... I just don&#39;t care.I download a Flatpak from the Pop OS store and it works. It installs only in my profile, so another user on the same machine doesn&#39;t have access.  You can&#39;t do that with a .deb!I&#39;ve never got into dependency hell where I need to apt-get a specific version of a library from a dodgy PPA.If I uninstall it, Flatpak doesn&#39;t leave acres of cruft strewn around my disk.I don&#39;t see how randomly installing a Flatpak is any worse for security than compiling the source myself. The permission model on Linux is far worse than Android - so I just hope for the best anyway.Snaps never worked right for me - and seemed to frequently break. But all my Flatpaks have run fine and at full speed.Does it take up more disk space? Sure. But that&#39;s a trade-off I&#39;m willing to make in order to just download and run with no extra work.Sure, there are some efficiency and security gains to be made. But I&#39;m much happier with a Flatpak world than the alternative."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a deep trend happening in software development.As the number of dependencies for building an application grows, it becomes exponentially harder to shake the tree. This used to be the role of Linux distributions, they were acting as a push-back force, asking projects to support multiple versions of C libraries. This was acceptable because there is not C package manager.Now that each language has their own package manager, the role of distributions have faded. They are even viewed as a form of nuisance by some developers. It&#39;s easier to support one fixed set of dependencies and not have to worry about backward-compatibility. This is something all distributions have been struggling with for a while now, especially with NodeJS.This trend is happening on all platforms, but is more pronounced in Linux because of the diversity of the system libraries ecosystem. On Windows and macOS, there are some SDKs the application can lean on. On Linux, the only stable &#34;SDK&#34; is the Linux kernel API."</p>

Bought one that was very close to being on the first page of Google results for a keyword related to personal finance.Did a bit of sprucing up the page, dropped a few links, and it did get on the front page for a few months, with AdSense paying me several thousands dollars a month while it lasted.  The page itself wasn&#39;t a scam per se, but it was roughly 1000 medium-effort words on the topic I wrote in a day, along with a few original photos that took another day, and a couple of inline AdSense ads.It didn&#39;t deserve to be on the first page of results.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Facebook flipped a switch, favoring comments and reactions over shares, and suddenly a food blogger from Utah became the largest publisher in the country, if not the world.&#34;While the firehose volume is disproportionate, the direction wasn&#39;t random. Whoever is copywriting these messages is an artist, drawing an outstanding number of responses. I felt the urge to react when I read them and bravely restrained myself. There&#39;s a lot of power in asking someone the right personal question."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A while back I was trying to get twitter followers.  I experimented with a few different strategies - quick reactions to big accounts I agreed with or disagreed with, saying what I thought people wanted to hear, saying what I thought would be controversial hot takes, tweeting about everything trending, etc.  I basically got no traction.  I was getting low tens of thousands of impressions a month according to the twitter analytics tool and maybe 1 or 2 new followers a month - and, to be honest, those new followers were probably bots.Eventually, I hit on a new strategy.  Instead of trying to generate good tweets I just followed people at random.  I forget the exact number, but somewhere between 15-30% of the people I followed at random would follow me back.  I realized I could probably get an arbitrary number of followers this way but it would be a pretty stupid and meaningless achievement so I quit doing it.The &#34;viral post&#34; strategy of the article, asking things like &#34;Who the heck sleeps with the fan on?&#34; maybe similar as a kind of brainless strategy to get followers.  I guess some people like responding to these prompts.  I suspect it has the same weakness as the &#34;follow back&#34; strategy though.  Nobody really cares about the account or connects with it or even understands what you&#39;re trying to do.  These people aren&#39;t your followers so much as they are people who like small talk and coalesced around you for a time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently read Enough: True Measures of Money, Business, and Life, by Jack Bogle, the founder of Vanguard. Written during the 2008 recession, it&#39;s so much more than a business book. It highlights in detail how the financial industry at large leeches so much wealth for itself while creating so little, and offers insights from someone truly introspective of life, business, finance, and the future of the country. Highly recommend a read/listen.https://amazon.com/John-C-Bogle/e/B001H6NWEM"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was disappointed by A Thousand Brains. The last part of the book veered into ... I don&#39;t really know. On the other hand, I loved Jeff Hawkins&#39; earlier book on this topic: On Intelligence [1]. It&#39;s easily one of the top 5 books that I&#39;ve read and the first part of A Thousand Brains recaps much of that work, so still relevant today according to the author.[1] https://numenta.com/resources/on-intelligence/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh hi! Author here. Fun thing to wake up to.I wanted to point something out that the series doesn&#39;t do a good job of highlighting:You can use Nix alongside your existing package manager.They won&#39;t conflict. You can set up dev environments with Nix without drinking the kool-aid. I still have Homebrew installed, and I still occasionally reach for it in the rare cases where Nix is missing some package I want to try. But I am sad every time I do: I never really realized how unbelievably slow Homebrew is until I tried Nix.So if you&#39;re Nix-curious, you can try it out without committing to anything upfront. I didn&#39;t make the switch until part 19:https://ianthehenry.com/posts/how-to-learn-nix/switching-fro...Nix is weird and hard to learn, but it&#39;s a lot like git in that respect. Yes, the UI is terrible. You have to learn the difference between `reset --hard` and `reset --mixed` and it&#39;s weird and unintuitive but you eventually get over it.And people are using it despite how unintuitive it is, because of how valuable it is to them. No one is arguing that `nix-env -qaP package` is a reasonable command to ask a fellow human being to type, but people are willing to type it anyway because the benefits are worth it. As a fun example, a few weeks ago I wrote up a little hack that I would not have even attempted before spending the time to learn Nix:https://ianthehenry.com/posts/janet-game/how-to-patch-emacs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve bounced off Nix a couple of times and figured that the problem is that it was too different. A lot of Linux distros (especially post-systemd) have a fair number of similarities and it&#39;s pretty easy to translate knowledge between them. NixOS _probably_ works very similarly, but it&#39;s also got this additional declarative configuration layer on top, which is the point of using NixOS, and it&#39;s got its own special way of doing things.You can&#39;t translate Linux knowledge to a NixOS config directly, you need NixOS&#39; documentation to understand the &#34;NixOS Way&#34; of doing things, and the NixOS way of doing things does not translate into other distros. And the documentation is difficult to understand and at times seemingly arbitrary.You have to commit to learning NixOS and understand that you are only learning NixOS, it won&#39;t help you use anything else. Other Linux distros help you learn Linux in general and inform your understanding of Linux system construction, but NixOS is its own thing. Plenty of people learn NixOS anyway, and more power to them, but it&#39;s definitely pushed me away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We know documentation is too scattered and incomplete.I&#39;ve started https://nix.dev about a year ago to provide a resource for newcomers.I&#39;m working on comprehensive language tutorial next, but I&#39;m mostly interested what you&#39;d like to learn when getting started."</p>
