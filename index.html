								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey Akash,I like the idea of giving people some help expressing themselves at work. You might be interested to learn about the Power Distance Index, and the body of work on PDI and work culture.You’ll see if you read the comments here that some people are like “the alternatives are bullshit corporate speak and infuriate me”, and some are like “yes, at last, a way to help people be more polite / better communicators”. There’s a smattering of “this is passive aggressive” thrown in.One of the broad pitches PDI at work types make is that the lower the PDI, the more direct communications are preferred; the higher, the more ‘diplomatic’ the communications are preferred. My vibe on your list is that it’s just a tad more diplomatic than Silicon Valley wants to be, hence the slight negative ‘passive aggressive’ reactions.Some of the lowest PDI countries in the world are Israel, and many Northern European countries, and it fits my experience that in those places additional respect is given for bluntness - as Jan Maas in Ted Lasso says “I’m not rude, I’m Dutch.” As a broad stereotype using the alternate wordings you give would be a sign you are not someone to be respected in that environment.On the other hand, Saudi Arabia’s PDI is high, and I would bet that some of your alternate list there would still be much too rude; just a guess, I haven’t worked in Saudi.Anyway, thanks again for this; if you stay interested, you might consider reworking this into different ‘cultural norms’ lists to help people acclimate / go both ways; at that point, I think it would be a very broadly useful resource."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This version of &#34;professionalism&#34; has the stereotypical West Coast problem: the message it claims to be sending gets not only lost in translation, but distorted into something more superficially inoffensive, but underneath that, more opaque and manipulative. It encourages indirection and avoidance rather than respectful candor.Let&#39;s start with the first example. The polite way to say &#34;you are overcomplicating this&#34; is &#34;I think this could be simpler&#34;. Not &#34;let&#39;s concentrate on initial scope&#34;, which isn&#39;t remotely the same thing in general. The latter is less generally applicable (how do we know there was an initial scope?), less specific (why stick to initial scope?), and more prescriptive (&#34;let&#39;s do this&#34; instead of &#34;I listened to your idea and this is what I think of it&#34;).Now, being less specific and more prescriptive may be some people&#39;s idea of effective self-interested corporate behavior, since it works to minimize your vulnerabilities and maximize the obligations of others. But I think communication is more meaningful, effective, and respectful if you explain how you evaluate others&#39; ideas (which implies you at least gave them the respect of listening) before just telling them what to do.They&#39;re not all bad though! I definitely think &#34;that&#39;s a horrible idea&#34; is productively replaced with some version of &#34;I have these concerns&#34; or &#34;I think there may be better alternatives&#34;. It&#39;s generally good to avoid terms that communicate nothing but negative affect and instead communicate whatever ideas that prompted the negative affect.EDIT: another comment mentions Power-Distance Index, which is part of a broader cultural dimensions theory. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstede%27s_cultural_dimens...Apparently I have a very strong preference for low PDI culture, as do most of you. But it&#39;s good to be aware that that&#39;s not universal and our style may require adaptation for success with diverse audiences."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Almost none of these are &#34;professional&#34; or the sort of corporate double speak the author wants to convey. In fact, I find a lot of the &#34;alternatives&#34; more passive aggressive and rude than the original intentions! Instead of &#34;stop bothering me&#34; being:    You have not heard from me because further information is not available at this time, Once I have an update I’ll be sure to loop you in

It should be something like &#34;Let&#39;s sync up later&#34; or &#34;I will ping you once I have an update.&#34; Way less hostile."</p>

This pseudo-security measure actually only slows down humans, not bots, because you can still edit the value of the text field using Javascript.I don&#39;t think this is generally worth it as a security measure, but the goal is not to protect against automation.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have learned the hard way that when dealing with government software (at least in the US), you must assume the least favorable/most unfavorable interpretation of any information given.When I saw the email informing the author of the over-purchase, I knew there was no way out. Purchasing the difference, as the author did, would only cause more trouble. The questions now are how much will be refunded, whether any purchases will go through, and whether there will be a fine or legal action. Refer to the rule above for my guesses.I think many people do not appreciate how devastating this is to public trust."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; so that if another person is shown your sequence of digits from 1 to 6, he/she should not be able to tell whether these numbers were produced by a real die or just “made up” by somebody.That instruction is a flaw in the experiment. It&#39;s always impossible to tell, for any given sequence, whether it was produced by a fair die. There&#39;s nothing an experimental subject can do to make the impossible more impossible.&gt; the kind of sequence you’d get if you really rolled a dieWell, there is no such sequence. The instruction is incoherent.You could take it as meaning &#34;Construct a sequence that you think will convince others that it came from a random source&#34;. That would be coherent. And then it would be legitimate to eliminate responses that were all-heads (&#34;clearly didn&#39;t even try&#34;). But then what are you measuring? The comparative understanding of older and youger people concerning random sources, or the Gambler&#39;s Paradox? Their comparative expertise in human psychology? Their comparative willingness to move the mouse-pointer over the screen?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with the article that the study is flawed in its unwillingness to exclude the all-H and all-T answers. But I’ll go further: the original study is just silly.“Make a sequence that looks random” is sort of a nonsensical ask. Looks random to whom? To our algorithm, is what they meant. There’s no such thing as a randomness test that can look at a sequence and decide “is it random?”, so this algo measures something else and uses it as a proxy for “looking” random to…the study authors, I guess? There’s no ground truth here; it’s chasing a ghost.I don’t know what information we could even hypothetically gain from knowing older people score lower according to this algo—-perhaps that the paper’s authors are younger than 60 and thus picked a different “randomness-looking” algo than they would if they were older? At best that older people have an equally incorrect but qualitatively different idea of “random looking”?Of course we did not learn that; we only learned that older people pick all-H or all-T more. But my point is that there wasn’t really anything interesting at stake anyway.(Edit: expanding a bit)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like a lot of the comments here are written after only taking the test and many are not reading the rest of the article.The authors of the website are stating that they believe the study is wrong. The below/above 60 answer is showing you it’s incorrect half of the time along with data backing up the claim."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I have seen another comment: ,,why?’’ and agree with it, I’d like to expand on it.For a long time I thought that switching away from 3d buttons, getting to less colors was only frustrating me and other techies who like how things were done before (I love the original iPhone aesthetics for example).But a few months ago my father died, my mother is left alone 73 years old, far from me, and I try to help her through phone (and sometimes remote sessions), but it’s extremely frustrating that she can’t tell me what buttons there are on the screen, because she can’t make a difference between buttons and text. With more black and white, I even can’t tell her what color to look for. And the worst thing is that when she can’t achieve something she needs to (like pay a bill), her blood pressure goes up, and she has to take medications with serious side effects.I’m very angry at companies that don’t test changes with old people whose life and health at this point depends on being able to use digital services."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unicode already has a way to specify that emoji should be rendered black-and-white for consistency with surrounding text: affixing the combining character U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 (examples[0]). Some touch keyboards have the text-style variations in the flyouts.This only works on emoji for which a variation sequence is defined. Some emoji render the text presentation by default; you can choose the emoji presentation for those using U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16. Sequences also exist for ideographic variations like single- or double-storey &#39;a&#39; and &#39;g&#39;, unified CJK, and miscellaneous ones such as serifs for certain mathematical characters.[1][0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscellaneous_Symbols_and_Pict...[1] https://unicode.org/faq/vs.htmlI find this tool handy for listing the Unicode characters in a string.[2][2] https://qaz.wtf/u/show.cgi?show=%F0%9F%8C%8D%EF%B8%8EEdit: An easy way to add the variation selector without a method for Unicode input (though there&#39;s a registry hack for Windows to enable Unicode alt codes): put the emoji in an address bar, then add the URL-encoded variation selector,  %EF%B8%8E"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"90% of my software engineering is fighting with incomprehensible framework magic to automates simple tasks that don&#39;t need to be automated, to &#34;save me&#34; from just writing some simple code. It&#39;s literally rube goldberg all the way, the most over complex contraptions to achieve the simplest of tasks.&#34;You don&#39;t want to write &#34;raw&#34; html/js/sql/Java&#34; Uhm I thought that was my job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Right. The hard line on this comes from aerospace. If A won&#39;t connect to B, you check the spec. If A isn&#39;t compliant with the spec, A is wrong and the vendor of A has to fix it. Same for B. If you can&#39;t tell who&#39;s wrong from the spec, the spec is wrong. This is why you can unplug a Pratt and Whitney engine from a aircraft and plug in a Rolls-Royce engine.Now, this worked a lot better when aerospace companies and the USAF had real clout with manufacturers. If it wasn&#39;t in compliance with the spec, you put a red tag on it and rejected it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like that story, and wish the author luck.I never thought of myself as a &#34;niche programmer,&#34; but, as it turns out, I sort of, am.I write native UIKit applications, using Swift. No PWAs, no hybrid systems (like React, Electron, or Ionic). I&#39;m pretty good at it. I&#39;ve been writing Swift, every day, since it was announced in 2014. It&#39;s no longer an &#34;edge&#34; language; it is now the baseline, mainstream, native development language for Apple systems, and I&#39;m a fluent speaker.It means that the apps I write are really small, really secure, really fast, accessible, highly usable, use very few system resources, leverage the latest Apple tech, have almost no external dependencies, work extremely well, and I write them very, very quickly. Also, because they are UIKit, I can get pretty ambitious, as UIKit is a very mature, ship-oriented system. I am looking forward to using SwiftUI, but am yet to be convinced that it is suitable for really ambitious projects.It&#39;s really difficult to find other native Swift developers that work the way that I do. Part of that, I hate to admit, is probably because I&#39;m 60, and I got really sick of sitting in meetups, with a circle of avoidance around me. I have come to understand that I have &#34;cooties.&#34; I won&#39;t go where I&#39;m not welcome.But I have also come to realize that an awful lot of apps for Apple systems are written using hybrid systems, and that many folks are unaware that there are Apple app development languages, other than JavaScript."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was doing my undergrad at the University of Waterloo in the &#39;90s, my first co-op (internship) placement happened to be at OTI -- a (some might say &#34;the&#34;) Smalltalk shop.  Smalltalk was very much a niche language even at the time but it opened up opportunities I wouldn&#39;t have dreamt of down the road.  My last couple co-op jobs took me to Australia and from there to a customer engagement in Thailand.  I bet that wouldn&#39;t have happened if I just specialized in C++ or whatnot.All this to say that I heartily endorse the OP&#39;s strategy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I didn&#39;t dive into finding an online Clojure community and none of my programmer friends did Clojure or had heard of it either so I had no idea if the language was gaining popularity or dying.This is so fascinating to me and I guess just a reminder of the HN echo chamber."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Benefits of JailBreaking Your Kindle:- Customize your lock screen to the recently opened book cover, selected image, or randomized from a collection of images. Amazon added something similar recently but it took them 13 years for something so basic.- KOReader for reading epub and pdf. Also, you get access to the filesystem so you can organize your books however you want.- Customizable collections (similar to folders) with Calibre- Run Python so you can run w/e you want. Some ideas...    - Sideload books via WiFi

    - Sync notes automatically


The main idea of Jailbreaking is that you own your device and you can do whatever you want with it. However, I switched from a Jailbroken Kindle Paperwhite to an Android e-ink reader about a year ago and I&#39;m never looking back.Regardless, I&#39;m happy to see this on Hacker News!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"KOReader (something you can install on a Jailbroken Kindle) is the best book reading app I have come across, in any platform."</p>

I&#39;m still continually baffled that there isn&#39;t a bigger push for the following fundamental idea:&#34;Any human being can hold an effectively infinite library, which is to say infinite knowledge in their hand for about $100. Any barrier to this should be regarded as negative, if not straight up evil.&#34;"</p>

Even with relatively slow internet connections, training should still make good use of all the compute available because the whole lot runs asynchronously with highly compressed and approximate updates to shared weights.The end result is that every bit of computation added has some benefits.Obviously for a real large scale effort, anti-cheat and anti-spam mechanisms would be needed to ensure nodes aren&#39;t deliberately sending bad data to hurt the group effort.[1]: https://github.com/Hello1024/shared-tensor"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Read the whole thing, I was really not convinced. Ive had some brilliant hits, but I think became more of a liability in the end. Look at what happened to the MacBook Pro, losing most of its ports and the thinness causing them to put a much worse keyboard in it that caused massive problems. Sacrificing a bit of thinness and going back on those changes with the newest iteration has been much better.Honestly to me the M1 era of Apple is the more exciting than things have been in years. The article linked is really negative (saying Apple only have “legacy products”) but with the M1 series they seems to be smashing it out of the park…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve always gotten the impression that Ive may be a truly great designer be he needs an editor. He had that in Steve Jobs.Once he lost his editor the designs Apple shipped moved more and more towards being perfect designs at the expense of thoughts of usability.And now he’s known as the guy who helped “ruin” Apple’s products until they kicked him out.Unfortunate. For the lack of an editor."</p>
