								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Once upon a time I worked at Google.I returned to Austin to visit old friends and took the opportunity to visit the Google office there. The Googlers sitting around me were primarily corporate sales.They weren&#39;t getting any corporate sales calls at all as far as I could tell, but there was one extremely irate user who was locked out of their GMail account and was repeatedly calling them because they were the only human beings at Google the user was able to get in touch with, via something like &#34;Press 3 for Corporate Sales.&#34; Of course these poor Google corporate sales people had absolutely no way to help this user even if they wanted to. Google literally did not have any GMail account phone support (at least at the time).I could hear the poor guy screaming through their headsets about how he paid Google something for some service and was entitled to phone support and he demanded someone help him, but they just kept saying, &#34;This is corporate sales. We do not offer consumer account support. If you want support, please visit the Google Support Forums at www dot...&#34;After they hung up on him 3 or 4 times, eventually a manager got on the phone and told him (between his screams), &#34;Look, you&#39;re not getting any phone support because it doesn&#39;t exist. There&#39;s nowhere for us to transfer you. There&#39;s nobody who can call you back about this. Your only option is to search the forums for an answer to your problem. I am going to terminate this call now. Sir, I&#39;m going to terminate this call. No, we can&#39;t help you. Nobody at Google can help you. I am terminating this call now. We asked you to stop calling this number. Do not call us again. &lt;click&gt;&#34;I&#39;d frequently tell my co-workers, &#34;If you&#39;re not paying for it, you&#39;re the product.&#34; That experience underscored that notion for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They also do this thing now where they block [1] smaller browsers (even ones using the latest version of chromium) under the guise of security. According to their docs they&#39;re fighting MITMs by generally disallowing any browser they can&#39;t identify (so the big few).If you&#39;re not on a whitelisted browser by Google, you can&#39;t log in (effectively, use) any of their properties.This feels very anti-competitive to me. Notably all the whitelisted browsers are either theirs (Chrome) or sell them their search traffic. I&#39;m building a browser for research [2]  and have to frequently find workarounds. I&#39;m not quite sure who I&#39;d contact to get on said whitelist either...[1] https://imgur.com/a/DASVkhl (here is the issue in the Vim browser and Min browser)[2] https://synth.app"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Had this. It was telling me to try again &#39;later&#39;. Ok, i did &#39;try later&#39; every day for three weeks, and they didn&#39;t let me in. Using the very same IP address as I used to always access it, no less.Then, I gave up, moved all my services to another email account, and after 2 or 3 months tried logging in, and it suddenly allowed me to log in.Needless to say, I will never again use gmail for critically important things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love the general renaissance of terminal UI tools we are seeing in the last few years.I can&#39;t quite put my finger on what I like about it so much. Something to do with  the simplicity and directness of these UIs, guaranteed optimised for efficient keyboard nav, widespread adoption of vim-like navigation keys, and the fact that they link directly with my terminal shell so I can stay entirely in a stream of thought while working through complex series of tasks that weave in and out of these apps and shell interactions.I do wish it was easier to select text from the terminal screen without using the mouse. It is supported in terminals to place text onto the system clipboard, but rarely implemented in most of these apps. It&#39;s the main reason my hands leave the keyboard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Charm; doing `ssh git.charm.sh` is a lot of fun and really sparks the imagination about SSH apps. They also have usable solutions for auth and storage, which like, if you&#39;re thinking of writing something like this are the first things you&#39;d start reaching for. They also work hard to enable you to run all your own services, so you don&#39;t rely on the Charm cloud for everything. Definitely a good model for future punk projects IMO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m very skeptical about the recent TUI approaches. At least that&#39;s NOT what the current infrastructure is designed for.I personally believe we really should graduate from the terminal infrastructure that was designed in the ancient time. We can make a good use of stuffs like client-side UI rendering (fast &amp; reactive), graphical boxes (more compact boxes), image embedding, native multiplexing, capability negotiation, etc. These might be still possible on the existing infrastructure, but a clean slate should provide more consistent experience for everyone involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked for a large e-commerce company.  I wanted to investigate putting all our support data into Watson and see what sort of recommendations it could provide, maybe a sort of auto-suggestion to help our customers.  Three really funny points stand out from the experience:1) To apply for Watson access you needed to show C-level approval, so our CEO put his name and phone number on the application (trying Watson was somewhat his idea).  A few months later, an IBM marketing team called HIS CELL and asked for ME.  Imagine how it felt to have the CEO walk up to me, deadpan hand me his personal iphone and say &#34;It&#39;s for you.&#34;..2) They told me they&#39;d help me with the support data idea, and every meeting we set up they tried to pitch &#34;what if we put Watson on all of your customer&#39;s storefronts, we could add a &#39;powered by watson&#39; banner on every page, and you give us a cut of GMV?&#34;.  I pivoted them to our plugin framework and told them to build it themselves.3) To demo the technology, the first step was to buy a $250k server from IBM.  To demo it.Big LOLs all around, never trust big blue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone doing a CS degree now, I seem to be the only one who doesn&#39;t want to have anything on my resume to do with &#34;AI&#34;, blockchain, ML, NFT, chatbots, etc... all I see is overhyped product after product, one-size-fits all solutions that frustrate customers and create problems for humans to clean up, hugely valued companies that have very little real improvement over conventional technology, etc.An &#34;AI chatbot&#34; is far inferior to a real user interface. A real user interface allows discoverability (looking through menus to notice functions that may be useful later), experimentation, and puts the user in control of the program.For example, my bank apparently only supports viewing the reason for card declines through the chatbot--something I never knew, because I took the time to go through the menus when I first got the app and learn what functions existed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at IBM Watson as one of the early engineers when they first started commercializing the product. It was a fucking joke - Ginni Rometty would go up on stage and said that Watson can help diagnose cancer from CT scans and we would just look at each other and be like &#34;Dude, Watson is just a glorified Lucene index, wtf is she talking about.&#34; They started selling Watson as the end-all for everything from cancer diagnosis to customer service chat - they even had a stupid Watson Chef thing at SXSW one year - but none of that used the original Watson codebase - it was all built from the ground up and lots of it was just simple logistic regression"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m more interested how he managed to master the knowledge of chip manufacturing plus a ton of electronics repairs (see his microscope and other equipment) at such an early age. Very admirable.Look at what he did:&gt; Photolithography machines are expensive—up to $150 million—and so Zeloof made his own by bolting a modified conference room projector bought on Amazon onto a microscope. It projects his designs at tiny scale onto silicon wafers that Zeloof coats in material sensitive to ultraviolet light.&gt; One of Zeloof’s best finds was a broken electron microscope that cost $250,000 in the early ’90s; he bought it for $1,000 and repaired it. He uses it to inspect his chips for flaws, as well as the nanostructures on butterfly wings.Damn this guy is good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazing!&#34;Zeloof says he doesn’t know for sure what he wants to do after graduating this spring&#34; - I hope we don&#39;t hear later that he went to work for FAANG. One the saddest things about Big Tech is how they take young talent away from innovative, potentially competing enterprises and into busy work internal projects just because they can."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since most people don&#39;t seem to be aware: you can use Wordpress as a mostly-static website generator.Use WP Super Cache, and most of your pages are static anyway. A small PHP stub will be hit still, but if you don&#39;t even want that, you can just serve the generated static pages without it.It&#39;s well documented, you just edit your httpd.conf/.htaccess or your nginx config to serve the static files generated by the plugins.Only logged-in users (in most personal Wordpress installations: &#34;just me&#34;) or recent commenters, depending on configuration, hit any PHP code at all.Oh, and commenting works, unless with SSGs out of the box.Keep the number of plugins small, use a static plugin and security is mostly a non-issue for a personal weblog (it&#39;s different for a &#34;real&#34; media operation with all kinds of complicated workflows, of course)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s clear that the fewer plugins one installs (ideally none) the better, though it&#39;s difficult to follow this rule in practice. I recently had to set up a WP website from scratch, and plugins are a very common way for people to solve their problems (especially non-technical users). Plugins are even used for basic ops work like rewrite rules, backups, log parsing, caching—and I get it, for most people if they didn&#39;t exist they wouldn&#39;t have done the ops stuff, or solve many of the other types of problems, so it&#39;s kind of a blessing and a curse given your attack surface increases with each plugin and WP feature. I&#39;ve learned that Wordpress really is what you make of it, directly proportional to the engineering effort you put in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This idea really resonates with me. I started out life pretty poor, and am fortunate enough now to be able to purchase most anything I want. What I no longer have however, is time. I found myself purchasing things I want to have time for, but in all reality don&#39;t. Thinking about the second cost before hitting that buy button may be a good way for me to stop cluttering my life up with stuff I don&#39;t need, and the associated stress of knowing it&#39;s sitting there waiting to eat up time I don&#39;t have."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually tend to see anything I buy as a black hole that will suck more money into it.A good example is when you get a bicycle, you do the equation and realize that within two years you will have saved in on the cost of public transportation. But it&#39;s when you start using it you realize that suddenly you always end up sweaty arriving to work so you need to buy good ventilated outdoor clothes and then a little bit later the winter arrives and you realize you need the same type of winter clothes, and then your first tier brakes and you realize you don&#39;t have any tools, so not only do you need to buy a new tier but also the tools. And here the initial smart calculation has fallen apart long time ago.Don&#39;t get me wrong. There&#39;s a lot of benefits riding a bike to work so it may still be very much worth it. But once you have this realization you can apply the same logic to anything you buy or thinking of buying which may helps prioritizing because there&#39;s just so many black holes you can have in your life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This makes sense for some things, but the examples the author uses don&#39;t make sense to me.Take the Moby Dick example... the author says you don&#39;t get the return on it until you have paid the 16 hour price of reading it... but isn&#39;t those sixteen hours the actual reward? You don&#39;t read a book to be finished with it, you read it because you like the reading process. The reward starts the first minute you start reading the book.Not only that, but you don&#39;t have to finish the book to get something out of reading it. If you enjoyed the time you spent reading, that is enough.This attitude seems very &#34;completionist&#34;, where you only get value after you finish something. That isn&#39;t how I view things.Also, why does he think mindless apps and games are the same as doing nothing? The idea is you enjoy the time spent playing the game. Sure, you don&#39;t end up with anything after, but you enjoyed the time."</p>

But you could argue it&#39;s already undermined, both by the government itself and the fact that somehow John Deere managed to achieve a monopoly in a sector critical to national security."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Am I being overly cynical in concluding that a growing % of companies will screw over their customers for their own gain. Doesn&#39;t this myopic &#34;screw the customer&#34; mentality damage brand reputation? Sure does for me. The growing discontent amongst a companies customer base is creating a new market opportunity for a competitor. When I feel screwed by a company like this, I find a good alternative, then jump ship and NEVER go back (even if they course correct some years later). From that point on I&#39;m a vocal detractor of the brand. If no quality alternative exists it&#39;s even worse because you know the company is screwing you knowing you have no good alternatives."</p>

Man how great it felt in the firsts weeks when this bot would send a message around 20 times a day: the sound of finally having built something valuable that would generate value even if I&#39;d be out of my computer, running or anything else really.Long live scrappingbee!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the best definition of engineering is that it&#39;s a process of optimization within a solution space bounded by constraints. If you pile up some mud and let it dry, you have made a dwelling but you are not an engineer. If you calculate the load requirements for a series of I-beams given a certain budget and build a skyscraper, you are an engineer.As the author correctly notes, there aren&#39;t necessarily hard boundaries on what qualifies as engineering, but I think there clearly are axes on which something is &#34;more engineer-y&#34; vs &#34;less engineer-y&#34;, and as the constraints of the solution space go from physical (tension, voltage, pressure) to non-physical (interpersonal relations, public perception, aesthetic judgment), the activity goes from more engineer-y to less engineer-y.In software, we&#39;re always optimizing on cost / developer time, but that&#39;s closer to the non-physical side of the constraint physicality axis. As you optimize for things like memory usage, execution time, binary size, then you get closer to the physical end of the constraint-type axis, and are thus more engineer-y."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I come from an aerospace engineering background (did structural engineering on commercial aircraft that were in the design and approval stages) and am in software now (games). I&#39;ve had two different takes on this. Neither is perfect. Would appreciate comments on them.(a) If it&#39;s regularly expected that you ship bugs, you might be in a discipline that is distinct from engineering.[0](b) If you can usually reach for an abstraction to save you, you might be working in something that isn&#39;t engineering.[1][0] If software is engineering, then it&#39;s the only engineering discipline I&#39;m aware of in which the participants are regularly expected to produce deliverables they don&#39;t fully understand. What do I mean by that? Well, if we software peeps fully understood our deliverables, we wouldn&#39;t have bugs, or at least, we&#39;d always know what bugs are there. If as a structural engineer I had delivered a final draft of an analysis document which showed that I didn&#39;t fully understand the part and how it would perform, my boss would not have been pleased. Most software bugs are treated more casually than that, so we clearly have a tolerance for delivering work that we don&#39;t fully understand.You might take issue with the idea that I &#34;fully understood&#34; a structural part. Fair. When I calculated the strength of a beam in a thrust reverser I didn&#39;t understand the individual molecular interactions, I didn&#39;t need to know if the metal was of a body-centered cubic crystal structure, etc. But this is because I was able to apply well-understood and rigorously accepted simplifying assumptions that were conservative (from the point of view of a factor of safety), and fully encapsulated all the understanding I needed to produce a part fit for use.[1] This feels like the more flawed of the two proposals, because I expect EEs can do this. Control systems folks can definitely do this, and I would absolutely call them engineers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actually, I am a real engineer, and designing gearboxes for airplanes is quite real. So are programmers engineers or not?Consider real engineering at Boeing. There are engineers and technicians (aka draftsmen) working side by side. They are often doing the same work. The difference, as far as Boeing is concerned, is the engineers have a degree in engineering and the technicians do not.But if they are often doing exactly the same thing, what&#39;s the real difference?Think of it another way. Think of an auto mechanic. He can fix your car. He can take your car apart and put it back together. He can customize it. But is he an auto engineer (who often does those tasks, too)?Nope.A programmer, technician, mechanic plugs numbers into formulas, follows instructions and procedures and practices laid out by an engineer.An engineer derives the formulas, writes the instructions, develops the procedures, and refines the practices.For example, a technician builds a band pass filter by using a circuit he&#39;s already used before and knows works. Maybe he&#39;ll tweak the RC values. An engineer will drive the RC values needed by understanding the calculation. The technician may use calculation (though they rarely do), but they don&#39;t understand where the formula comes from. An engineer does.In software, a programmer calls a sort function from the supplied library. An engineer writes the sort function, and can tell you its complexity and why the algorithm he chose (or invented) is the most appropriate one for the particular sorting task, and what the cases are where the sort will perform poorly, and why."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"American here&#34;perhaps better known as the online identity verification service that many states now use to help staunch the loss of billions of dollars in unemployment insurance and pandemic assistance stolen each year by identity thieves&#34;In the great State of California, billions in unemployment benefits were sent to the wrong people.. because their internal systems were designed to delay, deny and deprive, I say. Actual people with real jobs were repeatedly refused, while insiders who knew how to fill out paperwork, and apparently knew where the blind spots were, filed hundreds of claims in the early pandemic days. A newly appointed Director (young, tech savvy woman) soon stopped making public statements, and the situation nearly two years later, is not resolved.  This is at a time when California has record income to the State.Now, some people may jump on this and say &#34;well, you see how photo ID would have helped that&#34; and, with incomplete knowledge and personal opinion, I say no, it would not solve it. You see, people with real jobs, with every real paper filed, were denied benefits, while insiders were pulling checks with both hands, using certain kinds of identities that would slip through. How would ever more restriction, requirement and verification, have helped here?I am deeply against the collective government making ever more demands on citizens for &#34;papers, please&#34; enrollment to massive money social services (edit e.g. govt unemployment benefits). It is not going to have the desired effect, despite superficial evidence otherwise. Additionally this represents a slippery slope where the ability to interact as an individual will be eroded, and opportunity for insider graft will increase."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can anyone with context speak to as why ID.me was chosen instead of Login.gov? SSA made Login.gov its primary identity provider, so I&#39;m curious what the backstory is on IRS&#39; identity story.EDIT: Follow up question: Is ID.me a shim until there&#39;s traction for the USPS to perform in person identity proofing [1] [2] [3] versus ID.me&#39;s remote proofing?[1] https://about.usps.com/publications/pub364/ch12.html[2] https://www.cfr.org/report/solving-identity-protection-post-...[3] https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5a7b7a8490bade8a77c07..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; an online identity verification service that requires applicants to submit copies of bills and identity documents, as well as a live video feed of their faces via a mobile device.This looks like a solution you will expect by a small shop which owner hacks some technology together. It sounds ridiculous for any modern government.Edit: link to the Spanish certificate authority (Fabrica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre) https://www.fnmt.es/en/ceres"</p>
