								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me, the utility of being at home versus being at the office is massive. If I need a 15 minute break, I can start a load of laundry, or run the dishwasher, or do some other chore.I can wake up later since I don&#39;t have a commute. I don&#39;t lose two hours a day due to the commute.I can wear as comfortable clothing as I desire. I can delay my shower until after my daily workout (Which I can do since my workout equipment is at home).I can control my environment so there are as many or as few distractions as i like. I can put on videos or audio that might not be considered work appropriate. I can use speakers since no one is around me to hear the sound.The number and magnitude of inconveniences we subject ourselves to by heading to an office every day has been fully revealed. I will do all I can to work from home for the rest of my life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OK. I WFH as well. I know all the benefits. And as I&#39;m WFH for pandemic only I&#39;ve been trying to find remote work post-pandemic and there I realized some bitter points:1. I compete for positions with people all over the world. Who can complete with a fraction of the salary I need.2. As a remote worker -most often working as a contractor- I&#39;m even easier to be replaced in a heartbeat. No severance or anything alike.3. Did I mention that I compete with all the planet? That makes competition for good roles really crazy.4. Work blends into life and it is very hard to keep it from. This gets worse depending on the company/role but in general these things tend to go the employers way not yours.5. You need to find new ways to socialize (and the motivation to do so is minimal) or you risk mental health issues.All I&#39;m trying to say is be careful what you wish for because you might get it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope this is the start of a nation wide trend towards better work life balance. Production output has gone up over the past few decades and we’re expected to work the same amount of hours. I think the future probably looks something like 4 6-hour work days each week. Life is way too short and precious to be spending so much of it working for somebody else, even if you mostly do love your job."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few days ago, I clicked an age restricted video on Youtube and usually I just state that I am above 18 but now they ask for a credit card number or an identity card to prove it.I am not going to send this just to watch some random video clip that users have declared not appropriate to a young audience because it features a zombie. Seriously!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hmm, it&#39;s such a shame that we have a single point of failure for so much of internet culture, not to mention people&#39;s actual creative lives.This is one of the reasons I started using youtube-dl. I wanted to create an independent backup of all my favorite creators and contributors in the event that they have to leave or delete their channels.This content should belong to everyone. I wish I could trust that all my favorite videos will be there forever, but this is just not the case. Removing the comments on music videos already hurt a lot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s great to see more projects in the space, but for me it&#39;s not really about the editor itself any more, it&#39;s about the ecosystem and the extensibility. The act of selecting and changing text is just a small part of the problem space.I use emacs not because I&#39;m a neckbeard, but because I can script it to do whatever the hell I like. I switch to vscode when I want to do something my emacs setup isn&#39;t yet good for (like, working with Typescript).On the flip side, I use sublime text as a notepad replacement because it&#39;s that fast. I still use nano as my default editor for commit messages. Sometimes I use vim because that&#39;s what I happened to type to open a file.This isn&#39;t a comment on helix editor itself...just that, it&#39;s a pretty saturated space and I&#39;m keen to see something as novel as light table play out again, but only more successfully."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Built with Rust. No Electron. No VimScript. No JavaScript.Great. So, what&#39;s the extension language? Rust is utterly inadequate to be a scripting language (if you have to recompile the text editor to reconfigure it, that&#39;s a non-starter).VimScript sucks, but it&#39;s better than literally nothing. Emacs Lisp is weird, but powerful. Python is great and everyone knows it. Lua is small, simple, blindingly fast, and literally designed to be embedded in compiled projects.Why is there no mention of extensions or extensibility?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;We’ve redesigned and modernized the core experience to be cleaner, more inviting, and easier to use.&#34;Why does the UI change with every single Firefox release? I find myself having to re-adjust every time a new update is shipped.What&#39;s wrong with having a consistent experience that survives for more than 6 months? It&#39;s just a URL bar, and a bunch of tabs. Just leave it be already."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it infuriating how designers keep adding more and more whitespace and padding on my desktop computer. If you want to make your UI easier to use on touch devices that&#39;s fine, but Windows 10 has a tablet mode that I keep disabled, so there&#39;s no reason to assume I&#39;m not using a mouse. If I go to Customize toolbar there&#39;s three density options: Touch, Normal, and Compact (not supported). Why aren&#39;t there a supported compact mode, and why is the normal mode so full of unnecessary padding?With the new design my bookmarks menu that previously had plenty of vertical space left now needs scrolling. Tabs have poor contrast and lack visual anchoring to the web content they contain.I&#39;m going to keep browser.proton.enabled to false in about:config as long as it&#39;s possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Firefox ethos, Firefox keeps redesigning itself over and over, and this time, for the worse.I have a 400 LOC userChrome.css file because the new redesign was barely usable since Firefox beta received this makeover.- There is no tab contrast, and very difficult to tell tabs apart. Made worse on sides without Favicons.- I loved the mic/speaker icon when a tab is playing/listening audio. They had to make it TWO lines in the tab, and made it difficult to notice when you have more tabs.- I could use some icons in the right top menu. It looks nice and easier to use in Edge, that has icons for every option.- Compact mode is gone, that was discussed here before.That said, I like the native elements (buttons, up/down arrows, etc). The new icons in the addressbar look nicer and fits nicely in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Imagine 32GB of this V-Cache instead of RAM. Does each additional layer add latency? If so, I wonder how many layers you could have until it would reach RAM-equivalent latencies. Also, it would require a compiler change if you had 500 sections of RAM (at 64MB per section) with latency increases for each section."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"People have the cause and effect backwards in my opinion. You know why &#34;binge drinking&#34; isn&#39;t a problem in Germany, except for when the Australians turn up for Oktoberfest? It&#39;s because you can just buy a beer on the side of the road with your currywurst, and drink it without being hassled. If you act up, you get arrested for acting up. Try openly having a few beers in the park in Australia or the US, you&#39;ll be run out by the constabulary, or at the least they&#39;ll make you empty it in the trash. When you treat people like naughty children and bake into your culture the idea that drinking is itself an anti-social behaviour that always leads to fighting and dickheaddery, then that&#39;s how they act."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s hard to reduce the US to a single culture. Alcohol consumption habits vary greatly from region to region, or even city to city depending on where you live.I&#39;ve noticed that heavy drinkers tend to cluster with other heavy drinkers. The more you see your friends and coworkers binge drinking regularly, the more you feel it&#39;s an acceptable and even common behavior. Likewise, non-drinkers tend to cluster with each other because it gets tiresome to have friends who want every event to revolve around alcohol.Statistically, the median drinker in the US doesn&#39;t drink much alcohol at all. The vast majority of alcohol is consumed by the top 10% of drinkers. You may have simply ended up with a cluster of heavy drinkers that aren&#39;t representative of the median US alcohol consumer.Statistic here: https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2014/09/25/think... Note that the median US alcohol drinker consumes less than 1 drink per week."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite OBS feature is that you can bring in transparent browser windows all over the place. As such, I have my work conferencing set up so my time appears in the upper-right corner. I’m on the east coast and everyone I work with is on the west coast. It’s a nice way to remind them of my current time. (It also passive aggressively animated to purple with a moon when its “after hours,” a/k/a 5pm for me.)I also have shortcuts to pull in live weather conditions, our company stock price, crypto prices for fun, a 1- and 3- and 5-minute timer, as well as a countdown of days until important work events.It’s fun, and all just a bit of HTML and CSS and JS. (And PHP/cURL/cron to pull stock and weather prices in the background.) All this for free with OBS.Easily a top 5 app for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excited for this release since it contains M1 Apple VT H264 Hardware Encoding support[1] — I know on my Intel Mac, OBS would massacre the CPU if I didn&#39;t have the hardware encoding enabled. On the M1 it&#39;s not quite so bad, but being able to use hardware encoding does save a lot of CPU cycles when streaming at higher bitrates![1] https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio/issues/4170"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OBS is such wonderful software. It&#39;s immensely powerful yet approachable and performant. I am not a streamer, but I&#39;ve found it really useful as an audio/video swiss army knife. Many thanks to the team and community behind it!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I haven&#39;t heard of using docker compose for production development, only local development. In production I normally see people building production images and spinning up them up in their cloud with Terraform and whatever other infrastructure they need, especially for databases where your local MySQL container isn&#39;t going to be configured or provisioned like an AWS RDS instance. What do you hand a docker-compose file off to in production? Swarm? When would you choose this path over a separate system to provision your production resources (like Terraform)?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I run my personal services (Web, db, mail, nextcloud, traefick) off a cheap hetzner vps using docker-compose and its a pleasure how simple is to manage it. Before that I ran a vps with manually configured services and, specially for mail, it was very hard to deploy and manage. Also if p0wned a service, the whole box was as good as gone.Now, there are other alternatives with less downtime, more scalability and a lot more or complexity? Sure there are... but for my personal box I won&#39;t be touching any of that, thanksEdit/Add: ... and also VPN, which I added later on in like, 10m or so. Adding OpenVPN in my previous box was not as trivial, I tell you that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s widely accepted “best practice” to not run processes in docker containers as root but I think it does a disservice to not explain why. The top benefit in my mind is to be able to mark interpreted code (server side JS/python/ruby) as read only in case someone gains shell access in the container. It’s great to set up another user for execution, but you should also make sure to copy in code and build artifacts as read-only. I’m curious if people can name other direct benefits to a non-root user other than “I don’t trust docker/Linux process isolation”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing about smoking is that when you quit smoking you quit it every day. Imagine a light switch on the wall. You turn it off by quitting smoking and you can always go back at a desperate time for instance and turn it on. And some time later off again. Smoking your first cigarette implants that light switch on your mind and you can&#39;t make it go away. Since you know how it makes you feel good when the switch is on, you at some level desire to back to it. Whole idea of quitting smoking is then finding ways to stop yourself from turning it on again and this is true until you die. So do yourself a favor and avoid any substance that creates such light switches in your mind.Edit: Of course this is not the case for 100% of humans. Everyone is different. Some weak some strong in willpower, discipline, etc. But we can all agree that it is an addiction that sucks life out of you slowly. You wouldn&#39;t want to test your willpower your whole life against such a sneaky enemy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started smoking when i went to study in China. Someone gifted me an expensive brand of cigarette, and I kept it hidden in a drawer for two weeks as I didn&#39;t smoke. One very cold day with no where to go and nothing to do, I took the pack out and lit one stick. My did it have a lovely scent. The heat it created inside me was also soothing. It took me about a week and half to finish the pack of 21 cigs. I couldn&#39;t afford to buy the same brand often but i had become addicted to smoking. I struggled with anxiety back then and smoking calmed my nerves. Within 1 year I was smoking 2 packs a day.Smoking is frowned upon in Ghana, so upon my return there were few places I could smoke. One day while out and about I got really anxious about something and I needed a cig badly. I had to go some distance to get one, and even got a harder time finding a place to hide and smoke. I felt like I was committing the most heinous of crimes cause I had to take off my shirt to ensure the smell didn&#39;t stick on me. I didn&#39;t even enjoy the smoke because the quality wasn&#39;t that good, I smoked in a hurry and kept looking over my shoulder. I simply couldn&#39;t live like that anymore. So I quit after that day. The next time I tried to smoke again was 2 months later. I couldn&#39;t even finish a stick as it made me feel sick. I have disliked the smell of cigarettes ever since. And that was 7 years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ian Banks in his novel Complicity writes powerfully decrying smoking. Quoting from the novel.  I take out another cigarette, light it and draw deeply. I 
  gag again, coughing and hacking and feeling the whisky 
  and the can of Export I had earlier slosh around inside 
  me, almost coming up. My eyes are watering. What a stupid 
  drug, what a completely useless fucking drug; no real hit 
  after the first drag, highly addictive and lethal in all 
  sorts of ways, and even if the lung cancer or the heart 
  disease doesn&#39;t get you you can look forward to 
  gangrenous legs in your old age, bits of your body just 
  rotting away still attached and dying in instalments for 
  you, rotting and stinking while you&#39;re still alive and 
  then they have to cut them off and you wake up after the 
  operation wheezing and burning with pain and gasping for 
  a fag. Meanwhile the tobacco companies sponsor sport and 
  fight off advertising bans and look forward to all the 
  new markets in the East and the Far East and more women 
  taking up the weed to show that they can be brainless 
  fucks too, and suits with worm-shit in their brains go on 
  television and say, &#39;Well, nobody&#39;s actually proved how 
  tobacco causes cancer you know&#39;, and you sit there 
  seething and then you find Thatcher is taking half a 
  million from Philip Morris for a three-year find 
  consultancy and you swear never to buy any of their 
  products ever again but at the end of the day you still 
  light another cigarette and suck in the smoke like you 
  enjoyed it and make more profits for those evil fucks.
