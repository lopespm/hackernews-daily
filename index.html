								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I maintain a very popular piece of FOSS software as my full time job (you&#39;ve all heard of it, many of you use it).Easily the worst part of the job is toxic users who hop on to issues demanding you implement them immediately and belittling your planning ability. Worse when you were planning on implementing it soon anyways, but now if you do it&#39;s &#34;rewarding&#34; their behaviour (in their eyes at least), and they become invigorated to go and spread their toxicity even further. Alternatively, you can hold off on implementing it until things cool down, but then all the nice users who have been patiently waiting get screwed.I&#39;m forever grateful that I actually get FAANG salary to do this -- I wouldn&#39;t keep it up if I was getting the little-to-noting many FOSS contributors get."</p>

They may definitely have some growing pains and tough moments ahead of them, but I&#39;m ecstatic to see e2e getting so popular and users finally seeing the value in these kinds of things (after, for what seemed like a decade, getting anyone to care seemed impossible)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; We faced rejections in submitting the app, because they decided to change their policy on the app having a link in the &#34;About WireGuard&#34; tool window to www.wireguard.com/donations/ (which they previously had allowed explicitly; now they want 30% or something)Last year Google started to ban donation links in FOSS apps, WireGuard was one of the first victims [0], completely removed from the store. I didn&#39;t know that Apple also started doing the same and hit WireGuard again. Extending the definition of an &#34;in-app payment&#34; to a link to the project homepage in the &#34;About&#34; window that doesn&#39;t buy any good or service related to the app is an overzealous restriction. Especially so when that button is clicked by, perhaps, only 10% of the users. This is just evil.[0] Open-source apps removed from Google Play Store due to donation linkshttps://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21268389"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FOSS developers should simply stop developing good software for Apple devices.The absolute opacity of Apple&#39;s technical policies and their arrogant i-dont-care/its-your-problem approach against developers are quite renewed in the community. This ends up costing a lot of development time to developers who mostly work for free, who struggle to reverse engineer or debug what happens on MacOS/iOS, and (like Wireguard&#39;s case shows) it harms the reputation of their software because people tend to blame the application rather than the OS when things don&#39;t work as intended.If people want to use FOSS software, then they should be able to do so on systems that support the FOSS ecosystem, that provide developers with appropriate tools to debug what&#39;s going on (ON ANY PLATFORM) and sufficient documentation for them to understand how a certain component of the OS is supposed to behave.I know that in the past 15 years lots of tech-savvy people have opted for Apple products because &#34;they&#39;re still UNIX under the hood, and unlike Linux they just work out of the box&#34;. But being Unix-like DOES NOT mean to be developer-friendly! Apple is still an opaque developer-unfriendly company even if it provides you with a native bash!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The iOS and macOS apps have been the biggest point of stress and frustration when building EteSync[1]. The API is buggy as hell and very limited (if at all available) and the review process is arbitrary and can cause updates to be rejected. You can never know if your workarounds will be accepted or rejected. Sometimes they can even get rejected in future app updates.The EteSync experience is subpar on Apple devices, and there&#39;s almost nothing we can do about it. We already spent countless of hours trying to fix things, but Apple just make it impossible. We have more ideas on how to fix things, and we will keep on trying, but it&#39;s beyond me why would anyone willingly use an Apple product.Edit (adding one more point): that&#39;s one of the more annoying parts about Apple being the gatekeeper to 40% of the US population and in effect, to 100% of businesses (because one bad Apple in the org is enough to spoil the whole bunch). As a developer, you are just stuck with no way out.[1] https://www.etesync.com"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s one of the most successful routers ever sold and yet network equipment manufacturers are still fighting tooth and nail to keep their devices closed source. It just doesn&#39;t make sense to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, I worked for Broadcom for some years after this went down. This post is purely descriptive to give people some insight into the history from inside the company; I&#39;m not commenting on who should have done what (although I was not directly involved, so if someone who was comments, take their word over mine).Broadcom made an error of judgement here, but this incident fostered a deep distrust of open source, at senior levels, that persisted for more than a decade after; perhaps to this day.Firstly at this point Cisco was, at the time,  Broadcom&#39;s largest customer by a large margin. This caused huge tension in that relationship that was totally unforseen, and was very painful for a while.Secondly, a at a certain point it dawned on Cisco and Broadcom that the GPL lawsuit was not like a normal business dispute , because businessmen after a certain point will settle for money even if they didn&#39;t get everything they want. Sure a few people will keep going to the detriment of their own business, but most aim to make profit, not expound a principle. Many companies in the position of the FSF would have settled for a cut of the revenue. But the FSF wanted the source code released, and they were prepared to kill the business to get it. So Cisco and Broadcom had to concede. The source code was released, and OpenWRT was born.The fallout, though was that subsequently Broadcom router ICs were designed with hardware accelerators which were separate from the main CPU. They were driven by separate CPUs on the same SoC that did not run linux and whose drivers could not be demanded under the GPL. none of the open source firmwares  can run these devices efficiently unless someone spends weeks reverse engineering them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t know why WiFi AP manufacturers don’t just give up and just use stock open source firmware on their devices. They are not even trying to get the sw right. The first thing I do when buying one anymore is ditch the built in tinker-toy firmware and install an open source one. Lots of companies that make hardware treat software as just another line item on the BOM like a bolt or a screw, and source the cheapest shit they can find, rather than treating the software as an integral part of the product that needs the same polish as the external box and marketing materials."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone have informed opinion about the usability / value / relevance / quality of the Neural network support on this chip ?Their page mentions spec with :    • SiFive U74 RISC-V Dual core with 2MB L2 cache @ 1.5GHz
    • Vision DSP Tensilica-VP6 for computing vision
    • NVDLA Engine (configuration 2048 MACs@800MHz )
    • Neural Network Engine (1024MACs@500MHz)

So this board seems to have some great support for neural net / robotics processing ?I have just noticed the recent trend of neural hardware support on mainstream chips... Apples M1, this chip.Wondering what the implications are for software and user-space .. what kind of devices / apps will this enable ?One area Im interested in is turning lidar scanner point data into 3D geometry on the device, thus solving a big data management issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been unable to use Beagle boards in the past as they ship with an old kernel and uboot without the sources to update or config them (this was specifically with the black variant). It probably had something to do with vendor NDAs with chipsets or something but it made them entirely unusable to me and more expensive than competitors by almost 2x to boot.I would love a RISC-V board to play with that is a bit more stable and about the size of a Raspberry Pi within a reasonable price range. The SiFive development boards are pretty pricey, definitely showcase hardware (look at all these peripherals or this is basically a desktop computer!).I&#39;m hoping with the explicit call out of open hardware and open software that this board won&#39;t have the same issues as the Beaglebone Black..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s a fun fact (and I suspect shows what a loser I am :-)) Pat Gelsinger and I were colleagues at Intel in the early 80&#39;s. We both worked in what was called &#34;MIPO&#34; (Microprocessor Operation) but I was in Systems Validation and he was on the customer facing side with field engineering. My career went off through a variety of engineering roles, his went into management and up. When he joined EMC, I told him I had always thought he would have been Intel&#39;s CEO. He told me, &#34;Hey, maybe I still will be :-)&#34; That was like 10 years ago, and here he is.There are a lot of things you can say about Silicon Valley, but one of the more interesting aspects of it for me has been how &#34;small&#34; it is in terms of people have an oversized impact. I have never been one of those people of course, just a part of the entourage. But it has been interesting to watch and learn from folks who are good (and bad) role models."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Notable absent from that list is he fired Pat Gelsinger.
Please just bring him back as CEO.&#34;  - [1] 2012 on HN, when Paul Otellini Retired.&#34;The only one who may have a slim chance to completely transform Intel is Pat Gelsinger, if Andy Grove saved Intel last time, it will be his apprentice to save Intel again. Unfortunately given what Intel has done to Pat during his last tenure, I am not sure if he is willing to pick up the job, especially the board&#39;s Chairman is Bryant, not sure how well they go together. But we know Pat still loves Intel, and I know a lot of us miss Pat.&#34; [2] - June, 2018&#34;This is the same as Intel pushing out Pat Gelsinger. The product people get pushed out by sales and marketing. Which are increasingly running the show at Apple.&#34; [3] 30 Days ago.And numerous other reference since 2009. Many more around various other forums and twitter. I am getting quite emotional right now. I cant believe this is really happening. ( I am wiring this with tears in my eyes! ) I guess Andy Bryant retired makes the decision a little easier. And Pat has always loved Intel. I guess he is pissed those muppets drove it to the ground.This is 12 years! 12 years to prove a point! Consider 4 - 5 years of work in lead-time since he left in 2009. That is 2014. Guess what happen after 2014?May be it is too little too late? Or May be this will be another Andy Grove &#34;Only the paranoid survive&#34; moment?The King is Back at Intel, despite being a fan of Dr Lisa Su, I am little worry about AMD.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4804875[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17391707[3] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25435150"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pat was a &#34;boy wonder&#34; at Intel and could do no wrong — until Larrabee. I was working at Intel at the time and remember always assuming that Pat would someday be CEO.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dropbox and Evernote, for me are two very similar companies. Startups that innovated on a great user experience and had a flawless execution in the beginning.  I was an early adopter of both of them, and they worked well. Dropbox sync between different machines worked like magic. I still remember some of the nightmares my coworkers had with OneDrive in meetings when the files for the presentations were missing because of the poor sync capabilities of OneDrive. 
Dropbox is no failure. Their projected revenue for 2020 is $1.8B. This is 3x more than Slack, but their market cap is 3x smaller. 
Both Slack and Evernote are facing the most powerful companies in the world offering their products for free or at really discounted rates. What makes their situation even worse is that they don&#39;t own the content (documents, pdfs, spreadsheets). The documents will be edited somewhere else and then shared in dropbox.  On top of that many other applications like chat offer file transfer and sharing.Bottom line: I don&#39;t want them to fail ( I don&#39;t want Evernote to fail too), because it points to a world where only 5 to 10 big tech companies can survive. We need smaller innovative businesses to succeed too. It will be a sad day when a $2B business can&#39;t survive and is forced to sell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dropbox has been hammered by Wall Street ever since it went public. On the surface it should be trading well enough given it&#39;s revenue growth from when it went public to now, however, the narrative of competing with both Microsoft and Google was a tough one to play down.Revenue growth will slow down to below 20% in 2021 which basically starts to take DBX out of the high growth tech stock focus and it is trading at less than 5x 2021 revenue when the median is somewhere closer to the 12-14x range and that&#39;s for companies below 30% growth.The same was seen with Slack. Though they had great revenue growth, the narrative was that they couldn&#39;t compete with Microsoft and so their stock never really traded at a comparable revenue multiple compared to others.It could be said that they have a heavy spend on Sales and Marketing but the same could be said of plenty of other Enterprise tech focused companies like MongoDB that still commands a very high forward looking multiple.Unfortunately from the end-user side the experience has suffered somewhat and I&#39;ve personally switched away from Dropbox so I can&#39;t really say they are doing great on the product side and the amount of &#34;Growth Hacking for Revenue&#34; that is now part of the product experience is a bit off-putting.Also shows the potential for issues if you end up solely dependent on one product and don&#39;t diversity, especially if it&#39;s seen as a commodity.The work force reduction is purely to turn the company profitable on a net basis and the trailing twelve months they&#39;ve already gotten into the black. That&#39;s down from a $400MM loss just a couple of years ago.But the belief is that there isn&#39;t a tremendous amount of profitability internally, because the expenditures are just too high, and cutting further into that theoretically will reduce revenue growth further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is interesting because having layoffs at a company that should be going off like a rocket during a pandemic is odd.  What is going on at Dropbox that prevented them from taking advantage of the huge shift to remote work?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After our second daughter was born with a disability and we didn’t know if she’d make it to her first birthday I threw myself into my new job utterly. I was working 7-7 almost every day, took every opportunity to travel, and in general was absent from the situation as much as my “very important job” would allow.For me I felt completely powerless at the hospital. At work I got to solve “important” problems that were trivial in comparison to the things I had no control over, and was rewarded for doing so. It felt good to be useful when my life felt in complete chaos outside of work.At one point I stayed up all night to wrap up a project that wasn’t even that important. My boss, rather than being happy with me, sat me down and said I needed to make sure to sleep and take care of myself, that I was going to burn myself out. I really appreciate him saying that in retrospect, even though I felt a little offended at the time. I try to balance work and home life, and have developed a great relationship with my daughter, now two.In retrospect I wish I’d had the emotional stability to spend more time at the hospital, and to provide more emotional support for my wife who was saddled with going to the hospital almost every day.Things are better now, our daughter is doing very well, but the workaholism can be because of external factors, as overworking made me able to ignore the other, more depressing parts of my life where I lacked control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of the time I&#39;ve seen it, it is avoidance of the rest of their life. &#34;Change diapers? Oh, sorry honey, I uhh... gotta do this thing at work. Darn it!&#34;One phenomenon I&#39;ve always noticed about workaholics is that they THINK they are being more productive, but often times they are just spending more time spinning their wheels. Also the effect it has on their mood/interpersonal skills, and the pressure it puts on the rest of the team cancels it out. Seriously, one rude comment in the morning can throw a developer off for the rest of the day, it&#39;s not worth it.&#34;Man what&#39;s up with frank today?&#34;&#34;Oh he was pulling an all-nighter doing a non-urgent task.&#34;&#34;Did anybody ask him to?&#34;&#34;No. In fact we asked him to stop.&#34;I consider independent study, side-projects, reading a good book, smoking some dope, cooking a good meal with my partner, getting enough sleep, relaxing, and exercising(!!!!) part of my job. I don&#39;t care what kind of mutant you THINK you are, you will perform better if you go to bed and get a full nights rest and clean your brain out. It is just science.Finally, while it is true that &#34;work more = better review at work&#34;, it&#39;s just... not worth it. If your job is your whole life and you are not making +200k: GET A LIFE. You have better things to do with your time than make some other man money. Work is a &#34;safe place.&#34; Time goes in, money comes out. But that doesn&#39;t mean it is a healthy way to spend all of your time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been running an open source MathJax-based mathematics pastebin[1] since 2012 and I had received 2 donations for it until recently. Then a mathematician tweeted[2] about it convincing others to send some donations. After that kind gesture by him, I received 3 more donations. So pretty sure I can&#39;t make a living out of donations. :-) But I still appreciate them because they help in covering a portion of the hosting cost.Also, I never seriously expected donations for this project because I don&#39;t work much on it these days apart from cleaning up spam from time to time, complying with legal notices and occasional maintenance. I added a donation button only to see if someone would use it. Apart from covering hosting cost, I think an important side effect of the donations is that it provides some additional motivation to continue working on the project and develop it further which I indeed plan to do as soon as I can find the time for it.[1] http://mathb.in/[2] https://twitter.com/daveinstpaul/status/1345082256361193473"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first donation to my open source project (1) came from someone who went through the trouble of emailing me to ask how they could donate.Since then, I&#39;ve embraced receiving donations and last year I ended up receiving more than 10.000 euro. (2)I (re)donate everything to charity, for reasons (3), but even then it&#39;s a great motivator. If it wasn&#39;t for the money I would have burned out long ago. It really means a lot when people show their support in such a tangible way.I recommend everyone to both accept donations, and donate to others.(1) https://freesewing.org/

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been trying to encourage more &#34;Charityware&#34; for software [0]. My software is free and open source (MIT license) [1] but I also sell it for $5 and donate $3.50 of every sale to a cost-effective charity. My goal is to increase donations to the charity, and asking people for donations wouldn&#39;t be as effective. My software now has generated almost over $9,000 in donations.Personally, every purchase of my software feels rewarding. It&#39;s probably not as great as a regular donation, but it&#39;s a close second. Furthermore, since my software is pay-what-you-want (with a minimum of $5) people have been often giving more than the minimum. That really feels like a donation.[0] https://medium.com/@whyboris/charityware-doing-good-with-pro...[1] https://github.com/whyboris/Video-Hub-App"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have an interesting anecdote related to this.As it happens, I currently have COVID. When I first noticed I was getting sick, I was scheduled to fly in the near future, so I got a rapid COVID test that delivers results in 15 minutes.It was negative. I got another one, and it was negative too. I had thus intended to go ahead with the trip under the assumption I had a minor cold.Later, a few days before I was to fly, I lost all smell and taste. Now I didn’t know what to think. I wasn’t particularly congested, and the loss of smell was total. I’d never experienced this before. Could both tests have been false negatives?I delayed the flight (free of charge luckily, so no big deal) and got a test that had to be sent to a lab for analysis. A week later, the positive test result came back.Take from this what you will. I&#39;m not a scientist or a doctor and frankly there&#39;s nothing remotely intelligent I can say about the various tests out there for COVID. But if the rapid tests are as unreliable in general as they were for me, it’s sort of no wonder COVID is spreading like wildfire. I was very, very close to boarding a plane with an active case of COVID, and I would have if I hadn’t acted out of an abundance of caution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand why we don&#39;t implement the isolation procedures of countries that have gotten this under control, following these procedures for both foreign citizens AND US citizens:- When you arrive in the US, you either spend two weeks at a government approved hotel, at your expense, which is monitored by federal agents to make sure you don&#39;t leave your room.  You pay for room service for two weeks to get food.  This is what Singapore does.- If you don&#39;t want to stay at the government hotel, you agree to let the government track your cell phone for two weeks to make sure you stay in your home, and randomly call you twice a day to make sure you didn&#39;t ditch your phone.  This is what Taiwan does.As a plus, all the hotels near airports would be so thankful for all the forced business to make up for the loss of travel business.They should have been doing this for the last nine months.Edit: And obviously combine these rules with a relief bill that helps the industries that are hurt by these rules, or you know, everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A similar requirement has been enacted in Canada and what has happened is that Canadians with covid can&#39;t return home to Canada and are stuck abroad.
It really gives some teeth to the &#34;do not travel&#34; recommendation - if you get covid abroad you can&#39;t come home until you test negative. If you get covid at home and then go abroad you can&#39;t come home until you test negative.
I think people who previously would have travelled and just risked it will be a lot more careful now since they can&#39;t get home if they are sick with covid. Instead of dozens of flights per day entering canada with covid cases we now have zero [1].[1] http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19..."</p>
