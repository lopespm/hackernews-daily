								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all, I&#39;m the author of pdqsort that&#39;s credited in the post (to be clear: the authors acknowledged pdqsort at the bottom, I am not associated with the posted work directly). I recently held a talk at my institute on efficient in-memory sorting and the ideas in pdqsort, in case you&#39;re interested in hearing some of the theory behind it all: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jz-PBiWwNjcNext week I will hold another talk in the Dutch seminar on data systems design (https://dsdsd.da.cwi.nl/) on glidesort, a new stable sorting algorithm I&#39;ve been working on. It is a combination of adaptive quicksort (like pdqsort, fully adaptive for many equal elements) and an adaptive mergesort (like timsort, fully adaptive for long pre-sorted runs). It is the first practical implementation of an algorithm I&#39;m aware of that&#39;s fully adaptive for both. Like pdqsort it uses modern architecture aware branchless sorting, and it can use an arbitrary buffer size, becoming faster as you give it more memory (although if given a constant buffer size it will degrade to O(n (log n)^2) in theory, in practice for realistic workloads it&#39;s just a near-constant factor (c ~&lt;= 3-5) slower).The source code isn&#39;t publish-ready yet, I have to still do some extra correctness vetting and testing, and in particular exception-safety is still not yet fully implemented. This is important because I wrote it in Rust where we must always give back a valid initialized array, even if a comparison operator caused a panic. But I do have some performance numbers to quote, that won&#39;t significantly change.For sorting 2^24 randomly shuffled distinct u32s using a buffer of 2^23 elements (n/2), glidesort beats Rust&#39;s stdlib slice::sort (which is a classic timsort also using a buffer of n/2) by a factor of 3.5 times. When stably sorting the same numbers comparing only their least significant 4 bits, it beats stdlib slice::sort by 12.5 times using 6.5 times fewer comparisons, both numbers on my Apple M1 Macbook. All of this is just using single-threaded code with a generic comparison function. No SIMD, no threads, no type-specific optimizations.Finally, glidesort with a buffer size of &gt;= n/2 is faster than pdqsort."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun safety problems.Towards the end of this post, the author mentions a bunch of places where std::sort() blows up if your data or your sort rule doesn&#39;t exhibit strict weak ordering. In some cases you get a bad sort, which feels fair enough since you violated the rules the sort algorithm is relying on, but in others it literally has Undefined Behaviour in C++.Notably Rust&#39;s sort() and unstable_sort() do not have this problem, because of course these are safe Rust, and safe Rust doesn&#39;t have Undefined Behaviour. But why can this work?First up, one bullet which gets dodged is that Rust&#39;s floating point types (f32 and f64) are not Ord. Rust acknowledges that NaN != NaN and therefore we can&#39;t expect to go around sorting a slice of floating point values. In C++ that&#39;s on the programmer, in C++ the fact you can write a &lt; b means that type counts as ordered, even though it trivially isn&#39;t for several built-in types. So if you simply naively try to sort an [f32] Rust says you can&#39;t because it isn&#39;t Ord, you will need to write a lambda or whatever to Order these f32s and then if some of them are NaN your lambda is responsible for deciding what to do about that.But even if we insist on getting in harm&#39;s way, safe Rust promises to protect us anyway. For example if I make an array of a thousand misfortunate::OnewayGreater&lt;u8&gt;s they&#39;re only one byte each, yet they all insist they&#39;re Ordered greater than each other and even than themselves, Rust&#39;s sort() doesn&#39;t cause Undefined Behaviour on this input. It may never succeed, since all the elements to be &#34;sorted&#34; insist they&#39;re greater than each other, but it definitely won&#39;t segfault, trash unrelated memory or cause chaos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks, I&#39;m going to write all this out on a whiteboard the next time someone asks me to sort a linked list in a technical interview.Edit: just wanted to clarify that the point I&#39;m trying to make here is that if you want to ask someone if they&#39;ve memorized the answer to that question, go ahead and ask it in a technical interview, because the real well-considered answer looks like the linked article, and my honest non-smartass answer is that one should use the library function and not try to implement it themselves until they&#39;ve done sufficient research into the problem to prove to a reasonable degree that they indeed do need to re-implement sort() and that it&#39;s in the best interests of the business to fund such a project.Would love to read this over the phone to a recruiter and have them tell me that it&#39;s not what they have on their sheet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good lesson about the benefit of time when it comes to software development.  Mario 64 could have been a much much better game on the same hardware, but the time cost would have resulted in a release late enough that the entire game might have been considered irrelevant.Game consoles have had the benefit of the platform freezing for a few years allowing improvements to accumulate and later titles utilizing knowledge gained from the earlier titles.Much of the software we use every day could benefit from this level of scrutiny but the pressure to deliver on time means we won&#39;t get to see such benefits unless it becomes a crazy persons labour of love."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;roll those loops back up and don&#39;t compile in debug mode to achieve significant performance gains&#34; is not the takeaway I thought I&#39;d have going in, heh."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now that&#39;s a 10x programmer if I ever saw one. I&#39;m sure the compiler helped too. The generated code of C compilers from the 80&#39;s and 90&#39;s versus the generated code created by something like modern GCC -- it&#39;s like night and day. We&#39;re able to build faster tinier software than we ever have before, and it really helps to illuminate the impact modern tools have had when we apply that advantage to something old we already know."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great work! This might be unpopular among the HN crowd, but I think you can monetize this further by bundling this with an advising service.This idea of FIRE has been spreading beyond techies/Internet nerds and into other highly paid professionals like doctors. [0]. The main difference is that non-programmer professionals generally don&#39;t get a thrill out of min/max-ing financial projections.Such people might be willing to pay a few hundred dollars a year for someone to generate this kind of analysis with them and simply execute on it each year. Similar to how people pay for CPAs. My employer actually pays Goldman Sachs to provide a similar service for its employees (no commission, fiduciary advisors) but their tools suck compared to this.[0] For example https://www.whitecoatinvestor.com/, https://www.physicianonfire.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great, I took some time to get a fairly in depth plan together. There are two things that stuck out:1. You&#39;ve got RSU&#39;s (at first it wasn&#39;t clear  to me where this would be addressed, but I think it made sense once I came across it) but I don&#39;t see a dedicated strategy for dealing with ISO/NSO&#39;s. That&#39;d be helpful for the tech community especially.2. I spent the 10-15 minutes working on a plan knowing that I&#39;d need to upgrade to pro for every feature, but it seems like I need to upgrade to save my plan. I ended up not paying because I don&#39;t have enough time right now to fully evaluate this, but I might look back later. It would have been great if I could have entered my email and saved my plan without paying, and then had to later pay to access it. This gives you the benefit of getting my email address, and then sending me an email to access my plan so that I&#39;ve got a second touchpoint to your product when I check my email in the future.Looking forward to using this more in depth in the future!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so incredibly impressed with this tool. In addition to the slick interface, it has some killer features and niceties:- You can add a &#34;dependent expense&#34; (have a kid) at a certain age- You can run Monte Carlo simulations of your portfolio performance- Expenses can be configured to increase linearly, with inflation, up to an amount, or using a custom function that the user can input graphically- Adding a house purchase automatically cancels out your existing rent expense if you indicate that it will be your residence- Easily visualize all of your projected earnings from portfolio growth and losses due to inflation and taxesAs an avid YNAB-er, this is heaven."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is amazing how many large-scale applications run on a single or a few large RDBMS. It seems like a bad idea at first: surely a single point of failure must be bad for availability and scalability? But it turns out you can achieve excellent availability using simple replication and failover, and you can get huge database instances from the cloud providers. You can basically serve the entire world with a single supercomputer running Postgres and a small army of stateless app servers talking to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To resolve this, we ended up choosing to leave foreign key constraints unenforced on a few large tables.&gt; We reasoned this was likely safe, as Retool’s product logic performs its own consistency checks, and also doesn’t delete from the referenced tables, meaning it was unlikely we’d be left with a dangling reference.I was holding my breath here and I&#39;m glad these were eventually turned back on.Nobody should ever rely on their own product logic to ensure consistency of the database.The database has features (constraints, transactions, etc) for this purpose which are guaranteed to work correctly and atomically in all situations such as database initiated rollbacks that your application will never have control over."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey folks—I wrote the post! This was my biggest Postgres project to date, and it proved quite tricky since I didn&#39;t rehearse with a test database of the same size. I learned a bunch about Postgres, not least the incredibly powerful NOT VALID option for safely and quickly adding constraints.Happy to stick around and answer any questions you have."</p>

I really don&#39;t see how you get to 97% renewable when the state was burning natural gas to generate 2.8 GW of non-renewable power and had about 1.1 GW of nuclear at the time.  There might be some funny math here where they assign all of the &#34;dirty&#34; power generated in the state to exports and can claim that that California is running on renewable power.Source:  https://www.caiso.com/TodaysOutlook/Pages/supply.html"</p>

I made a animated graph showing this moment and its implications here https://youtu.be/Sq9Uq1DqhU8To deeply decarbonize you need to meet current demand and also make enough to charge the energy storage systems...on a cloudy string of winter days.However we will see headlines like this for the next 20 years at least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The grid operator cited is the California Independent System Operator.  How much of CA&#39;s electricity consumption is fed by that operator?In the article they mention 23GW from wind and solar.  A quick search says in 2018 CA&#39;s electrical generation capacity was 80GW (which I assume has only gone up).  So this 97% is a bit misleading, no?  It doesn&#39;t represent 97% of total CA electricity usage... it&#39;s less than 30%?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Under U.S. law, are there circumstances in which it could be acceptable to deliberately crash a plane?In this case, it clearly wasn&#39;t (crashing on public lands with risk of starting a wildfire and polluting them), but if you wanted to crash a plane for a scene in a movie, could you do so? Maybe crashing on private property in a predetermined location with appropriate fire department support and prior notification to air traffic control about your intentions?Can manufacturers perform genuine crashes (from controlled flight) on private property for safety tests, the way car manufacturers perform tests with crash test dummies?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh good. As a PPL working on an instrument rating this gladdens my heart. The aviation community isn’t just pilots. Many folks contribute to safety including ATC, first responders, SAR, aerospace engineers, investigators and many more. If you’d like a sense of how invested some of these people are in flight safety, listen to ATC recordings of incidents where you can hear back chatter between control facilities.This guys actions show a lack of appreciation for the work these people do and the care they put into that work.There’s also the risk of forest fire.I think the cherry on top would be if the USFS got him for littering."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are cases when server-side rendering (without SPA) is easier and faster. For example: documentation sites, blog-like sites, internet stores, sites like Hacker News. In all these cases, you can save on development time by writing just one application instead of two (server and client), and improve performance (no need to load multimegabyte JS applications and make multiple AJAX requests to display a page).Of course, there are cases when SPA-style application is better, for example: (graphic/circuit/text) editors, IDEs, mobile newsfeed-based apps - everything that resembles an app rather than a page with text, menus and images. But in these cases you usually don&#39;t need server-side rendering. And sometimes you cannot even use it - for example, if your code needs to know browser windows size to arrange objects on the page.So I think that SSR (running JS on server) is rarely useful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using server-side rendering for many years now and I find it to be almost zero overhead at this point. Yes, I had to do some initial work to set things up, but these days I don&#39;t even remember it&#39;s there.Most people make an assumption that in order to have SSR you need to run JavaScript (e.g. Node most of the time) on your backend. That is not a valid assumption.I think the title of the article could benefit from adding &#34;using Node&#34;, because much of the complexity described is something I do not encounter at all. I&#39;m using Clojure and ClojureScript with Rum as a React interface. Much (if not most) of my code is in cljc files, which get compiled with Clojure (for JVM on the backend) or ClojureScript (for JavaScript on the frontend). And the ClojureScript advanced compilation takes care of only including what is strictly necessary in the frontend compiled JavaScript.I mean, sure, you need to be careful not to do stupid things like trying to read from files, but otherwise I just don&#39;t encounter much friction. And I reap the benefits of using a single language for both backend and frontend, with most of my data model (e.g. business logic) code written only once, with SSR being a nice cherry on top."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been saying it for years - the hard part is not &#34;server side&#34; vs &#34;client side&#34;, it&#39;s making sure the state stays consistent between those 2 buckets.If you want to remove the hell from your life, you need to be all in on one or the other.For us, we&#39;ve been keeping all state server-side using things like Blazor and hand-rolled js-over-websocket UI frameworks. We never have to worry about more than ~10k users, so this works out great for us.If we were webscale, we&#39;d have to consider client side options."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have any kids, so I don&#39;t really feel comfortable telling folks how to raise theirs.But I will tell you my perspective.As someone who grew up in the &#34;be back home in time for supper&#34; 1970s, today&#39;s world seems completely foreign. When I started kindergarten, Mom walked me to school on the first day so that I&#39;d know the route. And after that I walked to school on my own until I learned to ride a bike.I rode to junior high, where there was parking for hundreds of bikes. Recently I drove by that school, and the bike racks were gone. This whole concept of waiting in traffic to pick up or drop off your kid wasn&#39;t even a thing.And I&#39;m so supremely grateful that I was raised that way. I&#39;m absolutely certain that early autonomy paid off later in life in countless ways.I&#39;d encourage you, if you&#39;re raising kids, to consider the upsides of so-called &#34;free range&#34;. Or, as we called it in the 70s, &#34;being a regular kid&#34;."</p>

He was in his own yard. The family lost their children to foster care. Ironically in foster care ACTUAL abuse rates are pretty darn high!&#34;When Cindy and Fred arrived home they were arrested for child neglect — then fingerprinted, strip searched, and held in jail overnight.Their kids, meanwhile, including their 4-year-old boy, were removed from the home and from their parents’ custody&#34;Mom worked in the school district ironically.&#34;We still do not have our children, we are fighting for our own freedom and due to the nature of my employment I am no longer employed,” she wrote. “My son was in his own yard playing basketball, not in the street or at the park.

He had no bathroom, but the responding officer found our yard good enough to relieve himself in while our son sat in a police car alone.&#34;Being accused of child abuse / neglect is a career ender. The idea of my 4 year old being taken is beyond belief. What is so ironic is so many real / terrible things are happening (crime of all sorts / abuse in the traditional sense / financial fraud online) where nothing happens. But your kid shoots some hoops in their own yard, you lose custody. You are jailed and strip searched. You lose your job.I realize big government is here to protect us, I just wish they would focus on the harder problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a parent, none of the risks are as profound as that of some other member of the public calling the police to inform on your “dangerous parenting”.I’ve deliberately chosen to live in a walkable part of the Bay Area in the hopes that my kids can be more independent when they get older, but I’m more worried about the social pushback than I am about their safety."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m excited to see more profiling tools for Python!This sounds like it does peak memory, which is critical for batch jobs, since that&#39;s the bottleneck. Memory is fundamentally different than performance in that it&#39;s a limited resource, instead of cumulative cost; making any part of the program faster almost always helps speed up the program (at least a little, or at least reduces CPU load), but optimizing non-peak memory has no impact. You have to be able to identify the peak in order to reduce memory usage.If you want peak memory profiling for Python that also runs on macOS, check out https://pythonspeed.com/fil/ (ARM support has some issues, but once I unpack my new Mac Mini I plan to fix it.)Ways memray is better than Fil:- Native callstacks.- More kinds of reports, and ability to do custom post-processing of data.- Much lower overhead (but not always, see reply).- Subprocess support.Fil I suspect has better flamegraphs: https://pythonspeed.com/articles/a-better-flamegraph/And if you&#39;re running Python batch jobs, and want both peak memory and performance profiling in production, check out Sciagraph: https://pythonspeed.com/sciagraph/(You can probably cobble together something like Sciagraph with py-spy + memray, but you won&#39;t e.g. get timeline reports designed with batch jobs in mind.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Want to chime in to say it&#39;s awesome that Bloomberg is releasing this product to the world. I don&#39;t think many financial organizations would even consider releasing anything as open source, even if it is as general purpose as this tool. My current one (HFT,MM) wouldn&#39;t go for it.It also shows good engineering practices. I&#39;d venture a guess that they are probably one of the better ones in the space.Makes me want to work there! Maybe one day..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why is no one questioning whether this is real?Reddit is full of far-fetched stories like this that ultimately turn up to be completely fabricated (obviously for the purpose of internet points). While this one isn&#39;t ridiculously far-fetched, it&#39;s definitely borderline.Also, the first thing that came to my mind when reading this was the movie Vivarium [1], where one of the main characters does almost exactly this. It sounds like the author watched that movie, modified it slightly, and posted it to /r/advice.[1] https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8368406"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s interesting about this to me is the way it sort of causes you to examine why certain things are acceptable hobbies and other things aren&#39;t. This particular hobby has three notable attributes:1. It&#39;s risky.2. The end product doesn&#39;t seem particularly useful if we set aside the mental/physical benefits. i.e.: it&#39;s done for it&#39;s own sake.3. It&#39;s novel.I would argue that 1 and 2 are attributes that a great number of hobbies share. Skiing, Mountain biking, football, kayaking, woodworking, sitting in a chair and playing video games all weekend. All these things carry some very specific and often non trivial risks to health or bodily harm over time.Of course because these hobbies aren&#39;t novel, the benefits of the hobby are well understood. Our understanding of the risks and how to mitigate them are also quite a bit more understood.It seems to me that the real &#39;problem&#39; with this tunnel digging hobby is how novel it is. Which consequently leads to a lack of knowledge about what the risks and benefits may be.Of course it&#39;s possible the poor guy is just dealing with a mental illness."</p>
