								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of another example of video-game inspired tactics:Just before he reached the end zone, with 17 seconds remaining, Stokley cut right at 90 degrees and ran across the field. Six seconds drained off the clock before, at last, he meandered across the goal line to score the winning touchdown. For certain football fans, the excitement of a last-minute comeback now commingled with the shock of the familiar: It&#39;s hard to think of a better example of a professional athlete doing something so obviously inspired by the tactics of videogame football. When I caught up with Stokley by telephone a few weeks later, I asked him point-blank: &#34;Is that something out of a videogame?&#34; &#34;It definitely is,&#34; Stokley said. &#34;I think everybody who&#39;s played those games has done that&#34; — run around the field for a while at the end of the game to shave a few precious seconds off the clock. Stokley said he had performed that maneuver in a videogame &#34;probably hundreds of times&#34; before doing it in a real NFL game.https://www.wired.com/2010/01/ff-gamechanger/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of those events that I&#39;m of several minds about:
1) This is what keeps people outside the scene interested and taking note - NASCAR absolutely should publicize and play up this moment, it brings a lot of folks to the sport. It was incredibly awesome.2) A lot of times something like this is how you form some new regulations - it&#39;s truly one of those &#34;You know, this was excellent but we can&#39;t do it again&#34; situations.3) The best course forward is to leave it alone and legal in this moment, publicize it, but also treat it as the formation of some new rules.Side note, Nascar 2005, which he referenced as one of his inspirations for this, is one of my favorite gamecube games. I remember picking it up and playing it for hours on end, the soundtrack was awesome, and it didn&#39;t feel like an EA cash-grab at the time. Man how times have changed...Edit: Extra info - the 11 of Hamlin has previously made it into the chase for the champion ship by _intentionally wrecking drivers_ , so by and large a huge part of the fan base believes he got what was coming to him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is also the shortest short track NASCAR races, its in Martinsville, VA. Known as &#34;The paperclip&#34;.This was a lot fun to watch.  #1 Ross Chastain had to get more points than #11 Denny Hamlin to qualify.  He was in 10th I think when he went full send with the wall, putting an arms length in front of Denny at the very last second to finish #5th.Short track races are fun because the do have a lot of rubbing, but they dont nearly go as fast as the super-speedways.  And just generally you dont see something like this.  I understand NASCAR is gonna make a rule to prevent it, but you know they are gonna promote the heck outta this clip.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martinsville_Speedway"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congratulations to the Remix team. Though neither Remix&#39;s nor Shopify&#39;s blog posts make it clear, I&#39;m guessing Michael and Ryan will continue to lead Remix development while hopefully having a team of focused engineers working with them. Since Shopify really believes in and wants to use the tech, it&#39;s great that they&#39;ll be able to pay engineers to continue to develop it in the open. I believe Remix also was VC funded so Shopify probably also made their investors whole?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is huge. Remix is my favorite React framework at the moment. It is by far the best abstraction I&#39;ve seen of client/server model. Their API abstraction layer is just right, working with native browser and nodejs APIs, not obscure them. Typescript support is amazing.I&#39;d bet my money on Remix model and direction vs Nextjs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting move by Shopify, given that they have Hydrogen [0]. I was half expecting Hydrogen to become its own all-purpose framework, but alas, they seem to plan for both to co-exist.&gt; While Hydrogen is focused on commerce, Remix is focused lower in the stack, and will continue to be a general web solution that scales from content through commerce and all the way to apps. Shopify will use Remix across many projects where it makes sense, and you can expect to see more of our developer platform with first-class Remix support over time.[0] https://hydrogen.shopify.dev"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The original thread emphasized too much on a few grants, which I feel is a minor issue considering how small part of the annual revenue they were. Not surprised Wikipedia is able to defend it easily.&gt; &#34;Awards and grants&#34; amounted to $9.8 million, of which $5 million (possibly $5.5 million) represented a grant to the Wikimedia Foundation&#39;s own Endowment held by the Tides Foundation. This leaves somewhere between $4 and $5 million for actual grants made to the community – a figure dwarfed by the Wikimedia Foundation&#39;s $50 million budget surplus in 2020–2021. There was no lack of money for grants.The actual problem is that the Foundation reached its endowment goal, five years before the the deadline it set [1], and yet, they keep guilt-tripping and pretending as if they are running out of money. How&#39;s it not profiteering? They could be honest and add, &#34;We have already reached our goal. But raising more could help us find more avenues to increase the world&#39;s knowledge,&#34; and they would be completely in the right. I bet fewer people would donate if they realized that they are not funding running expenses, at all.Addendum: If you&#39;re considering donating to Wikipedia, I suggest you look into doing it for Internet Archive. The complexity of their project and running expenses is way more than Wikipedia, and yet, they just received 12% of the amount that Wikipedia got in 2020 [2]. They just have $4M in net assets, and yet, I have never seen them guilt-tripping regular users.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fundraising_statisti...[2]: https://projects.propublica.org/nonprofits/organizations/943..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The money was transferred to an outside organisation, Tides Advocacy, sometime in the 2019–2020 financial year when the Foundation found it had a large amount of money left over because of an underspendThis is the root of the problem. Wikimedia rises too much money, and instead of putting it in a fund they &#34;need&#34; to find projects, programmes and - now apparently - outside organization that are in no way accountable to Wikimedia.Instead of burning all the money they are donated, Wikimedia should first and foremost strive to secure the technical and financial continuity of the project by e.g. investing a lion&#39;s share of the donations to a distributing fund that provides perpetual passive income from e.g. stock market dividends. Only once that passive income surpasses the current and foreseeable technical running costs (hosting, bandwidth, project and engineering staff) should they start giving money to external organizations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Basically the reason why I will not donate to any large organization. Imagine donating to an organization because you think it helps them pay for their servers or devs and then it enters an intangible web of different obscure organizations, all donating to one another in some obscure way. The cause it goes to is &#34;external organizations that support knowledge equity by addressing the racial inequities preventing access and participation in free knowledge&#34;, which is about the most nebulous, meaningless &#34;cause&#34; imaginable.
Where does the money go? Unkown.
Who benefits? The charities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes!!! I have been saying for years that lower level protocols are a bad joke at this point, but nobody in the industry wants to invest in making things better. There are so many improvements we could be making, but corporations don&#39;t see any &#34;immediate shareholder value&#34;, so they sit around happy as pigs in shit with the status quo.What&#39;s kind of hilarious about this paper is, these are just the network-layer problems! It completely ignores that the &#34;port number&#34; abstraction for service identification has completely failed due to the industry glomming onto HTTP as some sort of universal tunnel encapsulation for all application-layer protocols. And then there&#39;s all the non-backend problems!And that&#39;s just TCP. We still lack any way to communicate up and down the stack of an entire transaction, for example for debugging purposes. We should have a way to forward every single layer of the stack across each hop, and return back each layer of the stack, so that we can programmatically determine the exact causes of network issues, automatically diagnose them, and inform the user how to solve them. But right now, you need a human being to jump onto the user&#39;s computer and fire up an assortment of random tools in mystical combinations and use human intuition to divine what&#39;s going on, like a god damn Networking Gandalf. And we&#39;ve been doing it this way for 40+ years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get where this is coming from, but no. We don&#39;t need to replace TCP in the datacentre.Why?because for things that are low latency, need rigid flow control, or other 99.99% utilisation case, one doesn&#39;t use TCP. (Storage, which is high throughput, low latency and has rigid flow control, doesn&#39;t [well ignore NFS and iscisi] use TCP)Look if it really was that much of a problem then everyone in datacentres would move to RDMA over infiniband. For shared memory clusters, thats what&#39;s been done for years. but for general purpose computing its pretty rare. Most of the time its not worth the effort. Infiniband is cheap now, so its not that hard to deploy RDMA[1] type interconnects. Having a reliable layer2 with inbuilt flow control solves a number of issues, even if you are just slamming IP over the top.shit, even 25/100gig is cheap now. so most of your problems can be solved by putting extra nics in your servers and have fancypants distributed LACP type setups on your top of rack/core network.The biggest issue is that its not the network that&#39;s constraining throughput, it either processing or some other non network IO.[1]I mean it is hard, but not as hard as implementing a brand new protocol and expecting it to be usable and debuggable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The data model for TCP is a stream of bytes. However, this is not the right data model for most datacenter applications. Datacenter applications typically exchange discrete messages to implement remote procedure callsThis isn&#39;t just a datacenter problem. Every single network protocol I&#39;ve ever created or implemented is message based, not stream based. Every messaging system. Every video game. Every RPC transport.But, because we can&#39;t have nice things, message framing has to be re-implemented on top of TCP in a different, custom way by every single protocol. I&#39;ve basically got message framing-over-TCP in muscle memory at this point, in each of the variants you commonly see.The only kinda-sorta exceptions I know about are HTTP/1.1 and telnet. But HTTP/1.1 is still a message oriented protocol; just with file-sized messages. (And even this stops being true with http2 anyway).In my opinion, the real problem is the idea that &#34;everything is a file&#34;. Byte streams aren&#39;t a very useful abstraction. &#34;Everything is a stream of messages&#34; would be a far better base metaphor for computing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am of two minds of this and would invite people to give me some opinions on this thing.On one hand, I love free speech and think it is good. The innovation capable from people being ably to publish their views, congregate freely, etc. is a foundational good I believe in.On the other hand, I&#39;m aware that certain influential figures explicitly manipulate their speech in order to primarily amass personal power regardless of any second-order effects. E.g. cults are horrible, even though people are freely congregating, they just feel like they can&#39;t leave because of the emotional abuse these influential figures are heaping via their speech.On a third hand, the loved one of a politician was severely injured because of someone who believes the incorrect speech of influential figures and I desperately do not want further injury or violence to occur spurned by incorrect speech on the facts of reality.So what&#39;s to be done about the actual, real harm being done, while also protecting free speech? I don&#39;t want to assume that assaulting people is just the cost of free speech. That just seems so wrong to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Right to repair&#34; always seems a weak formulation. It&#39;s great to have
&#34;rights&#34; but people don&#39;t always care to exercise them, and can be
dissuaded from exercising them.Right To Repair sounds nice. It alliterates. But of course we have a
right to repair our stuff. That goes without saying.What&#39;s really at issue is a duty upon manufacturer&#39;s not to obstruct
the four R&#39;s, to;- refuse- reuse- repair- recycleLet&#39;s get specific, instead of a wishy &#34;rights&#34; formulation.No technology must ever by soft-mandated or made a dependency so as to
preclude an ethical, environmental or economic choice to not partake
in its use, or to substitute other choices.No technology should be encumbered with locks, licenses or mechanisms
that affect the post-sale rights of its owner to repurpose or modify
as they see fit (all other safety and contention (RF) issues can be
dealt with at a another layer of legislation and enforcement.)No impediment shall be made to the access, manufacture and distribution
of spare parts or consumables, software updates, power supplies,
connectors etcDesigns should not, by the use of adhesives, welding, non-standard
fixings, unnecessary integration, traps, and fuses, prevent the easy
disassembly and reuse of modular components."</p>

Otherwise you bought a service and not a product.Any service you decide to run on the device, should be possible (without explicit approval of the manufacturer) to be provided by any company. The current situation is like you bought a TV and you can only watch the TV-network of the manufacturer.Needless to say, within this law it should be allowed for any company to perform repairs too, or provide hardware extensions, etc."</p>

I&#39;m going out on a limb, but perhaps macOS&#39; Dark Mode, or VSCode&#39;s dark mode, wouldn&#39;t exist without Solarized blazing that path.It&#39;s kinda funny how, before Solarized, I would see tons of gimmicky themes like some that were going for a Matrix or &#34;classic terminal&#34; feel, going all in on a certain theme but eschewing real usefulness. I want my basic terminal colors to remain adjacent to their intended hues! I want different keywords/tokens in my code to be distinguishable!Ethan&#39;s application of color theory/science to the landscape was like a beacon in the darkness.Before Solarized, I used Zenburn (I actually still do in some environments, I&#39;m not too keen on the blueish hue of Solarized backround.)

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Developer of Solarized here. Glad that it continues to be a popular design. I&#39;ve let the github languish and regret that. Luckily since it&#39;s just a color scheme the website and info on github has been enough for it to continue to propagate.There have been plenty of other color schemes that I think it&#39;s safe to say have been inspired by Solarized and this is very satisfying to see.

I feel like he is acknowledging his own shortcomings, and how while he likes the immaturity of hacking together a racecar, but if Comma is going to go to the next level, then he needs someone who can pilot a boat, and George is not that pilot.  I appreciate that awareness, and I appreciate that he has the ability to detach himself and move onwards this way.Kudos to you, George.  I appreciate and respect what you do.  Thanks for letting us have a glimpse at it -- I personally find it very inspiring and encouraging for me and what I do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Although I haven&#39;t done such great things as Geohot, I connect the spirit he is describing. In my mind I have already solved the technical problems my firm will face over the next 3 years, and I no longer have the patience to see them implemented. I am languishing in my role as a result."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"6 months ago it was all painted (maybe seemingly, though, by prior executives who weren&#39;t speaking for Musk) as if this wouldn&#39;t be a big deal for employees, which to me makes this idea that people are being rapidly fired &#34;for cause&#34; after a suddenly-imposed weekend work shift deadline extra shitty :/. (Even if I do sometimes claim that Twitter is incompetent as an organization or bloated with idle staff, these are humans that deserve some basic respect with how they handle a transition plan.)https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/25/technology/twitter-employ...&gt; At the meeting with employees on Monday [April 25], executives tried to assure employees that they wouldn’t be shortchanged by Mr. Musk’s acquisition. Mr. Agrawal told employees that their stock options would convert to cash when the deal with Mr. Musk closes, which he estimated would take between three and six months. Employees would receive their same benefits packages for a year after the deal was finalized and there were no immediate plans for layoffs, he added."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unfortunately, this palette does not pass WCAG[1], which seems a weird thing to not have tested for if you&#39;ve made a palette intended for web UI.If you own/manage this project: install the Axe browser extension[2], run it on your site, go &#34;...oh...oh no...&#34; and then unfortunately, take accessibility seriously and get to revising =/[1] https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/[2] https://www.deque.com/axe/browser-extensions/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I super don&#39;t understand the marketplace of color themes.For sure this is my own ignorance talking and not to do with the projects themselves, but I have questions like: they have a coming-soon slack channel and discord. What are they talking about in there? Is it really just friends talking about shades of the color blue? (Wonderful if so!) Or is there some service being offered, or is it just design aficionados using this as a gathering place to talk about general design things?Are these projects created by design nerds who simply love it so much that they create things like this or the Dracula theme project for fun? (Excellent!) Or is there some corporate motivation for pushing people to adopt certain color themes?I think maybe the primary source of my confusion is that the nordtheme.com and draculatheme.com websites in particular feel like product pages rather than &#34;here&#39;s a cool thing&#34; pages. Was anyone else looking around for a &#39;pricing&#39; tab?Wait, Dracula does have a pricing page! Is there really enough demand for color themes to develop a business model around?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think we need a thread for every single terminal colorscheme out there, but gruvbox is my favourite by far. Warm earthy tones, comes in light or dark with 3 contrast options, and no pretentious waffle about color theory or being inspired by childhood holidays or whateverhttps://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox"</p>
