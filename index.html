								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It might be worth mentioning a famous abdication which caused a lot of consternation, albeit in another game.  I love this story but may have gotten some details wrong.Marion Tinsley was world checkers champion from 1955-1958, then took a break, then again from 1975-1991, when he resigned in protest (at age 64).  He was utterly dominant; indeed it is hard to think of a competitor in all of history more dominant over his sport or game than Tinsley.In 1990 Tinsley decided to play Chinook, the best checkers computer program in the world.  Chinook had placed second at the US Nationals so it had the right to enter the world championships, but the US and British checkers federations refused to allow it.So Tinsley resigned his title.  Tinsley then played Chinook in an unofficial match (which he won).This power play really stuck it to the federations: nobody wanted to be named the new world champion knowing Tinsley was fully capable of crushing them.  Eventually everyone came to an agreement to let Tinsley be the &#34;champion emeritus&#34;.Tinsley played Chinook four years later, at age 68, still probably the best player in the world.  But in the middle of the match he complained of stomach pains and withdrew after only six games (of 20), all drawn.  Tinsley&#39;s pains were real: he later died of pancreatic cancer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Time to change the format. It&#39;s understandable you don&#39;t want to spend your whole career preparing for these long matches all the time. For the challenger it&#39;s 6 months of preparing, but for Carlsen it would&#39;ve been his 6th time of preparing for this in a few years.They have also become less entertaining. 12 matches is long (edit, 14 now), but no one dares to take any risks. Caruana was just defensive and all games ended in a draw. Karjakin they both at least won each their game, but still had to go to rapid tie-breaks. And against Nepo it was a steamroll, understandably meeting him again isn&#39;t that exciting.It&#39;s also almost impossible for a new person to get a chance. Even Carlsen didn&#39;t like the format and didn&#39;t participate in the Candidates for a few years, and when he first did he almost didn&#39;t win it to be allowed to play the WC match. Even though he clearly was the best player at the time.I wonder how this will affect the status of the title, when it&#39;s in practice is now a title-fight between the second best players.Also what will happen to the hype in Norway? Each WC match has so far been live streamed on all big news pages, biggest TV channels etc. It will still be a Christmas tradition to watch the rapid WC tournament I guess, but I&#39;m afraid this will lead to less coverage. But just to tell how big Carlsen is in Norway: This is the top news on all outlets at the moment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obviously this raised the issue of Bobby Fischer. The article mentions this but doesn&#39;t really go into the details.Fischer beat Spassky in Rejkyavik in 1972 for the World Championship. This took almost 3 months (July to September) and there was controversy, disagreement and negotiation about where and how it would take place. This had the backdrop of being a Cold War proxy too of course.Interestingly, Fischer didn&#39;t play competitive Chess after this. He was set to defend the title against the eventual challenger, Anatoly Karpov, in 1975. Fischer too didn&#39;t like the tendency for draws and proposed a format of first to 10 wins (with Fischer retaining the title in case of a 9-9). This was rejected and Fischer ultimately abdicated and never played competitive Chess again. He also became a semi-nomadic recluse too.But it also wasn&#39;t Fischer&#39;s first hiatus from the game. There was the 1972-1975 gap but also anotehr in the 1960s. He clearly seemed like a troubled guy.I&#39;ve always found it fascinating the level of commitment required to play Chess at this level. I certainly have never had any interest in that (nor the ability, to be clear). No one really seems to know how to solve this without going to a more blitz like format.Chess at the highest level seems to revolve around memorizing a whole book of openings and defenses while being able to take advantage of mistakes but also finding novel approaches in standard openings and defenses but now it seems you have to go fairly deep into a game before you go off-book."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The font is used by the teamviewer website. When inviting a partner to a teamviewer session, one can do so by sharing the invitation url.The invitation url looks like this (where XXXXXXXX is the session code).  https://get.teamviewer.com/v15/en/sXXXXXXXX

The website will check if a teamviewer font is installed (using javascript). If the font is found, the web site assumes that teamviewer is installed. The teamviewer installer also registers a protocol handler in the operating system.
The website (javascript code) will thus try to launch teamviewer directly using a url like the following:  teamviewer8://instantsupport/?sid=XXXXXXXX

Otherwise, if the font is not found, it will prompt the user to download and install the teamviewer application.Source:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"30 days before your subscription expires, teamviewer send you a friendly email to remind you to that your subscription expires in 30 days and to be sure to renew before then in order to not lose service.What that email does not tell you is that unless you cancel your subscription at least 30 days (ie on that very day) before your sub expires they will renew you automatically and demand a full year&#39;s subscription under threat of legal proceedings.Personally I believe that the purpose of this email is to lull you into a false sense of security that you can just let your subscription lapse instead of renewing when that is far from the case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My proposal:1. Browsers should ship with a set of fonts used just in the web browser that web designers can count on. Right now, there isn&#39;t a font I can count on finding in Chrome on all platforms. This especially matters for non-English languages, where a different system font can lead to a website that looks very different.2. Browsers should not load fonts installed in the operating system. It&#39;s a fingerprinting vulnerability. And it also causes issues where the system-installed font is unexpectedly different from platform to platform. For example, Arial is different across platforms, especially once you consider non-English languages."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My car (Lexus) and my iPhone X:The car detects iPhone presence, like, 50% of the time. If it does detect it, it shows me a couple of half-naked shaved guys hugging each other and begins playing &#34;Songs of Innocence&#34; the moment I turn the ignition on. I tried deleting this song from the iPhone, but it auto-magically restores itself somehow, as if it is in the telephone&#39;s firmware. The image of men hugging in shade is baked into my mind forever at this point.As I want to set my plans in silence, I press stop on the dashboard. I set my Google Maps navigation, turn the knob to increase the volume so I could hear instructions, and this triggers &#34;Songs of Innocence&#34; to continue playing and the second burst of outrage in my cardiovascular system. I press the stop the second time, and at this point can continue on my journey - but should I try to increase the volume again, I have to remember the hugging men are always there.Once (or twice), the phone just went berserk and couldn&#39;t stop playing them. I tried everything, but the Songs were playing, and the men were hugging while I was doing 70 mph on the motorway. I had to reboot the phone, but after the reboot, the car was unable to pair with it.I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s a Lexus problem, or an Apple problem, but what I know is that I really fucking hate U2."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried to learn why BT is still somehow painful to use, and the article basically does not have an answer.My take from comments here and my experience:- Makers of BT devices can&#39;t agree on many important common things (easy discovery / pairing mode, priority, etc), and have little incentive to seek agreement. It&#39;s like phone chargers before USB.- Makers of BT devices tend to cut corners and/or add not-entirely-standard features. They &#34;save&#34; on writing a good driver. They care little if devices made by their competition don&#39;t work reliably or at all in the mix. (And even sometimes their own!)- RF noise makes radio interfaces like BT inherently not always reliable. But the user never notices when a small EM storm rages nearby, for the user it&#39;s just &#34;damn bluetooth glitches for no reason at all&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yeah, but thats hardly news, we have known that for decades. Otherwise direct serotonin releasers would be the most useful ADs. But these mostly give people nausea and serotonin syndrome. ADs work mostly by being FIASMAs, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress, increasing neurogenesis and neuroplasticity, increasing the activity of other monoaminergic systems, and the serotonergic portion is mostly explained by downregulation of 5-HT1A autoreceptors due to chronicly high extrasynaptic 5-HT levels. This also explains the delayed action of ADs.At least this is my knowledge from when I last researched this topic in depth.But that would be a little bit too much for the general public, so it is simplified, to this annoying effect that everyone talks of &#34;low serotonin levels&#34; where in fact the underlying systems are way more complex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a theory which I can’t substantiate, just anecdotes and conversations I had throughout the years. But, I’m convinced a lot of depression/anxiety stems from thinking too much and that in turn is caused by an ever complex word with looser and looser guidelines or norms.I’m not making judgements weather this is necessarily good or bad but rather observing.In the past, even as recent as the 50s but certainly before the 20th century, a persons course in life was mostly determined at birth.You’re born, you play, you grow up, work the fields or a job, get married, have kids of your own and die. Society was more rigid and pretty much funnelled you through a “tried and tested path”, for good or for worse. And the lack of information made things “simpler” in a way in the sense you had a small number of people to get input from. Take child rearing for example. Many modern people worry so much and research ways to “optimise” their children for example ( I’m thinking of a lot of questions I saw on the parenting stack overflow ) whereas in the last, you’d just ask your own parents. And, since they were older, the assumption was they knew what they where talking about, even if it was not necessarily true. Same with health, same with sexuality, relationships, a lot of things.Essentially lack of information and a rigid social structure meant fewer choices which meant less thinking. And less thinking meant less depression and anxiety.Now when you have a world of information at your hands, you have way more things to think about, to worry about and to look for information on how to fix or improve.I’m not sure medication, even “working” one is a sustainable solution to what appears to me to be an environmental problem rather than a biological one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Other clinicians say, however, that the notion of depression being because of a simple chemical imbalance is outmoded anyway, and that antidepressants remain a useful option for patients alongside other approaches including talking therapies.This is the key line in the summary.The concept of attacking an idea no one really believes is really a straw man.More importantly the modern practice of medicine is &#34;evidence based medicine&#34;, not &#34;mechanism based medicine&#34;.
That means treatments are tested as to if they work, not how they work.
Ideally in multiple well run double blinded randomised controlled trials with at least some against treatment as usual.
Unlike the past when we thought more about how they might work, theorising something is off about someone&#39;s humors and adjusting with leeches.Anyone looking for a truly mind bending result should look at Hjorth et al. 2021 [0], the study recruited people with social phobia and gave them all an SSRI (escitalopram). Half were told they were getting a sham active placebo and &#34;should not expect to get better&#34;, half were told &#34;you&#39;re getting the known effective treatment&#34;.Headline result being told you are being treated leads to 4x as much response with brain changes in the dopamin networks.In the meanwhile, rather than worry about how antidepressants work, why not take a look at electroconvulsive therapy which has proven time and again to be the most effective treatment for depression. Yet we have no idea how it works, other than knowing a decent seizure in those without epilepsy makes you less sad? What on earth.[0] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-021-01682-3"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have private access to some pretty cool motorsports/boat-racing/etc stuff that a majority of people don&#39;t get to see (prototype/development vehicle testing, etc). I thought it might be fun for me to make some videos of these and share them, with the full support of the owners/teams behind this stuff. They gave me extra access, let me film everything over 2 days (3 full days of work considering the remote location in another state etc), and I put my first video up on YouTube showing off a prototype vehicle that was going for a world record.The video went pretty viral... 8 digit views, got me 5 digit subscriber count, was posted on dozens and dozens of news sites and blogs and shared widely. I was excited, off to a great start with this whole YouTube thing.No music, no audio other than the engine sounds, absolutely zero reason anyone could possibly do a copyright strike... right?Nope, some church minister in some tiny country did a copyright strike saying they own the rights to the word &#34;spirit&#34; in my video title (it was part of the name of the vehicle itself)... so they got all the money I earned from that video + I got a strike on my channel and a scary warning from YouTube saying my entire Google account could get banned including my Gmail. I disputed it with a very clear explanation of the situation, and they quickly reply saying they sided with the complainant and they&#39;ll be ignoring all future disputes.Fuck YouTube/Google.Edit: I went back to find the emails from Google and realised the story is even crazier than I remember. YouTube never reviewed the dispute, they let the person making the claim review their own dispute!!&gt; Hi [Name],&gt; After reviewing your dispute, [Dodgy Fuck&#39;s Name] has decided that their copyright claim is still valid.&gt; Copyrighted content: Spirit&gt; Claimed by: [Dodgy Fuck&#39;s Name]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"tl;dw: Fran is a YouTube creator (mostly electronics and space videos) and has been having ongoing issues with illegitimate copyright claims made against her YouTube videos, including NASA public domain content and the sound of wind(!). She even has the physical copy of one Apollo 12 scene which she telecine&#39;d to digital, uploaded, and then an unclear party made a claim against that video which is currently successful.She also discusses &#34;Visual Claim&#34;[0] and how this will make things worse and how copyright trolls have nothing to lose with doubling down on illegitimate claims.One issue I have with her is her insistence that alternative video platforms, such as Odysee/LBRY, will never have a chance against YouTube. That&#39;s definitely true today but anti-trust or other government action could eventually shake that up.[0] https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7037712?hl=en"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time I feel myself wanting to make content, I see stuff like this and I nope out of it. Why put so much effort into sharing your passion with the world only to be frozen out  by some morons that are enabled by a billion-dollar company that doesn&#39;t care about you?Copyright strikes are such a blatant example of the legal system being bought and paid for by the wealthy, it&#39;s not even funny."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yeah, people don&#39;t want to work when they make crap wages, don&#39;t get any real time off (maybe not even paid).. don&#39;t get paid if they are sick, can&#39;t enjoy having a kid because they can&#39;t even afford it.. and worry about breaking the bank for every little medical thing. worry about having to stick at a shitty job because &#34;it has benefits&#34;Healthcare for all that has 0 to do with employers and is near &#34;free&#34;.. guaranteed time off, sick leave, maternity leave, and real assistance on early childcare (as in nearly free nurserys etc) would fix like 90% of the US&#39;s problems when we talk about things like &#34;people don&#39;t want to work&#34;.But this will never happen so where we are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nobody ever &#34;wanted&#34; to work, and that&#39;s been true since at least the agricultural revolution. People work because they have to, and stop the minute they don&#39;t.Today still, in some parts of the world, lower echelons of society are called &#34;the working class&#34;, because needing to work is very effective at discriminating between haves and have nots. If work was somehow desirable in and of itself, it would be the other way around: the working class would describe those lucky enough to have a job.People complaining that &#34;nobody wants to work anymore&#34; are usually people not working themselves, who fail to understand that in order to find someone willing to do your own laundry, you have to pay them a fair wage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People have been complaining about this since literally before Christ.“[Young people] are high-minded because they have not yet been humbled by life, 
nor have they experienced the force of circumstances.
...
They think they know everything, and are always quite sure about it.”
-Aristotle"</p>
