								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OK, for starters, ECC has to become standard.Then the rate of ECC errors has to be monitored. If something is trying a rowhammer attack, it&#39;s going to cause unwanted bit flips which the ECC will correct. Normally, the ECC error rate is very low. Under attack, it should go up. So an attack should be noticeable.  You might get some false alarms, but that just means it&#39;s time to replace memory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article:
&gt; We demonstrate that it is possible to trigger Rowhammer bit flips on all DRAM devices today despite deployed mitigations on commodity off-the-shelf systems with little effort.The fact that user space code can cause bit flips in your RAM is a hardware bug. I&#39;d love to see this code in memory testers like memtest86 so I could send the RAM back if it ever caught a problem like this.I guess it shows just how close to the edge of not working our modern computing environment is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Eventually, it will be obvious that running shared workloads on a single piece of physical hardware has fundamentally unremediatable security implications. This slow recognition is deeply perpendicular with how the current landscape of x86 chips are both manufactured and priced, as well as how cloud providers have structured billions of dollars in DC investment; in other words, they&#39;ll down-play it. This will be a massive opportunity for ARM &amp; SoC manufacturers in the coming years, as its far better positioned to offer, for example, a single rack appliance with 64 individual 2-core mini-computers at a price-point competitive with a 128 core x86 rack, as one computer.Computing moves in cycles:- 2000s: gigahertz race on each core- 2010s: increase core counts, multicore everything- 2020s: back to core-efficiency and increasing per-core performance. M1 is already leading this charge, but is obviously a mismatch for a DC environment.AMD and Intel need to adjust, or face extinction. Its not just about pushing ultra-high per-core performance (they&#39;re both good at this); its about pushing for more efficiency, so per-blade density in a DC can be pushed higher in the face of more, smaller individual computers. If they don&#39;t evolve, AWS will for them [1].[1] https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/graviton/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The streams are back up.Yet, this thread quickly devolved into a discussion about the grand conspiracy to censor instead of the repeated failure of automated tools and the ease at which they&#39;re abused."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think at this point we can just expect this stuff.The ridiculousness of it, though.  The rekieta law stream (which is fantastic, btw: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7YXd2M5E-8) has anywhere from 4-12 active lawyers giving commentary and context to everything that is happening.This is exactly the type of thing we dreamed about when we were first creating the internet.However: often times these smaller independent journalists and commenters go against the reality that media companies want you to believe you live in.  Thus: they get censored.  Rekieta lost almost 40,000 people who were getting live commentary from a diverse (idealogically) set of lawyers, and now must to places where these companies can assert more narrative control.It&#39;s sad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is inverted moderation: they&#39;re penalizing anodyne, wonkish lawyers&#39; podcasts, while leaving up most of the nonfactual, inflammatory ragebait. This is the exact opposite of how every platform professes to moderate.The rules-violating stuff must look very impressive for ad engagement metrics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This is not an OCR problem (as we switched off OCR on purpose), it is a lot worse – patches of the pixel data are randomly replaced in a very subtle and dangerous way: The scanned images look correct at first glance, even though numbers may actually be incorrect.I have a habit of scanning invoices/statements/manuals etc to pdf and found the above quite alarming. Though I don&#39;t use Xerox (my scanner is Epson Perfection V39), I never considered the possibility that a scan of a document can result in altered numbers. How do I know if my scanner could also be affected in case it uses similar underlying software/setup?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I live in Christchurch, NZ, and so I see a variety of long distance travellers in the swamplands and estuaries, including bar-tailed godwits at the end of Southshore spit https://newsline.ccc.govt.nz/news/story/draft-godwits-arriva...A huge amount of housing and infrastructure here wouldn’t be allowed now, because when it was built it would have disrupted rare birds (or perhaps that is why the birds are now rare).It does make one feel more aware of how the world is connected when you realise that migratory birds need to survive stopovers in other countries like China.The birds also need to survive in New Zealand, where just a few signs and some social convention prevents dogs from attacking nesting sites (edit: or people disturbing them), and it would be hard to lock down the area since many people would strongly assert their rights to go there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"According to Wikipedia a godwit weighs ~0.5kg and it flew 7000 miles. If my calculations are right we are looking at 1.5kwh of energy and 0.2 wh per mile?Even if we assume that the bird is almost all fat and fat can store ~3500kcal per pound, the maximum stored energy is 4kwh. That gives us 0.8wh per mile. So we can safely say that the bird spent [1.5-4kwh] to do this trip.Teslas that are very efficient are in the order of 200 wh per mile.What the heck we have a lot of work to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lovely. My 2yo child really enjoys correctly identifying the Bar-tailed godwit (along with all the other birds) in this wonderfully illustrated book: https://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/what-its-like-to-be-a-bird-978...So, this title made me smile and think of him :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice! A network tool I&#39;ve always wanted is one that automates the investigation you have to do manually if you are experienceing &#34;internet issues&#34;. I mean, the check list is quite straightforward but still a pretty manual process, stuff like:
- Do I have the expected IP?
- Is there large packet loss or latency issues hinting at connectivity issues?
- Can I ping the local gateway?
- Can I ping to outside network?
- Is my nearest DNS responding?
- Is another, remote DNS responding?
- What does Downdetector or similar say about the service I&#39;m trying?It would be nice with a one click tool that just went through this in order and gave a diagnosis."</p>

That intermittent shade also meant a lot less evaporation of coveted irrigation water. And in turn the evaporation actually helped keep the sun-baked solar panels cooler, making them more efficient.Solar panels are still way over hyped in a stupid marginalist way, but polyculture has always been a good idea :)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m a FB employee and I’m giving my notice tomorrow.I interviewed with them in 2019 just so I could get a competing offer and had no intention of working there, but at the end of my interviewing run they were the only offer I had. It was 2x my current salary and it was too hard to turn it down when the money was right there in front of me.I had sincere moral issues with the company but I convinced myself their worst days were likely behind them, that they were committed to doing the work to to fix their reputation. The last 2 years have only gotten worse and it’s very clear the leadership has no interest in making meaningful changes to address social harm caused by the platform. I legit don’t like telling people what I do for a living when I meet someone new at a bar for fear they ask where I work.Couple this with a culture that has masterminded a set of carrots and sticks that gets people to push themselves very hard all of the time, I’m completely burnt out. My GF pretty much told me she can’t handle living with someone so stressed out all the time.I don’t have another job lined up but I’m not too worried. I’m excited for a reset. I’m taking through the end of the year to cool off and prep for interviews. I think it’s imperative at my next job that I at least somewhat believe in the product. I’ve learned that money isn’t enough to keep me going in the face of giving 0 fucks about the company mission."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would guess people evaluate their job on money/work/stink axes.All of FAANG pays well, so what&#39;s left is whether the work is interesting/important/fulfilling and whether the company has integrity/evil issues. Eg you might think F1 has interesting problems despite glorifying fossil fuel cars, or you might think drones are technically challenging despite being used to kill people. Loads of people become nurses and teachers because they want to help people, even though they don&#39;t get paid much.What you&#39;re less likely to do is work in an area where your work isn&#39;t interesting, contributes nothing significant, and rots people&#39;s minds.I found it interesting that only half their job offers are taken up, that&#39;s super surprising to me. I suppose it&#39;s possible that people with one FAANG offer have more than one? If that&#39;s the case, all the rest of FAANG would likely have less stink than FB at the moment, and also wins on the work axis."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While this article focused primarily on things being left unmaintained, etc. there is also a huge problem with things being touched for no reason and making them worse.When handed what must be a mountain of bugs and unfinished items, why the hell did they prioritize things like breaking notifications and Safari tabs, for instance?  They’re in a position where engineering resources desperately need to be closing gaps, not creating huge new ones.There seems to be a prioritization problem at the very least.  Which I get, on some level who wants to work on the broken things?  But if they threw some money at this they could fix it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find anything that involves the cloud with Apple is suspect to just not work without explanation, but overall I think iOS is pretty solid still. I just avoid their cloud services and use something else.MacOS, on the other hand, I feel is increasingly a pain to use these days. It is not so much that the OS has gotten worse, but that there have been weird UX decisions along the way compared to Windows. I don’t like how MacOS manages windows or full-screen apps; I don’t really like the finder still; and I think the dock is a big waste of space on high resolution displays and never quite hides reliably the way I think it should when set to hide when not in use.I should say, I loved the dock back in the OSX days, I just think The Windows taskbar is better these days.It is a shame because I think Apple is at an all time high with their hardware design and build quality. Their laptops are second to none. The OS just feels like a chore to use half the time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an anecdotal example that may be relevant, I wanted to upgrade to Monterey and my Mac Mini said there wasn&#39;t enough room.Hooked up a Western Digital external drive that I had used on previous Macs and launched Time Machine. And that&#39;s when it started. Time Machine presented what seemed like a stack of Finder windows in the middle, a timeline with hash marks on the right-side and the only button highlighted was the &#34;Cancel&#34;.No menu, no other actionable buttons, no right-click menu. Nothing. So after hitting various key combos and mouse buttons, I decided that my 30+ minutes trying to use Apple&#39;s built-in backup software to backup a few folders was better spent finding 3rd party software.And that was another user experience fail in my opinion for Apple and any &#34;total quality&#34; experience.And that&#39;s not even talking about Safari or XCode or Pages or Numbers or iBooks not syncing and so many others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am a security engineer but have been a business leader from time to time.  Business leaders often need to plan around dates- eg ”should we spend $50k announcing at conference Y in month Z, or should we wait until month A?”  “Our competition just launched; will we be able to launch this quarter (the board wants to know, and we have to report material financial impact items quarterly or face SEC fines)?”Every team I have ever worked with hates planning; every team hates their methodology and thinks it’s stupid and inaccurate and why are those pinhead business people insisting on a date; it’ll be done when it’s done.One of the primary jobs of managers at all levels is to plan and then execute in accordance with the plan.  Some managers are good at it, many aren’t- the world is populated with people nearer the center than the ends of the bell curve.So show me a methodology that mere mortals can implement successfully.  If all you can do is complain and point out unicorn 500x engineers (yeah try hiring for that characteristic, good luck), then I don’t want to hear it.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is cathartic to read, but I also despair at getting the people who need to hear it to take it seriously.&gt; But many people want the world to be simpleThis is the source of so much insanity in the world, not just with regard to allocating labor. Details matter, but people who plan &#34;timelines&#34; desperately don&#39;t want to hear it. They can go through whole careers without being forced out of the cozy illusion that the world is simple. It&#39;s hard to get a man to believe something when his salary depends on it not being true, the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent, etc."</p>
