								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Here&#39;s why I like SSH signatures:&gt;* It&#39;s not PGP.The most important reason people use the OpenPGP message format is because it is a well accepted standard. Sure the cryptography is not new and fun but it is secure. If you sign something with OpenPGP then you can be sure that those signatures are verifiable on any platform by anyone. The OpenPGP standard has provisions to ensure that the signatures are from a particular entity. This proposal suggests that Github could be treated as a trusted third party. If that is the case then you don&#39;t need signatures at all.Obligatory &#34;The PGP Problem&#34; rebuttal:* https://articles.59.ca/doku.php?id=pgpfan:tpp"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; GitHub acts as a trusted third party here, and you have to trust them not to lie about people&#39;s public keys, so it may not be appropriate for all use cases. But relying on a trusted third party with a professional security team like GitHub seems like a way better default than PGP&#39;s Web of Trust, which was nigh impossible to use.Hopefully that&#39;s a false dichotomy and the entire Free Software community doesn&#39;t end up reliant on Microsoft to host all our keys for us.  The article goes on to mention key transparency, though, which does seem like the right solution.I note that rekor (the transparency log implementation used by sigstore) already supports signing with SSH keys[0], so this TechRepublic article about it[1] from March (which lists only &#34;GPG, x509 and Minisign&#34;) is already out of date.[0] https://github.com/sigstore/rekor/blob/main/types.md#ssh[1] https://www.techrepublic.com/article/a-new-linux-foundation-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding PGP&#39;s &#39;Web of Trust&#39;, I thought the purpose of this was to validate the link between the key and the owner of that key.  This is not what you get from retrieving a public key from github... that only gives you the link between that key and a github account.  But what does that give you?From what I understand, it gives you nothing for anything that is signed and that does not have a direct link to a github account.  Obviously, if someone releases software on that github account and I find a signed release of that software, I can validate that it really was signed by the official source of that software on github. For anything that does not have that direct link, it really does not give you anything.I&#39;ve never used PGP, but I thought the web of trust was used to validate metadata on the key and that this can be used to validate that a key really belongs to the person that you think it belongs to.  I saw it more like how you have SSL certificates with different degrees of validation and where you must deliver more proof of your identity if you want to receive a certification with a higher degree of validation.I&#39;m all for using SSH keys for signing, but I still would like to have something like PGP&#39;s web of trust for those keys."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Restic is a great backup program. I use it (via rclone) to back up my laptop and it truly saved my bacon when I attached my main hard disk to a VM I was playing with and accidentally formatted it!Restic can use rclone to access cloud providers it can&#39;t access and that&#39;s something we worked together on.I use rclone directly for backing up media and files which don&#39;t change much, but restic nails that incremental backup at the cost of no longer mapping one file to one object on the storage which is where rclone shines.(rclone author)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"  We have been made aware of &#34;scary&#34; emails sent in the last few hours that purport to come from the FBI/DHS. While the emails are indeed being sent from infrastructure that is owned by the FBI/DHS (the LEEP portal), our research shows that these emails *are* fake.

https://twitter.com/spamhaus/status/1459450061696417792"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The email domain where the messages originate is from some sort of federated identity management system that was created in 2010 (here is a proposal deck [0] with technical details). Found this program simply by searching Google for the sending domain.Based on the guide for using this system [1] (see step 15) looks like this specific email address is the one that sends automated confirmation emails upon registration. Perhaps someone was able to inject a message instead of the regular canned text through some sort of reflection attack? This explains why replies to the message result in a canned response. The system also now appears to be temporarily down. So it’s getting some sort of attention (internally taken down (most likely) or maybe denial of service from the abuse).The Reddit thread suggests the recipients’ emails are likely ARIN IP range contacts. Those are very available from tools like this [2] so nothing interesting with that, but the real question is WHY someone would do this at all? This was clearly given some thought (on who to send this to who would actually take the time to verify the headers) but given the sloppiness of everything else, is this just a script kiddie flex? Whoever it is pissed off the FBI and gained absolutely nothing.[0] https://bja.ojp.gov/sites/g/files/xyckuh186/files/media/docu...[1] https://www.justice.gov/tribal/page/file/1260671/download[2] http://itools.com/tool/arin-whois-domain-search"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of people commenting that the text of the email seems amateurish. Perhaps it’s exactly as it should be, but you don’t understand its purpose. Maybe they wanted this to be discussed on netsec forums everywhere, so that Google searches for “Vinny Troia” always lead back to discussion about this email, framing him as a cyber criminal and outranking legitimate posts about or by him - an online identity assassination. They needed the email to set off some alarm bells so that it would pique enough interest to be widely discussed. They appear to have widely targeted the email addresses of system admins. I’m fairly certain this was their intention.Also, does it strike anyone else as odd that the account that posted this to HN was created hours ago, for the sole purpose of starting this thread?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(Portuguese here)
Portuguese Parliament and Government publish law every day and afterhours[1], as a citizen I have to keep up with this. MPs believe they are doing a great job by producing more Law, instead of checking if what is in place is accountable. A common behaviour is when a &#34;crime&#34; case is well covered by the media, the first thing is said &#34;we need to change the Law&#34;, trying to dodge blame.I have been working remote for 17 years, and the teams I worked in, work asynchronously. It is fine to text, slack, discord and email after hours, people don&#39;t expect to get answers immediately, they will reply according to their schedule or contract.One case is that employers have to compensate employees for electricity and utilities for working remote, in my case that is a cost of €10.58, I save much more for not commuting, financially and psychologically.[1] https://dre.pt/dre/home"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can we open up a broader discussion about Portugal&#39;s culture of work? On one hand this sends a message that Portugal cares about work/life balance for everyday citizens. On the other my general impression of Portugal&#39;s economy is that it&#39;s one of the weaker members of the EU. High debt, not a huge driver of innovation, wealth, etc. These are all just loosely held beliefs kicking around in my head. I&#39;m not attached to any of them or sure that they are even accurate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I DM my staff on slack “after hours” [1] all the time, and set the expectation that they should respond when appropriate at their discretion. That could (and often does) mean the next business day or even later. Or it could mean ASAP; they’re adults, and have the judgement to make the correct call.[1] Obviously, this policy is not targeted at staff in different time zones, which makes their remedy meaningless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reading this really drove home to me just how amusing some of the twists and turns of music tech development are. In contemporary modular synth formats, you now have modules that use similar FM tone chips, but are controlled by potentiometers and analog control voltage inputs (for instance, https://busycircuits.com/alm011/). I could see how someone could conclude that this destroys the reproducibility advantages of digital FM synthesis, while preserving the cheesiness of FM sounds. From another perspective, you can freely explore the enormous landscape of sound produced by FM synthesis, without diving into the deep end of DX7 programming. Instead of generating sysex dumps on the fly to dynamically change the sounds produced by the synth, you just feed whatever control voltage you can come up with into the inputs of a module and bask in the insanity that comes out (for instance—https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2-YEbg040ww definitely not everyone’s cup of tea).Edit: but if you want to explore the landscape of FM tones generated by these chips without spending all of your money on a modular setup, generating sysex messages will of course take you where you want to go: https://fo.am/activities/midimutant/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is maybe a little outside the scope of your article, but I&#39;ve read about the DX7&#39;s log2 based sine wavetables in the past, and it makes sense from a math standpoint (log2(x) + log2(y) = log2(x*y)). However, I find it confusing when I go to try to replicate it. My understanding is that these are NOT floating point numbers. In which case the output would be in the 8bit range of (0-257) or -127 to +127 if we&#39;re using signed values.So assuming I want to represent a signal value of 127 (i.e. sin(t) = 127) using base 2 logs, I punch this into my calculator and i get log2(127) = 6.9886.
But that&#39;s not what&#39;s going to be stored in the signal LUT since it&#39;s a floating point number.I think I&#39;m probably missing something obvious, but any clarification would be amazing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I agree with the author in principle, I think there is an implicit criteria they ignore, which is the intuitive correctness from the perspective of the user.Imagine a user chooses &#34;Sort by rating&#34;, and they subsequently observe an item with an average 4.5 ranking above a score of 5.0 because it has a higher Wilson score. Some portion of users will think &#34;Ah, yes, this makes sense because the 4.5 rating is based on many more reviews, therefore its Wilson score is higher.&#34; and the vast, vast majority of users will think &#34;What the heck? This site is rigging the system! How come this one is ranked higher than that one?&#34; and erode confidence in the rankings.In fact, these kinds of black-box rankings* frequently land sites like Yelp into trouble, because it is natural to assume that the company has a finger on the scale so to speak when it is in their financial interests to do so. In particular, entries with a higher Wilson score are likely to be more expensive because their ostensibly-superior quality commands (or depends upon) their higher cost, exacerbating this effect due to perceived-higher margins.So the next logical step is to present the Wilson score directly, but this merely shifts the confusion elsewhere -- the user may find an item they&#39;re interested in buying, find it has one 5-star review, and yet its Wilson score is &lt;&lt; 5, producing at least the same perception and possibly a worse one.Instead, providing the statistically-sound score but de-emphasizing or hiding it, such as by making it accessible in the DOM but not visible, allows for the creation of alternative sorting mechanisms via e.g. browser extensions for the statistically-minded, without sacrificing the intuition of the top-line score.* I assume that most companies would choose not to explain the statistical foundations of their ranking algorithm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article inspired me so much that I based my shitty undergrad senior thesis on it. My idea was to predict the trend of the ratings by using I think a trailing weighted average, weighted to the most recent window. It managed to generate more &#34;predictive&#34; ratings of the following 6 months based on the Amazon dataset I used, but I doubt it would have held up to much scrutiny. I learned a ton though!Edit: Link to paper, which looks like it actually attempts to use a linear prediction algorithm. https://github.com/rkuykendall/rkuykendall.com/blob/e65147f6..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using this at work for the last year or so to great success.For example, we have an internal phishing simulation/assessment program, and want to track metrics like improvement and general uncertainty. Since implementing this about a year ago, we&#39;ve been able to make great improvements such as:* for a given person, identify the wilson lower bound that they would not get phished if they were targeted* for the employee population as a whole, determine the 95% uncertainty on whether a sample employee would get phished if targetedIt lets us make much more intelligent inferences about things, much more accurate risk assessments, and also lets us improve the program pretty significantly (e.g. your probability of being targeted being weighted by a combination of your wilson lower bound and your wilson uncertainty).There are SO MANY opportunities to improve things by using this method. Obviously it isn&#39;t applicable everywhere, but I&#39;d suggest you look at any metrics you have that use an average and just take a moment to ask yourself if a Wilson bound would be more appropriate, or might enable you to make marked improvements."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with self-hosted search engine is that they make you _very_ unique: you’re the only client of the ”backend“ engine with that (static and non-NATed) IP. Furthermore, you’re now one of the small group of people with ”hosting“ IPs. Using self-hosted SearX may make you easier to track, not harder.Using SearX hosted by someone else is marginally better, but now you have to trust the owner of the server, which is probably not what you want for privacy-centered search engine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still find it weird that planes are cheaper than trains even for quite small distances. London -&gt; Berlin? Paris -&gt; Madrid? Hell even Rome -&gt; Milan is cheaper to fly.I would love to start contributing less to emissions and take trains even though they take more time but they gotta start taxing planes and making trains cheaper to make people start doing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Note that if you’re building a framework with the intent of using Linux avoid the “vpro” variant of the Intel wireless adapter:https://community.frame.work/t/using-the-ax210-with-linux-on...Last I checked with every recommended config tweak you still lose ~3% battery per hour of suspend, which really adds up and is extremely annoying.We’ve been asking framework to include a notice referencing this issue when configuring but as of the last time I checked they haven’t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From https://frame.work/blog/linux-on-the-framework-laptop :“ There has been immense interest in this configuration, with it outselling pre-configured systems with Windows 10 by a wide margin.”There is a market. And it is currently under-served."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m typing this on my Framework now and I have to say it really is a special device. The prevailing culture of treating technology as disposable is something I personally don&#39;t vibe with - I always keep all of my tech and have collected machines over the years that most people would probably consider obsolete and uninteresting (there&#39;s an Amiga 1000 and iMac G3 currently in my field of view). Having a fully open machine that I can customize, upgrade and repair for the foreseeable future is just so cool and makes me feel like this is my personal computer in the truest sense of the word!A few takeaways from using it for around a month now:1. This is the most &#34;premium&#34; feeling non-Apple laptop I&#39;ve ever owned. Most of the laptops I&#39;ve ever daily driven are Macs or Thinkpads so take that for what it&#39;s worth, but I think most people will be happy with the fit and finish of this device.2. The swappable port system is actually a lot more useful than I expected. I initially thought it would be something I set up once and didn&#39;t bother with again for a while but there are a lot of random moments where it comes in handy. I&#39;m kind of a messy, hyper person that periodically reorganizes my desk and I like to move between different workspaces when I need a different setting to feel creative. Being able to move my HDMI or USB-C ports around for better cable management is so nice and yeah I could use an external hub but I&#39;ve always found those to be annoying on-the-go and just &#34;feels bad man&#34;. Also I don&#39;t use Micro SD cards as much as other people but there are times when I do and being able to swap that in is really kewl.3. Linux support is amazing but there are still a few hiccups. I use Arch Linux and everything works perfectly except for one minor inconvenience with Bluetooth: on a soft restart, the Bluetooth is disabled and I have to do a hard restart to restore it (can be mitigated by a kernel downgrade and should be fixed in a future update). It&#39;s not a deal breaker for me as I usually just close my laptop and put it to sleep, but just know that it&#39;s like running Linux on most other computers - you&#39;re going to have a much better time if you&#39;re fluent in tinkering and configuring your OS.4. The 3:2 display is awesome for programming and content creation, and I don&#39;t know why more devices don&#39;t adopt it. My only criticism is that it&#39;s not a touch screen but with how modular this laptop is it&#39;s only a matter of time before that becomes an option."</p>
