								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Time to kibitz on the likely sentence! You can get the federal sentencing guidelines here:https://www.ussc.gov/sites/default/files/pdf/guidelines-manu...They&#39;re long and mostly not relevant except for the sections pertaining to Holmes conduct.Here&#39;s the indictment:https://www.justice.gov/usao-ndca/page/file/1135066/downloadHolmes was found guilty of one 18 USC 1349 charge, and 3 18 USC 1343 charges; the 1343&#39;s she was found guilty on were in amounts ranging from $100k to $100MM(!).It should be possible to come up with a better guess than the New York Times&#39; &#34;20 years per count, but likely served concurrently&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It blows my mind that she was found guilty for defrauding investors, but not guilty for defrauding patients about their test results.Investors know that every dollar they put into a company could disappear, it&#39;s why startups get capital from investors and not bank loans.But a patient does not expect for their blood test results to be completely wrong. Her tests weren&#39;t giving false-negatives or false-positives, they were using lab techniques that we have known to be inaccurate for decades. She knowingly sold Walgreens on 1 test, and then performed a different test.I need to sit down and properly inform myself about how the prosecutors fucked that up so badly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This will sound weird but I am a collector of swag from large companies that have collapsed due to anything from mismanagement to outright fraud. While we&#39;re a rare breed there are others like me out there. Still, even with this oddly specific marketplace being small, let me tell you, the Theranos swag market is hot right now (check eBay if you&#39;re curious).Wish I had gone big on this one earlier, because I have a feeling this verdict is going to spice things up in the short term.All that to be said, if you&#39;ve got any authentic Theranos gear hiding in storage please do let me know, I&#39;m a motivated buyer.For those curious as one example: Nothing raises a few eyebrows more than a note written on Lehman Brothers letterhead with a Purdue Pharma OxyContin pen with the dosage pullout."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was in response to mwseibel&#39;s thread, which had a big discussion yesterday:Google no longer producing high quality search results in significant categories - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29772136 - Jan 2022 (1167 comments, spread over multiple pages - note the &#34;X more comments&#34; links at the bottom)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To some extent, I worry that the problem with search engines is that there isn&#39;t any data worth returning.  Yesterday&#39;s thread talked a lot about reviews.  Writing a review is hard work that requires deep domain expertise, experience with similar products, and months of testing.  If you want a review for something that came out today, there is no way that work could have been done, so there simply isn&#39;t anything to find.  Instead you&#39;ll get a list of &#34;Best TVs 2021&#34; or whatever, with some blurb and an affiliate link, not an actual review.  That&#39;s what people can make for free with a day&#39;s notice, so if you write a search engine that discards those sites, that&#39;s fine, you&#39;ll just return &#34;no results&#34; for every interesting query.I guess what I&#39;m saying is that if you want better reviews, you probably want to start writing reviews and figuring out how to sell them for money.  Many have tried, few have succeeded.  But there probably isn&#39;t some Javascript that will fix this problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Why not try writing a search engine specifically for some category dominated by SEO spam?Back in the olden days, there were lots of organizations that collated high quality content from the best writers. They nurtured expert writers and paid them well. They fact-checked the content and employed diligent editors and proofreaders so it was accurate and well-written. Over the years, they&#39;d build a reputation for reliability and trustworthiness that kept people coming back for more. If you wanted to learn about fitness, or cars, or cooking, or science, you&#39;d find a reputable author and publisher and buy their magazines or books.But then, in the early 2000s, the geniuses from SV &#34;disrupted&#34; the publishing industry and its financial model. They brought us a much better way to find content, the search engine. Because they were so much better than the old-fashioned publishers, search engines gobbled up the advertising money and became the dominant gateway to content. Publishers had to abandon expensive high-quality writing because rankings and eyeballs now mattered more than quality and trustworthiness. Instead of investing in writers, they invested in marketers and SEO specialists.The result: worthless content, writers banging out garbage for peanuts, and useless search engines.Two decades later, looking at the barren wasteland they had created, the SV geniuses thought: I know what we need, more search engines, but smaller ones that collate high-quality content from the best writers. There must be money in that, right?"</p>

The result of such ongoing struggles is why the Linux kernel still works after decades of active development, despite radical changing requirements."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This post feels too much like an unsubstantiated rant to belong on this site. It doesn’t give much textual evidence and feels highly emotionally charged.That said, I do agree that SA has gone downhill in the last 5 years. I canceled my subscription last year because the science was becoming too pop-sci-ish.Here’s the offending article the author was referring to:
https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-complicated-l..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read (not extremely closely, but better than skimming) Aaronson&#39;s foreword, the guest post, and the article in question; and I still don&#39;t know what about Wilson&#39;s work was supposedly &#34;problematic&#34;. It&#39;s apparently something to do with the &#34;nature vs. nurture&#34; question, but I can hardly remember reading so many words with so little substance. For somebody not involved with the field (e.g. me), this omission of substance makes it very difficult to evaluate the merits of either perspective.It also sets off some alarm bells, since it&#39;s difficult for an intellectually honest (edit: and competent) author to write on the order of a thousand words of evasive fluff and deem it suitable for publication.OP&#39;s link aside, I don&#39;t think the SA article comes anywhere close to justifying its attack on Wilson (&#34;racist ideas&#34;), and the quoted bit regarding normal distributions is beyond the pale."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Genuine racists, sexists, and their sort have no greater allies than the ever-present purity inquisition among people purporting to oppose bigotry.  What may have begun as efforts to reform thinking in a progressive and egalitarian manner has become the mirror image of the hate-mongering of their opponents.  The difference is that the racists attack people who were never inclined to be their allies, and that&#39;s why they win elections."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My own major debilating depression was such that I couldn&#39;t get out of bed other than to use the toilet. Worse than that I could see no reason to get out of bed and didn&#39;t care to get out of bed. Taking a shower and getting dressed was out of the question. I knew the strain I was causing in my family, but since I didn&#39;t feel anything, I couldn&#39;t feel enough empathy for them to do anything about it. I knew I used to love them, but that seemed a long time ago and there was no hope of ever feeling again. I thought about suicide often, but my inability to get motivated prevented me from carrying it out. I once had a bounce of energy so I started planning to kill myself and the weird thing was, that I felt the happiest I had ever felt in my life. It was such a feeling of peace and joy that it would soon be over.Fortunately for me, my family would not tolerate me in this condition and forced to me to get out of bed and dragged me to doctors and checked me into mental health units until we found the right doctor who perscribed the right medication that worked. Turns out typical anti-depressants don&#39;t work on me because I am bipolar and was experiencing bipolar depression.It&#39;s been three years of recovery now and I am very happy. I take my quatiepine every night and get the sleep I need so I don&#39;t relaspe into mania and then depression.My family is not sophisticated about mental illness. They would rather not think about it. But the one thing they did is to refuse to let me remain in that state and forced me to take action."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Depression can also manifest in different ways. One way is anger, frustration, and anxiety. My wife’s depression was like this. She would come home from work, find one thing wrong with our apartment - there were dirty dishes in the sink, the clothes hadn’t been folded - and get angry with me for not having taken care of it.The fact that I had cooked dinner and mopped the floors didn’t count.She was angry with me probably 33-50% of the time. For about a year I tried to get out ahead of all the chores. But that’s impossible. Finally I realized that this wasn’t my fault. I wasn’t a bad partner. This was something in her head.I could actually watch in real time as her own brain gaslit her. I’d pay her a compliment — “that dress looks nice” — and see a perceptible lag as her brain figured out how to turn it into an insult — “your other dresses aren’t nice.”Eventually she recognized something was wrong and got help, but it took a couple of years. She is a completely different person now.If you are the partner of a depressed person, your primary responsibility is to yourself. You have to stay sane. THEN, if you can, you can support and help your partner. But if you lose your own mental health you’re pretty much done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the overarching message with this post is right on whenever you are talking to someone who is struggling: listen, love, and don&#39;t judge. A hug is much better than a suggestion on how the family member can &#34;fix&#34; themselves.I also want to put a plug in for dogs. I have struggled with depression on and off in my life, and two years ago I adopted a dog I saw being abused in the street. She was just a little puppy, and I absolutely did not want anything to do with raising a dog at the time, but I felt I had no choice. I picked her up and took her home.Since then I have not been able to sleep past 7am in the morning without these two little eyes staring me down. But it is wonderful. She gives me relentless love every day, and she gave my life a really healthy structure it desperately needed. We go on walks three times a day looking for her doggy friends. I spent a lot more time in nature, because she doesn&#39;t give a damn for computers or video games. I know even some people look down on me for how much I love my dog, but they have no idea what I was like before. This dog saved my ass.Now it is IMPOSSIBLE for me to just lie in bed, and that is a great thing, not a bad thing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m sorry, but at 7500 words, this is more of a novella than a summary.The summary at the end of the book is shorter than this blog post and contains the big takeaways.I love this book as much as the other person does, but there are much better reads to go deeper into some of the inspiration:https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1059504529111158784Additionally the major influences on the book:https://twitter.com/jamesclear/status/1059521349239169024Tiny Habits for example is super underrated and one of the better habit books if you enjoyed this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I loved reading Atomic Habits during the first lockdown. I was excited to try out its actionables, specially tracking to keep me honest.I tried a bunch of iOS apps, but wanted no friction, no tracking, no cloud, no social, etc. so eventually built https://flathabits.com. Also wanted to own my habit data (as plain text), so I made sure Flat Habits stored its data locally as an org file.I&#39;m an Emacs nutter and can say the strength of a habit tracker lies in removing daily friction from the tracking process itself. The plain text part is cherry on top (bringing piece of mind around lock-in). In my case, it&#39;s been months since I looked at the plain text file itself.As for forming habits themselves (the actual goal)... it&#39;s been well over a year since I started running. I&#39;ve kept it up since reading Atomic Habits (and started tracking)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read this book and I think this sums it up in a Tweet:The laws are:  Make it obvious, Make it attractive, Make it easy, Make it satisfying; Each law maps to one of the four steps of habit formation:  Make it obvious → Cue Make it attractive → Craving Make it easy → Response Make it satisfying → Reward; Make it Obvious To effectively build a new habit, make the cue for that habit blatantly obvious"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Along similar lines, I&#39;ve adopted a hyper-frequent commit pattern in git. I do a bunch of meaningless micro-commits as I&#39;m making progress, and then rewrite them all into one or two meanginful commits once I&#39;ve reached a working state of whatever I was trying to do.I find it&#39;s helpful for not losing work / easily backing up if as I&#39;m going along I realize I want to change approach.(For the micro commit I have a git command &#34;git cam&#34; that just commits all changes with the message &#34;nt&#34;. Then once I&#39;m ready to do a &#34;real commit&#34;, I have &#34;git wip&#34; which rolls back all the nt commits but leaves them in checkout; then I can make one or two &#34;real&#34; commits.)I wonder if dura would be even better, or if the commit frequency would end up being too fine-grained and obscure?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"JetBrains &#34;local history&#34; for InteliJ IDEs has saved me several times. It has all of the diffing tools that are available for git commits. This looks to be a generic implementation of that. We should not live in a world where unsaved data is lost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built a similar tool a couple of years ago here: https://github.com/google/git-sync-changesBoth save uncommitted changes in a hidden ref.Based on the README, the differences seem to be:1. dura runs as a daemon while git-sync-changes is a one shot execution.2. dura saves locally, while git-sync-changes syncs with a remote repo.3. dura only does the save and the restore is manual, whereas git-sync-changes does both steps automatically.I’m glad to see more people exploring this space. I think there’s a lot of untapped potential in tracking pending changes similarly to how we track committed changes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interviews are really a dumb game these days so if you want to really game it you can go with a statistical approach:* Practice questions by company on LeetCode, sort by frequency of last 6 months and work down the list, do maybe 75-100, the list updates once a week* Search for the company on the LeetCode forums and sort by most recent. If a question is not on LC yet it will likely get posted there, so you can get really fresh intel.I&#39;ve read of people doing this and getting like 6/6 questions they&#39;ve seen before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Almost all advice online about interviewing is written from the point of view of the candidate. Sometimes this is good advice, but sometimes it devolves into some kind of astrology, where candidate are just guessing how things work.I&#39;ve done +300 interviews at FAANG so I can share bit of advice from the interviewer&#39;s side. The caveat is that this is based on how I conduct interviews, so YMMV with other people.* Always ask clarifying questions. Almost all problems have some level of ambiguity that you need to clarify. This is intended. The more senior you are, the more important this becomes.* Explain your approach before you begin, and even while you code. This gives the interviewer a chance to help you if you are down the wrong path, or even just understand what you are up to.* If you get stuck, ask for help! think of this as a pair programming session rather than an interview. I much prefer a candidate who gets stuck, ask for hints, gets unblocked and writes good code, rather than one that doesn&#39;t ask for help and writes not-so-good code.* Caveat: There is a tension with asking questions. There is such a thing as too much help, e.g. I need to explicitly tell you how to solve the problem. Use judiciously.* Take interviewer&#39;s hints. The interviewer has probably asked this question dozens of times and knows it inside out. If they give you a hint, 99% of times they are on to something.* Personally I don&#39;t like &#34;hard LC&#34; problems. Instead I prefer medium difficulty problems, and spend extra time probing the candidate&#39;s coding skills. This includes:1. Write tests.2. Handle corner cases/incorrect inputs.3. Discuss how to scale the code.4. Discuss how to refactor the code.* If nothing else, write the simplest brute force solution you can think of. As an interviewer I need a coding sample to evaluate the candidate. Trying to and failing to implement an optimal solution is worse than implementing a correct brute force one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; After being given the algorithm problem, ask for the specific runtime your solution will need to have. Almost certainly, the interviewer will tell you.In my experience, interviewers will rarely tell you the runtime of the optimal solution.Regardless, very interesting blog post."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Copyrights should be shorterYou&#39;re going up against a big lobby. To do that you first need a functioning democracy.In a place where &#34;the people&#34; rule, copyright&#39;d be optimized to ensure a rich commons for everyone to enjoy. That was the original idea behind intellectual property law, e.g. copyright. Now it&#39;s big biz holding our culture for ransom."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Copyright doesn&#39;t need 2 years to get the job done.Nobody simply selling their labour in the market gets to live off what they did yesterday, never mind two years ago.It&#39;s a monopoly and in any sensible system would be subject to anti-trust and market competition action like any other monopoly.And in any sensible system there would also be a way for creative people to earn a living wage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The longest I can theoretically think is justified is the death of the author. The idea to keep works out of the public domain so that heirs or estates or businesses can live off economic rents is pretty bizarre to me, seems straight up feudal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You don&#39;t even need an SPA. Having the backend + frontend share the same state makes development so much faster and easier it&#39;s shockingly refreshing. When building a SaaS project last year I decided to just ditch React/Angular/Vue and did everything server-side like it was 2005. I was extremely pleased at the result -- everything feels snappy, secure, and native for the browser. I was shocked at how much time and headache I saved: not having to design/deploy an API and all the trimmings (ACLs, CORS, JWTs etc.), not having to spend X hours a day wrestling with Webpack/hot reloading/npm/tree-shaking/state management, having direct access to backend secrets/state/APIs and just spitting out HTML, it&#39;s just so....lovely. It simplifies performance tuning as well, the only thing I need to optimize is the server, which is easy to do because I have 100% control and visibility, compared to debugging/optimizing JavaScript for a million different clients."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"CORS is such an ugly web standard.  It&#39;s not only a pain in you butt, but it also makes your requests slow through these extra pre-flight round-trips.I have hope that we can remove it, though, in new versions of HTTP.CORS only exists because XMLHTTPRequest broke the assumptions of web 1.0 servers.  Suddenly any web browser loading any page anywhere could make a request to your server without the user&#39;s explicit permission, and a ton of web servers had already been built and were running under the assumption that users would only hit their endpoints by explicitly typing in a URL or clicking on a link.But each time we design a new version of HTTP, we get an opportunity to remove CORS restrictions for it, because there aren&#39;t any servers running the new version yet.And with Braid (https://braid.org), we&#39;re making changes that are big enough that I think it really warrants taking a fresh look at all of this stuff.  So I have hope that we can eliminate CORS and all this ugliness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The irony in this is that with CloudFront at least, it can&#39;t strip the &#34;/api&#34; prefix before sending it to your backend, so you have to have your backend server understand /api/xyz rather than just /xyz calls like when it was on a dedicated api subdomain.But don&#39;t worry! AWS thought of this! They invented Another Cloud Thing, namely Lambda@Edge, to solve this. Now you can run a JS function for every single request that hits your CloudFront Distribution so that you can run logic in there to strip the prefix before it gets passed to your origin. You read that right! Execute code every time a request hits your proxy! But wait, doesn&#39;t executing code for every single request sound insane AND doesn&#39;t it also add latency which this was trying to remove? Yes! Isn&#39;t cloud just lovely?"</p>
