								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey everyone, I just wanted to chime in and say that GPT-J is incredibly legit. Every aspect of GPT-J is production grade — no difference in process, quality, or results, compared to any other big name research lab.I also want to apologize to Eleuther for giving them a hard time in the past. My earlier concerns were unjustified. To be completely honest, I was jealous they achieved everything I tried to achieve with my own open source research lab attempt. It took a long time to even recognize that jealousy in myself, let alone set it aside. Sorry.The credit for this work goes almost entirely to kindiana, aka Ben Wang. Remember that name; you’ll be seeing a lot of it in the coming decade. It’s clear to me that whichever lab he ends up at (he’s an undergrad! Google let him slip away because he didn’t have a degree!), he’s gonna be changing the world. Don’t know what, don’t know how, know he will.Every aspect of that codebase is immaculate. Most research code is not pretty; this looks carved out of marble and placed in a museum.Without Eleuther’s TPU resources, this work wouldn’t have happened. Tensorfork (my lab) didn’t get access to the TPU VM alpha. And TPU VMs were an absolute necessity here. (TPU VMs are a new thing; they’ve been in alpha since December, but only recently launched. If curious see https://github.com/shawwn/website/blob/master/jaxtpu.md and https://github.com/shawwn/website/blob/master/mlmind.md for why it’s the future of ML.)Eleuther also helped test the model thoroughly. Leo Gao (go follow him: https://twitter.com/nabla_theta?s=21) ran GPT-J through the gauntlet. He was the primary person behind The Pile, the training data that makes any of this possible. I can say with absolute certainty and no hesitation that there are no “gotchas” here.Eleuther’s https://6b.eleuther.ai page looks wonderful too. It’s like a free OpenAI API playground that everyone can try. Keeping it running for months is no small achievement. (Set top_p to 1.0 and temp to 0.8; the defaults are pretty bad.)Congratulations, and thank you everyone for all your hard work. The world is so much better for having access to this level of quality."</p>

I am actually kinda happy with that. I listen to some podcasts and read the news before leaving to get a couple of documents together. I’m going to my mom’s today to have a meeting regarding my eviction notice. My mom still lives with my dad. I can’t ask him to do anything, though, I guess. I was always so used to having to ask for stuff, that I completely forgot I could get people to do what I want for me. My mom, for instance, is not as bad as my dad, and I actually don’t mind asking her to help me with everything. It makes me feel like she loves me. I know that this is a small thing, but it’s something that makes me happy.I get to my mom’s apartment at 5:30. The place is very nice. There is a roof terrace, an elevator that goes up and down (where can you find something like that in an apartment building?!), and all rooms have their own AC units. All of the furniture is in good shape. The appliances were also all upgraded recently, so there is a full washer/dryer, a coff"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The audacity of it! (pun intended) Fork it, call it Audacious and be done with it. There’s no reason for an offline application to collect data “necessary for law enforcement”. We’re already in an age where software is increasingly tilting towards becoming SaaS. We don’t need offline applications to behave as if they’re online or SaaS ones.If this is only about telemetry or analytics, make it an opt-in choice on first run.I wasn’t aware that Audacity had been acquired by The Muse Group recently.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given how beneficial sci-hub is, there ought to be some way that the scientific community can formally recognise this, as a way of legitimizing her cause.Some ways I can think of:* Get her elected as rector of a university. Contraversial figures are sometimes elected as Rector, at least in the UK, because students are the electorate. However for the same reason this isn&#39;t considered especially prestigious by people who know this.* Fund and create an academic post specifically for her (Ptolomy II Professor of the ethics of copyright strikes me a  a suitably biting title [1])* Nominate her to some well known prize[1] Ptolomy II decreed that any book found in a ship in the port of Alexandria should be copied by the scribes of his library - with or without the permission of the owner.  The UK actually has a similar law in that publishers are required to send copies of any book published in the UK to the British Library"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really wonder how this is going to play out. For those who don&#39;t follow the current situation with Sci-Hub, Alexandra (the creator and likely the sole operator) of Sci-Hub shut down the part of the website (&#34;the magical proxy&#34;) that is responsible for fetching the papers that were not previously retrieved. This was done to comply with the request of the Indian court, as described in the article.As a result, any papers published in 2021 (and some of the rarer, older ones, that nobody tried to access in the past) are not retrievable by Sci-Hub. The user only gets to see a white screen.This is meant to be a temporary measure, but it&#39;s been going on since December of last year (due to various court hearing delays), and the desperation in online communities like the r/scihub subreddit has been palpable [1,2].[1] https://old.reddit.com/r/scihub/comments/o2xb57/how_do_i_eve...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The push for crypto without ecc ram is a nonstop horror show. Software under normal circumstances is remarkably resilient to having its memory corrupted. However crypto algorithms are designed so that a single bit flip effectively changes all the bits in a block. If you chain blocks then a single bit flip in one block destroys all the blocks. I&#39;ve seen companies like msps go out of business because they were doing crypto with consumer hardware. No one thinks it&#39;ll happen to them and once it happens they&#39;re usually too dim to even know what happened. Bit flips aren&#39;t an act of god you simply need a better computer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cosmic-ray bit flipping is real and it has real security concerns. This also makes Intel&#39;s efforts at market segmentation by not having ECC support in any consumer CPUs [1] even more unforgivable and dangerous.Example: bitsquatting on domains [2].[1]: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/01/linus-torvalds-blame...[2]: https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2011/08/10/bh-2011-bit-squa..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OP here.  Unless you work for a certificate authority or a web browser, this event will have zero impact on you.  While this particular CT log has failed, there are many other CT logs, and certificates are required to be logged to 2-3 different logs (depending on certificate lifetime) so that if a log fails web browsers can rely on one of the other logs to ensure the certificate is publicly logged.This is the 8th log to fail (although the first caused by a bit flip), and log failure has never caused a user-facing certificate error.  The overall CT ecosystem has proven very resilient, even if a bit flip can take out an individual log.(P.S. No one knows if it was really a cosmic ray or not.  But it&#39;s almost certainly a random hardware error rather than a software bug, and cosmic ray is just the informal term people like to use for unexplained hardware bit flips.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s wild we have any images of the surface of Venus at all given how hostile Venus is. Given how hostile it is, it seems unlikely we&#39;ll go back anytime soon. These images were really a product of the Cold War where the US focused on Mars.It&#39;s worth noting that Venus is still probably a better terraforming target than Mars [1]. This romantic notion of Mars has rooted itself deeply at this point (eg with Elon Musk) but Mars is basically a more distant and inconvenient Moon. Almost no atmosphere (in fact, just enough because dust storms will occasionally just coat all your equipment), the Sun is weaker and gravity is still very low.Venus&#39;s atmosphere is about 3% nitrogen and 97% CO2. It has about 100x the atmosphere of Earth, which means there&#39;s actually more atmospheric nitrogen than on Earth. And abundant CO2 means oxygen is abundant.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BI-old7YI4I"</p>

Also, there is something really exciting about looking at pictures of an alien planet. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 2004Hacker OldsBy the way, these probes provided the data for the following:Harry Dale Huffman [1,2] discovered that at Earthly tropospheric pressure (sea level 1000mBar to 200mBar at the top of the troposphere), the temperature gradients of Earth and Venus are identical as shown by this graph (Earth blue, Venus purple). Horizontally the tropospheric pressure from the surface up, and vertically the temperature, corrected by 1.176 because Venus is closer to the sun [1]. So an atmosphere with almost 100% CO2 behaves identically to one with almost 0%!!! Likewise, an atmosphere without any water vapour (Venus) behaves like one half saturated in it (Earth).http://theendofthemystery.blogspot.com/2010/11/venus-no-gree..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice to see more professional commercial projects picking up Blender. It helps to see what are the things missing or suboptimal for &#34;expert&#34; users of the system.Blender and OBS Studio are very good examples of FOSS software that are the best at what they do and can easily offer competition to even the commercial alternatives.Most of all their design and UI language is consistent - something very rarely seen in FOSS software.And they have incredible depth of features 90% of which are overkill for the casual user but the experts sure do appreciate them.And the best part is the well-thought of extensibility and API story. Both of them have a very good community of plugins and extensions which add very useful features without feeling out of place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blender has gone from being a tool professionals scoffed at to one that professionals are stressing over themselves to learn by binging tutorials. It is quite the sight, I remember in 2008 wanting to get into game development and being poopooed on forums from picking up blender and instead pirating maya instead. I obviously dropped the idea completely because of it.Idk, I think there might be a larger lesson somewhere in there but regardless it&#39;s amazing to see the shift that has occurred."</p>

Highly capable and the scripting interface is great. You can pop up a window that shows the python command for every action you are doing in the GUInso it’s easy to automate anything you can do manually."</p>

This draft links to one of our docs (though the draft points to a 404 URL, the correct link being[0]).As the draft calls out, Google Standard Payments uses the &#34;requestId&#34; field as our idempontency key, which is part of the request body, rather than in the HTTP header.  We did this specifically to decouple the protocol from the behavior of the request.  We could take the existing definitions and put that payload into any other protocol and it would work without having to use that protocol&#39;s sidechannel data (aka, the HTTP header).Our design makes idempontency part of the application layer, rather than any middlebox or load balancer.[0] https://developers.google.com/standard-payments/guides/conne..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a bit funny to see an IETF draft for this!Adding idempotency support to Stripe&#39;s API was one of the things I built while an intern in 2015. We&#39;ve since rewritten it almost entirely, but many the technical decisions made in 2015 still stand.One of the things that IETF doesn&#39;t specify (&#34;an appropriate response&#34;) is that Stripe&#39;s Idempotency API has a response body has the latest rendering of the resource. Here&#39;s what I mean:  # Set tax exempt status
  curl /v1/customers/cus_AJ6m5vWl7scnn6 \
    -H &#34;Idempotency-Key: aaaaaaaaaa&#34; \
    -d tax_exempt=reverse

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s more appropriate IMO to name it something like &#34;Request-Identifier&#34;. All the client should indicate is that if you get 2 or more POSTs with that same Id, you are free to no-op on any after the 1st successfully handled one.Idempotency is an emergent property of a system so it doesn&#39;t make sense that a client would dictate the key that&#39;s used to provide that behavior. So if the Idempotency-Key is quite likely not to be the actual &#34;Idempotency-Key&#34; in any sufficiently complex system, then don&#39;t name it that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll repeat my comment from nearly seven months ago [1] since it left a really bad taste about how users are dealt with. Nearly a year ago when the initial waves of the pandemic were raging on, Migadu removed its free tier. That&#39;s not a problem by itself because businesses have to make money to sustain and grow. But Migadu gave one month’s notice (contrary to the claims in the replies, that&#39;s what I saw) for users to switch. The replies to the comment also said that the new lowest paid tier was &#34;affordable in every corner of the planet&#34;, which sounded quite ignorant even for a non-pandemic time.Another point, which may matter to some people, is that while Migadu may be a Swiss company, the data centers where the mails are hosted were in France (this was the case at least a year ago). So the situation is somewhat comparable (not entirely though) to Fastmail being an Australian company with data centers in the U.S. being used.For those who want multi-domain email services for a lower (flat) price, look at mxroute. It&#39;s based out of the U.S. though, which may not be an option for people who want certain services outside Five Eyes jurisdictions.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25382626"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ive had a bad enough experience with migadu that I am compelled to actively warn people not to use them (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25054091).Migadu has taught me bargain basement email is too expensive in the long run."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Their $19 (Micro) Plan lists &#34;200 in/day and 20 out/day&#34;. My email usage, personally, seems to be in bursts. It stays below 1 or 2 outbound mails on most days, however on some days (rarely) there&#39;ll be threaded conversations with &gt;50 outbound mails. So, I feel like it would be fantastic if the plan had monthly limits instead of daily limit. Or some other sort of limit, say EC2 like, which would allow the user to consume the resources in bursts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All: please don&#39;t post generic comments [1], and definitely not generic flamebait comments [2], in threads like this. Those are repetitive, tedious, and therefore off topic (https://news.ycombinator.com/newsguidelines.html). Edit: we don&#39;t want to just repeat the same argument over and over, because there&#39;s no curiosity in that [5], and because it usually turns nasty [6].The value of an article (and thread) on a major ongoing topic, such as this one, is in the specifics of what the article discusses—in other words, the diff relative to previous articles and threads [3]. If there aren&#39;t any new specifics, then the article itself would count as off topic [4], but in this case there do seem to be.[1] https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sor...[2] https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sor...[3] https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;so...[4] https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;so...[5] https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=false&amp;so...[6] https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;sor..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The quest to come up with a narrative for why Covid happened reminds me of the reporting when Katrina hit New Orleans.  The city&#39;s vulnerability was known beforehand [0] but the inevitable disaster was greeted with shock, confusion, and a search for peripheral explanations.  In the case of the pandemic, our vulnerability to zoonotic viruses and other diseases was also well-known; e.g. [1] was published in 1995.  But again the reporting, as it seems to me anyway, focuses on the particular circumstances of the disaster rather than our fundamental vulnerability.  There is a plentiful supply of unknown microorganisms to fuel the next global health crisis, and we need to expect and prepare for it so that next time we can prevail without great struggle.[0] https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/article/predicting-katrina/[1] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46722.The_Coming_Plague"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This part of the article citing Anthony Fauci&#39;s 2012 comment [1] is impressive to me:“Consider this hypothetical scenario,” Fauci wrote. “An important gain-of-function experiment involving a virus with serious pandemic potential is performed in a well-regulated, world-class laboratory by experienced investigators, but the information from the experiment is then used by another scientist who does not have the same training and facilities and is not subject to the same regulations. In an unlikely but conceivable turn of events, what if that scientist becomes infected with the virus, which leads to an outbreak and ultimately triggers a pandemic?”[1] https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3484390/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with the author&#39;s sentiment. The way this problem is typically framed is as a dichotomy between preserving a &#34;true&#34; history of what really happened on the micro/commit scale VS presenting a &#34;clean&#34; history that makes the story of the change easy to follow on the macro/PR scale.This is a false dichotomy. I&#39;m greedy, I want BOTH. Give me story mode when I&#39;m just browsing the repo, but offer me the option to switch into commit-by-commit mode when I want more detail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my organization we kind of do this. We use one merge commit per pull request, without squashing. However, we also rebase before merging, which results in a commit graph that looks like a cactus:      o-o-o   o-o   o-o-o
     /     \ /   \ /     \
    o-------o-----o-------o--&gt;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can do this today in standard git with https://www.davidchudzicki.com/posts/first-parentSummary: every feature is merged with &#39;main&#39; as the first parent.  Then, whenever interacting with history, you tell git you only want it to consider --first-parent"</p>
