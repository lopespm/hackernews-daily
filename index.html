								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is absolutely hilarious, and despite being long form, fits Twitter format very well, with each chunk funnier than the last :)A few notes:- Per my knowledge US is the only country which stubbornly (and illogically) considers Sunday to be the first day of the week;- US (and maybe one or two English-speaking countries) are the only ones using 12h time, the rest of the world uses 24hrs, however 12h _sometimes_ is used conversationally;- May be the author got tired (or whatever he took started to wear off) but I consider omitting the whole DST thing a major missed opportunity. :)Also, for those interested, look up Swatch time invented in late 90s and touted as more logical replacement of the mess that we have. I believe they still maintain some Internet presence but mostly gave up on promoting it. Good luck breaking 1000+yo habits."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;uh, it&#39;s supposed to be the birth of a religious leader, but they got the math wrong so it&#39;s off by 4 years, if he existed at all.&#34;&gt; &#34;if? You based your calendar off the birth date of someone you&#39;re not sure exists?&#34;I find it quite offensive. Not all scholars agree that Jesus was raised from dead, but the existence of Jesus is accepted even by non-Christian scholars.&gt; Virtually all scholars of antiquity agree that Jesus existed.[7][8][30] Historian Michael Grant asserts that if conventional standards of historical textual criticism are applied to the New Testament, &#34;we can no more reject Jesus&#39; existence than we can reject the existence of a mass of pagan personages whose reality as historical figures is never questioned.&#34;[31] There is no indication that writers in antiquity who opposed Christianity questioned the existence of Jesus.[32][33]https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Jesus"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the implication that aliens are rational and have no subrational concepts due to tradition and habit interesting, as it sort of implies that these kinds of outgrowths are not necessary and can just be done away with.  The narrator starts from a position of not wanting to legitimize or historicize beyond reductive statements like &#34;some ancient civilization did XYZ&#34;.  I&#39;ll admit that I skimmed through the last part of the thread, so I might have missed something, but I don&#39;t see any mention of the decimal calendar https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/French_Republican_calendar, or why that failed.  I get that this is supposed to be funny, but the indirect message of getting rid of whatever doesn&#39;t make conscious sense is simplistic, and spoils the fun for me.  Humans are stupid, very funny."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Mechanical Engineer and product designer here.  I&#39;ve been using mcmaster daily for 20 years to do my job.  It is definitely the standard by which all others are judged.  I&#39;ll gladly pay 2, 3, 5, even 10x the price to get it from McMaster.  The service, the CAD models, I have what I need the next day.  As an example of the level of their service, you can send them a box of loose parts, no part numbers,  no markings, and they&#39;ll go through it, figure out what&#39;s what, and refund you for it.  They make it so easy, you just have to do the engineering.  Thank you McMaster-Carr."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"McMaster is great.This article is also completely glossing over another reason to use them: Their shipping is somehow insanely fast.Almost everything is next-day delivery, even for standard shipping. They&#39;ve somehow got their logistics COMPLETELY nailed. I believe they have their own agreements with USPS/FedEx/etc...McMaster is generally not the cheapest, but they&#39;re almost always the fastest and the easiest.Machining/industry runs on McMaster."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"McMaster-Carr is an incredible example of how an existing physical-product distributor with a vaunted historical operations department, when faced with moving into the e-commerce world, could choose one of two paths:- Build an online presence cheaply because you can rely on your historical offline operations to paper over any shortcomings in the online system.- Build an online presence with the same ethos, standards, creativity, and long-term continued investment with which you built your offline operations to be your competitive advantage in the first place.There aren&#39;t many legacy organizations that successfully digitized with that second path in mind, at least not at first - McMaster, B&amp;H Photo, and Sweetwater come to mind as notable exceptions. It&#39;s a useful thought experiment, I think, even for those working on startups and green-field projects."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this does not work well for mobile devices. Spacing and the font size is too large. Hence, a lot of screen space is wasted and the user has to scroll more. Larger font sizes on mobile are usually not a good idea as the device tends to be closer to your eyes anyway.A snippet that could work better in my opinion is the following:    html {
      max-width: 70ch;
      /* larger spacing on larger screens, very small spacing on tiny screens */
      padding: calc(1vmin + .5rem);
      /* shorthand for margin-left/margin-right */

Isn&#39;t this against the app store policy? You can&#39;t deny me access to one feature just because I refuse to grant permissions to a different feature.But because it&#39;s Google I&#39;m sure they can break whatever rules they want as long as it doesn&#39;t involve trying to avoid Apple&#39;s 30% fees."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m mostly curious in what compression algorithm results in artifacts like these, and assume somebody here on HN recognizes them? But we&#39;re 225 comments in (so far) and not a single answer.They&#39;re absolutely nothing like block-based JPEG, that&#39;s for sure. When I inspect the images Google Photos serves me in my browser, it is serving up JPEG (from the response headers). But is this an artifact that shows up in AVIF or WebP? I wonder if mobile clients are getting a different encoding.The only objective thing I notice is that the artifact lines tend to track a line of constant brightness, so you seem them appearing perpendicular to gradients of light and shade. And that each artifact line is black/dark on one side and white/light on the other -- and that the white edge seems to be in the direction of darkening, while the black is in the direction of lightening.Someone here who works with modern image codecs must be able to hypothesize what part of encoding/decoding must be bugging out here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A slightly off-topic but still relevant - the app Libby is currently as close to that ideal library of everything for free. You have access to vast amount of books, especially most of the recently published ones (and some popular older ones that have digital versions published) and available for free, at your fingertip. Since I have started reading books through Libby, I read a lot more books, and started collecting more library cards :) Surprisingly few people seem to know about Libby. If you haven&#39;t installed one, you really should. And I am surprised there&#39;s no mention of Libby in HN when the topic is about books and its availability."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s funny how I&#39;ve witnessed a complete 180° change from how, in the 1990&#39;s, software was supposed to be entirely discoverable and it also came with a manual that documented literally everything, to now there&#39;s a ton that&#39;s hidden, often without any manual whatsoever... but you can Google everything you need to know.Probably the single most useful skill I&#39;ve had to learn in my life is, whenever you wonder something, just Google it. If you don&#39;t think your software does X... don&#39;t just assume it. Look it up.I&#39;ve been astonished at how often a feature was added 3 years ago to a program I&#39;ve used for 8 years, or there&#39;s a secret swipe that avoids a bunch of menus, or an unofficial command-line flag.And it really leaves me feeling deeply conflicted. Because on the one hand, I still believe in the virtue of learning your tools inside and out. I would read the manual and be proud I knew exactly what every program/language could and couldn&#39;t do. But on the other hand, is that really just a waste of time? Programs have so many features now, that instead of learning all the things via discoverability or a manual, we just learn them by... querying how to do things when we need them.I don&#39;t really like the idea of so fundamentally relying on Google and forums and tutorials and Reddit and YouTube videos as the main way of learning how to use software. But at the same time, software does so much now and adds new things so quickly that it appears to be the only reasonable way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Back Tap feature is my favorite &#34;hidden&#34; action on the iPhone. You can double (or triple) tap the back of the phone to trigger whatever action you want. For example, toggle the flashlight or lock rotation. Show Spotlight or run a Shortcut.https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/back-tap-iphaa57e7885...I think Apple does a decent job telling people about iOS features across the User Guide, Tips.app, and the Apple Support YouTube channel.The &#34;undiscoverable&#34; features in the article are all there.Delete the last digit: If you make a mistake when you enter a number, swipe left or right on the display at the top.https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/calculator-iph1ac0b5c...Turn the onscreen keyboard into a trackpad.1. Touch and hold the Space bar with one finger until the keyboard turns light gray.2. Move the insertion point by dragging around the keyboard.https://support.apple.com/guide/iphone/type-with-the-onscree...To access other open tabs, you can swipe left or right on the tab bar.https://youtu.be/30tfnCxLWSg?t=21"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The actions listed in the article are fairly non-essential, but many fundamental iOS functions also have discoverability issues, as well as some head-scratching design choices.  For example:- seeing notifications requires swiping down specifically from the top left- turning on the flashlight requires swiping down specifically from the top right.  Swiping down from top left also gets you a flashlight button, but it is not actionable.  The flashlight button on the home screen is also not actionable.- universal search requires swiping to the left of the app pages.  Swiping past the right end of the app pages also gets you a search bar, but it will only show you apps- Seeing your open apps requires swiping up slowly from the bottom of the page.- turning the phone off requires holding two unrelated buttonsMobile UX generally is heavily-dependent on gestures, which inherently creates discoverability challenges, but it seems like Apple goes out of its way to hide every basic function behind a very specific swipe.  It makes me wonder if they intentionally design their products to be exclusively usable by tech-savvy people.Another possible explanation is that design requires users to develop muscle memory over time that will improve experience in the long run and makes competitors feel unnatural."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not a comment on the quality of this application, but rather a tangential topic: there should be some way of auditing the accuracy of emulators in general. If a genuine homebrew scene wants to exist (not just getting old games to work), new programmers who have little-to-no access to the original hardware need some practical way of knowing their software will work properly across different emulators. In the old days, most platforms had one good emulator that everyone used, and these emulators were supported by communities like AtariAge. In the Web 2.0 world, those communities are fractured or even gone completely, and often not easy to find in search engines. There are now much more platforms that emulators can be run on.Hardware emulation isn’t a solution. An FPGA emulator isn’t intrinsically more accurate than a software one, and documentation and schematics that are used to implement emulators can be incorrect and don’t specify ‘undefined behavior’ which was very much used reliably by software developers.The approach adopted by MAME has proven to be the only reliable: you have to measure some output on a real working system and compare it to the emulator behavior, but this can be impractical and becomes moreso over time as systems become more difficult to operate. (E.g. I can’t even operate most 8-bit computers without some kind of mod because I don’t have a CRT television anymore)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This urgently needs shareable URL&#39;s for each game...Otherwise when someone finds a cool game, they can&#39;t tell friends about it without that friend having to hunt through menus.Also, search engine indexing ought to be possible so that you can search a game name on Google/DDG and go direct to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dig the Netflix style navigation, I&#39;m curious if there are plans to support arbitrary ROMs for classic games. Probably can&#39;t host them, but maybe an easy way to load one from local?edit: should have scrolled down in the readme more, they say in the non-goals section:Directly playing locally stored game content (ROMs, etc.)
(Technically possible by using a local web server, but not a primary use case)"</p>

I would HIGHLY prefer this to a short press release blurb that allows pop-science clickbait aggregators (or even worse, the &#34;science&#34; sections of CBS/CNN and the like) to have first crack at it.This was produced by the university themselves, and provides a concise yet accurate and detailed overview of the biochemistry involved, as well as a nice short embedded youtube video demonstrating the movement in question and going over the main points of the research.Yes, improvements could be made, and yes, follow up studies will need to be performed. But this is head and shoulders above the &#34;ONE SMALL TRICK, DIETICIANS HATE HIM&#34; alternative we would have gotten otherwise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For all the comments wondering what the particular movement and equipment is, see pages 5 and 6 of the supplementary materials: https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/1-s2.0-S25890042220114... The equipment is an electromyography system with realtime display. It measures the muscle contraction and is displayed to the subject so they can learn to recognize the movement that properly activates the muscle. Contrary to the video, you do not need to be an academic to buy one, they&#39;re fairly common in high-end sports coaching/rehab and you can find a cheap arduino-compatible system on Amazon if you want to DIY.If you don&#39;t read much exercise science, it&#39;s worth noting the paper says &#34;It is important to note that volunteers in Experiment I (Table S1) were typically sedentary (verified with an objective tracking device), and none of them had a high aerobic cardiorespiratory fitness (determined by treadmill VO2max or the maximal oxygen consumption test).&#34; A common pitfall of exercise science is that almost anything works wonderfully on untrained sedentary subjects. Wait for replication."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Instead of breaking down glycogen, the soleus can use other types of fuels such as blood glucose and fats. Glycogen is normally the predominant type of carbohydrate that fuels muscular exercise.&gt; When the SPU was tested, the whole-body effects on blood chemistry included a 52% improvement in the excursion of blood glucose (sugar) and 60% less insulin requirement over three hours after ingesting a glucose drink.That&#39;s amazing if it is true."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t necessarily agree with the step of putting the code in a separate function; that often works, but just as often makes it so that the code can&#39;t be read top-to-bottom anymore which hurts readability.In this case there&#39;s, I think, a better alternative; the equivalent-ish code in Ruby for the example code here would be something like this:   values = s
      .partition(&#39;?&#39;)[-1]
      .split(&#39;&amp;&#39;)
      .map { |key_value| key_value.partition(&#39;=&#39;)[-1] }

You can write these nice functional pipelines where you just read the code top-to-bottom and see step-by-step what is being done to the data on each line. You don&#39;t have to jump up-and-down around the code when reading it, and you don&#39;t have to keep too much context in your head when reading it.This is one of the reasons why I vastly prefer Ruby over Python for most data processing tasks. I wish more languages would support this style of programming."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now I know where Rust got some of its syntax from...As an aside, when I see samples like this, it makes me itchy. I hope and assume that they&#39;re being used as made-up snippets just to illustrate a point, and aren&#39;t being lifted from an actual codebase.Because... ugh... isn&#39;t it obvious? Attacker-controlled input such as URLs should never be manipulated with naive string processing! Always use a proper parsing library. Not to mention that complexities of URL encoding, character escapes, etc...The problem is that the author is using abstractions at the wrong level, with or without his fixes. The correct solution would be something like:    var uri = new Uri( &#34;http://foo/demo?test=a&amp;blah=b%20c&#34; );
    var map = System.Web.HttpUtility.ParseQueryString( uri.Query );
    
    Console.Out.WriteLine( &#34;is blah equal to &#39;b c&#39;?\n{0}&#34;, map[&#34;blah&#34;] == &#34;b c&#34; );

The above example is C#, but similar code can be written in any language. It&#39;s simple, direct, and doesn&#39;t violate the &#34;rule of six&#34;. It can be read like English:1. Construct a URI from a given string.2. Parse the query part of the URI into a map.3. Test if the &#39;blah&#39; value in the query is &#34;b c&#34; as expected, with the escaped space decoded properly.The example of how to apply the &#34;MORF&#34; rule in the article still has low-level operations involved, which doesn&#39;t make the code more readable. It doesn&#39;t describe the intent, which is the key thing to writing code that doesn&#39;t need comments every second line."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What the author is missing is that easy to read/reason/understand about is within the context of making a change to the code to fix a bug, add a feature or make some non-functional improvement to it.This is what most of the &#34;easy to read&#34; articles forget.Show me why it is easier to fix a bug, add a feature or make a non-functional improvement to the code with their style than without.For example, if you&#39;ve extracted something into its own function, are you then sharing this function and using it in other places as well? If you then change the body of that function, are you now possibly breaking other parts of the code that relied on its old behavior?If you&#39;ve introduced a local mutable variable in between two lines, are you then mutating that variable prior/later? Is the query_params different at the end of the function then in the middle? Can you safely use it again?How easily can you now introduce new behavior before, in the middle, after, and anywhere in-between?When you modify the behavior to fix a bug, add a feature or make a non-functional improvement, is it an isolated change? How many tests break? Did it require major refactoring to make or very few things had to change? How easy was it to add a test for your new behavior? Was it easy to find the most appropriate place in the code to make the change? Etc.Sure sometimes maybe you just read code for the fun of understanding what it does, but almost always in practice when you&#39;re working on a code base, you only care to understand and reason about the code because you&#39;re looking to deliver that next sprint task that involves changing something about it.I wish more people focused on &#34;easy to change/modify&#34; then simply on &#34;easy to read/understand&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not a new problem, back in the late 80s I worked for a Mac graphics card developer ... We made some of the first 24bit accelerated graphics cards.Our first was just an existing card with a small daughter card with pals an sram on it, it was so easy that we got our own logos put on many of the chips to put the competition off the scent, we designed that one in days and got it to market in weeks.We immediately started on 2 more designs. The next was all FPGA, it was as big a nubus card as one could build, it pulled too much power, and tilted under it&#39;s own weight out of the bus socket (Mac&#39;s didn&#39;t use screws to hold cards in place, that happened when you closed the chassis). We got it out the door about the point that the competition beat the first board&#39;s performance.The final card was built with custom silicon, designed backwards from &#34;how fast can we possibly make the vrams go if we use all the tricks?&#34;, In this case we essentially bet the company on whether a new ~200 pin plastic packaging technology was viable. This design really soaked the competition.In those days big monitors didn&#39;t work on just any card so if you owned the high end graphics card biz you owned the high end monitor biz too ... The 3 card play above was worth more than $120m"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised this isn&#39;t mentioned here more clearly: Some high end cases like the be quiet silent base I&#39;m using have the option to mount the graphics card vertically, basically parallel to the mainboard, in a separate anchor slot. It needs an additional connector cable (~$20), but other than that is easy to setup, looks better with a look-in case (the illuminated fans face the glass side) and the weight pulls on a special anchor point just for that with no electronics involved. Plus the card itself is more sturdy in that orientation and there is no issues with bending through its own weight. It might even be beneficial ventilation-wise as the graphics card no longer causes a horizontal divide (basically creating separate ventilation-zones on the top and bottom of the card).Yes, the cable will add approximately ~0.3ns of additional latency due to the added 10cm of distance.This is how it looks like:https://www.hardware-journal.de/images/Bilder/2018/test/be-q...https://www.hardware-journal.de/images/Bilder/2018/test/be-q..."</p>
