								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great project, well done. Algorithmic music is fascinating to me, I feel like there&#39;s a lot of untapped potential in the concept particularly with more &#39;complex&#39; genres where higher levels of composition and structural continuity are required. This tends to work much better with loop-based genres but I&#39;d personally love to do a side project on something that could write melodies from some sort of generative grammar for example. A lot of these exist but the results are mixed very often.For me the interesting part is not just in getting a computer to do all the work but using it as a compositional aide. You can think of it at writing music at a higher level of abstraction. Rather than writing a score you can write the rules of the score and use a stochastic process to spit out permutations for example. Eg imagine writing a program that could spit out Eric Satie-esque melodies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This generates much better patterns than any other music web project I&#39;ve tried. Awesome work.If you had no music experience, snuck into a club, impersonated a DJ, and just pressed play on this, I think even without touching it, no one would notice anything&#39;s amiss. If you messed around with it occasionally, you&#39;d probably get hired back. (And that&#39;s a compliment to the app; definitely not a diss of acid techno.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; AirTag is designed for over a year’s worth of battery life with everyday use. The CR2032 battery is user-replaceable and widely available. Replacement batteries are sold separately.That&#39;s the piece of information I wanted to know first. Devices like this can be built, but those can&#39;t run on batteries for a reasonable time frame.Apple made it practical."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought one of the big use cases for this was to track stolen items, like a backpack or maybe even a bicycle.But the &#34;anti-stalking&#34; feature will notify someone if an AirTag they don&#39;t own appears to be traveling with them.Does this render it useless for anti-theft, then? Since it will just notify a thief that the bike they just stole is being tracked, and they can look for the AirTag and throw it in the nearest trash can?Not criticizing Apple here -- anti-stalking is super-important -- but just looking for clarification if this will help you find lost items, but not stolen ones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A week ago my wife dropped her Iphone from a ski lift, and couldn&#39;t find it afterwards. I went to try and find it, from home she used Find my phone to get a picture of the location, and had it play sounds when I was nearby. I found it under a foot of snow, first try. This has been around for a while now but it was the first time I saw it first hand, I was blown away."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The funny thing to me, which I haven&#39;t seen anyone else mention yet, is that way, way back in the old days, Grafana started out as a fork of Kibana. Go take a look at the first commit in the Grafana source:
https://github.com/grafana/grafana/commit/75d03fc49ab4f95ee4...Anyone want to guess what the third commit was? That&#39;s right, it was an Apache 2 license:
https://github.com/grafana/grafana/commits/master?after=2bb7...Before there was any code, there was a permissive license. If the choice had been made 8 years ago to make Kibana less-permissively licensed, it&#39;s very likely Grafana wouldn&#39;t exist right now.And for historical fun, here&#39;s the first commit from Torkel after the fork from Kibana v3:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I applaud this decision.I would like to see all major SaaSS projects be AGPLv3. End users still have freedom to user, modify, and distribute the software. Cloud providers must share contributions.This is how I like it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t want to weigh in here with a huge value judgement on whether this is the right decision. However, I do want to say that what they&#39;re saying regarding SSPL vs AGPL is totally right. One of the biggest sticking points with SSPL is that it&#39;s not even really plausibly open source, and it tries to create restrictions that implicate software that is not even &#34;linked&#34; with the program that is licensed under it, which calls into question whether it&#39;s even legally enforceable.[1]AGPL is somewhat controversial, but the reasoning for AGPL to exist is chiefly to protect the end user&#39;s rights, however misguided that may be in your opinion. In this case Grafana presumably retains the copyright to these programs, so presumably they are not beholden to these restrictions in any way. On the other hand, though, it does mean that other providers will have to distribute their patches back to the community, which is pretty much the entire goal of copyleft open source in the first place.In any case, this is, in my opinion, a lot better than SSPL or the Timescale license.[1]: https://www.processmechanics.com/2018/10/18/the-server-side-...edit: wording regarding AGPL was changed, because the claim that considering AGPL as not open source is “somewhat controversial” isn’t quite accurate; it’s more correct to say the license itself is simply controversial."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Speaking as an 18 y.o. doing my first year college online, I wouldn&#39;t have made it through quarantine without Discord. I&#39;ve a server with my high school friends and since Discord lowers the barrier to join a voice call so much it&#39;s super chill to just hop in a channel when doing homework or playing a game or whatever else, and anyone else who&#39;s free can join.I really wish there were competition, but there&#39;s nothing AFAIK that can replicate this particular experience except for Teamspeak, which has other problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s crazy to me to think how TeamSpeak and Ventrilo had more than a decade to iterate and never came up with something like Discord. Xfire came close multiple times, but never got the voice part right, though for the time the client was acceptable.Granted, the server model was very different for TS and Vent (more so the latter), but it was normal then. Kudos to the Discord team on making a solid product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Discord does not give users a choice to opt-out of their wildly invasive data collection methods including logging executables running on your system while the desktop client is open, not just games. This data alone is very valuable.Comment from a 2019 support thread &#34;I am pretty flabbergasted that people aren&#39;t making a bigger deal of this than they are. Discord actively monitors your executables, but the larger concern for people now seems to be its inaccuracy in identifying them as games.

It&#39;s likely that &#39;smart&#39; people are just as likely to be unaware of their own follies or inabilities, I would argue, maybe more so as a lot of smart people tend to be &#39;inwardly focused&#39; and less concerned about their direct environment.This kind of thing happens all the time among Exec. level, but normally we&#39;d expect it from Ford CEO, not Google types. It may be an odd sign of industry maturity.That said, we shouldn&#39;t discount how often this kind of stuff actually does work. Watching the crowd at the Oracle conf. eat up Larry Ellison&#39;s huffery as through he was some kind of market visionary was the lesson at the other end of the spectrum, and it&#39;s that &#39;If you&#39;re rich and stand on stage and say something that &#39;sounds credible&#39;, a lot of people with just believe it&#39;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Do Spotify actually manage to sell any significant number of subscriptions due to podcasts?Personally when ever I hear about an interesting podcast, and it&#39;s followed by &#34;available on Spotify/Podimo, whatever&#34;, my reaction is always: Okay, never mind then.There are so many great podcasts on the open web. Those available on platforms like Spotify always seems to be people with existing celebrity status trying to &#34;cash in&#34;. Those shows are rarely that interesting, and even if they are there are so many competitors.Assuming you have an existing successful podcast, I don&#39;t get why you&#39;d move to something like Spotify. Are you really going to make that much more money? Your share of $10 per month cannot be high. Of cause it Spotify throws a large sum at you, to effectively buy your listeners, then I see the profit motive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Joe who?Seriously, I think that there are a number of reasons why this won&#39;t pan out as predicted:- There aren&#39;t really any tent-pole, must listen podcasts. They thought Joe Rogan was one but I&#39;m hearing a lot of people have stopped listening to him on Spotify (I have).- Spotify (and others) don&#39;t have the money to buy out the whole podcast ecosystem and many podcast makers I think would resist going Spotify exclusive.- I like my podcast player a lot and there is no way I&#39;m giving it up for the inferior Spotify experience.I see podcasting as being more like YouTubing - sure there are outfits generating substantial revenue from advertising but many have more diverse revenue streams and reaching the largest audience is more important that an uplift in advertising revenue. Plus not everyone on YouTube is there for the $$$"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post is essentially a funding pitch for Spotify. I talks a lot about they are going to try and kill the open podcast ecosystem but no evidence that they are making any progress. The podcast ecosystem is very different from other media markets-- it started open, it grew up open, and people are actually willing to directly pay content producers either for bonus content, to avoid ad reads, or just to keep the train chugging along. 
I immediately  unsub from any podcast where there is some jarring dynamic ad insertion. I&#39;ve watch all of the once great Gimlet podcasts wither, and some die since their acquisition.Yea there is a market for the low-est common denominator stuff like low-brow true crime stuff and the joe rogans, but I don&#39;t see those as competition, either for sponsors or ears to the healthy, robust, mature open podcast ecosystem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; There’s no evidence that the deal directly affects coverage in either the news or editorial departments. Before the Facebook News deal, the Times famously published an op-ed titled “It’s Time to Break Up Facebook,” by Chris Hughes, a cofounder of Facebook turned critic. And since the deal, columns from Tim Wu and Kara Swisher, among others, have been similarly critical. In December, the editorial board welcomed a lawsuit calling for Facebook to be broken up.It&#39;s kind of a throwaway passage in the article but it feels like a crucial point. Maybe I&#39;m wrong but &#34;buying off&#34; to me strongly suggests something along the lines of a bribe. We&#39;re going to give you this cash, nudge nudge, wink wink, maybe that negative stuff you print about us goes away. My question is: is this actually happening?The core conflict here isn&#39;t new, surely. Newspapers have taken advertising money from news-making companies since time immaterial. The question has always been whether that money affects coverage. And so far it seems like &#34;no&#34;, or &#34;not yet&#34;. And there&#39;s a very worthy debate to be had here, much as there always has been about advertising in news media, but the headline doesn&#39;t do that debate justice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is worth remembering the Australia fiasco. The Australian media led by Murdoch basically shook down Facebook until they came to am agreement to give the media kickbacks. Then Australia agreed not to apply its law.The European media has also demanded payments, even though the value flows from sending traffic to news sites and not the other way around.The media seems to believe it is entitled to be send traffic AND to be paid for it. Common story all over the world.So, to reduce those demands in America, Facebook pays kickbacks to the biggest media orgs.Here, the media publication is presenting it as a grant for favourable coverage. But the far more likely explanation is Facebook knows the media will shake it down for more money unless it gives them a payoff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s always been the case that big advertisers influence the media that cover them. In the quaint old days there was a metaphorical &#34;wall&#34; between the business side and the news side, and neither could influence there other. In theory, that is. In practice, at a high enough level, the wall was less of a 16&#39; fence topped with razor wire and more like police tape.Of course, we don&#39;t live in the quaint old days. There&#39;s no distinction between news as journalism and news as business. Writers are measured not on how good their reporting is, but on how much &#34;engagement&#34; it gets, which is just a proxy for how profitable.Is it a bribe or buyoff? Or just a failure of credibility? Newspapers used to have a position called the ombudsman to address just this scenario. The New York Times had a position called Public Editor. That position was eliminated in 2017[1]1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_editor"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The semiconductor supply chain is now almost completely disaggregated ie everyone specialises in just a small part of the value chain. ARM’s speciality is in CPU design and it has carved out for itself the enviable position of being the defacto standard for mobile applications - almost every single phone on the planet has ARM processor(s) running it. And their products are in dozens of other end applications segments as well. These chips are embedded in System on Chip IC’s and manufactured by third party companies like TSMC and UMC etc to end customer specifications, like Apple or Samsung for example.The problem with the original SoftBank deal, and now the Nvidia deal, is that these companies will simply hollow ARM out (slash R&amp;D, cut staff etc) to pump up the target’s value, before flogging it off or breaking it up. The stock market doesn’t value synergies, although it is quite happy to punt this aspect when M&amp;A deals are in the offing.  Given its strategic position as the defacto standard for mobile comms, that’s a serious threat.ARM also gives the UK strategic leverage in any trade negotiations. Would we knowingly allow Rolls-Royce Jet Engines to be flogged off? No. Ditto ARM.So, I think this is the right policy and hopefully the government will see fit to step into other deals like this and block them.I’ve been through a PE acquisition. We were stripped bare and bits sold off before finally getting our mojo back. I benefited handsomely but we were not the company we were before and the job losses in the process were huge. It will be no different with Nvidia’s proposed take over of ARM.(disclaimer: I was a semiconductor executive in a global MNC)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess governments are suddenly much more interested in keeping key industries on-shore.I believe HMG didn&#39;t do anything to stop Astra-Zeneca being sold out of the UK a few years ago, and it&#39;s just luck it didn&#39;t go through. They probably see the need now."</p>
