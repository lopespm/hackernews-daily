								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I always found it funny that companies will go to extreme Herculean lengths to hire the best programmers, and are incredibly fearful and paranoid that they could be making a &#34;bad hire&#34;, and yet once hired they don&#39;t spend a second making sure engineers aren&#39;t completely running the software product off the rails and killing the company internally. The author mentions trying to rewrite Etsy&#39;s backend in Scala and MongoDB. That probably cost the company X million dollars. Etsy could still be recovering from that.The industry constantly mints senior engineers who have been bitten by complexity, but doesn&#39;t want to hire them, or listen to them. More often than not senior engineers pretend to be excited about complecting the tech stack, because hey, it pads their resume with the latest buzzwords and they&#39;ve given up trying to fight against it anyway.The last line of defense against a rogue engineering team is managers who have studied this stuff. How many engineering managers can spot the common situation &#34;the engineers are bored and they&#39;re rewriting perfectly-good codebases in Common Lisp and OCAML for funsies&#34;? And how many know what to do about it when they see it?Anyway, this is a cool website, and it&#39;ll be useful to point people to it in the future, so thanks for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with the non-boring technology club is that programmers see what problem FAANG companies are solving and wanting to be on the edge on new technology too. But they don‘t have the same problems. Another problem is they want to show what they can do. If they tell in an interview they are working with rails/django and a postgresql database they fear they look incompetent using those old technologies. So they try to convince their companies their products need to be rewritten in mongodb, react with graphql in a micro service stack and many more state of the art technologies.And in the end many developer years are wasted just rewriting a working an existing software in a new stack they are not yet comfortable with and the new product is much less stable than the old one.I love basecamp for their hotwired stack and showing that you can make the great software with old boring technologies and just a little bit of javascript magic pixie dust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way I see it is that one should master their stack.  If you work over and over again with the same stack you will know it well.  You will be able to move mountains with it.  But it takes years to arrive to that.  It takes implementing multiple projects the same way over and over again.You need the wherewithal to stick with your stack and not get lured away.  Maybe this is what boring means.  Maybe boring is different to different engineers based on their background.Sometimes you cannot select the stack cause there might be more senior engineers at a company and they have more sway.  This is fine as long as the engineers picking the stack have picked a stack they have mastered and it is boring to them.  As a regular engineer in their team I would hope to rely on their expertise and would hope to learn from them.I remember at one job a rogue engineer picked a boring backend that would have been fine.  But they fell behind because the other engineers knew their boring stack a lot better.  Ultimately the rogue engineer had to switch to the other boring stack.  The rogue engineer just was not fast enough to master it and implement the features required to keep pace with the demands of management.  These demands were trace centralized logging, security, and of course features.  So while they were still learning the ropes, we were moving on to even more advanced security, logging, and feature requirements.  They just couldn&#39;t keep up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I want to express sympathies in a particular way:When I had a job I didn’t want, in a city i didn’t want, no kids, no wife, and prospects abounding, it was easy to speak truth to power.  I did it, and I was right technically, businesswise, and 
morally.  What a win...(?)Now, I have my dream job, my dream location, my own damn house, and my family.  -Whole thing feels like a dream I might wake up from if I am not careful...  and I feel totally weighed down when it comes to speaking up in a way I would have never countenanced a few years ago.All that to say, this poor kid... I can only imagine the incentive structures that led him to choose this route, but I know academia being f’ed is a big part of it, and it ticks me off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m gonna get enemies for that ....But let&#39;s face it: the Academia peer review process is pretty rotten.- Many organisations could not care less about whatever crap you publish as long as you publish. And if possible a lot.- Many journal&#39;s reviewers are friend of friends and you can often easily guess their names, even in double blinded review.- Many reviewers care more about you quoting their own paper than giving any relevant feedback.- There is plenty &#34;pay2publish&#34; journals that care about quantity not quality that are commonly used by academia to &#34;force&#34; validate crappy researches/PHds- The publishing world is full of oversized-ego individuals that will destroy a paper just because it comes from a competing lab/department/professor and not because it is scientifically irrelevant.And that is only a little subset of the problems..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone really, really, really needs to get this professor&#39;s current students to safety immediately. Don&#39;t forget that shortly before the student&#39;s suicide, according to a screenshot of a conversation with the student who took his own life (same Medium account, earlier article), the professor threatened to kill the student if he &#34;ruined his reputation.&#34; His students are not safe and the focus should be on making sure they are safe."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Plastic recycling seems heavily motivated by emotion and virtue signaling.In reality, only about 5% of our crude oil use goes towards plastic.If we rolled out EVs, and then just burned all the plastic trash (using waste-to-energy plants), we would still be far ahead.The biggest challenges with plastics are hormone disruption, and microplastics (particularly in the 3rd world without sufficient landfill or W2E infrastructure or societal environmental concern).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Between Clipper and this, we’ve arrived at an inflection for SLS - it’s a dead program walking. The Senator from Alabama, Sen. Shelby is set to retire. And so it has become politically viable to sunset SLS.I predict that the program will end after Artemis flies and they have a plan in place for the jobs it creates"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a shame that the lunar gateway is useless and itself a jobs program like SLS. Since NASA decided not to fund the version of the asteroid retrieval mission (ARM) that included de-spin there are no near earth asteroids that can be brought back to the proposed space station. All it can do is uselessly orbit the Moon, getting full cosmic radiation dose instead of less than half in Earth orbit in the magnetosphere.In terms of resources the moon itself only has water. But it&#39;s down in a difficult to access gravity well. There&#39;s no nitrogen. Far, far, better would be fully funding ARM and starting to despin and drag asteroids to the lunar gateway for study, resources, and eventually living space in space protected from radiation and, if you build sub-surface tracks, enough acceleration to live normally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand how NASA&#39;s manned space program has become such a mess and basically a political football while their unmanned scientific missions seem to go pretty well. Whenever I hear something about SLS I feel sad for the people working on it.  Although the James Webb also seems to be a disaster."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m surprised by the backlash regarding this tool. Well, I guess surprised is the wrong word. I get that it is creepy. There are lots of websites that do this very thing like whatsmyname.app.I personally like running my username through tools like this and aggregating my digital presence. When I was younger, I signed up for lots of sites that were the cool, new thing. Checking myself years later, I am shocked by the wide berth I left. Fitness accounts. Accounts from that time I was getting into studying chess. I’m the type of person who is always on to the next hobby. I go 100% in on something, then pop to the next thing. It was a big wake up call to me looking back seeing how much presence I left. Many accounts are so old I can’t even get into them anymore to clean up what’s out there. Tools like this can be used for good.That said, I totally understand the cyber stalking/bullying concerns. I am also astounded by the cyber sleuth types. In the documentary, Don’t F* with Cats, people spent 100s of hours carefully walking through streets in Google Maps to match a location to a photo they had of a guy who killed a cat on YouTube. It seems to me where there’s a will, there’s a way. It’s scary, and unfortunately a lot of tools we can use to protect ourselves are the same tools that can be used against us. Look at cyber security in general. A black hat and a white hat are people with the same skills, but ethics draw a line between them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; API, CLI &amp; Web App for analyzing &amp; finding a person&#39;s profile across +300 social media websites&gt; could help in investigating profiles related to suspicious or malicious activities such as cyberbullying, cybergrooming, cyberstalking, and spreading misinformation.It will much more likely be used to aid cyberbullying and cyberstalking. Those types love digging for more information by finding their targets&#39; profiles on other social media sites.Those types of trolls are much more adept at using randomized usernames, disposable e-mail addresses, and VPN clients because they know what they&#39;re doing is potentially illegal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think that anyone developing a social media app for the 2020s will need to make a conscious decision to not let users pick their own unique identifiers. You can&#39;t expect users to protect themselves, because you don&#39;t know what dangers might exist in the future for them that do not exist today.The other thing you can do is not allow your API to iterate over the set of all users by user-set identifier. It&#39;s an extreme flaw of the telephone numbering system. You would think by the 2020s we&#39;d have learned to use a unique UUID designation for every user for any public facing APIs. If users want to link to it on their public pages, that would be on them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is interesting how manufactured distraction-free sessions like yoga, meditation, paid retreats, have emerged to fill the demand for idle time. We’re forgetting how to unplug unless it’s a product or service that we can buy.The distraction issue is the number one issue holding back most of the young people in the mentorship group I’m part of. They’re so glued to their phones to check minute-by-minute updates about COVID death tolls, how big their stimulus checks are going to be, the value of their crypto portfolio, GameStop, and every other popular topic under the sun that they don’t have any attention left for their own lives.Bitcoin is especially distracting right now, as they’re all nervously watching the real-time changes of their $1000 portfolios to see if they need to be sad about losing money because it’s crashing or sad about not investing more money because it’s going up.These are all smart students. I always wonder how much more they could accomplish if they’d simply pick four hours each day to turn off their phones. That’s a tough sell, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry to say this, but HN is a problem as well.I’m looking for that 1% of the posts that interest me, and when I find them it’s fantastic, since it’s info I would not be able to find anywhere else. But going through the other 99% is a waste of time.These two combined have a harmful effect on me. I don’t know if there’s a name for it, but it’s the same as the one causing addiction in gambling/bets/games. Gathering energy/motivation to do something productive instead takes effort.Just a few days ago I was thinking of adding a dns block for it. But that 1% of the links is sweet..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if we see a rise in ADHD in kids nowadays because it is an increasingly useful adaptation to our environment.&#34;Hyperfocus is the experience of deep and intense concentration in some people with ADHD. ADHD is not necessarily a deficit of attention, but rather a problem with regulating one’s attention span to desired tasks.&#34;I don&#39;t know, but &#34;hyperfocus&#34; on a hobby you love sounds exactly like what most people need nowadays to get off their phone and stop wasting their life staring on ads and ad-financed content. Also, I remember that most things we covered in school were completely irrelevant for the real world. So a difficulty to concentrate on school stuff may actually be better than doing the homework.In short, ignoring what society considers normal and instead being super focused on your own things ... sounds more healthy to me than the average &#34;normal&#34; person."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tangentially related to this post: I am surprised at the infosec’s love of file checksums, like MD5 here.
There are endpoint tools which collect MD5’s, network scanners which collect MD5s, and I have heard about actual infosec directors who, upon seeing a blog post like that, would carefully type the hashes in their endpoint management interface to make sure their org is not infected.How on earth can this be effective? It is trivial to create customized binaries in the installer, so no two users have the same file checksum. With a bit of work, one can rig their download server so each user has a completely different installer checksum as well.I remember reading about polymorphic viruses back in the 1990’s - not only those had different checksums for each  computer, they also had no long-ish substrings common between two versions, making signature analysis ineffective. Did malware authors just forgot about all those and went back to trivial “everyone gets the same image” strategy?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Mistake 3: Communicating something one time is enoughI joined a company once where a particularly skilled engineer had become a manager.   She was very good at her job and I&#39;m fairly certain had something like &#39;perfect recollection&#39;.We were in a meeting and she went on about how she was upset people were doing a troubleshooting process wrong despite having sent out a detailed email.Not wanting to do that thing wrong I searched my email, but couldn&#39;t find it.   I asked about it and she told me &#34;Oh it was before you joined us.&#34;.I had been with that team for two years...People tend to remember important things like it was yesterday, but don&#39;t always realize that other people can only absorb so many important things / don&#39;t always know how important it is... and email is kinda a terrible way to communicate it too.   Let alone 2+ years earlier ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the most difficult things I had to learn to do as an engineering manager was to be able to confront attitude problems and take action as quickly as possible.Performance problems can be fixed. Attitude problems are much harder to solve. You will face this situation multiple times in your career as engineering manager.I&#39;m not very aggressive or confrontational by nature, so having that conversation with the engineer in question is absolutely not something I looked forward to. This obviously led to an unfair amount of work for the others in the team, a feeling of unfair treatment, resentment and a hit to morale and performance.Two situations were so extreme that we&#39;ve had to lay off the engineer(s) in question, which is one of the hardest things to do as a manager. I can tell you that in both instances the teams fared much better afterwards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mistakes I&#39;ve seen eng mgrs make:- not acknowledging obvious elephants in the room- not building enough trust early on with their reports that when a problem comes up, the information they get is biased as they are seen as part of leadership/management and not the team- applying pressure in the wrong direction (ie; if the team is moving slow because of stress or fear, making things more stressful will not speed things up)- trying too hard to be friends with all their reports, rather than figuring out the appropriate boundaries on a person to person basis- relaying anonymous information around in an effort to &#34;protect people&#34; and thus making themselves the go-between between all members on a team rather than encouraging people to work things out themselves- for ICs that then became mgrs, staying way too focused on the in the weeds details and not on the bigger picture or people details, up to an including still spending too much time coding or trying to do PR reviews that carry too much weight--I would actually go so far as to say that the best &#34;IC turned managers&#34; I&#39;ve had have been about at par with the most mediocre &#34;good people mgrs that didn&#39;t come through coding for that role&#34;, and the people in that role that excelled at it (a motley crew of former stage managers, teachers, guidance counselors, project managers, etc)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Running an alternative OS &#34;natively&#34; on a Mac doesn&#39;t seem very appealing to me. It&#39;s almost guaranteed you will never fully get Wi-Fi, audio, graphics acceleration, the trackpad, etc. working flawlessly, especially on the M1 where almost every component is Apple proprietary and it&#39;s not a matter of loading, say, some common Intel graphics driver.On the other hand, virtualization _already_ lets you run whatever arm64 BSD, Linux, or Windows that you want. The trackpad and everything else will work flawlessly thanks to guest additions. Yes, you make some tradeoffs -- you sacrifice a core, a few GB of RAM, some disk space for an OS you don&#39;t _really_ want to be running. But I&#39;m skeptical that these are not better tradeoffs than constantly using a hacked-together and half-broken OS.To me the ideal solution is not that Corellium or Marcan or whoever reverse engineers the drivers to a sufficient degree. I&#39;d rather see Apple (or the Hackintosh types) release a tiny variant of macOS that contains hardware drivers and Hypervisor.framework and not much else. It could be the next generation of Boot Camp and it would probably take less engineering effort for them to maintain while satisfying the small segment of customers interested in running other operating systems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic. OpenBSD on an M1 Mac Mini would be a great home server.As for desktop, I love cwm on my thinkpads, but macbook touchpads have won me over. That said, if arcan gets to a usable state on OpenBSD, I wouldn&#39;t mind sinking a few weekends (and/or crates of beer) into helping with improving touchpad/gesture support. X11 is just too daunting to have me bothered."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So much for the many remarks made on HN claiming that Apple would use the M1 to further exert control over users’ ability to boot an alternative OS. Between this and Asahi Linux, I’d say things are off to a good start.Btw, Asahi has a Patreon page for anyone who wants to contribute. I’m tossing twelve bucks a month and recommend any Mac users with interest in booting alternative OSes support such projects.Now I’m gonna see if there’s an option to throw money at this."</p>
