								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes it’s a negative feedback loop created by the very bad product decisions they made to optimize for local maxima of getting more ads revenue. You inject more and more ads followed by more and more suggested content, thereby reducing the in network content. The in network content doesn’t get as much of traction, therefore people stop posting. This in turn forces the feed to have more and more suggestions and a few stale in network posts from days ago. This drives engagement down from people who want to see in network content and they leave. So what is left is people who do engage with suggested content, pushing the product to make decisions to push even more suggested content. All of this continues till eventually fatigue sets in and a sudden rapid drop in engagement kicks in because your global maxima of a quality product was lost long time ago and your product dies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Crazy idea: FB should stop trying to lure people back from Tiktok with weird features and just lean in to its one remaining strength, which is that among social media sites, it&#39;s the most generic and boring and ubiquitous.  Being the default place for non-influencers to do quotidian stuff like hearing about school closings, joining the PTA or HOA, coordinating family gatherings, see your nephew&#39;s school photos, etc would be a pretty good little business.  And they already have all of that functionality built, so they could run significantly leaner, and hence not have to drive their remaining users away with excessive ads.This seems like a good idea to me.  But I also think it&#39;s about as likely to happen as President Stallman."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Knowing the beast firsthand, there&#39;s no trace of doubt in my mind that the convergence to a junk product outcome involved a monotonous increase in ad revenue and likely, engagement metrics.There&#39;s a tragic dimension that a system which connected so much of humanity to itself so well would be rendered so toxic as a product and as a community in just a few years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Please no. Someone tell me it&#39;s just an unconfirmed rumor. Why would they do such a thing?I am at very high risk for Factorio addiction, and the only reason I haven&#39;t played it yet is because I don&#39;t play PC games anymore. But I do have a Switch, and having Civ VI on there was enough of a problem, thank you very much.Goodbye everyone!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even though it is many orders of magnitude simpler than the real-world equivalent, I find that there is no better way of grasping the logistics of modern civilization than playing Factorio.In fact, it&#39;s probably in the Goldilocks zone: easy enough to play, but complicated enough to convey the kind of resource, energy and transport logistics involved in scaling a multi-step production process. It is like an illustrative toy model.The aliens even give the game a satisfying environmental and political dimension, though the mechanics in this respect are more straightforward, i.e., just kill the aliens. Though emitting less pollution with solar also helps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Curious to see how well it translates to controllers. I know there is limited support on the Steam Deck, but I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s still subpar to traditional mouse/keyboard controls.From the link:Factorio was developed for 10 years with only keyboard and mouse in mind, so making sure the game is fully playable with controllers was no easy task. Playing with a controller is slightly slower, and will take some getting used to (just as it does when playing with keyboard and mouse for the first time). After becoming familiar with it, I find it very comfortable. I recommend everyone to play through the first levels of our tutorial campaign, as it&#39;s a great way to get acquainted with playing Factorio with a controller."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was a kid in 1998, the newly returned Steve Jobs introduced the original iMac from Apple, the first Mac without a floppy disk drive. This seemed like a monumental shift to me at the time, and me and my friends had just started to write our own freeware and shareware video games for the platform. I named our software company SloppyDisk Software. We stuck to that brand for around 10 years, releasing games like Sloppy Sokoban, Pong Wars, and Descender.Crazy to think that now there&#39;s just one disk supplier hanging on to a bulk order of floppies, supplying the whole world.Here&#39;s what sloppydisk.com looked like in its heyday, for those interested: http://web.archive.org/web/20070921170305/http://www.sloppyd..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I miss the physicality of floppy disks. Picking up a caddy of disks, thumbing through reading the labels, sliding them into the drive and hearing the motor whirr.Nowadays, my caddy has been replaced with a small plastic bag full of chips and thumbdrives. Even though my small bag can easily hold millions of times more data, the little chips aren&#39;t a joy to use. None of them have labels telling their contents. All of them are fiddly. They are obnoxiously easy to loose."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago, the last man standing in the punched paper tape business, &#34;westnc.com&#34;, finally gave it up. There were still some numerically controlled machine tools running off paper tape. In 2019, NSA punched a crypto key into paper tape for the last time. As far as I can tell, nobody in the US still sells punched paper tape.Although if you really need it, you could get it made. I restore old Teletype machines, including the kind that printed on 5/16&#34; paper tape. I had a thousand rolls of such tape made up by a company in China, that being the minimum order, and I still sell some now and then to Teletype collectors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This bit from the employee announcement about how they&#39;re handling equity vesting [1] is worth highlighting as a pretty classy move, all things considered:&gt; We’re waiving the one-year equity vesting cliff for all departing employees so that everyone has an opportunity to be a shareholder, regardless of your tenure. [...] All departing teammates will qualify for an extended option exercise period of 5 years, and we have extended it to 7 years in regions where we are legally able.It must be jarring to be on the receiving end of a layoff. In the grand scheme of things, a laid-off employee surely has bigger things to worry about... but I still think what they did here with the equity, especially the option exercise period, is a nice touch. Not many companies do this sort of thing, but they should.[1]: https://blog.patreon.com/a-note-from-jack"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I subscribe to a single Patreon. It&#39;s an artist publishing an online comic. I pay for day-ahead access vs the public site.Reading the thing I pay for is fucking _painful_ on Patreon. So is trying to use their comment system to interact with the creator or other fans. Everything is slow-loading infinite scroll with tons of &#34;load more&#34; links. It is absolutely dreadful and every time I interact with the site I&#39;m reminded that I really should cancel my subscription.The experience has not meaningfully changed in years.They can pay all the lip service they like but Patreon sucks at connecting creators to fans/subs. Their content presentation sucks. Their search sucks. Their comment system sucks.Whatever they are doing they aren&#39;t making the service more useful to the people forking over the money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Full post from Jack Conte&#39;s Instagram post:&#34;Hi everyone - I have some sad news to share: today, Patreon is doing a layoff of about 80 employees, about 17% of our team. This was ultimately my decision, so I wanted you all to hear directly from me about the reasoning.Before I do, I want to say two things: first, today will be painful for many people, and I am deeply sorry to the incredible teammates who will be leaving Patreon - they are good, kind, creator-first, exceptionally talented, and smart people.And second, I remember how nerve-racking it was when I was a full time creator - before starting Patreon - to watch companies that I depended on go through moments like this. So for those of you who rely on Patreon for your business and communities: I want to assure you that the company is making this move precisely for that reason - so we can continue to be a rock for your business.As the world has recovered from COVID lockdowns and entered a broader economic slowdown, it has become clear that the original plan we built doe he year, to support outsized growth through the pandemic, is no longer the right plan for the company.I take full responsibility for choosing that original path forward, and for the resulting changes today, which will be so difficult for our team.It&#39;s important to me that we continue to deliver for our creators and patrons with new features and products like native video, new content creation and organization tools, a wold-class mobile experience, and new ways for creators to grow their membership and strengthen their communities. To ensure that we make progress on that roadmap, we are increasing our investment in product, engineering, and design, which means decreasing our spend on other ares of the company.Ad difficult as this is fo our team, I know this is the right thing to do for Patreon, because it ensures that the company maintains a position of strength, even through an economic downturn, while continuing to deliver for our creators.If you want to read more about this decision, I just published the internal note I sent to our team this morning, and it&#39;s linked in my bio. I&#39;m going to stop posting here for a while to be 100% present internally for our teammates at the company. But I promise to come back in a bit - I will see you all soon.- Jack&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hard to overstate Godard&#39;s importance to the film world, both as a critic and a filmmaker. As a critic with Cahiers du Cinema he and others championed many forgotten Hollywood films and established one of the first recognizable &#39;canons&#39; of film -- one of the beginning points of film history as a subject. And unlike his predecessor and colleague Bazin, Godard went beyond theory to actually create films that embodied the radical new ideas about film that the Cahiers crowd promoted. I&#39;ve seen people in the thread mentioning Italian Neorealism, and some of the great Hollywood films of  the 50s, all fantastic examples of forward-thinking film art. But Godard and his contemporaries&#39; contributions were about synthesizing earlier developments with a pop-art bent in a way that destroyed established boundaries of the medium and paved the way for explosions of film creativity on the continent and beyond. His genius was finding a middle ground between directors like Hawks and Rosselini, or Ford and Renoir, and using that space to create indelible masterpieces. RIP JLG"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Le Mépris (Contempt) is by far my favourite movie, peak cinema. Absolutely stunning Mediterranean cinematography, beautiful coastal and indoor shots, a decent plot with Odysseus in the background, and certainly not hurt by Brigitte Bardot&#39;s onscreen presence. Overall unbeatable aesthetics.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rF0Ju0ONwGUWatching it is like taking a short vacation. Phenomenal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is hard to overstate how much Godard changed cinema, even in America. If you don’t believe me check for yourself. Open the best picture nominees between 55’-65’ and watch their trailers. Films like Marty/On the waterfront/12 angry men/To kill a mockingbird/The Caine Mutiny/Sweet smell of success is what movies were like in the late 50s.The acting/writing was pompous, actors talked like reciting Shakespear. The movies were about heros of impeccable character doing heroic things and there always was a happy ending. Movie shots followed strict guidelines and the creative head of the movie was the producer while the director was akin to a contractor, someone hired to film the scenes.Starting in the mid 60s there was a radical shift, topping the nominations we have films like Five Easy Pieces, The French Connection, The Godfather, One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest, The Deer Hunter, Dog Day Afternoon, Taxi Driver etc. Actors would act and behave like normal everyday people facing everyday problems. The new Archetype is the Anti-Hero, someone with flaws/vices in their character, someone that viewers can relate to. We see the rise of the director as the auteur, the creative master of a film. Every known filmaking rule is being tested to it’s limits and broken by young experimenting directors.The catalyst for this change was the French New Wave, a group of young filmmakers tired of the old style of cinema wanting to do films about their own life and experiences. The poster boy for the New Wave was Jean-Luc Godard starting this revolution with his 1960 film Breathless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I made an API for a bank...   I was a third party and made the API by screen scraping their webUI.   I sent their devs a link and initially there were positive messages going back and forth.The API allowed you to see balance, transaction history, and make payments.Before long, the API got quite popular, and lots of people were using it to make lots of payments automatically.You know what makes money laundering super easy...   a banking API so you can split the million dollars you want to launder into 1 million 1 dollar payments.   And an API client which lets you treat each login cookie and account as an object in python.Before long, the API and all users who had ever used it were perma-banned from the bank, because it was determined they posed too high a fraud/money-laundering risk.I&#39;m still salty because, after spending a week of my life building and refining that API, they banned me and 6 years later still claim they can&#39;t return the $350 that was in the account because they are still &#39;investigating&#39;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Anything that you can achieve with PDFs, presence, and persistence in a bank branch you can do with our API.Not sure how to take this. With a small tweak like &#34;you can eventually do&#34; I would let it pass without criticism.I work with bank cores, imaging, BSA and related middleware on a daily basis. The scope and complexity of these systems is incomprehensible to most. Many of our clients don&#39;t even try to think about how fucked up their business is. They prefer to hire Deloitte and other vendors like us to be stressed about it for them.To give you an idea of how comprehensive a &#34;full&#34; banking API is, our combined WSDL and XSD references total ~9 megabytes. This is before codegen. The final reference sources as generated into the .NET codebase total nearly 20 megabytes. This is just the types &amp; method signatures. The actual implementations live in an IBM system manufactured some time during the previous millennium.But, none of that really matters. Whatever API method you call against a specific bank will have behavior that ultimately depends on a million things specific to them _and the region within which they operate_. So, its not enough to simply integrate with this massive API. You also have to understand a multi-dimensional matrix of regulations, end-customer behaviors, technological constraints, active geopolitical affairs, et. al."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"W4 Games&#39;s CEO Juan Linietsky is the creator and lead dev of Godot. Their primary mission, from my understanding, is providing the non-open-source tooling and support that&#39;s needed to make it feasible to use Godot as an environment for developing console games. The SDK&#39;s and their APIs cannot be included in the FOSS Godot code directly.Juan shared a blog post about the state of console support in Godot shortly before the launch of W4 that gives some more insight: https://godotengine.org/article/godot-consoles-all-you-need-...Often time folks say that what Godot is missing is a &#34;killer app&#34; that shows that the platform is viable. I think that this could potentially go a long way towards that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve started using Godot (4.0-alpha) for some hobby game dev recently. In the past I&#39;ve done a fair amount with Unity and touched Unreal once or twice. Thoughts so far:Godot is far from perfect. It&#39;s definitely more sparse than the others in terms of features. I&#39;ve encountered some bugs (nothing show-stopping, and it&#39;s tough to say how much of that is just from using the alpha version, but it has impacted my flow). There are unfortunate quirks; for example, saving scripts always saves the whole scene, and saving large scenes can pause the editor for multiple seconds, which is a particularly annoying combination. The programming model is heavily OOP. The custom scripting language, GDScript, is a blessing and a curse; its tight integration with the engine comes at the cost of subpar tooling (and of course, just learning a new language with new quirks).But.Godot has the distinct feeling of being cohesive. It feels like it was designed by one person, who knows what it takes to make games, and set out with a holistic vision. Everything you might need to do has an answer, or at least a story. You don&#39;t get confusing mixed signals from different parts of the interface or from the docs; there&#39;s one, intentionally-designed way to do each thing. GDScript has its quirks, but it also has very elegant built-ins for doing engine-specific stuff that would be super clunky in a general-purpose language. Using Godot almost has the feeling of using (good) Apple software; somebody anticipated your needs, and made sure they&#39;d be met. Maybe not in the exact way you would have picked, but in a way that will work, and will fit in with everything else.That, combined with it being fully open-source, makes it feel like it has good bones. Especially in contrast with Unity - which felt like a growing pile of corpses being tossed on top of each other with each release - it&#39;s been so refreshing that it&#39;s singlehandedly gotten me back into hobby game dev. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m wasting my time learning one half-baked API that&#39;s going to be replaced with another half-baked API six months from now. For every annoyance or missing feature in Godot, I have faith that things will continue to improve - because they&#39;re built on a solid foundation - or that I could at least build it myself if I really needed to.I believe in the vision and the future of this piece of software. And that makes it feel worthwhile to invest the time learning all its quirks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice! I don&#39;t think W4 has created any games though. To get some REAL traction, Godot needs some full well-known games published. Basically, we need a game to do to Godot, what Undertale and Nuclear Throne did to GameMaker.We have Wrought Flesh by Miziziziz, but other than that I can&#39;t think of a single game actually produced by Godot. I know it is capable of it, but we need a &#34;killer app&#34; to make it really blow up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Intellectually poor man&#39;s attempt at a summary of the summary:Part 1 - math proof that a formal system when evaluated by an agent &#34;breaking out of the system&#34; can use that system to prove itself inconsistent. (&#34;f* up&#34; the internal logic of that system by feeding it into itself)Part 2 - ironically, to be conscious you have to have an awareness of your own system (a &#34;strange loop&#34;) but you&#39;ll never be able to understand yourself as proven in part 1."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Certainly everybody believes that Godel&#39;s theorems are true. But I wonder if its&#39; Achilles heel is the notion of &#34;stepping outside&#34; of the formal system.Can we formalize what &#34;stepping outside&#34; means? How can we be sure we have done it correctly? When we step &#34;outside&#34; and do reasoning, are we doing it following the formal logic? Which logic? Are there rules as to what kind of inferences are NOT allowed when reasoning &#34;outside of the system&#34;?In other words when we &#34;reason outside of the formal system&#34; we are using English. Can we trust the logic of English is &#34;correct&#34;?Can a formal system really do self-reference? It&#39;s just strings. WE can give an interpretation to formal sentences but when we interpret a given sentence as referring to &#34;itself&#34; doesn&#39;t it really refers to the interpretation, not to &#34;itself&#34; but its interpretation?When natural language refers to the formal system doesn&#39;t it really just refer to what the formal system &#34;means&#34; in the natural language, not to the formal system itself as such?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Gödel&#39;s Incompleteness Theorem: any sufficiently rich formal system, together with an interpretation, has strings which are true but unprovable.This is only half of it!Gödel&#39;s Incompleteness Theorem states that any sufficiently rich formal system, together with an interpretation, either has strings which are true but unprovable or has strings which are provable but untrue. Either is possible! In practice people prefer to have true things that can&#39;t be proven rather than provable things that are untrue. But either is possible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The cost of building a consumer audio product is generally no more than 30% of retail. 30% COGS (cost of goods sold) is virtually a maximum for items sold at mainstream retailers.There’s nothing wrong with this. These are standard ratios, not some dirty secret.The cost of goods sold is only a fraction of the costs that go into getting products all the way into the customers’ hands and supporting them (customer support, warranty replacements, lost shipments, fraudulent orders, etc.). That’s not even counting the R&amp;D investment costs that go into making the product, as the post says.Salaries, warehousing, shipping, insurance, and all of the others costs of doing business add up.It’s not actually realistic to expect an entire company to be selling you a $300 product that costs them something like $250 to build. Every business in existence must build in enough margin to pay the people who do all of the work to make it happen and support it.If this seems shocking, consider that the COGS of software as a service products are much lower by comparison. Doesn’t matter, though, because you have to pay all of those expensive salaries to make it happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago I visited a friend in emmm..., &#34;Europe&#34;. He was not home and the neighbour let us in. He asked us to entertain ourselves until he gets back. It took little time to notice the pair of speakers: 50cm cubes, almost. I managed to turn them on and connect them to the TV. There I heard the most lifelike sound I ever heard from any speakers. I wondered: these should be some crazy European brand... no brand names anywhere on the boxes.Later that night I asked about the speakers and he went: &#34;What? They sound good?&#34;It turns out his friend works at &#34;Insert big European brand, not only audio here&#34; and they decided to make a great pair of speakers. Then he brings home a measurement device north of 6 figure €s, and they tune it so that you would not be able to distinguish a person talking behind you, from the recording of them being played with these speakers... Or as close you can get to that.Then they take their product to the company only to be laughed at: &#34;for anything below 5000€, we don&#39;t use any part above 50€. You have parts north of 500, this is not feasible for the market.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to apply across the entire Small Plastic-covered Electronics sector.  I worked for an instrumentation/sporting goods manufacturer among others and this reads like I wrote it myself.The CEO, even of a small operation, likely has no idea what the performance characteristics of their devices are.  They exist to raise capital and deal with paperwork.We operated at about a 25% bom cost which was muuuuch higher than it needed to be but we were the aforementioned $50 components assembled by baboons case.  The products were very high end meters and sensors with the electrical sophistication of a McDonalds toy, just using whatever the highest end parts Arrow et al would sell us.Like they aluded to, ultimately it&#39;s all the little stuff that gets you.  Packaging, whatever voodoo the S&amp;M team is up to, random IT bullshit, heath insurance, random FCC compliance stuff, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a degree in Studio Arts in addition to being a software developer (and recently I&#39;ve started making a lot of creative work with AI). Back when I was in school, there was already plenty of debate about &#39;what is &#34;Art&#34;&#39;? It&#39;s always been hotly contested. Most of my teachers felt that &#39;technique&#39; was not Art. Others were more purists – life painters, etc – and felt that, no, technique is art.Duchamp poked the art establishment in the eye with his &#39;readymades&#39; (urinals on the gallery wall, etc.) Warhol with his &#39;factory&#39; making silkscreens.The &#39;reverse Monet&#39; (too lazy to link) that caused such an uproar when it was shared last week was ironic – apparently people aren&#39;t aware that the impressionists themselves were considered &#39;not artists&#39; by a lot of people at the time.The camera and photography made many painters sit up and say, &#39;hey, it can&#39;t just be about &#34;image&#34; anymore&#39; – enter abstract expressionism, fauvism, cubism, etc. Work that shifted the focus from the image represented in the painting (&#39;a window into a world&#39;) onto the surface of the canvas itself: Rothko, Albers, etc.The thing is, people have wild misconceptions about what this technology does. Many clearly think it&#39;s a photocopier. As if StableDiffusion is hiding copies of all these works inside. When in fact what&#39;s been done is to take all of this online knowledge and create an incredible new tool with it. Like a music synthesizer times a million.It&#39;s understandable why this technology makes people uncomfortable. There are legit fears about displacement, economic uncertainty, etc. But we are fundamentally tool makers – it&#39;s arguably intrinsically part of what makes us human (borrowing from Carl Sagan&#39;s &#34;Dragons of Eden&#34;).If I were back in the art department last century, I&#39;m pretty sure we&#39;d be really excitedly discussing how these new tools will enable entirely new forms of expression. And sure, there&#39;d be the old guard saying it was awful, and &#39;not Art&#39;.This is a really interesting debate – I just wish it scratched deeper than the surface more often than it does, with a bit more historical context."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aside from the debates about &#34;artistic merit&#34; and the ethics of using AI trained on existing artists&#39; work, one of the key things is that this new technology allows anyone to flood a place with images.There are some scifi-themed subreddits that I visit that allow posting art, and at this point it feels like 50% of all submissions are Midjourney/Dall-E generated art. Fine, it looks ok, but there&#39;s such a low barrier to creating and posting these, it&#39;s beginning to drown out other valuable content. The article even speaks about this:&gt; In July, one AI furry porn generator was uploading one image every 40 seconds"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s important to keep in mind that these art communities represent one very narrow kind of art, one that is more focused on illustration and graphical style, and most often not the kind of art that major art institutions work with. In the past 5 years, AI-generated art has been accepted and incorporated in the contemporary art world, with major works produced by luminaries such as Pierre Huyghe (of Ideal), Trevor Paglen (Bloom), and Hito Steyerl (Power Plants). For these artists, the graphical potency of the generated images is usually only one factor of the work, which also centers on how the artists use the technology, its origins, history, and broader uses, and what it might imply.For this kind of artwork, the kind made by artists who feel threatened by AI, I’ve been thinking for a while that a computer could likely do it better. Intricate detail, repetition, sampling and recombination of popular styles, optimization for aesthetic popularity and mass appeal — these practices are all squarely in the domain of automation, data science, and marketing. We might call it the Netflix-ification of illustration art, but it’s quite different, because the tools for making are available to many. As an arts educator and artist, I welcome these new tools, as they allow easy experimentation for newcomers, but also as they reveal that art based primarily in deployment of technical skill and eye-popping graphics is missing something vital."</p>
