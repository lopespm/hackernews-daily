								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The other day I wanted to learn Svelte. Even though the tutorials on the Svelte homepage are great, I found the MDN Svelte tutorial to be better: it explains the conceptual differences wrt other frontend frameworks well, it explains in detail how to enable Typescript and migrate your projects, and it has a dedicated section that describes different deployment options.While of - of course - all of these infos can be found somewhere on the web as well, I very much appreciate such a well-written, holistic intro to a framework. I signed up for the MDN Plus 5 plan.P.S.: If someone from the MDN team is reading this, maybe include a &#34;sign up&#34; link directly in the blog article from Hermina."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems fair enough. It won&#39;t prevent anyone from accessing the actual content and it probably makes it easy to justify paying something to MDN to employers.In practice, if you are not paying:- Bookmarks can most certainly easily replace the Collections feature- you can clone the MDN repository for having the documents offline- notifications could be computed from the commit logand the subscription probably makes these features more convenient, at least for the notifications and the offline without actually removing rights from anybody.Seems clever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"MDN is literally the documentation for everything front-end web that is built-in to browsers and a little more. I hope all of the income from this goes back into MDN. If there&#39;s a project that deserves my eternal gratitude, MDN is up there as a web developer.Thank you to everyone who has ever worked on MDN or contributed at any capacity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really miss a consistent user experience. A core idea that I as a user can rely on to predict how a new app will work. I was in awe when I discovered as a kid that user interface were a research area. Things like Fitt&#39;s Law and so on. It was not just opinion.Today I get the feeling it&#39;s mostly just opinion. Either the designer&#39;s opinion or the wish to copy the look of something.Whenever I see a hamburger menu I silently think &#34;Here someone has given up&#34;.And there are a lot of behaviors that are not functioning well.Is something a button? Should I click it or double-click it? How about long-press on it? How can I know when there&#39;s no visual clues?Things like &#34;Hide cursor while typing&#34; in Windows. It has not worked properly for decades and today only work in some super old apps like Notepad.Another thing is type-ahead. I remember in classic MacOS, people pressed shortcuts and started to type the filename or whatever. It was all perfectly recorded and replayed. In modern Windows, press Win-key and start to type, oops, it missed the first keypresses, presented the completely wrong results and made a mess of your workflow.I feel confused and disrespected as a user every day and I&#39;ve been using WIMP graphical user interfaces since 1986. Sure, computers do more today, but there&#39;s less consideration of almost everything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree 100% with the author, the old GTK button was gorgeous, it will be missed.&gt; I have had to explain to people tons of times that the random word in the UI somewhere in an application is actually a button they can press to invoke an action.This is one of my biggest complaints with the super flat modern designs. Many widgets lost their skeuomorphic depth, which encoded a lot if visual information (the clickability, the current status), but in many cases nothing was added to supplant the loss of those visual cues, so now it is just a label (or a label in a white or grey box) and there is no way of knowing if it is clickable or its current status."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m going to take a risk here and say that I&#39;m a designer who generally likes flat design.I see a lot of hate here against flat design, and it makes sense. A lot of designers abuse it, making their UIs ambiguous. It&#39;s probably true that if flat design was never conceived, UIs would be less confusing on average.But it&#39;s clearly possible to do flat design well. iOS is mostly flat, but it&#39;s quite beautiful and user friendly. You usually know when something is a button because the context makes it obvious. If it&#39;s not obvious, it&#39;s probably not a critical feature, just a nicety for those who discover it. There will always be people who hate everything Apple designs, but I think they&#39;re usually channeling a hatred of something else, like monopolies or proprietary things.Moreover, I think flat design is not a fad but an inevitability. As a rule, designs become more abstract over time, because as users get more used to UIs, they need fewer clues. It used to be that UIs needed to be skeuomorphic to be familiar and recognizable, but now simple outlines can do the job.Why do we need to remove unneeded clues, you ask? To make room for more important things. If Instagram was littered with gradient buttons and blue underlined links, they&#39;d draw attention away from the real content, the pictures. If Figma had too much personality, it&#39;d influence users&#39; designs.You could argue that we&#39;ve gone too far too fast. I don&#39;t have a dog in that fight. But I would bet my big toe that we&#39;re not going to reverse time and end up with skeuomorphism again. Instead, we&#39;re going to take advantage of faster GPUs to visualize abstractions in ways we couldn&#39;t before. We&#39;re seeing that with blurred background effects becoming more common. Excited to see what&#39;s next."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Rant engaged. As a person who feels responsible for ensuring what I build is secure, the security space feels inscrutably defeating. Is there a dummies guide, MOOC, cert, or other instructional material to better get a handle on all these things?SSH keys make sense. But certificates? Is this OIDC, SAML, what? Is it unreasonable to request better and deeper &#34;how to do {new security thing}&#34; when PKI is a new acronym to someone? Where can I point my data science managers so they can understand the need and how to implement measures to have security on PII-laden dashboards? As so on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel that trying to make SSH keys short-lived is becoming more painful each year because there&#39;s an increase of tools that use SSH keys for purposes other than SSH logins. For example, age [1] encrypts files with SSH keys, agenix [2] does secrets management with it, Git can now sign commits with it [3], and even ssh-keygen can now sign arbitrary data [4]. All of these become useless the moment you start using short-lived keys.[1]: https://github.com/FiloSottile/age[2]: https://github.com/ryantm/agenix[3]: https://calebhearth.com/sign-git-with-ssh[4]: https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/ssh-keygen.1.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article was very illuminating. And, I wish it was written like this:  To really secure your SSH server, do these three things:
  1. Setup a trusted authority
  2. Use ssh certificates
  3. With ssh certs, you can easily add MFA for logins expire until you reauth.
  Now that we&#39;ve established this, here are the gory details.
  Lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum, lorem ipsum.


It&#39;s a great narrative, but I wish I knew the big payout in advance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think its important to recognise that quite a lot of modern web based companies are running their business on the 0 cents model. That is they take the marginal cost of a customer and push it down to zero and rely on scale to make a profit from it. They can&#39;t add anything to their business that would scale with the number of their customers that has any real cost, computing resources even are heavily optimised for let alone having an actual human to speak to.What this means is that as a 0 cents customer (even if you pay them) you are completely disposable, no customer matters to them at all. This culture comes along with a cold disdain for customers and a desire to run everything off algorithms and if some people get caught up in error they just don&#39;t care. As a customer its annoying and you can loose a lot of data, but for the companies its their business model. The only way as a customer to not be in that situation is to avoid the businesses based on this model. If they were somehow forced to provide human customer support they may very well be substantially less profitable or not viable as a business anymore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently had the experience of trying to do a banking operation that required an in-person visit.  For some reason this bank required me to do this operation at the branch that I originally opened the account, which is not where I live anymore, and it&#39;s very inconvenient for me to go there.So, while I was in another city of that country, I decided to try and handle that problem.  I went to a branch and asked them to do the operation, saying that there must be a way to do it without me having to travel hundreds of km.  The person absolutely refused to even try to help me.  &#34;No, there&#39;s no way to do it, you&#39;ll have to go to your branch office.&#34;  I begged, I got angry.  (This was after leaving this issue for a couple of years -- travel has not exactly been easy, so there are reasons I didn&#39;t manage to do it yet, and was getting desperate.)  All to no avail, the person just. could. not. help me.Fine, I left, very annoyed.  The next day, I went to a different branch, told the same story, and explained how extremely inconvenient the whole thing is.  I went in expecting failure.  To my surprise, the person responded kindly, said &#34;okay, I can send an inter-branch memo, I&#39;ll do the operation you pay this much, done and done.&#34;  I signed something, walked out smiling, and the next business day, received a confirmation email from my branch in the other city.Moral of the story: I completely agree with the premise here, but just keep in mind that even if you talk to a human, your millage may vary greatly depending on who you speak to and what side of the bed they got up on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree that companies have a responsibility to listen to and address customer complaints. The problem is that a small percentage of customers create the bulk of the customer support burden. With phone support this gets even more skewed. You can&#39;t have engineers do phone support or they won&#39;t be able to get any real work done with all the interruptions. You can have engineers investigate and address all complaints that arrive by email. I strongly believe email support that goes directly to the people most knowledgable to fix the underlying problem is the best approach.Companies that provide bad customer support just don&#39;t care. They&#39;ll provide phone support if they feel they have to, but they&#39;ll outsource it for cost reasons. Talking to people who are friendly but clueless is at least as frustrating for me as creating a ticket that doesn&#39;t go anywhere."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This does indeed seem to work for me, but the repeated emphasis on the patents and trademarks makes me suspicious. It looks like a company who cares much more about patent royalties than about their invention - whom I would never be willing to give my money to. Having seen the principle, I could write a browser extension in an hour. I suppose I&#39;ll have to wait 25 years (or whatever the French patent expiry length is), though.If you want to read the patent (in French), it&#39;s here: https://data.inpi.fr/brevets/FR3052587. I couldn&#39;t find the German patent (10 2017 112 916.2), but I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s the same substance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have some feedback regarding the testimonial from “Sangeeth”, whose Memoji shows a Sikh person. Did the user choose their Memoji? The two don’t go together well for reasons of odd cultural differences in the Roman/Latin transliteration of sounds in the south and the north of India. The -th- cluster represents the dental t, IPA /t/, but only in South India. In the North the same sound is represented by -t-. Therefore you might find a Sikh named Sangeet, or a non-Sikh named Sangeeth, but a Sikh named Sangeeth? I’ve never seen a Sikh name using the -th- cluster in my life. There are Sikhs who grow up in South India of course but their names use the North Indian transliteration rules.What I’m trying to say is: if you chose the Memoji with a turban to show an Indian person, it doesn’t match the -th in the name. As an Indian my first reaction was that the testimonial was fake, for this reason."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Bionic reading aims to encourage a more in-depth reading and understanding of written contentby reading faster? I mean the examples are pretty compelling and it did feel like I was reading faster, but at the same time their goals are at odds - faster reading doesn&#39;t necessarily mean more attentive reading, or being able to absorb more information.Still, interesting technique. I just wish they made their examples / comparisons actual text instead of images; surely they can just write a snippet of JS or some HTML to render the effect in the browser itself. Or would that be giving up their secret sauce?Also if any of the authors are here, please get rid of the &#34;small text in between big text&#34;, I&#39;m not sure if I need to read the one and then the other, or refocus my eyes on the big then the small text."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve had some Issues with KornShell. I wrote a quick unit Counting script, kind of a Dirty hack to try it out. &#34;Let&#39;s Get This Party Started,&#34; I thought as I hit enter on my keyboard, eager to see the units print on my screen. But it couldn&#39;t even count to &#34;4 U&#34;. Instead, it printed &#34;./count.sh[3]: syntax error: `(&#39; unexpected&#34; and just stopped Dead. I tried again, thinking It&#39;s Gonna Go Away. Nope, No Way. Am I Going Crazy? Somebody Somewhere has to know what&#39;s going wrong. Before long, I realized I had to Wake Up and face the truth that KornShell is very particular about whitespace. Those of you who only write in modern languages and environments, I Wish You Could Be Me for just a moment to realize how nice you have it today and how you don&#39;t have to put up with Trash that can&#39;t parse without whitespace."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember being 12 years old in 1996 looking for Korn websites on AltaVista and found that a solid half of the links being returned were ksh guides. Maybe that&#39;s how I turned into such a Unix geek."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had to go to Wikipedia to see if ksh was named after the band,¹ but it turns out that it was created by David Korn and not a metal fan.⸻1. Not completely inconceivably given that Python gets its name from Monty Python. I&#39;m thinking there are other similarly fandom-based namings of popular tech tools (the only other one that comes to mind is the occasional assertion that Knuth&#39;s choice of TeX was to honor his alma mater CalTech²).2. I created a short-lived California TeX Users Group in the late 80s/early 90s which we dubbed CTUG after being warned off naming it CalTeX (but being at Harvey Mudd College³ at the time, I was disinclined to name it that anyway).3. Which, of course, summons to mind one of my favorite pranks⁴ in the HMC-CalTech rivalry in which the freeway sign identifying the exit for CalTech and Pasadena Community College had parentheses added so it read “CalTech (Pasadena Community College)”4. Most people would consider the Fleming cannon theft to be the pinnacle of the pranks (when I had my pre-frosh campus visit, the cannon had just arrived on the Mudd campus), but I think the freeway sign gets points for being more creative."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Years ago I was putting out the garbage in the back alley behind our building where I lived on the 8th floor. A crow attacked me out of the blue.  Distracted by the attack, the back door slammed shut behind me.  Since my key was only good for the front door, I had to walk around the building.  That damn crow followed me the entire time, dive bombing my head, and screaming bloody murder at me.  It was a little spooky.When I finally got back inside and upstairs, I went and looked out the living room window, which looked out the same direction as the back alley.  The crow had flown back around and was at the 8th floor looking in the window, from the other side of the pigeon netting we had on our balcony.   On the inside of the pigeon netting, was another crow, desperately trying to figure out how it could escape.  Not really sure how it had got itself through the pigeon netting in the first place.I went out and sliced a hole through the netting and the trapped crow quickly joined its mate outside, who finally stopped screaming bloody murder.   To this day it still amazes me that the crow&#39;s mate, knew which apartment I lived in and spotted me downstairs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is only inspirationally relevant, but a few weeks ago, I saw a crow (or a raven, never quite sure) holding a stick, floating without moving, on top of Twin Peaks in SF, like it was waiting to give a wand to a wizard. When I got home, I wrote this weird little story about it: https://f52.charlieharrington.com/stories/a-great-unkindness..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Prot is one of those contributors who has made his contributions accessible in the form of videos, tutorials, blogs, and other documentation. As far as I know, he&#39;s not contributing to the Emacs internals and instead providing packages, he has given most of his code to be part of GNU. I came across his work on modus-themes and understood from his documentation that he&#39;s done a lot of research in making it compliant to accessibility standards of WCAG AAA. This theme is going to be bundled with the next stable release of Emacs 28 when it comes.One can truly see his journey in contributing to free software, including philosophy, documented in his videos. Congratulations Prot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prot videos are the best. He does a wonderful job of presenting a topic, covering the information thoroughly, and stays on topic. All without acting like a typical youtuber. He doesn&#39;t ask for likes or subscribes, doesn&#39;t have ads, doesn&#39;t have chat, he isn&#39;t a slave to patronage, and best of all he doesn&#39;t use that hyping style that many youtubers use today.I wish more technical youtubers would go back to presenting like Prot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prot is one of the most well spoken, humble, deliberate and wholesome people I&#39;ve ever come across.  Absolutely crazy to think that he came to Emacs and Lisp without any technical background and just started contributing.Cheers to you, Prot!"</p>
