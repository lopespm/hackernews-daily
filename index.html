								<p class="story__comment_others">"I loved to throw around &#34;What&#39;s next? Private prisons??&#34; when speaking about some crazy privatization ideas. That, until I learned it&#39;s an actual thing in US. Who would have guessed. I think I was 32 at that time"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Open drug scenes[0] are behind the push to end open drug scenes.9% of prisons are private, which is 9% too many, but it&#39;s the citizens who have to endure open drug scenes who are behind the push to end them.[0]: https://www.karger.com/Article/Pdf/259053This problem is described, wrongly, as homelessness, by both advocates for ending open drug scenes, and by activists who view themselves as working on behalf of the unhoused.That&#39;s not the effect of their activism. The effect of their advocacy is to increase misery. Open drug scenes make the city unsafe. Open drug scenes draw the temporarily homeless into a shadow market of addictions and prostitution.Open drug scenes are bad for everyone who has to be near them, but they are particularly destructive to the mentally ill addicts who constitute them.I&#39;m sure private prisons would love to turn all of us into literal slaves, but if we reduced the number of them down to the correct 0%, urban residents would still be demanding the end of open drug scenes.They are right to do so. Supporting open drug scenes is supporting misery, harm, assault, theft, overdose, rape.Don&#39;t support open drug scenes. Make sure your donations to help the unhoused don&#39;t support open drug scenes (this is difficult).Also, let&#39;s end private prisons. It was never a good idea and it won&#39;t get better with time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2003 I had my web server in my college apartment bedroom.  This is back when AOL Instant Messenger was popular.I had a URL on my website called moo.html that wasn&#39;t indexed.  My friends had it bookmarked, and when they visited it they got a picture of a cow, but it played a cow mooing in my bedroom.  It was a nudge to come online and be social.The End."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised no-one has mentioned Unraid here yet (https://unraid.net).You install it to a USB, put the USB into whatever you want as a server, and boot it up from the USB. The OS and config gets loaded into a ram drive. You now have a linux server ready to go, with access to thousands of apps and add-ons (which are basically just open source things you already know on various docker containers).So you can install postgres, redis, whatever, and you are off to the races if you want to host your own side projects. Or you can install Tailscale, plex, and whatever OSS dropbox / media server clones to have access to your media anywhere.The magic is that it all &#39;just works&#39; and has a nice web GUI to install and configure things, and you don&#39;t even need to know that Docker is handling all the things running under the hood if you don&#39;t want to. The only tricky bit can be mounting volumes from the various containers to get things working together, for which there are many many guides and youtube videos. You can always bring your own docker compose config if you you want to keep it in code.The uptime for one of my servers was up to well over half a year, and only storm &amp; power outage brought the server down...now I&#39;ve got it on a UPS with automated safe shutoff (again configured in the web GUI, took about 5-10 mins) if power drops again.Unraid just runs and is rock solid and stays out of your way for whatever things you want to run."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Speaking as someone who hosts multiple websites, email, etc. in the corner of a room&gt; [it should] be reliable if I kick a cable out of the wallRight, if you want it to be reliable but also be able to cut its cables, then you will need a secondary host outside the home.&gt; or in the unlikely event that I get a bunch of traffic.Are you serving media (music or video of more than a few seconds)? If not: DSL or mobile data (if your data cap allows) is fine for HN front page. Judging by the current page weighing 100KB, you can have 10 visitors every second at 1 MiB/s upload. (HN reaches that rate only in spikes, even at a top three position.)&gt; I’d also like it to be quick!It&#39;s currently not quick at DigitalOcean (2 seconds for TLS setup, 12 seconds for HTML, 8 seconds for JavaScript, etc... 27 seconds total). It can only get better!I can recommend something beefier than a raspberry pi, though, or at least than than the pi 1-3 speeds that I&#39;m used to. I personally use an old laptop which is plenty fast for, well, anything you&#39;d also ask of a daily driver, except it now doesn&#39;t need to render a GUI which speeds things up a lot. They can peak up to 100W depending on the model, but are usually very low power when nothing is being asked of them.&gt; Oh, and I don’t want to have my home network hacked.Then install unattended-upgrades, put admin panels (phpmyadmin, wp-admin) behind basic authentication, don&#39;t host things you don&#39;t trust (random code written by &#39;someone on the internet&#39; that has never been tested by anyone), put it in a VLAN if you want to be extra cautious, and you&#39;ll be fine. It never hurts to keep your phone and other systems on the LAN up-to-date anyhow so they should be secure as well, even if someone does get in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m baffled by the reaction here. I agree that productive VR work is still not ready for prime time, but most of you haven&#39;t tried any of this (let alone the new hardware) and you&#39;re already dismissing even the possibility of it becoming good in the future. Reminds me of the Dropbox thread. You know which one.Also what I really don&#39;t understand is how anyone can have anything against them spending $$$ on R&amp;D? Worst case scenario: their whole productivity angle doesn&#39;t work out, they lose billions upon billions in the coming decade and eventually scrap the whole thing. Then they&#39;ve still invented a lot of super interesting tech along the way. High resolution displays, low latency rendering pipelines, novel human interface technologies, high fidelity hand tracking, lightweight and sharp lenses, the list goes on and on. There&#39;s lots of applications for each of those things and almost nobody else is willing to spend this much cash for such an uncertain roi.
I, for one, am super excited about what the future iterations of this will look like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really can’t understand why there’s so much time and resources being put into re-inventing virtual meetings.This is supposed to capture subtle facial expressions. I’m sure every generation will capture more subtleties and have increasingly realistic avatars.  So why not just see real faces then?I always see mentions of virtual sticky notes on a whiteboard.  That sounds awful.  Do you need to squint to view them from your virtual seat at the table?  Do you need to walk your avatar to the board and avoid bumping into others who might be posting their own?  We don’t have those issues today with sites like Miro. If the metaverse will somehow avoid these annoyances then how would it be any different from the non-metaverse experience?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been a very early adopter of this tech (Kickstarter backer of Oculus), get zero motion sickness and have a great time working in VR through a virtual desktop. This looks like a few floating screens in front of my face, in a space station and I’m typing on a real Bluetooth keyboard. I think this is the only way companies will be able to keep remote-friendly polices and stay competitive with product. YMMV because I am biased to be for this, but, the way they’ve tuned this Pro model looks like it’s exactly for my use-case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The same problem frequently bites me in Python too:    functions = []

    for i in range(10):
        functions.append(lambda: print(f&#39;Hello {i}&#39;))
    
    for fn in functions:
        fn()

    # Hello 9

    # Hello 9
    # Hello 9
    # Hello 9
    # Hello 9
    # Hello 9
    # Hello 9

I find it one of Python&#39;s biggest warts because it&#39;s silent, hard to troubleshoot (especially the first time!), and like in Go the most straightforward fix looks like a mistake (i=i):    for i in range(10):
        functions.append(lambda i=i: print(f&#39;Hello {i}&#39;))

I guess this is a lesson in designing language semantics that match people&#39;s intuitions, and learning from previous languages&#39; mistakes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an experienced Go programmer and still accidentally do this every so often. It certainly bit me and my team several times when we were newish to Go.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This sounds like if you spliced together tape of Rogan and Jobs with scotch tape. An interesting concept but I never felt like I was listening to a conversation between two people. Jobs sounds weirdly far away, he also was never a &#34;fast talker&#34;. Listen to his interview at MIT where he takes questions. He always stopped for long pauses, stares off into space for a minute. He didn&#39;t rush into responses and tended to nail timing really well.Rogan sounds more believable but I suspect you&#39;d get the same results sitting down at Audacity and cutting together an MP3. You just have better quality samples of him talking to people in a podcast setting.It&#39;s an interesting demo but I&#39;m not sure why I would want this to exist. It seems like technology which you could only abuse, either through the generation of podcast spam or through the production of fake audio. Podcasts are legion and are already cheap to make and based on open standards."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is mindblowing. Like this could be real, and I&#39;m learning stuff from it: There&#39;s an Indian epic that&#39;s 10 times as long as ...There&#39;s some audio distortion (sounds like clips cut together, little &#34;notches&#34; in the soundscape) but apart from that, and some weirdness in sensing &#34;the spatial location&#34; where this audio was recorded...the concepts and the dialog are amazing.Some parts are weird...but people can be weird. It you tidied this up, and added the right sounds affects and audio processing to this, without the cue that this is AI generated...holy fuck, I think people would believe it. Particularly if you cut it together as a &#34;highlights reel&#34;. Jobs does sound a bit off tho, a bit thin...there should be enough data on him to do a sparse reconstruction of his voice to a level of accuracy beyond human discernment tho.The thing this got wrong about Job&#39;s voice cadence, tho is: Jobs speaks a lot more slowly and deliberately, and with a lot more pauses, than here. I suspect the cadence / timing is not so emphatically modelled by this AI.I think also they&#39;re missing some emotional trajectory coherence in both their voices. Like the emotional register of the voice does not sound or transition as naturally, and is less diverse.Incredible PoC. AI folks are the new dark wizards. WTF can they not do? That list is shorter"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi everyone, cofounder of play.ht (the startup behind this podcast) here. let me know if you have any questions.To give more context, the podcast was totally AI generated, the content itself was generated from a finetuned GPT3 on SteveJobs&#39; biography, the voices were cloned from few hours of both Joe and Steve voices, even though it was tough to get good content for Steve Jobs. And the podcast artwork was generated by SD.We will be releasing more episodes soon which will be even more mind-blowing!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reddit discussion for the original mod-replacement incident: https://old.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/comments/y12jo3/sta...The entire subreddit is in a process of community migration now: https://old.reddit.com/r/StableDiffusion/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unbelievable behavior from SD. The subreddit is currently an unmoderated mess, illustrating they have no clue how to run the community.I am unsurprised at Discord&#39;s behavior, handing over a server like that. They have essentially been hostile when not silent to us at WSB with our 600K user server.Reddit has an opportunity to do better here. Hand back control of r/StableDiffusion back to OP.Steve Huffman alluded to the disaster that is sub transitions in the recent Mod Summit. If someone at Reddit is reading this, this is your opportunity to do better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Discord&#39;s use of the word server is misleading, and it leads people to think they own something when they don&#39;t. Discord owns it and can pull the rug out from under you at any time, regardless of how much hard work you put into building a community, and that hurts.I understand that &#34;server&#34; is an abstract term and just means &#34;something which provides a service&#34;, but most other uses of the word relate to something owned by the person operating it. E.g., if I run a Matrix server instance, it&#39;s mine to administer, manage, destroy, etc. If I start a Discord &#34;server&#34; it&#39;s a glorified chat room or set of chat rooms owned and maintained by the company.Language is powerful and helps shape our world, and by redefining &#34;server&#34; to mean a segmented part of someone else&#39;s website, it&#39;s another nail in the coffin for the concept of real ownership."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to put away a liter of vodka a night. I kept it up for years, accumulating a solid decade of heavy drinking. I was miserable. It was souring my relationship. The stress from work, personal life, and declining mental state of course made me feel even more compelled to drink. I was becoming a shell of my former self, and my dreams were becoming strictly that.I had a confluence of events that changed my course:1. I attended a tech conference where someone I personally knew who had went through rehab was hosting and speaking, and he was filled with a vivacity I hadn’t seen from him before.2. My spouse gave me an ultimatum to quit or he’d be out the door. It wasn’t the first time he had said this, but I had a feeling it was probably going to be the last.3. My progression in life was stalling. I couldn’t keep up commitments anymore, and I was starting to feel like I had already passed my peak.So I quit. Cold Turkey. It was a dangerous, stupid thing to do, but I knew if I tried to taper off, I’d just slide back. The withdrawals were nightmarish, and I was lucky I didn’t die from it. But I pulled through, and then started to do some heavy soul searching for why I ever picked up the bottle — what was I escaping from? And I found those answers, and got to work — A real kind of personal work that most people will never have to put into themselves.Since then, I have been a cofounder, jumped multiple levels in my career, and have been working towards several academic publications, on top of drastically improving my personal life. It’s been nearly five years since I put down the bottle. And every day I choose to never pick it up again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was drinking heavily and knew that it would be the quickest and most effective hack towards being a better father and husband. I first stepped into an AA meeting and as the opportunity to speak was going around the room I started seeing many similarities between the people sharing their stories and myself. I thought to myself &#39;If I were perhaps an alcoholic, what could I share about it and how it may hurt me and those that love me?&#39; When the opportunity for me to share came up, I said &#39;screw it!&#39; to myself and spilled the beans. &#34;I am an alcoholic...&#34;The meetings made me feel good at first as I kept telling myself that my stories could potentially help someone else. I did not end up sticking with the AA program but the meetings really launched me into the right direction and finding my own path. I do drink NA beer and as many others in the comments have pointed out, there is a lot offered in that arena as of lately.I am a very social person and navigating that lifestyle for the first time without alcoholic beverages was the biggest challenge for me. But I learned to like the challenge and found that sparked a lot of conversations with friends that were interested in quitting or dialing it back. It also identified and strengthened a lot of friendships where people normally wouldn&#39;t drink while doing whatever it was we are doing, but they did because I was &#39;the drinker.&#39;Next week marks my first year of sobriety, so I am certainly no expert, but feel free to reach out if you ever need to hash some things out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t had a drink in 27 days, which is the longest I&#39;ve gone in a while. Left to my own devices, I tend to settle into a pattern of 2-4 drinks per night, 5-6 nights a week (I actually tracked this for a while with a spreadsheet).It&#39;s not like, ruin my life, wake up in a gutter type situation, but it leads to just feeling somewhat crappy all the time, and I didn&#39;t like it, so I wanted to stop.Some things that helped / are helping:I have an app Habit Tracker. It&#39;s a pretty simple app with a list of habits you want do do, you can set on some schedule. When you do them, you tick them off and it keeps track of how many times, so you build up a streak. I made a &#34;don&#39;t drink&#34; habit, and check it off in the morning if I didn&#39;t drink the day before. It also shows a notification bubble on the app if you don&#39;t check it off and I hate that. It&#39;s like this little negative reinforcement that I have to live with that bubble all day if I drank the day before. It&#39;s silly, but it helped.Reading the book This Naked Mind and listening to The Huberman Lab podcast episode about alcohol (#86) also helped. Alcohol messes up your body in a lot of ways, even at what&#39;s considered &#34;moderate&#34; or &#34;normal&#34; levels of drinking./r/stopdrinking on RedditAlcohol is an addictive drug and when you stop after using it regularly, you&#39;re going to feel cravings. It&#39;s not a moral failing, it&#39;s physiology. They do get less intense and less frequent after the first two weeks or so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t know much about the whole space, but from what I&#39;ve read so far about Wayland, it starts to feel a lot like yet another &#34;perpetual next-gen&#34; tech, such as IPv6, fuel cells, the Semantic Web or XHTML2 (before that one was officially declared dead at least).Like, according to the linked article, the standard is out there since 2008 - so the adoption period is already 14 years! And people are still haggling about basic stuff like color management, mouse cursors and window decorations?What exactly is the envisioned timeframe for Wayland to replace X11 as the dominant windowing system?If the standard has been promoted as the obvious next step for linux desktop environments for 14 years but still hasn&#39;t actually caught on, are we sure it really is the right direction to go?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how they handle color management, since apparently Wayland still doesn&#39;t support it (and the Wayland devs are clueless about it).See the discussion here: https://discuss.pixls.us/t/wayland-color-management/10804"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been great to see apps slowly getting more native Wayland support.I&#39;m looking forward to Java/Swing hopefully gaining support too via Project Wakefield."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work at a different FAANG and it seems like more and more the only news that we get from corporate is related to DEI. Also a lot of hiring details are now hidden from ICs. It used to be that you would be apart of the interview panel as an interviewer and then you would get together with your team afterwards and everyone on the team would vote yes/no and that would pretty much be it. Now it’s made by a manager elsewhere and you have no idea why the decision was made.I do worry that my kids won’t be diverse enough to be able to get into a decent school or get a good job like I was able to when they’re older.We used to argue for equality, a level playing field, for all. Now we’ve had the rug swapped from underneath us.It’s no longer about equality of opportunity, it’s about equality of outcome. To quote Kamala Harris’ recent remarks “to make sure everyone ends up in the same place”, i.e. “equity”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I shut my mouth at work and go along with this stuff because I have no choice. I have a family to take care of. I&#39;ve accepted this. But man, why do they always throw in the line about striving to make the workplace a &#34;diverse and inclusive culture where everyone can bring their full and authentic self&#34;? Everyone knows that&#39;s a goddamn lie. I almost want to cry when I read that - it makes me so angry. I haven&#39;t been anything like myself in the workplace for over a decade now and I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll never be again. I live a lie when I&#39;m here and so do many, many others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You might imagine this policy doesn’t bias the hiring process, since managers are still free to choose who to hire after interviewing the diverse candidates. But because of the number of applicants, most are rejected based on their resumes. Imagine diversity candidates are 1% of the applicants but 15% of those interviewed. This gives those candidates opportunities to do well in interviews that their peers with similar resumes do not get.So minority candidates are given an advantage in getting their foot in the door, but still have to prove themselves qualified for the job by doing well in interviews.On average, those candidates would have started with a disadvantage in getting their foot in the door for several reasons – including outright discrimination, and the cumulative effect of past discrimination, but also softer factors such as being less likely to have helpful personal connections.  This applies not just to the Microsoft job at issue, but to the previous jobs that would have populated their resumes (and for younger candidates, even schools).Compensating for that sounds like a good policy to me.Now, the post also suggests there is pressure to actually hire or promote less-qualified candidates, which might be a problem, but in that area the post is more vague and speculative."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OkCupid was bought by Match Group (who run almost all online dating sites, including Match, eHarmony, and Tinder) in 2011 and took down this post not long after.EDIT: the purchase was Feb 2011 [1] and the post was removed sometime between Jan 2011 [2] and Mar 2011 [3].  The rest of the blog was still up at the time [4].[1] https://www.npr.org/2011/02/03/133456140/The-Last-Word-In-Bu...[2] https://web.archive.org/web/20110113034228/http://blog.okcup... up[3] https://web.archive.org/web/20110301161329/http://blog.okcup... down[4] https://web.archive.org/web/20110301161329/http://blog.okcup... different post up"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related personal anecdote:I am experimenting with Tinder subscription at the moment, and it feels incredibly exploitative. When you make a profile, matches are frequent and you can tell that you show up for people. However it gradually falls down with time, and the only predictable and obvious way to get back up is to pay for Boosts and/or Priority Likes.Right now my 6-month old profile gets ZERO likes outside of the time it&#39;s Boosted ($3 a pop or something). I get plenty once I&#39;m boosted, so the profile attractiveness doesn&#39;t seem to be a factor.It feels like the app&#39;s algorithms are rigged to gradually push you towards paid subscription options. There must be a huge invisible market of Tinder whales given how exploitative it is, gambling addiction, loneliness, and desperation for dates are correlated traits and I would absolutely bet on Tinder exploiting this heavily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem really happens when you do algorithmic price setting, which incentivizes you as the developer to get people addicted to the experience of swiping, regardless of whether or not the swiping has the desired outcome for the end user. A user base with just the right levels of dopamine from interactions and loneliness will probably end up buying one of the weekly promotional deals.That&#39;s why when you first start on any dating service, you&#39;re (typically) inundated with activity, so that you can always chase that high, and when you can&#39;t get it, you try to pay for it.Online dating is a tough problem to solve, tougher still when profit incentives misalign with user success incentives! I&#39;m not even sure what an equitable but also successful dating service would look like, because there&#39;s this fundamental mismatch in values."</p>
