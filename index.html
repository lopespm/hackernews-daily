								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People thinking this is an absurd amount of money are sleeping on how 1Password is quietly positioning itself to become the ground truth storage solution for corporate secret management, across devops and non-technical groups alike.Given Hashicorp&#39;s market cap of 11B, and 1Password&#39;s narrative on how to become even more central to corporate use cases by being the storage layer for Vault deployments, it&#39;s a very reasonable leap for them to make!https://1password.com/secrets/https://1password.com/secrets/integrations/https://1password.com/enterprise-password-manager/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really wish they weren&#39;t doing away with 1password classic and the native mac app. I like the fact I bought a license, that I can store the data on dropbox or icloud, and it works just fine.Yes, this is old news and sour grapes on my part. I just don&#39;t yet feel like migrating to bitwarden.I&#39;ve been using 1password for 12 years since I saw it on a tutorial on peepcode.com. I actually taught my mother how to use it, she&#39;s been using it for 9 years, and last weekend she was upgrading all her passwords to use 2fa with the QR code capturing facility.We had to go find the 1password classic browser extension (something stopped working, needed to reinstall it) and that took a bit of doing. 1password is not making it easy to find anymore, and when she contacted customer support (before talking to me), their response was to upgrade to a paid account and store your passwords on a server.Ugh.Honestly, now that they&#39;ve raised this much cash, would it really be that big of an inconvenience or lift for them to give mac users a native app instead of the electron one and keep allowing legacy users like me to use 1password with our existing licenses and dropbox?I think they&#39;d be able to hire some additional developers and product/project people to make it happen. Not continuing to work on the classic project just feels like a kick in the shins.Now, I&#39;m building out my kubernetes cluster at home, and bitwarden is something I&#39;m going to experiment with as a backup, but 1password 7 works fine and I just don&#39;t want to migrate to a paid account.C&#39;mon 1password, make your legacy customers happy!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of announcement tends to ring all kinds of alarm bells for me.  What kinds of changes should we expect to make those huge investments worthwhile for the investors?My 1Password installation is grandfathered from a time when it was just a standalone app, without subscription.  Will it just stop working one day to bully me into subscribing?  Can you even start using 1Password these days without buying a subscription?  I&#39;ll have to start looking for alternatives today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once almost completely automated my job, and didn&#39;t hide it.  The job was to load data files into the backend system. The problem was there there were almost as many formats (~80) as there were partners sending data (~120), not just in structure but in content (deltas, full replace, etc.).  This job was burning people out every 6 months, and I was the hapless next victim who was just looking to break into a tech position.I started scripting and automating parts of it, which eventually got pieced together to be completely hands off unless a new partner came on board or there was some new error.  Since some of these steps used keyboard macros on VT100 terminals, I couldn&#39;t even use my computer while it was running, so I requested another, with the explicit intent that I could use it to surf the web while my main computer was doing it&#39;s thing.  Data load lag times went from weeks, to days, to hours.When it came time for performance review, I was told I had &#34;completely redefined the position&#34;.  I would therefore be assessed against the new definition, and was therefore deemed average, and got a 3% cost of living raise (pro-rated to 2% since I&#39;d only been there 8 months) with no merit increase.  A few weeks later, my manager was somehow surprised to the point of tears that I had a new job elsewhere.A few months later, I got a call from my ex-manager, asking if I had any backups of the programs I wrote (this was long before the days of offsite source control).  I said no, I had no need for them and that would probably be illegal.  My replacement had somehow lost everything, and was now trying to keep up the old burnout way and they were weeks behind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Early in my career I was the only engineer in a company with a dedicated office building full of people selling my work to Fortune 500 companies as that of a large team. Slept under my desk a lot as the 80 hour weeks made me choose between commuting and sleeping.It got worse when they hired someone to manage me that demanded I use Basecamp to log every action I take in my day .I wrote a script to fill it out with technical sounding nonsense. After a few weeks the manager came to compliment me on hearing his demands out and being so detailed in my reporting without productivity going down as I suggested in my early reservations.I explained that I automated it. He was fascinated and asked how it knows what I am doing, smelling a startup opportunity. I explained that it just makes stuff up to appease non technical managers.&#34;Did you just do this as an elaborate way to give me the middle finger?&#34;&#34;Pretty much.&#34;He never tried to manage me again, realizing I had automated his job reporting to his managers too.Said script for fun: https://gist.githubusercontent.com/lrvick/5ecabfc4bb5a2f5578..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This story is a pretty accurate fable for the pointlessness of the modern economy and its inability to provide real value to anyone. Man spends all day playing video games, because he automated his largely superfluous job at a law firm which itself likely only exists to deal with bureaucratic or unnecessary cases (assuming this is true, as they have a single absent IT person who handles their entire infrastructure.)On top of all that, this story itself is probably made up, created to get attention from other people in pointless jobs. It’s a meta-exercise in pointlessness."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not quite there yet, but I&#39;m up to $300/mo iteratively building an uptime checker: https://onlineornot.com/I started with literally just a Lambda function that checks if static websites were still online, added an email alert if it&#39;s offline, wrapped authentication around it, integrated Stripe, and shipped it.Eventually, I added Slack/Discord/SMS alerts, team invites, support for checking APIs for both uptime and correctness, support for checking JavaScript apps, and more.My trick for launching into 200 competitors providing the &#34;same&#34; service and still getting customers?- I work two hours a day, every weekday on OnlineOrNot, and no other side projects. I&#39;ve had this streak going for about nine months now.- I focus particularly on features that solve my customer&#39;s pain (and I ask my customers what that pain is)- I&#39;m ruthlessly iterative. If I can&#39;t get a feature done in two hours, I figure out how to cut scope down to a two hour block, and ship that. Then iterate on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hmm… Is there a good way to export all the email across all the accounts and move it to another service?I have been using this since it was “gmail for your domain” and have a number of old addresses I’d like to keep but am unwilling to pay $6 a month for, not to mention many friends having long neglected addresses I’m sure they’d like to keep."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m definitely getting screwed over by this. I&#39;ve hosted close friend&#39;s and family&#39;s email for a decade now on an old G Apps instance. We only ever used it for email on a custom domain. It was most useful because I could reset passwords for them if they forgot it. Now I&#39;m going to have to figure out what to do.Microsoft&#39;s Family offering is way better (not saying much considering Google doesn&#39;t have one). Right now I&#39;m really considering moving over to them. But I have no idea what the migration of a decade of email across 5 inboxes will look like; not to mention Calendar and contacts. I used this as my primary email on at least 7 android phones (the original Pixel up through the Pixel 6 I preordered). The loss of Youtube purchases; android play purchases, etc. is going to hurt. I&#39;m sad it isn&#39;t illegal to turn a free account into a paid one when it means losing purchased content like this.I&#39;m not 100% sure what to do, I don&#39;t have dozens of hours to walk everyone through a migration; and Google provides absolutely no migration tools to help with this. This is the last time I&#39;ll be burned by Google though. I used to be a huge fan; but at this point I&#39;m done. I&#39;m really looking forward to cutting them out completely. As an added bonus; I no longer have to worry about them deciding to ban my account one day and lose everything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OK, this is annoying but it looks like there&#39;s a combination of features that allows me to continue using my domain as an alias for my @gmail.com account, including being able to send mail using the alias:1. Email forwarding: https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3251241?authuser=1...2. Send as alias: https://support.google.com/domains/answer/9437157?authuser=1I think this will actually end up being a better set up for my usage than GAFYD was."</p>

Plus a ton of wonderful things.There are two minor points I am missing:- the ability to control someone&#39;s passwords. Typical usage: the 24/7/365 support for my parents, where I would like to be able to access their passwords (they also would like that, obviously). There would be a simple solution: the ability to force someone to file entries only in an organization. But it is not possible (and new entries will go to the personal vault by default).- the ability to discard the Android pop-up, sometimes it completely blocks the ability to manually fill in something. An &#34;escape&#34; kind of gesture."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related talk by Dan Liebgold from Naughty Dog, at RacketCon 2013:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSmqbnhHp1c&amp;t=55sStarting at around 10m into the talk, Liebgold says their DC language for TLOU (to get what they most needed from a DSL even if using C++ instead of GOAL) was implemented in Racket.For anyone not familiar with TLOU, it was a critically-acclaimed game, and my personal all-time favorite game for storytelling that somehow grabbed me.  (I dislike all zombie franchises, but at a key point towards the end of the nonlinear narrative and playing in the game, I was surprised how much I really wanted to protect the kid.  Which I&#39;ll partly attribute to a Lispy DSL that helped them execute immersive storytelling in a zombie stealth shooter.)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_of_Us#Critical_respon...This is one of the Racket success stories.  They seem to happen because someone already knows they want a Lisp, they end up picking Racket without needing anyone else&#39;s permission, and the people using it are capable of designing and building whatever missing pieces they need."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GOAL / games written in Lisp have been a lifelong obsession. I used to search for hours for any scrap of information about the language. I would have traded a lot for this repo when I was 19.Thank you to the authors for fulfilling a teenage dream. Please consider doing Last Of Us next —- I once downloaded it and tore it apart for any signs of lisp, but it was all compiled bytecode. That’s where I gave up, but it looks like you took it one millennium further by reverse engineering the bytecode from Jak and Dexter to make your own port that compiles to the same bytecode. If you have infinite time, you could theoretically do this for last of us too, and also last of us 2."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Abuse was mostly written in Lisp. 2d side scrolling action game from the 90s that was unusual in being commercial with a brick and mortar release but also supporting Linux. It uses keyboard for direction mouse for aiming at the same time, which was also kind of unique at the time. The code is open source, complete with modernization, but you have to dig around for it nowdays.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abuse_(video_game)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It’s hard to accept the possibility that Judy may have completely forgotten about me, but a lifetime of living with disability has shown me how delicate human bodies and minds can be, how little it can take to dramatically, traumatically alter—or end—lives. Two rogue bones in my neck. Plaque on my beloved’s brain. Great love stories begin with such heady promise and end with such sadness and grief—but, at least in my case, also with memories of immense joy throughout a muscular marriage of two strong, supportive partners with challenges aplenty.So poignantly expressed. I am usually skeptical of &#39;true love&#39;, but these kind of stories remind me I could be so utterly wrong. It is rare to find people as committed to each other as Judy &amp; Steve."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those of you who are younger and perhaps haven&#39;t experienced it, forget the movie version of true love.  This story is a much better example - it&#39;s imperfect, illogical, sometimes downright gritty and yet it persists (with bouquets of flowers spread throughout)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dementia is in the future for many of us. If not you then your parents or children, or friends, colleagues, whatever. You&#39;ll see someone with it, one day, and it&#39;s truly horrible.Donate to your nation&#39;s dementia or Alzheimer&#39;s research foundations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve also built a simple and small (99sqm) PassivHaus in Romania, 5 years ago. Everybody, and I mean everybody from family to friends called me nuts, but I&#39;ve got my payback this winter when the energy prices went trough the roof and I&#39;m just slightly affected.The house is elevated from the ground on 12 concrete columns so that I can insulate under the foundation beams using glass foam, insulation on walls is 30 cm of EPS graphite, underfloor 45 cm EPS and on the roof, 50 cm and the orientation is full on south. For heating it consumes about 1500-2000 kWh per year (December, January, February and a maybe a small part of March)What is the big difference between houses built in North America and Europe is that the European houses are built using concrete and masonry which give them a lot of thermal mass which is crucial to this kind of builds.Have a look here [0], this is the first PassivHaus in my area and is nicely documented.
The cost of building a PassivHaus in my country typically goes about 20-25% more than a traditional one.[0]: http://www.sdac.ro/site/archives/category/passivehouse"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While this is at the extreme end of the spectrum, there is a much easier way to save lots of energy: just build modern well-insulated homes.I lived in California and I was appalled at the monstrous energy waste: houses are generally made pretty much from cardboard. You need to cool them in summertime and heat them in wintertime, and the energy expenditure is enormous.I now live in Poland and have recently built small homes that are similar in structure to the ones in CA: wooden frame, drywall inside. But the ones here have walls that are 25cm thick because of insulation (mineral wool) and use advanced modern membranes as well. Together, these things do wonders, and maintaining warmth in wintertime using a heat pump (AC) is easy and doesn&#39;t cost an arm and a leg.In other words, you can get 80% of the benefits with 20% of the effort — just design thicker walls with insulation and use modern materials."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People fail to appreciate how much leveraged financing affects the design of houses. If you pay 100% for a house and you decide to build something only you appreciate using 10% of your budget, you will lose 10% of your investment when selling the house. If you put down 20% and have the bank finance 80%, then the same decision will wipe out 50% of your investment. This means for financed houses, &#34;resale value&#34; becomes the preeminent decision affecting the design of a house.In Economics, this is known as a &#34;Keynesian Beauty Contest&#34; [1] where your job is to predict what everyone else predicts will be the most popular option and Keynesian Beauty Contests can get weird.eg: It&#39;s quite possible that you might personally hate granite countertops but still feel the need to put a granite countertop in your home because you believe it will help the resale value of your home. It&#39;s quite possible for everyone in a community to all hate granite countertops but for everyone to still put granite countertops in their home because they believe everyone else loves granite countertops. It&#39;s quite possible for everyone in a community to hate granite countertops and to know that everyone else hates granite countertops and still make the economically rational decision to put a granite countertop in their house to help with the resale value.A lot of &#34;economically irrational&#34; housing decisions are driven by this core transformation via Mortgage Backed Securities of a house from a consumption based purchase of a place to enjoy living into an investment asset that dominates most people&#39;s finances.It&#39;s only in houses built for the independently wealthy that don&#39;t really care about the future resale value of their houses that a lot of the good building science expertise still lies. That&#39;s why, paradoxically, in countries much poorer than the US/UK/Aus/NZ, you see much better building quality because their finance systems are also less developed.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian_beauty_contest"</p>
