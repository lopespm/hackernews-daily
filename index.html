								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I&#39;m understanding this correctly this offloads the copyright issue by making it the users responsibility to upload a rom?No one really talks about it but the first iPod had the same approach to letting people play their thousands of mp3 files (which I imagine 99% of were obtained illegally). Apple was eventually able to create a legal marketplace for mp3s but early days it was all napster/limewire/kazaa/etcObviously Playstation/Nintendo roms are not as prevalent but its an interesting thought?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found their NES version[0] just the other day, tried it with a friend, and there was a consistent 0.5-1s delay with button inputs. We both tried hosting, but had same issue and couldn&#39;t play. I have to imagine that PS1 emulation would be worse?But as far as UX, it was incredibly easy get us both into a 2 player game, complete with chat, voice, and video feeds. Their buttons are mapped to keyboard inputs, so Windows users can get a gamepad working with a program like JoyToKey[1].[0] https://nes.party/[1] https://joytokey.net/en/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I switched to a 4-day working week a few years back, taking a 20% pay cut in the process - and I haven&#39;t looked back!There has been no drop in productivity - I guess I procrastinate less, and am more focused on doing things that need done.I have an extra day for family and side projects - 1 day might not sound like much, but having that extra day off feels like my work/life balance is so much better!If anyone else has the opportunity, and can afford the pay cut of course, I highly recommend it.P.S. there was no way to negotiate less than a 20% cut; I work for a megacorp that has rigid rules and doesn&#39;t give half a crusty shit about individuals.Edit: I should have also mentioned that I&#39;m in the UK, where under EU law, employers have to consider reasonable requests for flexible working. I should have also mentioned that I work 7.5h per day, and the only time I work overtime is when I&#39;m travelling to a customer site (which itself is rare, obviously not happening at all now!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even though we have many luxuries, modern life does require a lot of admin. Most of which needs be be conducted during business hours. I recently took a two week vacation and spent half of it catching up on BS life admin that I had neglected over the last 6 months / year due to a hectic work schedule.I&#39;d imagine many of us are not wealthy enough to afford a personal assistant but live complex enough lives to warrant it. Modern life kind of requires a 4 day work week, if you are salaried slave."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first job out of college in 2008 was with Lockheed Martin, which supported flexible work schedules. You could work the traditional 40 hour week M-F, 9 hour days with every other Friday off (9-10), or four 10 hour days with every Friday off. Most people enjoyed the flexible schedules. Since Friday was the one day in flux, everyone knew to avoid scheduling important meetings on Friday. Being young and naive, I assumed most tech employers offered flexible schedules. I now know that this is regrettably not the case. I hope more employers will embrace this in the future. The costs to the firm are negligible, but flexible schedules can be a huge benefit to employees."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a somewhat pervasive idea that advertising and brand recognition are coercive tools that will ultimately die out, replaced by better objective information about products. I&#39;m kind of partial to this idea myself.But increasingly we seem a long way from achieving this. Amazon reviews have become such garbage, I&#39;ve fallen back to pretty much relying on name brands as my placeholder for product quality.There&#39;s still a lot to be said for established brands. Brands can afford widespread advertising because they have thriving businesses that generate lots of cash. Brands can get stocked in major retailers because you need decent products to make it through Walmart&#39;s buying process.These are signals that are harder to fake, and they&#39;re kind of the best we&#39;ve got right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Skip the Amazon resellers and order direct from China on Alibaba. Their reputation system is less spammy than Amazon&#39;s.One of my areas to watch: solid state relays.Here we have yet another fake Fotek solid state relay on Amazon.[1] Note the &#34;Made in China&#34;.Here&#39;s the real thing.[2] Note the &#34;Taiwan made&#34; from the real Fotek. Costs a lot more.
That&#39;s because it will actually handle the rated current. The fakes are notorious for overheating and burning out. The real thing has overheat and surge protection, will shut off if it overheats, and can stand a big short term overload for motor starting or when a short is in the process of tripping the circuit breaker upstream.Here&#39;s a similar solid state relay from China, from the actual manufacturer.They actually provide a table which shows how much they
exaggerate the ratings. They&#39;re over-rated by 2X for
a resistive load, and 6x for an inductive load.
&#34;For a motor with rated current of 15A and the motor
is inductive load, the formula is 15A x 6 = 90A, so
you should choose to buy 100A solid state relay&#34;.For a little extra, you can have your own fake label. Minimum order 200 pcs.Here&#39;s a fake Fotek.[4] What&#39;s amusing is that this is the actual manufacturer in China selling the fakes. They&#39;re in Guangdong, and they&#39;re selling under their own name, but with a fake label. No shame.There are legit manufacturers in China selling solid state relays.[5] They put their own name on the product, show pictures of the inside their rather grubby factory, and have realistic numbers on their data sheets, along with pictures of UL certification documents. About 4x more expensive than the fakes. If you&#39;re in China and are building industrial equipment which needs these components, you need ones that won&#39;t fail and shut down a manufacturing line.Here&#39;s a teardown of a fake. [6] The fakes are just solid state switches with power ratings way beyond what their components are good for. UL warning notice about fake Fotek solid state relays.[7] UL issued that notice six years ago, and they&#39;re still on Amazon and eBay.[1] https://www.amazon.com/SSR-25-DC-AC-Solid-State-Relay/dp/B07...[2] https://www.fotek.com.tw/en-gb/product-category/143[3] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/1PCS-SSR-10-DA-DC-Con...[4] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/High-quality-SSR-25DA...[5] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/SSR-S25DA-H-DC-TO-AC_...[6] https://youtu.be/DxEhxjvifyY[7] https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ul-warns-of-solid-s..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps I&#39;m in the minority of frequent amazon users, but I don&#39;t buy anything from 3rd party sellers anymore. There is simply too much fraud. In practice, this means that I often need to skip past amazon entirely and go straight to the product manufacturer, sometimes paying more, just to be sure I&#39;m not being screwed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the biggest problems in science (in general) is that your reputation and therefore funding is highly tied to a particular subfield.  Everyone in a subfield knows each other and gives positive grant reviews and external tenure letters to other practitioners.  If you try to move on to new areas of research, your reputation and funding are gone.  The outcome is that areas of research interest become quasi-permanent, even when they are no longer interesting. I talk to the people today that still work in my specialty of nuclear physics (relativistic heavy ion physics) and I&#39;m shocked at how little intellectual progress has been made.  At the risk of offending people it&#39;s time to give up and declare victory, but the consequences would be dire (hundreds of professors all over the world without grants)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In computer science, researchers who had spent decades working on feature engineering for images got completely blown out of the water by deep learning.  All those decades of papers would never get another cite.  Everyone moved on.String theory doesn&#39;t actually do anything though, so there&#39;s no way to say it&#39;s better or worse than anything else.  It&#39;s like someone saying they&#39;re working on solving the halting problem or something and eventually they&#39;ll get there and they&#39;ve been working on it for 20 years without any code that actually works.  At some point, you just have to give up and do something else.  They keep getting grants to work on this stuff though for some reason.  Someone needs to interview the people who are giving out string theory grants and ask them why the heck they are still giving these people money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1. Don&#39;t try too hard to make science funding more efficient / market lead or whatever - just fund more - double the science budget tomorrow And again every five years for a generation.  We are about to go through a societal refactoring with solar / electric / digital / climate change hitting at once.  Spending a few quid to help out the fundamentals won&#39;t hurt anyone.2. The above might upset people but string theory is a good example - partly yes people are held hostage by funding (much like it&#39;s hard to avoid being typecast as an actor).  But the solution to that is to fund lots more (experimental) movies, not to hope studio heads can pick better winners.I am perfectly happy for a slice of my tax dollar to go on someone thinking about Pram theory (#) for a decade simply because we have no idea whatsoever how to tackle the big ones in physics, so spray and pray is going to be a lot better than most other options.(#) Red Dwarf episode. worth watching episode just for this joke."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As long as companies Apple are not legally responsible for their supply chain in front of developed countries’ courts nothing will change. In Switzerland a law that would have changed this was recently rejected. Hopefully another country makes the first step."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Traditionally slavery was an alternative to death for the conquered.  I&#39;m morbidly curious what the effects of all Western corporations banning slave labor would be.  I doubt it would result in liberation.  Would working conditions for the slaves worsen when they worked for local, lower-margin factories instead?  I can&#39;t imagine them improving.I have little faith in legal remedies to liberate slaves.  Arming them seems the only long-term effective solution.  Otherwise the man with the gun will order the slave back to work the second the man in the wig isn&#39;t looking.  And the man in the wig will remain silent, to avoid revealing his impotence.Slave labor is inefficient, so perhaps the best way is to topple inefficient slave societies through full-spectrum competition, from military to economic.  This pressure incentivizes efficient human resource utilization.One thing&#39;s for sure:  Individual Westerner guilt over whether to buy the next iPhone will add zero value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recently, Apple&#39;s supplier, Wistron faced revolt after treating workers unfairly here in India. And India is not really the most shining example of protecting our workers from unfair and harsh working conditions. So, if such treatments don&#39;t fly here, I don&#39;t think they will fly anywhere else. The kind of labor expectation that these companies have after their stints in China is ethically incompatible with most other countries. So, I can&#39;t see the condition improving in the near future, companies will continue chasing profits at all cost and China will remain the most fertile ground to do that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting shift in strategy. Instead of giving the second dose within a few weeks of the first they’re going to allow up to 12 weeks between doses. Allows them to get more widespread level of some protection with dose 1 before later boosting protection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazing news, and so happy to see a lot of good sense here from the UK.They have distanced themselves from the US with the fastest approvals of Pfizer and Astrazeneca, the smartest targeting of the population (a focus on saving lives by targeting most vulnerable groups first), and the enormously helpful focus on getting some immunity first before worrying about second doses.The UK is no longer constrained by manufactured doses or anything else. The faster they put that existing supply into people, the faster they are done.  They could be done with the pandemic by the end of January."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like they approved the two-dose 62% ~effective~ efficacy  regiment.There was a lot of hope for the one-dose given the supply constraints or a retrial for the more promising half+full dose for greater efficacy.I wonder if people will ask which vaccine they&#39;re receiving. 62% is kinda underwhelming when there&#39;s two 95% ones (Pfizer/Moderna), a 92% one (Gamaleya), and a 79-86% one (Sinopharm). With the latter two also not needing subzero temps."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"He makes an important point early on in outlining the mission of Wikileaks centering on making Data and Information freely accessible to all (the concept of Dataism, for those who have read Yuval Harrari’s HOMO DEUS).However, the processing of Information into Intelligence that can be acted upon is what characterizes Intelligence agencies. Wikileaks does not concern itself with this phase. Yet, the CIA’s Pompeo is trying to paint a narrative that Wikileaks is doing this by labeling them a “non-state intelligence agency”, thereby justifying the CIA’s actions to attack Wikileaks.In brief:Narrative #1 - the CIA attacking an “Idealistic Free Information Publisher”.Narrative #2 - the CIA attacking a “Non-state Dark Intelligence Agency”The CIA is actively trying to create Narrative #2, which is a bit concerning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of several advantages military/policing/etc forces have is detailed records of what worked &amp; what didn&#39;t in a confrontation, and the other doesn&#39;t even necessarily know that they are fighting. That and purpose-built gear which nearly goes without saying.Something I&#39;ve noticed with the riots in Europe/America/China/the Middle East/Africa is that we now have first hand video footage of how situations play out. Often longform over 20 minutes which goes far beyond what traditional media forces would show.It isn&#39;t anywhere near enough to erase the organisational gap, but it is the furthest along the civilians have ever been in that game."</p>
