								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m just happy that Microsoft is finally charging directly for a developer product!When they keep giving out freebies (VSCode, npm etc.), we never know which direction the product is going to evolve. With this, there&#39;s direct alignment between customer &amp; the product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Copilot for a few months and...Yeah, it makes mistakes, sometimes it shows you i.e. the most common way to do something, even if that way has a bug in it.Yes, sometimes it writes a complete blunder.And yes again, sometimes there are very subtle logical mistakes in the code it proposes.But overall? It&#39;s been *great*! Definitely worth the 10 bucks a month (especially with a developer salary). :insert shut up and take my money gif:It&#39;s excellent for quickly writing slightly repetitive test cases; it&#39;s great as an autocomplete on steroids that completes entire lines + fills in all arguments, instead of just a single identifier; it&#39;s great for quickly writing nice contextual error messages (especially useful for Go developers and the constant errors.Wrap, Copilot is really good at writing meaningful error messages there); and it&#39;s also great for technical documentation, as it&#39;s able to autocomplete markdown (and it does it surprisingly well).Overall, I definitely wouldn&#39;t want to go back to writing code without it. It just takes care of most of the mundane and obvious code for you, so you can take care of the interesting bits. It&#39;s like having the stereotypical &#34;intern&#34; as an associate built-in to your editor.And sometimes, fairly rarely, but it happens, it&#39;s just surprising how good of a suggestion it can make.It&#39;s also ridiculously flexible. When I start writing graphs in ASCII (cause I&#39;m just quickly writing something down in a scratch file) it&#39;ll actually understand what I&#39;m doing and start autocompleting textual nodes in that ASCII graph."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I assume that Copilot uses open source projects on GitHub to “learn” what to suggest. Some of these projects might be under, say, GPL v3. A developer uses Copilot for a commercial project and Copilot insert a complete function from a GPL v3 code into this project. Someone notices this and sues the commercial project for breaking GPL v3. Will GitHub pickup the tab?"</p>

You don&#39;t need to know much if anything about how the database engine executes queries, you only need to implement the callbacks it needs to do its job.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We use Cloudflare to serve ~20-30TB of traffic a month where I work. Was the SRE on call when I got paged on our blackbox monitoring/third party web checks failing..It was very pleasant to find the cloudflare status page pointing me to the issue right away (minutes after our alerts triggered), even though I couldn&#39;t replicate the issue myself yet.I wish more companies would take note of the transparency and sense of urgency on updating their status page. (Looking at you Azure)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The default way that most networking devices are managed is crazy in this day and age.Like the post-mortem says, they will put mitigations in place, but this is something every network admin has to implement bespoke after learning the hard way that the default management approach is dangerous.I’ve personally watched admins make routing changes where any error would cut them off from the device they are managing and prevent them from rolling it back — pretty much what happened here.What should be the default on every networking device is a two-stage commit where the second stage requires a new TCP connection.Many devices still rely on “not saving” the configuration, with a power cycle as the rollback to the previous saved state. This is a great way to turn a small outage into a big one.This style of device management may have been okay for small office routers where you can just walk into the “server closet” to flip the switch. It was okay in the era when device firmware was measured in kilobytes and boot times in single digit seconds.Globally distributed backbone routers are an entirely different scenario but the manufacturers use the same outdated management concepts!(I have seen some small improvements in this space, such as devices now keeping a history of config files by default instead of a single current-state file only.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of our sites uses Cloudflare and serves 400k pageviews per month and generates around $650/day in ad and affiliate revenue. If the site is not up the business is not making any money.Looking at the hourly chart in Google Analytics (compared to the previous day) there isn&#39;t even a blip during this outage.So for all the advantages we get from Cloudflare (caching, WAF, security [our WP admin is secured with Cloudflare Teams], redirects, page rules, etc) I&#39;ll take these minor outages that make HN go apeshit.Of course it helped that most our traffic is from the US and this happened when it did but in the past week alone we served over 180 countries which Cloudflare helps make sure is nice and fast :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Advice regarding VCs: Don&#39;t ever talk to them if they randomly approach you saying they &#34;really like what you&#39;re doing&#34;. They will gladly sent an associate to talk with you about your business in the greatest detail and ask you to share presentations, demos and metrics. Anything you give them will then get passed along to their own portfolio companies in your space. So don&#39;t feel flattered when they feign interest in your company, they&#39;re mostly just doing reconnaissance. Ignore it as chances are you&#39;re feeding them information they&#39;ll use to kill your company.If you&#39;re really interested in VC funding you should proactively approach VCs (ideally using introductions by your network) that seem suitable. And you should check beforehand that they don&#39;t fund your main competitor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for this writeup, I can relate 100%, especially the part on the supportive spouse. I&#39;ve built WunderGraph (https://wundergraph.com/) as a solo-dev for multiple years until I reached a similar point like you. It&#39;s weird to say, but my wife kind of accepted that I&#39;d work on weekends between 1-3 pm when the kids sleep. What helped me get out of this &#34;solo-time-drain-thing&#34; was to find the right Co-Founders to help me. I&#39;ve found a really nice guy to help me with Marketing, and another one who helped me develop the Product. &#34;If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, find a team.&#34; I hope you can find some way of financing so that you can push through this wall. For me, it was working a full time job and building WunderGraph at night and on the weekends, but it&#39;s making you age quickly. I wish you the best for your future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the post:&gt; For example, it is integrated with GitHub in such a way that on every push it will provision a new server running specifically that code, deployed to the edge, worldwide, and persisted permanently. Want to access the code your app was running a month ago at commit f7c5e19? It will be served up instantly at a moment&#39;s notice. It costs you nothing to have that bit of JavaScript responding to requests indefinitely.These things sound great and almost a dream come true but how realistic is it to consider being able to do this in most web apps? As soon as your application uses a SQL database and you have database migrations then you&#39;re out of luck because a commit from 2 months ago might expect a different database schema than the current version and while it&#39;s common to migrate in backwards compatible ways, the backwards compatibility is usually only temporary until you finish migrating from A to B.Long story short, this sounds cool but in practice is really only applicable to static sites or dynamic sites where you plan to keep a version of your database and code base backwards compatible from day 1 to current day (which I&#39;ve never seen done in any app developed over the last ~20 years of freelancing for many different companies). The post mentions &#34;The open source Deno runtime shows how clean and productive a modern, batteries-included, programming environment can be&#34; so it sounds like they expect you&#39;ll be running database backed apps and not only static sites."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting how this will play out. It&#39;s an ambitious goal to consolidate client side and server side javascript ecosystems which is quite fragmented today. On the other hand, this may only increase fragmentation further by introducing another target to develop for (wait for transpilers that can automagically convert between deno and node code). I will always look at javascript as this problem kid that cannot get its shit together in life, perpetually chasing the romance of utopia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The rise of JavaScript-only clouds intended as &#34;defacto&#34; solutions for web development scares the hell out of me. Monocultures are dangerous. At least in the early Node era, it sat alongside all the other flavors of server infra out there with a near-infinite variety of languages, platforms, OSes. Now we&#39;re being told that the future of web development is…Deno? That&#39;s it? One tool? One language? One platform?Not the web I intend to build and participate in, I can tell you that right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems like the least of the negative impacts nextdoor encourages.i removed myself after months of watching people on this app become more and more paranoid, feeding off each other.the breaking point was when someonea put out a warning that someone had knocked on their door at 7:00pm, “the wife and i were eating dinner when the rude knock came. we crept over to the window, peeked out, and didn’t recognize the person. be careful!”the person knocking turned out to be a 16 year old girl who lives three blocks away who unfortunately got a flat tire and was hoping to borrow a phone to call her dad.we live in an incredibly safe wealthy suburb and these people “crept” to a window like they’re in an old west shootout and decided to put out a warning on nextdoor about a little sixteen year old girl.we still laugh just thinking how crazy these people must have looked while creeping from their kitchen to peek out a window in one of the safest areas in the state at a time of day when people are still out mowing their lawns.nextdoor somehow just adds to these people’s already insane creeping paranoia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"NextDoor: home of the dumbest people on the Internet. They must be proud of that.There are occasionally things I want to see on there: a new Costco going in where the OSH Hardware used to be, or whatnot. So I got the daily email digest. One email per day -- tolerable.Then it stopped coming. I wrote to Support, and their guy swore it was still being sent! I said &#34;no, it&#39;s not. I looked in Spam and Trash.&#34; He swore again that it was going out, and I should &#34;check with my email provider.&#34;I asked &#34;How do you know they&#39;re going out? Did you look in the Sent folder?&#34; He got all sniffy and said &#34;We are unable to disclose anything about our internal operations.&#34; Ooh, big secret!So I wrote to the Nextdoor handle on Twitter. They told me there was an experiment going on. I asked if they could take me out of it. They did and all was good again.Except other people on Nextdoor were also unhappy about being in the experiment, and asked me how I got out of it. I told them; they tried it; Nextdoor now refused to do it for them.Think about it -- almost every site on the Web is trying to get you to sign up for a daily email. Nextdoor already has one, and they&#39;re trying to take it away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nextdoor wins my prize for the scummiest human manipulation to increase user signups I&#39;ve witnessed.I live in the UK in a cul-de-sac with about 25 houses in the street. We&#39;ve lived here about 4 years and have a dog so we have bumped in to all the neighbours and know all of them by name at least.I get a note through my door from NextDoor claiming to be from a neighbour in my street with a name that we did not recognise. Apparently this neighbour had signed up for NextDoor to keep our street safe and exchange important information yada yada yada...Needless to say it&#39;s total horse shit - none of us are using their scummy platform and have absolutely no desire to.So they&#39;re preying on people&#39;s fears, and hoping that some kind of FOMO plus the fear of being stabbed in your sleep if you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on in your street will get people on to their platform."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HDMI offers so many protocols I didn’t know of.Before finding a way to use DDC on Apple Silicon [1] for Lunar (https://lunar.fyi), I contemplated creating a universal DDC/CI device that can change brightness, contrast, volume, input and colors of a monitor, by either receiving commands through HTTP, or acting as an Adaptive Brightness standalone device.In my mind, it would have been an HDMI dongle with an ESP32 that gets power through the 5V line of the HDMI port, and which has an ambient light sensor to adapt brightness by itself.In the end, I found the I2C APIs on M1 so this was not so sorely needed anymore, but given the limitations of the M1 Display Coprocessor, I still think it might be a good idea. I just have no idea where would I start with hardware distribution and mass production, this domain seems so intangible from the software development side.[1] https://alinpanaitiu.com/blog/journey-to-ddc-on-m1-macs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; For example, let&#39;s imagine you invite an external guest for a presentation inside your company. You offer to connect to a video-projector so he can show his slides. This is the perfect opportunity for the guest to hack the video-projector. Next time an employee connects to this projector, his laptop is hacked back.Is there a single proof of concept of this out there? This seems wildly theoretical to me.Seems like you have to know:* the projector/TV model/firmware* the employee laptop and firmware* a bug in the projector/TV that would let you insert arbitrary data in a way that will stay around and be sent to other devices that connect to HDMI* a bug in the laptop that would let you install something malicious with the data could get the projector to send* your hack wont be detected by software on the laptop or the IDS/whatever on their networkThat’s pretty heavy lifting. I mean is any of that reasonable outside of nation-state level attacks?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The main thing I&#39;d be interested in blocking is Ethernet:* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HDMI_Ethernet_ChannelWith televisions having all sorts of questionable software installed that wants to phone home, it&#39;s probably best not to connect them directly, but rather stream things to the display from either your mobile device or a box (e.g., Apple TV).Of course if you accidentally do connect it online via a box that does have Internet access, who knows what kind of Lovecraftian horrors will be enabled on the television."</p>

My personal design goal is that my bag fits under airline seats, so I never have to worry about gate checking a bag and risking lost luggage.  The main tradeoff is that I do a lot of laundry in sinks - you really learn the effectiveness of detergent when you see the color of the water coming off some clothes you thought were pretty clean.  These days I&#39;m a bit lazier and try to end up somewhere with a washing machine every week or two to break up the hand washing chore.  I&#39;ve done the towel wringing trick but it&#39;s not all that necessary with my clothes unless I&#39;m in a damp environment and am short on time.The two things that I mostly agree with - eSIM is a massive improvement (I also use Airalo), and I&#39;ve also tried to standardize on USB-C (except for my headphones, where I haven&#39;t found a good replacement).  /r/onebag does have some good product recommendations but is somewhat skewed to young backpackers.I would encourage everyone to ignore anyone telling them they&#39;re &#34;doing it wrong&#34; when traveling. You know yourself, make your own decisions. Personally, making an effort to meet digital nomads all around the world sounds like hell on earth to me. Also, it&#39;s wasted effort. Trust me, they&#39;ll find you and tell you all about themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is interesting because I tend to think of packing as a dirtbag thing rather than a nomad thing... when I&#39;m hotel hopping for extended periods I just bring normal luggage. Maybe I should start bringing my backpack instead.My first impression is that this is a LOT of clothes and the electric stuff is a bit weird.A few differences between dirtbag and nomad (the latter AFAICT is mostly hotel/airbnb hopping?):First, you think a lot about food and water. Especially water, and especially sans car. It&#39;s VERY heavy and very necessary.Second, my emergency pack is almost completely different. No vitamin shoppe merch. An ACE bandage, 8 aspirin per day from civ, 1 dose of imodium per day from civ, gauze, anti-bacterial cream, tape, suture kit, and one dose of a more powerful pain killer for serious emergencies if you can get it. No rapid tests (travel usually required a PCR anyways), but a couple KN95s. Cash in both USD (clean, unfolded, new bills) and the local currency. Maps.Third, weight really matters.Fourth, cleanliness really matters. You&#39;re essentially homeless. Diners and cafes kick out homeless people if you try to stay 9-5. In addition to organizing my life around being clean, I also had a whole separate emergency &#34;Not A Dirtbag For A Day&#34; kit.I guess the other big difference is that all of my day-to-day stuff fit in roughly 15L so that I could carry 5L water and my gear could consume the other 20L."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve spend months at a time, e.g. Sicilian island hopping, with less than this. For me the critical issue, which drives all clothing choices, is being able to independently do laundry. That is easier in frequent small batches; I can&#39;t imagine traveling with eight T-shirts!After washing clothes, layer them in a large wringable synthetic pack towel, roll, and twist. Then they can be hung without dripping, and will dry in a fraction of the time. Wring out the towel and repeat. Or, if one has just arrived at a hotel with towels for four, get busy before they clear three of them in the morning.One needs an ample supply of travel-scaled clothesline and clothespin equivalents. I last traveled with tiny Nite Ize Gear Ties, and a few larger ties with loops for securing the clothesline ends. Be thoughtful about attachment points; foreign construction quality can often be surprising.I can&#39;t praise highly enough merino wool T-shirts, even in the hottest weather. I found mine on closeout; they can be expensive.The Aranet4 CO2 meter is an interesting pandemic choice. I own one for monitoring my classroom assignments; they&#39;re very well made."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks neat. I wish it used iso8601 [0] dates. It’s pretty convenient as the time periods uses the format YYYY-MM-DD/YYYY-MM-DD and I think is easier to mentally parse than MM/DD/YYYY-MM/DD/YYYY.Of course I didn’t even know what a solidus (“/“) was until using iso8601.Also, I usually find standards pretty much as overhead, but 8601 seems pretty good as a universal standard.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been working on markwhen as a way to easily create timelines just from text.I’ve used it personally to help plan and coordinate my own wedding (https://markwhen.com/rob/wedding) and for keeping track of life events, and I’ve seen it used for event planning, project management, and to visualize historical events or periods of time.I personally like tools that let you immediately start using them, and I set out to do that here with markwhen.Let me know if you have any questions!"</p>
