								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s an artist called Øystein Wyller Odden that works with mains hum. I find it pretty fascinating:Kraftbalanse is a musical translation of the hum from the mains; i. e. the frequency of the alternating current. The piece is based on the fact that this frequency is not stable, it fluctuates subtly around 50 Hz as a direct result of supply and demand in the power market.The composition consists of a self-resonating piano that is tuned to resonate on 50 hz and overtones of 50 hz (100 Hz, 150 Hz, 200 Hz etc.) The piano is fitted with vibration-elements – transducers – plugged directly into the electrical grid, causing the resonance and timbre of the piano to change with the fluctuations on the power market.The piano is accompanied by a string octet. The musicians are equipped with voltmeters that measure the frequency of the current in real time, as well as a score of instructions on how to respond to changes in this frequency.https://vimeo.com/370554138"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Stripe is extremely bad at fraud. I have a company that continues to charge my credit card monthly, their website and email do not work anymore. I continue to charge back them every single month, and Stripe continues to charge my card. This has been going on for about 7 months now. If I ask them to help, they tell me to contact AMEX, I contact AMEX they tell me to contact Stripe.The website doesn&#39;t work, the email doesn&#39;t work, I charge it back every single month, yet Stripe doesn&#39;t care one bit.Attempting to contact Stripe results in emails asking if I need help resetting my password (yes I legit sent an email asking for them to investigate the &#34;company&#34; and they sent back a reply with details on how to reset my password), to telling me to contact my credit card provider.Honestly both companies are giant bags of turds, if you can you should look elsewhere, you can save money on almost every fee, there are alternatives to every single product they provide, and pretty much all of the alternatives are varying degrees of better or cheaper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The one part of this article that I totally agree with is how terrible the API integration has become. In the early days, Stripe sold itself on a few things, one of which was the simplicity of integration. Since the whole PaymentIntents and SetupIntents introduction (along with the documentation fiasco that happened at the same time), integrating with Stripe is something like PayPal from 10 years ago. Its shit.PaymentIntents workflow (including the necessity to listen for webhooks) deserves a special place in hell. Its like they decided to copy Paypal IPN.I have used, recommended and intgrated Stripe to multiple businesses over the years (generating hundreds of US$ millions). For the past 2 years or so, I have migrated most of them away from Stripe, and any new integrations are done through other payment processors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is extremely confusing and filled with do many errors it&#39;s hard to even list them all. However, the bit I wanted to focus on was the author&#39;s claim that PayPal got &#34;sued&#34; and &#34;stopped taking money from people&#34;. Getting sued is part of the ordinary course of business for a company like PayPal, and ~85% of lawsuits like that go nowhere, and result in no internal changes. The specific lawsuit the author seems to have been talking about was dismissed entirely by a judge in July, because the contact you sign with Facebook when you use their account explicitly forbids you from suing them instead of going through private arbitration proceedings: https://www.pokertube.com/article/chris-moneymaker-s-class-a... (Chris Moneymaker&#39;s Class Action Lawsuit Against PayPal Falls At First Hurdle).And again, this is the kind of thing that happens to PayPal all the time. The fact that some random lawsuit that never even required a substantial reply from PayPal got picked up by Zed as evidence of their bad behavior &#34;finally catching up to them&#34; really erodes my confidence in the way he represents any of the other details in this article. What else is he misrepresenting or exaggerating?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"May I suggest a purely rational, evidence based take?The trap is your belief in a linear relationship between effort and
outcome. Working harder and longer produces more productivity, right?That&#39;s false.As you say so yourself, your memory goes to shit. It&#39;s not just a law
of diminishing returns. For coders, past a certain point, exhaustion
leads you to start undoing your work. You are into negative
productivity.I&#39;ve pushed through all-nighters where I poured out a few thousand LOC
only to find the next day that I had broken everything and introduced
more bugs than I had time to fix. I just had to revert. An exhausted
hacker is worse than no hacker at all. You&#39;re a liability to yourself
and the project.So, like driving when tired, realise that the urge to continue is
completely irrational, and probably based in the emotional drives of
fear or pride. It would be completely irrational for any manager to
want you to code in that state, and anyone who pushes you to is also
the idiot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; small hurdles spike my anxiety, my anger flares at the slightest confrontation, I notice fewer jokes, fewer attempts on my part to make people laugh. My memory goes to all hell too and I can’t seem to concentrate on prolonged amounts of anything. Books fall off my radar, I stop listening to music. My phone is in my hand at all times, scrolly-anxiety-inducing apps become impossible to avoid.This describes me perfectly. Unfortunately I can’t take a break because it’s entirely due to being the parent of young children."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On top of taking regular breaks, I think we should also work slower. Burnout is a scary place to be in. While the news calls it “quiet quitting”, I think many people are simply burnt out from the last few years of world conditions and add on the rubber band effect of everything going back to “normal”. It’s just too much change in a short amount of time.I wrote a book about this topic when I was in a state of burnout. I had enough of the many different aspects of the world (overwork, the news, social media, etc) that I believe led to stress based illness.I don’t feel bad for taking time off anymore. You got to put yourself first sometimes to be able to show up for others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everytime I read about this, it makes me think about this game:https://termsandconditions.game/(SSL warning)These shenanigans are not required, they are very much designed on purpose.Indeed, corporations can follow the &#34;Do Not Track&#34; header. There is nothing in the EU law that requires a banner, only informed consent.So if I have DNT=1 set in my browser, pop a quick non modal notification saying &#34;we wants to track you but but we won&#39;t because you said not to. Click here if you want to change that&#34;. Solved.I&#39;m informed. I made my choice.But that&#39;s not what it&#39;s about.Because the vast majority of people would not consent. Who are you kidding? This tracking is not benefiting us. It&#39;s like when politician says it&#39;s &#34;for the children&#34; or &#34;to fight terrorists&#34;. Everybody knows there are full of it.So the banner is just the most annoying way that is legally allowed to try to get people to force-accept tracking. In fact, some banner are crafted to make rejection the hardest path for this very reason.Those corps chose to make the web terrible a little bit more every day: tracking, auto play, scroll hijacking, dark patters, cookie banners...We should thank the UE a 1000 times to reveal who are the bad players."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Firefox also plans to have builtin support for auto-rejecting cookies when there is a consent banner. See https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1783015. From my understanding, this should be similar to Consent-O-Matic. It will be available on both desktop and mobile versions. This is enabled recently by default in Nightly (but I don&#39;t use Nightly)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ugh i hate these banners.The web browser should control the consent. Like how it worked in IE5 before everyone realized asking was super annoying and just assumed yes.It makes no sense for a web site to collect state to know if its allowed to collect state."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly I hope Google go through with this as it will direct people to Firefox so they can continue using ad-blockers like uBlock Origin.I don&#39;t know how many will come but if Google wants to implode their plugin ecosystem in favour of more advertising, and if that action increases Firefox adoption (and thus a healthy browser ecosystem via competition) then I am for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Benefits of the Manifest V3: noneV3 not allowing remote code execution is actually a serious benefit. Of course, this does not negate the fact that V3 is mainly there to boost the ad ecosystem of Google, but I&#39;d never want my screen casting extension to be mining bitcoin on the background. That said, I&#39;m not sure how this is going to scale long term, given that it sometimes takes 2+ weeks for the web store review team to approve a genuine one-line change. Lack of RCE is only going to make this review backlog bigger."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"After playing with a C64 Maxi replica (mine has the VIC-20 colors) I can&#39;t think of using a vintage computer without a matching keyboard (and often mouse). The experience is not only the pixels on the screen and the sounds of the speaker, but the whole spatial relationship with the physical object.It probably doesn&#39;t need to be an almost perfect replica like the 64 Maxi, but having the keys in the same places (even if there is no ESC key - looking at you, DEC LK-201). On my desk, my two daily drivers are a Sun Type 7c (Type 7 is in storage, waiting for its rotation) and an IBM/Lexmark/Unicomp PC-122 Model M, and I can say each of them provides a unique experience, tactile, spatial, and, on the Model M&#39;s case, auditory.I&#39;m thinking about learning how to build keyboards and make a couple DIY ones. Switches can&#39;t be the same, but, at least, physical layout, keycap shapes, labels, and colors can be matched."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This point is so good and so important:&#34;Getting lost in your knowledge management system is a fantastic way to avoid creating things. Or calling that friend you’re estranged from. Or doing anything else even mildly threatening. It’s also a fantastic way to convince yourself that unpreparedness is what’s between you and creative work. If you believe you’re unprepared, know that you will never transmute into the perfectly prepared person that you think exists in the future.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think we conflate two types of note-taking:  1. List-style notes of things we need to remember

  2. School-style notes of information and ideas

I think the former requires a tool, but nothing particularly sophisticated - Apple Notes for example with its search indexing is fineI think the latter we write only to stimulate our brain to process information and learn better.I think there is a discrepancy where a lot of tools attempt to make Type 2 notes more &#34;convenient&#34;, i.e. to trying to somehow make them an extension of our brain, but the truth is that it&#39;s like hacking a hard drive to work as fast as a CPU register -- retrieving and working with information is always going to be orders of magnitude slower than working through your thoughts in your brain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Any article that pretends to know what the right way of taking notes (say, &#34;This is known as a commonplace book, and it is about how detailed your note-taking system should be unless you plan on thinking more elaborately than Leonardo da Vinci.&#34; in this article) is missing the point.People think differently, people have different purposes and goals, people have different constraints on their time, their memory, their field. Can you procrastinate on note-taking? Sure. So can you on writing, and publishing, and building an audience, and writing papers, and doing the dishes.Can people have a fantastic creative output by just opening a blank page and jotting down their thoughts? Sure. Can other people write great books with an elaborate notetaking system? Of course. There are plenty of people out there with terrific, obsessive note-taking and reference systems, Kubrick being one of the prime examples.As someone with what looks from the outside to be an overarchitected note-taking system ( https://publish.obsidian.md/manuel ), it is a system that works great for me, and it is a system that makes me more creative and helps me discover ideas I would have never been able to articulate without. I used linear sketchbooks where I would write and draw whatever for years, filling hundreds of notebooks, and it came nowhere near my obsidian setup in terms of output and effectiveness."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was curious how this worked so I did some reading which I found interesting. In short, this uses ptrace, which is the same Linux kernel mechanism used by debuggers, to attach to a running process and manipulate the open file descriptors (amongst other things) while it runs. So basically it attaches to the process, and changes stdin (fd 0) and stdout (fd 1) to point to your tmux session stdout and stdin.Pretty cool use of ptrace."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a nice tool (reptyr), but not particularly convenient to use, requiring several steps to move the process to the background and remembering the PID etc. I do wish this was a more streamlined, standard feature of Unix/Linux shells.
