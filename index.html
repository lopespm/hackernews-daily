								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back when I worked at Marvell Semiconductor (circa 2005), we made laser printer ASICs for HP. We did a lot of dithering in hardware. We had a hardware block that did error diffusion, we had a hardware block that did regular diffusion. We also had a hardware block that did Blue Noise. I was responsible for implementing the firmware that drove those printers&#39; scan/copy path: scan an image in monochrome, run through the dither hardware to create the bit pattern fed to the laser engine.No one could explain to me how to use the blue noise block. I couldn&#39;t understand what the blue noise block was doing. This is the first article that explained, in terms I could understand, how blue noise dithering works.I can die happy. Thank you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such a well-written article: it describes the impetus, it is researched, it has great examples both as code and as output, and it piques interest. In the late 1990&#39;s I contracted with an embedded software company to optimize a dithering algorithm for 8-bit MCUs that was used in most laser printers &amp; copiers, and this paper is a really good overview."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; According to Wikipedia, “Dither is an intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error”, and is a technique not only limited to images. It is actually a technique used to this day on audio recordings […]Dithering as a digital signal processing technique is also used frequently in the digital control of physical systems. One example of this is in the control of hydraulic servo valves[1]; these valves are usually pretty small and their performance can be dominated by a lot of external factors. One of the biggest ones is &#34;stiction&#34;, or static friction, wherein if the moving parts of the valve are at rest it can take a large amount of current to get them going again which translates in to poor control of the valve and in turn poor control of the thing the valve is trying to move. It&#39;s common to use very high frequency/small amplitude dithering on these valves to eliminate the effects of stiction without compromising accuracy which greatly improves the control stability and responsiveness of the servo valves.1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrohydraulic_servo_valve"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some truly impressive results. I&#39;ll pick my usual point here when a fancy new (generative) model comes out, and I&#39;m sure some of the other commenters have alluded to this. The examples shown are likely from a set of well-defined (read: lots of data, high bias) input classes for the model. What would be really interesting is how the model generalizes to /object concepts/ that have yet to be seen, and which have abstract relationships to the examples it has seen. Another commenter here mentioned &#34;red square on green square&#34; working, but &#34;large cube on small cube&#34;, not working. Humans are able to infer and understand such abstract concepts with very few examples, and this is something AI isn&#39;t as close to as it might seem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is simultaneously amazing and depressing, like watching someone set off a hydrogen bomb for the first time and marveling at the mushroom cloud it creates.I really find it hard to understand why people are optimistic about the impact AI will have on our future.The pace of improvement in AI has been really fast over the last two decades, and I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a good thing. Compare the best text generator models from 10 years ago with GPT-3. Now do the same for image generators. Now project these improvements 20 years into the future. The amount of investment this work is getting grows with every such breakthrough. It seems likely to me we will figure out general-purpose human-level AI in a few decades.And what then? There are so many ways this could turn into a dystopian future.Imagine for example huge mostly-ML operated drone armies, tens of millions strong, that only need a small number of humans to supervise them. Terrified yet? What happens to democracy when power doesn&#39;t need to flow through a large number of people? When a dozen people and a few million armed drones can oppress a hundred million people?If there&#39;s even a 5% chance of such an outcome (personally I think it&#39;s higher), then we should be taking it seriously."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow. This is amazing. Although I wish they documented how much compute and data was used to get these results.I absolutely believe we&#39;ll crack the fundamental principles of intelligence in our lifetimes. We now have capability to process all public data available on internet (of wikipedia is a huge chunk). We have so many cameras and microphones (one in each pocket).It&#39;s also scary to think if it goes wrong (the great filter for fermi paradox). However I&#39;m optimistic.The brain only uses 20 watts of power to do all its magic. The entire human body is built from 700MB of data in the DNA. The fundamental principles of intelligence is within reach if we look from that perspective.Right now GPT3 and DALL-E seem to be using an insane amount of computation to achieve what they are doing. My prediction is that in 2050, we&#39;ll have pretty good intelligence in our phones that has deep understanding (language and visual) of the world around us."</p>

If so, do you have any tips?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; [The spokeswoman] said there will be no change in how WhatsApp shares provides data with Facebook for non-business chats and account data.That sounds a lot less alarming, in the third to last paragraph, than the headline or first few paragraphs?Don&#39;t get me wrong, I ditched Facebook years ago, and wouldn&#39;t use WhatsApp but for family and a pre-Corona club I wouldn&#39;t have (much at all) contact with otherwise.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something that I find interesting is that career advice coming from professionals having many years of experience focuses almost exclusively on the people aspects and not the technology: communication, trust, teamwork, documentation, clarity. The advice is clear, precise and honest.This is the opposite of what you get from new hires/juniors: they tend to focus on which stacks matter, what to learn, how to develop, deploy and maintain. Not much real advice on the behavioral side, to the point that people often take trainings for behavioral interviews and memorize “leadership principles” and other nonsense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very wise:&#34;When I was at GM, you were a failure if your next move was not up—managing more people or taking on bigger, more complex projects. For many, this made for a miserable career path&#34;As I&#39;ve said before, I think this is a corrosive aspect of the perf/promo process at many FAANGs. The &#34;level&#34; system encourages/pushes people to &#34;upgrade&#34; in this manner, and I think contributes to a number of problems. For one, organizational incompetence when people who were valuable contributors where they were are elevated up into roles where they no longer can apply those skills as effectively (i.e. technical team lead to management or architect) leaving a vacuum below. A form of the Peter Principle I guess, except the individual may have competence in their new role but not be happy, or make the team itself less successful.And most importantly, as he touches on: being asked to &#39;level up&#39; and told that this is your mission can lead to an unpleasurable career. Either when you do get that promo and then find that you don&#39;t enjoy the new responsibilities (but become trapped by the position / upgraded compensation etc.) or when you don&#39;t get the promo (or don&#39;t try) and find that your value in the eyes of yourself and others seems less.And finally, I think this type of thing can really take hold in places with a highly academic background / focus / origin (like Google, etc.) as it mimics in many ways the grade / peer review achievement structure of academia. And that reward / grading structure may not at all correspond to either the monetary or cultural success of a corporation.Smaller companies looking to grow/formalize should exercise caution when looking at the rating/performance/promo process @ FAANGs / MS as a model for their own.(I&#39;m at 20-25ish years in the industry, but really feel junior in so many ways when I read the words of veterans like this.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  3. Simplicity
  Fighting complexity is a never-ending cause. Solutions should 
  be as simple as possible. Assume the next person to 
  maintain your code won’t be as smart as you. When you can 
  use fewer technologies, do so.

This is the one I appreciate more and more as I age. Because frequently, I&#39;m the next person looking at my own code. And there&#39;s no better gift to your future self than well-written, easy-to-understand code that is straightforward to maintain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Definitely beautiful and would love for something simple and clean to eat LinkedIn&#39;s lunch.I don&#39;t have much to add in addition to everyone else except this: I am really disturbed by the common meme of faces-inside-circles. Why do we need faces? It just distracts from the content. I love the idea of being able to link former colleagues together - that&#39;s neat - but I&#39;m very anti-face and  there are any number of ways to do it that does not involve people&#39;s pictures.Edit: Wow this got a lot of upvotes. So, I&#39;ll continue for a sec: There is so, so much conscious and unconscious judgment and game playing with pictures, I don&#39;t even know where to start. Let&#39;s leave this to be simple, clean and beautiful without the faces."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started read.cv when transitioning from full time to freelance design in July. I wanted an easy to update &#39;about me&#39; page to link from my website and bio – something simpler than LinkedIn and more dynamic than a PDF.Design wise I focused on legibility and tried to give projects/side projects equal weight to things like education and work experience. A few unique features: tagging collaborators in your experiences, status updates, and print optimized profiles.It took me around three months (Sept to November) to get it out the door, and I&#39;ve been working on making improvements since. Open to any questions or feedback!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good start, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of this the way it is now.First, the font is tiny for my old eyes.  Not all of us, especially hiring managers, are still in their 20s and can read these tiny fonts. I measured it with a ruler and the text is 1mm tall.  Also, the font is gray on white, which is pretty but hard to read. In contrast, Linkedin is three times bigger and black on white, much easier to read.Second, after looking at the example, I have almost no idea what you&#39;ve done.  All I see are job titles.  I don&#39;t see any accomplishments or even job duties.  It looks like I could add those things when I create my own profile, but having them missing on the example isn&#39;t a good look.Third, the face circles.  I see face circles under each job, but they aren&#39;t clickable nor are there tooltips.  I have no idea what those are.  I assume they&#39;re other people who worked at the same place?  Maybe connections of yours who have worked at the same place?  That&#39;s a cool idea, but it needs to be more discoverable.  At the very least a tooltip would be good.Overall, when I&#39;m looking at a professional profile, I&#39;m usually doing it because I want to hire or work with someone.  The main information I want to know is 1) Do we have anyone in common I can ask about you?  2) What did you accomplish at your previous workplaces or otherwise?  3) Have you worked anywhere that I recognize and when, so I can ask my other friends who worked there if they know you?The face circles accomplish #1, so that&#39;s great.  #2 looks possible, but the design seems to minimize the accomplishments, as opposed to Linkedin which sort of puts it in your face.  And #3 seems to be covered but again the design minimizes the information I want most.I would say a good place to start would be asking yourself, &#34;Why does Linkedin look the way it does?&#34;.  A lot of their design comes from customer feedback, and their main customers are recruiters and hiring managers.  Steal their good stuff and leave their dark patterns behind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is anyone else ever saddened when they think about the man hours spent on projects like this (reversing software or hardware to accomplish what should be a simple goal) when all it would take is the teensiest bit of cooperation to not waste all those hours? I use waste in the sense of like trying to assemble something complicated with the instructions just out of arms reach, not in the sense of doing something pointless.In some cases all companies would have to do is not actively hide or obfuscate things. In others it may take more effort but still just a drop in the huge bucket compared to developing a system in the first place.I love Apple&#39;s hardware, I even (mostly) love the OS. If they too believe that it is solid - why prevent people from running what they want? The majority will come back anyway - I&#39;ve run Linux for years and still ended up on MacOS for simplicity. I&#39;ll still buy Macs and run MacOS because it works for me, it&#39;s not like letting me run Linux will cost them money or something. The vast majority of people don&#39;t  know what Linux even is, there is no threat there.Please note that this comment is not directed at people who choose to spend their time on projects like this. You&#39;re awesome, I just wish you didn&#39;t have to put so much effort in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple needs to give a little here.I think it&#39;s patently ridiculous that we have to enlist the assistance of console hackers in order to have a chance at porting the most used operating system in the entire world to run on hardware that in all likelihood already happily runs it inside of Apple&#39;s labs.&gt; In particular, we will be reverse engineering the Apple GPU architecture and developing an open source driver for it.This is all a noble goal, but I can&#39;t see this as being anything other than a complete and total non-starter with zero cooperation from Apple. After the street cred of getting a marginally usable OS up and running evaporates, why continue to take the effort of great engineers and waste it developing an ecosystem that doesn&#39;t care? It makes no sense to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Compare this slap on the wrist to Aaron Swartz:Federal prosecutors later charged him with two counts of wire fraud and eleven violations of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act,[15] carrying a cumulative maximum penalty of $1 million in fines, 35 years in prison, asset forfeiture, restitution, and supervised release.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Ticketmaster has agreed to pay a $10 million criminal fineLive Nation is worth $16 Billion. This is like a person with a $100k net worth having to pay a $62 fine, basically an expensive parking ticket.They might as well tell them to write &#34;I will not hack my competitors&#34; on the blackboard 100 times."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at Songkick. The business was not sustainable, there was no revenue stream in sight before the Crowdsurge merger. Crowdsurge effectively acquired us when they merged as Songkick had run out of funding, with no potential buyers or investors. Crowdsurge was not sustainable either, they lost money on every ticket sold, but mostly because TM would only allow 10% of any allocation at any TM venue. Crowdsurge were backed by Access (Len Blavatnik who owns Warner). The CEO and COO of Crowdsurge went after Ticketmaster as an exit. They built a corporate structure that made the employee share pool worthless. This meant that no employees ever saw any of the $110m &#34;buy out&#34; and they will never see any of this new $10m. The CEO and COO have a lot to answer for."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So many dimensions come to play here.1. There&#39;s the obvious legal aspect i.e. how these laws are framed and interpreted.2. Then there&#39;s the geopolitical aspect. Is it fair to impose sanctions on Iran.3. There&#39;s another aspect around GitHub policy that asks if an entire organization be banned for the location of one team member.4. Finally, there&#39;s the aspect of relinquishing control. Your app development is on the cloud. IDEs are on the cloud. Deployments are on the cloud. App stores are on the cloud.You have relinquished so much control, why be surprised if that stares you back in the face?Ironically, Git is a decentralized version control system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Entrusting your business to an american entity is the stupidest idea you could have thought about.Especially us europeans should not rely on American services at all.It&#39;s not worth it.American corporations are just as much a liability as their counterparts in China."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US sanctions on Iran has such a massive impact on Iranians that most of us don&#39;t realise.All US companies have to comply and majority of the tech companies are unfortunately in the US.I know you can use a VPN and configure it on a router level to make sure that you are always connected via a VPN but just the fact that 1 slip-up can result in account level blocks (which google is notoriously good at and can essentially shut down your business) means no company would want to work with someone working from Iran.Coming from a 3rd world country, I know the problems of internet censorship which Iranians also face but being too toxic to touch for everyone outside Iran because the US leadership thinks so is just infuriating and heart breaking.Imagine being a programmer in Iran. Not only do you have less resources to learn and grow, you have a massive handicap to find good work as most work is outside of the country.Only bet is to leave the country but even there you have a very low probability as you basically can&#39;t have a trial period for your job as most companies don&#39;t want to risk having their accounts blocked.Most of us here know how degrading and infuriating the tech recruiting processes can be and now add to it the horrors of working from Iran.Wars are not supposed to have civilian casualties but this one has a generation of civilians being starved of information and experience critical for them to grow."</p>
