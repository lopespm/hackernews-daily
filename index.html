								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will share my solution:If I have something that spies 24/7 in my home or around me I throw it in the recycle bin.No more tech talk, implementation talk on closed software and dark pattern designed products by any company.Apple is using its market leader in &#34;user convenience&#34; position to normalize on device user behavior analysis and data processing and active policing. This is madness.I expect police and three letter agencies to use their own hacking tools and budget. I will not pay the bill on a multiple levels to be monitored and classified. Yes you can vote with your wallet as first reaction, as second you can push your representatives for political and legislative reaction.Imagine this news in 2010. For sure some Apple stores will be burned down to the ground.But make no mistake:
If you don&#39;t buy products created from the get go to snoop around and extract your data, you will have more privacy.The only way into the future for people who want peace of mind is not to buy into 
smart home, smart appliances, smart cars and smart surveillance. Period.They are called smart for a reason. Because we are becoming stupider.Start self-hosting and local backups, there are tech savvy people who are moving away from surveillance state and building more private and sustainable future for themselves.Apple is the big writing on the wall. They act as political entity now, the users are their voters and as a classic politics move they are selling the audience to the highest bidder.Checks and balances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem here is similar to what happens with the War on Terror.1) It is noted that governments could, in theory, be spying on everything. Widely dismissed as silly.2) There is a trigger event (eg, 9/11). Inside government, a standard slips. They start spying on everything.3) Years later it becomes public knowledge. It is too hard to monitor what is going on now though, so it is difficult to tell who specifically should be outraged about what.4) The situation persists because it is convenient to the people in charge.5) (TBD) It gets turned on political dissidents. I&#39;m expecting everyone will agree on this point in 5 or so years, at the moment that is probably maybe more a partisan observation.Apple&#39;s partnering up will follow the same pattern. There just isn&#39;t enough transparency about what closed source software does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s an interesting thought experiment for anyone who disagrees that the proposed system is problematic.Let&#39;s say the police installs a new device in your house. This device could be capable of seeing or hearing anything that happens in your entire home. However, the police claim that the device is only watching a specific door in your house and forwarding encrypted low resolution photos to their servers &#34;just in case&#34; some criteria is met and they need to take a look. Nevermind that it would only take a policy change and an OTA update that you have no visibility into, or chance of blocking, before it&#39;s watching your entire house in real-time and sending practically anything to their servers. After all, they did release a carefully worded statement regarding what the device supposedly does.But hey, you have several other doors to enter or exit your house from so what&#39;s the big deal right? You could seal that door and never be subjected to the system _as advertised_.Would you trust the police in that scenario, regardless of whether you have anything to hide?"</p>

Nothing wrong with people having tattoos everywhere, green or violet hair, non conformist clothing and views. Let them be, let them express and find themselves.I am the shave every day suit kinda guy and will remain so, but if someone chooses to be different or wants to complain about new woke culture values , fine by me.There&#39;s not more or less trans and gay people these days, they are just more visible and have a voice, as they won&#39;t be burned at a stake anymore, metaphorically speaking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some weird random anecdote about Back Orifice 2000 (BO2k) that nobody asked for:We were goofing around in high school with this. Putting it on computers in school and messing around. We sent it over to a classmate. Her father was teachter and we figured she might open it on their home PC. (we were 14 at the time, by the way).Anyway, we made a fake hotmail address in the name of another classmate. These two people didn&#39;t share any classes and were not in eachother little social circle. We sent a couple of emails back and forth pretending to be the other guy but lost interest along the way and nothing happend.Now for the strange part; forward 18 years or so. I&#39;m in the city, I run into the person who we were sending the messages to... with the person who we were pretending to be. Married and 3 children together.I&#39;d like to think we brought them together in some strange way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man, yeah also adding to the list of people that abused their highschool computer labs with this.  We had so much fun, but we eventually drew the ire of the school IT admin.  After class one day the teacher took us aside with the admin and asked if we had installed BO on the computers, which we of course denied... they &#34;believed&#34; us, heh, but gave us a stern warning that whoever was doing it should stop.  We would have all probably ended up with felony charges these days.The next year, so 1999, we actually got approval to attempt to change our grades as an exercise.  We actually managed to do it by sneakily copying a floppy one of the teachers used to store their grades with a program called Integrade. We took it home, reverse engineered the password protection to disable it, changed our grades on the copy, re-enable the password protection with the original password, and turned that in as our proof. Our teacher was impressed and super sketched out/nervous at the same time. I guess they never considered we&#39;d succeed and get access to the whole class&#39;s grades..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi party people, this is Sir Dystic, author of the original 1998 Back Orifice.  Great to hear all of you reminiscing about my software!One thing that I did not predict when I released BO:  The distribution ZIP contained three files, a readme.txt, the BO server and the BO client.  In retrospect, the BO server should probably not have been distributed with the original .EXE extension as a LARGE portion of people apparently downloaded the ZIP, unzipped it and just double clicked on the BO server, immediately infecting themselves.Keep disturbing shit please...--oo] ooM [oo--.."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Microsoft declined to comment specifically on Bill’s research, but said customers can block the overwhelming majority of account takeover efforts by enabling multi-factor authentication.Or, of course, by not reusing passwords everywhere. ISPs can help by turning on some sort of brute force protection on SMTP and IMAP. They can also help by checking for completely obvious passwords (yes, by brute force cracking with a short list). Which brings us to this:&gt;But you also know they are accessing their email exclusively through an email client. What do you do? You can’t flag their account for a password reset, because there’s no mechanism in the email client to affect a password change.”If only there was some way to communicate with a email customer..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can we talk about who &#34;Bill&#34; (the source for the article) is ?If we read between the lines, it appears that someone sitting at a fairly large Internet choke point is grepping the flow of mail traffic for keywords (for lack of better terms since it&#39;s not literally grep).Presumably someone placed highly enough that they can do such analysis without management oversight ?Or are there compliance and security reasons to &#34;grep&#34; IMAP traffic for certain things and he just added some other keywords ?Where, in 2021, would a network admin own this much traffic and have this little oversight ?-----EDIT: ... and now that I think about it, wouldn&#39;t this be fairly easy to suss out ?  The source states:&#34;So I’m seeing this traffic to just like 10 net blocks tied to Microsoft, which means I’m only looking at maybe 25 percent of Microsoft’s infrastructure,&#34;I have neither the time nor the inclination but if there is an ISP out there that is routing 25% of MS mail infrastructure, all I have to do is look at mail routes to MS for a few days and run some traceroutes and I could probably make some guesses as to which network &#34;Bill&#34; works for ..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ive been using Podman for a while for my non-Kubernetes cloud deployments (i.e. small VM based things).It&#39;s worked very well for me after a few initial hiccups a year or so ago.Now that Podman-compose[0] is in the works, it&#39;ll really be comparable in the UX space soon, and outperforms Docker in several ways when it comes to security.The key difference with Podman compared to Docker is that is does not run a deamon as root, like Docker does, thus all containers are created with the privilege level of the user who created it.This can be a learning curve for those used to Docker as privileges (e.g. for filesystems, files) and capabilities (e.g. for devices,  low level networking) need to be handled more explicitly as opposed to Docker&#39;s approach of &#34;simon (root) says&#34;.Additionally, Podman is very light weight due to the lack of a daemon since there is no service or supporting software which needs to run beyond the capabilities baked into Linux.[0] https://github.com/containers/podman-composeEDIT TO ADD: I run Linux both on desktop and server so I have no data for usage in Windows/Mac. Docker Desktop, as I understand it, is a Linux VM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see all comments here and I’m wondering if anybody actually read TFA.This is NOT a drop-in replacement on Mac, very far from it.No volumes mount from the host, no auto port forward, complications when building images, bugs where the socket isn’t cleared etc.They will get there eventually but this is way over hyped for a sensible replacement for docker on Mac."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it is obviously not unrelated to the pandemic chaos, there is a deeper issue.  As Nassim Taleb has often pointed out, the same things that make a system &#34;efficient&#34; also can often be viewed as making it fragile.  &#34;Just-in-time&#34; means &#34;no buffer&#34;.  We have, for decades, been doing as much as possible to make all our economic systems as efficient as possible, which is to say with no extra capacity.Thus, if it had not been the pandemic, it would eventually have been something else.  Sooner or later, there is always a shock to the system.  If you have made sure that every step in a long complex chain is optimized to have very little slack, the thing you have optimized for is fragility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Old article May 5th of this year, which in that industry is a long time. 
Nevertheless the situation since did actually get worse as predicted. Not only is it chip shortage we should call it component shortage. A standard 10k 0406 package resistor is sold out around the world. Many high quality, high density capacitor you can&#39;t get. The same goes for the standard semiconductor parts like diodes, MOSFET or TVS. 
Semiconductor sales rep give you now +50 weeks lead time for the many ICs meaning no real forecast at this point. 
They generally tell you 2022 will be tough maybe Q4 will ease up.Many of the major semi companies are running at fairly high capacity, but supporting elements like IC package build capacity, sometimes materials can&#39;t keep up as well.We looked at some boards to redesign, but when you are short hundreds of parts it gets nearly insurmountable to manage a hardware redesign. Interesting and challenging allocation period, definitely worse than 2003-2005."</p>

Looking at the strings output, we can see some interesting string references, including auth_admin_ssh_special and auth_admin_internal. Searching for auth_admin_internal finds the sub_13DBEC function. This function has a strcmp call that is not present in the 6.3.0r19b firmware:

  The argument to the strcmp call is &lt;&lt;&lt; %s(un=&#39;%s&#39;) = %u, which is the backdoor password, and was presumably chosen so that it would be mistaken for one of the many other debug format strings in the code. This password allows an attacker to bypass authentication through SSH and Telnet.

The hackers altered the algorithm so they could decipher encrypted data flowing through the virtual private network connections created by NetScreen devices. They returned in 2014 and added a separate backdoor that allowed them to directly access NetScreen products, according to the people and the document.Can we have more technical details regarding this?

There&#39;s something really weird about the contemporary Australian culture that&#39;s seems to be permitting increasingly authoritarian governance.If think if you asked my grandparents what defined &#39;being Australian&#39; it would be been belief in freedom, mateship and irreverence of authority."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m unsurprised this is occurring in Australia.  Australia has for a long time now been pursuing policies which seem on their face to feel more at home in China.  I suspect for most Australians though, they&#39;ll just go along with this and there will be a greater proportion of tech-savvy people who find a way to dodge this and exclusively connect via VPN.It&#39;s becoming more and more commonplace for people outside the US to connect to the Internet exclusively via a VPN egress in the US, creating &#34;US-based&#34; online accounts, and operating online as if they were a US person.  It seems in the future this may be necessary just to experience the Internet with even basic expectations of free access and anonymity.As long as they continue to play ball geopolitically with the rest of the West, nobody is going to call them out, but the last decade in Australia has seen a significant curtailing of human rights.  The most surprising thing is that it seems few people are speaking out about it, generally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if the legislation they passed within 24 hours allowing police to read/delete/edit social media posts of anybody without warrants is related to the australian truckers blocking off major highways in the past couple of days.Australia is more and more like China every day.

Shlinkedin is definitely a bizarre passion of mine so it’s awesome to see it resonate - turns out a lot of people find a lot LinkedIn ridiculous :)This has also been a good excuse to learn Elixir/ Liveview. I’ve made all the code open source if anyone wants to take a look!https://github.com/cbh123/shlinked"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personally I found most of those examples to be not great. I think they would be improved better names overall, more well named private methods and most importantly well structured companion test classes proving the behavior.I really dont want to read another developers comments on their mental state while I am feverishly debugging their code during a 3am page.The number of times I have been misled by an outdated comment. I generally open git blame to see if the comments predate any code now. Tests on the other hand almost never lie.Readmes or comments explaining why something exists vs what it allegedly does are generally much better. If you can’t write expressive code why would you assume your English is much better?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Speaking of source code comments, antirez (of Redis fame) wrote a fantastic article[0] about that topic some time ago and I still recommend it to colleagues whenever they make the hollow statement that &#34;code should and can be intelligible on its own, without any comments&#34;.[0]: https://web.archive.org/web/20210226004600/http://antirez.co... (I still don&#39;t understand why he deleted his blog)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the first example with conditions, I much prefer rolling the &#34;why&#34; of the comments into boolean variable names where possible e.g.   // We still have burst budget for *all* tokens requests.
   if self.one_time_burst &gt;= tokens {
      ...
   } else {
      // We still have burst budget for *some* of the tokens requests.

becomes something like   (I&#39;m   missing context   but you get the idea):   enoughBudgetForAllTokenRequests = self.one_time_burst &gt;= tokens

   if enoughBudgetForAllTokenRequests
      ...
   else
      ...

I don&#39;t see this often though. I see the commenting pattern a lot where the comment usually duplicates the &#34;what&#34; of the conditional code, and it&#39;s often ambiguous if the comment is talking about the condition or a whole branch.I think a descriptive variable makes the code easier to skim, it&#39;s more precise and less likely to become inaccurate. For a big complex conditional, you can break in up into several well-named boolean variables you compose together (but obviously comment the bits that can&#39;t be covered by a concise variable name)."</p>
