								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This resonates with my own experience tremendously. I&#39;ve blogged for ten years - opportunities have come out of it. I&#39;ve worked on OSS for ten years - opportunities have come out of it. Most of the time I was doing both I felt like I was doing something inconsequential that only meant something to me. That was incorrect. Reliably putting work out there and collaborating with other humans makes things happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s true, I can attest! The idea of “increasing your luck surface area” is real.You can create a lot of opportunities for yourself by being public about what you’re up to.It got me a job working with Taylor Otwell, before his businesses took off, and now working at Fly to help with Laravel adoption.My side projects have made helped people learn, given me an audience, and earn extra income."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got my first paid work writing software because I got lucky on GitHub.Back in college, I simply commented on a peer&#39;s issue made for a local hackathon. He was confused about what direction to take for a webapp, and didn&#39;t have any experience in any frameworks. I just suggested Rails, and gave a few highlights for it and pointed him towards some starter guides.Within a couple hours a well connected student (I believe he ran the CS club) saw my comment, and forwarded it to an alumni who was doing local Rails work.I actually didn&#39;t have any experience in Rails beyond the tutorials of the day, and I made that clear. But he liked the look of my GitHub and was happy to give me the job.It was pretty good money for a college student. I recall not really knowing what to expect hourly wise, and when he brought up payment I wasn&#39;t able to give an answer so he immediately said 50/hr. To me, I was truly expecting like half of that. I tried to keep cool as I accepted.  My pricing mindset was definitely anchored by waiting tables, where 50/hr is something you might get if you got a really lucky shift and required busting ass. So to get that much for _sitting down_? Oh boy.After settling on the price, he stepped out of the room for a bit. This was a shared co-working space, and I recall looking over to the guy next to us (who I could tell was paying some attention to our conversation) and saying I did not expect that much money. He happened to work for Uber - and he agreed that I got a very good deal. Not sure why I remember that detail.Anyway: yes, working in public, and even being helpful in public, certainly can pay dividends."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The drastic move to organic farming is puzzling.Any level headed person, forget a politician, would want to experiment first, see the results, gauge and then expand selectively. That is common sense.I guess when you are a dictator ish government and you rule the country with an iron first, the institutions of the state stop being anything and simply become rubber stamps.This also underlines the importance of self sufficiency in necessities. A country ought to feed its people, provide basic services like power and medical facilities on its own, without depending on imports."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; But the most boneheaded, bizarre mistake that the Sri Lankan government made was a disastrous plan to shift the entire country to organic agriculture. In April of 2021 the government banned the import and use of pesticides and synthetic fertilizers. This devastated Sri Lankan agriculture, since, as it turns out, fertilizer is really really important. Production of tea — Sri Lanka’s main cash crop — fell by 18% in a year. Production of rice — the main food crop — fell by even more.From https://foreignpolicy.com/2022/03/05/sri-lanka-organic-farmi... :&gt; By 2020, the total cost of fertilizer imports and subsidies was close to $500 million each year. With fertilizer prices rising, the tab was likely to increase further in 2021. Banning synthetic fertilizers seemingly allowed Rajapaksa to kill two birds with one stone: improving the nation’s foreign exchange situation while also cutting a massive expenditure on subsidies from the pandemic-hit public budget.&gt; But when it comes to agricultural practices and yields, there is no free lunch. Agricultural inputs—chemicals, nutrients, land, labor, and irrigation—bear a critical relationship to agricultural output. From the moment the plan was announced, agronomists in Sri Lanka and around the world warned that agricultural yields would fall substantially. The government claimed it would increase the production of manure and other organic fertilizers in place of imported synthetic fertilizers. But there was no conceivable way the nation could produce enough fertilizer domestically to make up for the shortfall.You don&#39;t get anything &#34;for free&#34;, and cutting supports like this will inevitably doom a sputtering economy, when the actual solution was almost certainly more government spending, not less.The US is actually lucky to understand this at the deepest levels of policy and law making, with massive aid packages to prevent total collapse. Even Europe tried harsh austerity in the wake of 2008, and the fad lasted way too long there.The Sri Lankan leader&#39;s hostile attitude towards the Sri Lankan population is what made protesters storm the leader&#39;s home."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first part of the article about how Sri Lanka would get foreign currency 
(swap, export or borrow) almost completely ignores the well documented devastation of the tourist industry, where people bring euros or dollars, due to covid19 and shutdowns of travel.Yes I suppose it falls into the category of swap, because people bring euros and exchange them for local currency to buy local goods and services. But it was a big part of the &#34;swap&#34; that vanished for 2+ years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the idea of searching a curated list of domains, but I&#39;m not sure that doing the curation yourself is the best approach considering the huge number of useful but niche websites in existence.I wonder if simply parsing all of Wikipedia (dumps are available, and so are parsers capable of handling them) and building a list of all domains used in external links would do the trick. Wikipedia already has substantial quality control mechanisms, and the resulting list should be essentially free of blog spam and other low-quality content. Wikipedia also maintains &#34;official website&#34; links for many topics, which can be obtained by parsing the infobox from the article."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Somewhere I read a quote from some cranky business analyst complaining about how the low prices, quality products and high wages impact profits. &#34;It&#39;s better to be a Costco customer or Costco employee than it is to be a Costco shareholder.&#34;To which I responded &#34;That sounds like a well run company!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 2005 my wife and I lived in a part of the USA that had no Costco within a half day&#39;s drive.  We soon secured jobs in a part of the USA that had two (two!) Costcos in the same city that we would live.  True story - before we even looked for housing, I went online and joined Costco.  Years later my diabetic cat even had a Costco pharmacy account (best place to buy insulin by far) and received a discount for being without health insurance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related to the story&#39;s underlying topic, as an immigrant I find significant attitudinal/philosophical differences in how I regard saving money and spending money versus, for example, my American coworkers and friends, especially younger ones who grew up around relatively well-off families.  Maybe the affection for Costco embodies that.   I&#39;m sure I sound like an old fart for saying this, like &#34;those younguns don&#39;t know the value of a dollar any more&#34;.By comparison at least, they are much freer with their money and don&#39;t have the same baggage about it.   An example especially apparent for me is their willingness to spend on clothing, where I just can&#39;t bring myself to do it.  Maybe just not having been brought up around parents who were ever dressed that nice, or allowed me and siblings to be.   Or for example, their lack of concern about overpaying for small things, which yes in the bigger picture, who cares if you&#39;re overcharged for a drink once in a while?I suppose it&#39;s because the information or concern about not having money was already passed down or imposed on me as a lesson early in life (whether intentionally or not).  Sometimes I view it as an advantage as I see that my friends (those spending freely) will encounter those lessons when they get married, have kids, etc. and need to save.   On the other hand, I wonder if I&#39;m just handicapping myself with that baggage and not allowing myself to enjoy the freedom that a good income now brings, and living too  much in the restraints of my family&#39;s past..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that is missing from this simulation is that (at least some) ant species walk straight back to their nest once they found some food. They do this (as far as we know) by accumulating each step they take into what is called the &#34;home vector&#34;, effectively integrating the whole path they took. That way they always know which way is &#34;back to the nest&#34;. There is a vast amount of papers on the topic. Some (personal) highlights:If you put the ants on stilts they will follow the same home vector, but because each step on stilts is effectively longer they will overshoot the target: https://www.researchgate.net/figure/Fig4-Odometry-by-stride-...If the ant is placed close to the nest after gathering food, it will still follow its home vector ... away from the nest: https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/abs/10.1098/rspb.2004...Crazy little buggers these ants."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very nice! There&#39;s a long history of this kind of simulation, going back to Alan Turing (or before). I used to work doing this kind of thing in the 90s, as part of the Artificial Life community. There&#39;s a lot of papers from back then if you&#39;re looking for other ideas for agent based simulations or complex systems. For that matter the ALife community itself still exists."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think I can count the number of kernel changes I&#39;ve submitted on one hand, but I work on core virtualization that involves a lot of pretending to be hardware and (these days) a lot of poking directly at hardware registers.I would say James Mickens sums things up nicely in &#34;The Night Watch[0].&#34; For example, you mention debugging with logs and metrics -- this snippet came to mind:     “Yeah, that sounds bad. Have you checked the log files for
     errors?” I said, “Indeed, I would do that if I hadn’t broken every
     component that a logging system needs to log data. I have a
     network file system, and I have broken the network, and I have
     broken the file system, and my machines crash when I make
     eye contact with them. I HAVE NO TOOLS BECAUSE I’VE
     DESTROYED MY TOOLS WITH MY TOOLS. My only logging
     option is to hire monks to transcribe the subjective experience
     of watching my machines die as I weep tears of blood.”

Mind you, I absolutely _love_ working on low-level stuff, and I wouldn&#39;t trade the time I get to spend actually doing that for anything. That said, the complexity of modern operating systems, CPU architectures, interconnects, and peripherals creates opportunities for frustration and confusion that honor no bounds of reasonability or decency.[0]: https://www.usenix.org/system/files/1311_05-08_mickens.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in the kernel team many moons ago helping improve the performance and then built the .net clr later. Also worked on a NT Filesystem called Cairo. So I guess I have experienced both kernel dev and backend framework dev.Kernel code is amazing, especially the parts written by the early members like DaveC, MarkZ and others.For me the biggest part was working with a group of extremely smart people who were very nearly the best programmers in the world.I really miss that outside of Microsoft. I would imagine that you can get the same experience if you worked with the Linux kernel dev team or some of the other few places in the world like FAMGA where you can work.My suggestion is to go for it. 
After leaving MS I found peace by working with the open source community and open source software.Hope that helps, happy to discuss further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If MS or any FAANG wants to hire you for a kernel dev position, go for it; they clearly see a lot of potential in you that maybe you don&#39;t see yourself. I want to point out a couple of things that you should be prepared for:&gt; 2. Debugging exclusively via metrics and logs, since I can&#39;t just attach a debugger to a running server.You often can&#39;t do this in kernel/OS development work either. Serial printf logging is often required. It can be a real &#34;my tools to debug my tools are broken&#34; slog.&gt; 3. Designing systems in general. Some people love the challenge of distributed transactions, eventual consistency and all that jazz, but it just rubs my brain the wrong way. I&#39;m not interested at all in that problem space [1].I&#39;m not sure I understand this issue. I mean, kernels have subsystems for doing stuff; you might need to design one someday? But it won&#39;t be dull-as-dishwater web technology stacks, it&#39;ll be you writing data structures directly in C/C++ or Rust if MS goes there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The full quote for context:&gt; Ferrari and some of the other high-end car manufacturers still use clay and carving knives. It’s a very small portion of the gaming industry that works that way, and some of these people are my favourite people in the world to fight with – they’re the most beautiful and pure, brilliant people. They’re also some of the biggest fucking idiots.Their CEO is certainly not calling everyone an idiot, just that there are some in that group of people. And personally, I greatly prefer this sort of frank talk to run-of-the-mill generic PR speak that usually comes from CEO interviews.The next thing he says in the interview:&gt; I’ve been in the gaming industry longer than most anybody – getting to the grey hair and all that. It used to be the case that developers would throw their game over the wall to the publicist and sales force with literally no interaction beforehand. That model is baked into the philosophy of a lot of artforms and medium, and it’s one I am deeply respectful of; I know their dedication and care."</p>

Although if I try to take a step back I suppose this term could be used to describe any game and not just one of the lootbox-mania or idle games.However, the wikipedia article [1] states:&gt; A core or compulsion loop is any repetitive gameplay cycle that is designed to keep the player engaged with the game. ...  A compulsion loop may be distinguished further from a core loop; while many games have a core loop of activities that a player may repeat over and over again, such as combat within a role-playing game, a compulsion loop is particularly designed to guide the player into anticipation for the potential reward from specific activitiesFor some reason, all I can think of is that game from ST:TNG [2].  I&#39;d like to say that I am somehow above it all but back when I used to play FPS games, it was probably just the same thing.

This is steel manufactured before 1945 that is uncontaminated by radionuclides:https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Low-background_steelThere will soon be a market for pre-microtransactions games.Also: I used to hate on the casino industry for using the term “gaming” to euphemistically refer to gambling, but now they’re not so different so I’ll let them have that one."</p>
