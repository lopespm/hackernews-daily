								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had been putting off quantum physics and time was running out. I was worried forth semester physics at MIT was going to be tough, but then through some miracle of providence the EE department decided that a solid state chemistry chemistry class plus Into to Biology could be substituted for quantum physics.Because I had already taken a solid state chemistry class, all I had to do was take a basic introductory biology class; how difficult could that be? It turns out that biology is hard, very hard.The other students that filled the large lecture hall weren’t ordinary first year students; they were pre-med students. Instead of relaxing by the swimming pool reading a colorful text with pictures of jelly fish and beetles, it felt more like I was taking swim lessons with a few hundred sharks.The lectures by Professor Luria were great (he had won the Nobel prize four years before) but the number of facts seemed impossible to remember. My fellow students were writing down literally every word written or uttered during each lecture. There wasn’t any mention of jelly fish or bugs or pea plants, but there were complex diagrams depicting even more complex biochemical pathways. I was accustomed to math classes and engineering classes and computer science classes. Biology was very different, more facts and less study of how to apply fundamental principles to prove some theorem or solve some engineering problem.I survived the Biology class, but it would have been a lot easier for me to take the physics class."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"During the first part of the pandemic I watched the lectures for the Introductory Biology course [1] from MIT OpenCourseWare. I cannot recommend those highly enough!Almost every lecture brought up and highlighted something really cool and fascinating. Like how RNA sequencing over the last couple of years has gone from expensive to almost free, and what its uses are. Or time-lapse of bacteria adapting to antibiotics. Or just the first lecture showing a video of someone sticking a syringe into a cell. There were even some labs that could be done via a normal web browser.For me this was so much more engaging than the biology I was thought in high school, where we mostly learned things from outdated books.[1]: https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/7-016-introductory-biology-fall-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a large gap between the mechanisms of chemistry and the magic of biology that most people do not see closed until late in their education. It&#39;s a real shame that this gap cannot be closed sooner.In undergrad I took a bunch of biology and chemistry classes.  It wasn&#39;t until I took Biochemistry (a senior level class) that everything came together. The biochemistry class I took was a re-telling of all the stories you learned in molecular biology but with the tools you acquire in organic chemistry.Equipped with those tools I relearned the Krebs cycle and photosynthesis as real chemical reactions that make sense rather than a chain of facts to be memorized.The class left me with a deep and profound reverence for life.  Every process in a cell has a mechanism that can understood with chemistry. However, the magic of life exists where those processes come together and interact in incredibly complicated ways.It&#39;s seductive to think that we should be able to tease apart this complicated processes and figure out how &#34;life&#34; works, and maybe someday we will.  However, it&#39;s easy to underestimate the level of complexity and interconnectedness in these systems.Many of us understand how hard it can be to debug a distributed system. Imagine trying to reverse engineer a distributed system with tens of thousands of interconnected services and messaging queues that all just sort of evolved and were not built with clean engineering practices."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This problem seems endemic to big tech platforms, particularly when money is involved. I remember hearing similar stories about PayPal a decade ago (still do for what it’s worth).While I can understand the desire to not interact with a user of the platform (shopify, google, PayPal, etc), because of the cost, and because many are likely to be bots or actually fraudulent. It’s precisely at these edge cases when computers and automated performs the worst.These are the situations where the scenario is imperfectly modelled in the system. Maybe the engineers didn’t think of the edge case, or an ML model never had training data to cover it.Point is, it doesn’t matter. People problems need people solutions. Remediating edge cases involving people’s livelihoods strikes me as most likely a people problem.When you’re asking a person or company to trust them in a business relationship into the future, such as by being their shopfront, there’s only so many you can destroy before word gets around. I haven’t used or recommended businesses to use PayPal for a decade, because I saw them time and again inflict pain and financial stress with no recourse.As another example, look at the general sentiment around Google Cloud. Would you build a business on top of it? Does that include an exit strategy to multi-cloud, because you’re unsure if they’ll support the service you use?If you can’t scale to provide a human to help other humans caught in the edge cases of your own system, then you need to acknowledge you’re causing harm.A dog food company that kills a puppy every week, is really a puppy killing company that sells dog food.It’s a matter of perspective yes, but if you got into it to help feed dogs, surely the last thing you would want to do is harm them?And if you became aware your killing puppies, would it not be the top priority to ensure it never happens again?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shopify should be scrambling to do a public post-mortem right now. They &#34;Fixed&#34; the situation within a few hours of the tweetstorm, showing that they know they f&#39;d up. Shit happens - but how does shopify assuage small businesses that this won&#39;t happen to them next? A public apology, post-mortem and steps to make sure this never happens again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"WordPress / Magento / OpenCart + Stripe / Authorize.net / BrainTree / Paypal. Why use Shopify and depend on it? Host your own stuff for nearly free ($2-5) and pay very little for the payment gateways.Shopify charges additional 1% per transaction for 3rd party payment integrations.  Weird."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article says Musk agreed to buy Twitter mostly as a joke. I think there&#39;s a far better explanation. This wasn&#39;t a joke for Musk because after agreeing to buy Twitter he proceeded to sell billions of dollars&#39; worth of TSLA stock, supposedly to finance the purchase. Even for the richest man in the world that&#39;s not a joke.I think a better explanation is that Musk offered to buy Twitter as a cover for selling billions of dollars&#39; worth of TSLA.Look at this story: https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-sells-billions-of-dol...
The headline is: &#34;Elon Musk Sells $8.5 Billion of Tesla Shares After Deal to Buy Twitter&#34;Why does he need a cover? Because TSLA is way too overvalued. He has to know that it is overvalued. Tesla&#39;s market cap is double of Toyota, VW, Mercedes, BMW, GM, Honda, Ferrari and Volvo all combined! [1]. If you sell stock while knowing your company&#39;s stock is way too overvalued, you&#39;re fleecing unsophisticated investors. Pretending to buy Twitter provides a convenient cover.Musk pretended that TSLA valuation is reasonable. Musk even called out Gates for shorting TSLA stock [2]. If he didn&#39;t have a cover then Musk would look like a hypocrite for selling TSLA.In reality, both Musk and Gates sold TSLA, the only difference is that Musk sold stocks he owned, but Gates sold borrowed stocks. But Musk used buying Twitter as a cover, so he gets to pretend to be morally superior. Even though both men sold TSLA, according to Musk, Gates&#39; sales means that he isn&#39;t serious about climate change [3].[1] https://companiesmarketcap.com/automakers/largest-automakers...[2] https://nypost.com/2022/05/31/elon-musk-calls-out-bill-gates...[3] https://www.businessinsider.com/bill-gates-shorting-tesla-wo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So much noise here and ill-informed comments fail to give a broader understanding of  what&#39;s going on. Elon bought up Twitter shares early in the year for a reason, because he wanted more control over Twitter. He bought up so much Twitter shares that when it was announced via the SEC, Twitter offered a board seat under the clause that he wouldn&#39;t acquire too much % control over the company. He obliged, but then left when he realized he couldn&#39;t make the changes he desired at the company. Plus, people on the board at the time, specifically Dorsey, was nudging him to buy out the company as a whole. So he did, hastingly. That was an ill-informed decision and obviously a mistake made with respect to doing due-diligence. In hindsight, before the market crash that price may have made sense. But fast forward today with looming recession talk, it&#39;s pretty clear he realized it&#39;s overvalued (we know this from tweets about twitter deal being repriced). And so he needed an escape hatch, hence the issue with bots and the unverifiable mDAU was a great talking point. In fact, he may as well be right on the issue as Twitter doesn&#39;t want to reveal how they calculate it. What he&#39;s trying to do right now is pretty clearly force the board to give a better deal. He&#39;s not sold any stock and likely won&#39;t unless he&#39;s actually out for good. But given the amount of effort and thought he&#39;s put into it and making it clear that he should pay a lower price depending on the bot issue, I don&#39;t think there&#39;s much doubt he&#39;s not actually leaving Twitter. Whether the courts will force an acquisition at the current price however, is a looming question. My bet is they settle at a lower price."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not knowing anything about glyphosate, I went to the article before reading the comments. I’ll just put this here because it was clear the researchers wanted to be sure people see it. From the first paragraph of the article—&gt;&gt; In 2015, the International Agency for Research on Cancer determined that glyphosate is a “probable human carcinogen” (IARC, 2015). However, the European Food Safety Authority and the Joint Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Meeting on Pesticide Residues (EFSA 2015, FAO/WHO 2015) determined that glyphosate is unlikely to be a carcinogen. The US EPA concluded that “available data and weight-of-evidence clearly do not support the descriptors “carcinogenic to humans,” “likely to be carcinogenic to humans,” or “inadequate information to assess carcinogenic potential” (US EPA 2017a). Controversy and concern that the rising use of glyphosate may have adverse human-health effects exist (Myers et. al., 2016)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been in the field for many years and I see the EU on the forefront of public chemical safety, both in terms of legislation and enforcement.
ECHA is transparent about glyphosate [1]. It is not even labelled as CMR on REACH Annex III [2], and that&#39;s saying a lot.
If you follow the developments, you will find that there is no way to prove a chemical as &#34;safe&#34;. All it takes is one bloke on record to develop any health condition which can be linked to a chemical, and it will be scrutinized six ways to Sundays. Often leading to the introduction or decrease of an OEL, or a classification of this substance. As new humans are born all of the time, and diagnostics and analysis methods are still being improved, the likelihood of any given chemical to be &#34;harmless&#34; asymptotically approaches zero.
1 in 2 people develop cancer during their lives [3]. There are currently &gt; 23000 chemicals on the EEA market at &gt;= 1 t/a [4].1 https://echa.europa.eu/hot-topics/glyphosate

He said “there’s no reason” to come closer and predicted tragic outcomes for those who do, saying, “Such an approach is unreasonable, unnecessary, and unsafe, and should be made illegal.&#34;He is just happily excusing cops visiting &#34;tragic outcomes&#34; on people who get closer than 8 feet to cops. The lengths that people will go to too justify police just killing people is insane. How about we don&#39;t allow police to just wantonly murder or beat whoever they want?This same guy is an ex cop and &#34;sponsored legislation that would prohibit oversight boards of police departments unless those boards were two-thirds sworn police officers&#34; After the 2020 election he also said: &#34;&#34;Everybody shouldn’t be voting...Quantity is important, but we have to look at the quality of votes, as well.&#34;Seems like a really great guy that very much deserves to be in power /shttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Kavanagh_(Arizona_politic..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I was cop, I would certainly want to know that there is a physical boundary in law that bystanders cannot cross. For my own safety, and for theirs. I see nothing unreasonable about not allowing people to cross this boundary. The law does not prevent recording. It says you cannot record closer than 8ft. Why would somebody need to get closer than 8ft to an officer doing their job, when you have no involvement in the situation at hand? Adding more people to the situation simply increases the stress of all involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the early 2000s someone (drunkmenworkhere is what I remember) made a blog post generator that you could sign up for, add some names, some interests, and it would generate blog posts with Markov chains and some other magic. I signed up, not fully understanding how it worked, added some friends and family as names, played around with it, it wasn&#39;t what I thought it was and moved on. Meanwhile it kept generating entries about me and my family doing fantastic things.At some point my then ex-wife (we&#39;ve since reconciled) was google-stalking me and came across these entries. At some point they became outlandish enough that she contacted me to ask what was going on in my life. There was a very confused conversation where I had no idea what she was talking about and she was somewhat concerned about my health and safety. It wasn&#39;t until I talked to a relative and started googling myself with some specific terms that I came across the entries and was able to figure out what was happening. I emailed the individual running the project and asked to end the entries and if possible remove them from the internet to avoid further confusion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I first learned about Markov chains in the early &#39;00s, I found and hacked at a simple IRC bot, and deployed it to a number of rooms found in the mIRC defaults.  It would sit in each channel and learn, only replying when DM&#39;d.I did give the bot a few hard-coded replies, namely to &#34;ASL?&#34; with &#34;[random integer 20-30]/f/cali&#34; and &#34;pic?&#34; with a random link to images from Google Image search. Otherwise it would happily barf up random Markov walks from all of the other conversations without any consideration of context.In the span of one weekend at least five hundred unique users attempted to chat with it, some for hours on end. I only have a few logs left, but the conversations generally progressed from horny to irate or bizarre."</p>

Summary is they wanted lighter cars so accel/decel would require less power and the gas/brake system would be lighter/smaller.

That risk might seem slight today, but it would have been more of a concern in that era, years before Amtrak, when railroads were being required by their regulators (ICC and CPUC) to operate other unprofitable passenger services.As the posting concedes, “The pamphlet does not specify why only the wide gauge of five-feet-six inches was tested and not others.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; she used the Yamaha CS-80 as her main composition instrument. She seemed to favour it particularly for its touch-sensitivity, and it was one of the few synths that offered the feature at the time.This undersells the CS-80. It had polyphonic aftertouch, which most synths don&#39;t have today.Most have velocity sensitivity, meaning each note transmits how much initial force you applied. And most have aftertouch, meaning they transmit how much force you continue to apply after hitting bottom. But for most it&#39;s just channel aftertouch, meaning it transmits the aftertouch of the key you&#39;re pressing the hardest.The CS-80 transmitted aftertouch of each individual key, and had nice controls to to adjust how it used that information. A lot of synths can use polyphonic aftertouch but only a few new ones actually have poly-AT keyboards. The ones I know of are the Hydrasynth (out for a couple years now), the Behringer UB-Xa, and the Iridium keyboard (both introduced this year).Vangelis was also a huge CS-80 fan and used it on the Blade Runner soundtrack. Incidentally, a boutique synth that replicates the CS-80 pretty well (without keyboard) is the Deckard&#39;s Dream. It&#39;s $4000 but that&#39;s way less than a vintage CS-80."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone already probably knows this, but if you search &lt;Song Name&gt; acapella or &lt;song name&gt; isolated vocals on youtube you can get the vocals to songs you want to cover. Sometimes its the original isolated, but sometimes its just someone singing it. I&#39;ve been having a lot of fun with Reverbmachine&#39;s Legends bank and vocals from youtube. Eurythmics Sweet Dreams for example.On a tangent, when I was in prison my mom died, and Kate Bush was her favorite music. Also in prison as a coping mechanism I created my own superstition that music on the radio was a message for me (I know it isn&#39;t but I needed a way to just get a little space to breath). Like Tom Petty meant the the day was going to turn out ok. So I programmed myself to be super receptive to Kate Bush being popular again and it&#39;s been amazing for my mood and productivity. Programming little positive things into my makeup has been really important in getting through stuff, be it addiction or just day to day difficulties."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This brings me back to when I worked on Excel. The formatting structs (and most cell related ones) are so tightly packed and the byte code VM for the formulas is pretty neat.I wish I could have met duanec, that guy wrote probably 10% of the code for Excel. Sadly he had retired 2 years before I started working on Excel.Fun fact: when they were about to ship Excel 1.0, they didn’t know what to name it then so they had an internal poll. The name that garnered the most votes was “Mr Spreadsheet”. Needless to say, marketing vetoed it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re interested in multi-dimensional calculation engines I can also highly recommend this documentary: https://tm1.film/Companies like Amazon are still using TM1 for their forecasting. We&#39;re trying to build a 21st century version at https://causal.app"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work as a consultant and spend five out of eight hours a day in Excel, and I want the features in this app so bad.Sadly, the only way I’ll be able to use these features is if Microsoft bought them out and integrated them into Excel. It’s ubiquitous at almost every workplace you go to, but the only innovation of the past 20 years seems to be PQ (which is awesome), and xlookup."</p>
