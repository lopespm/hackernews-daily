Django, Flask, and even FastAPI are master classes in how to build great open source projects that will survive the test of time. In my opinion they&#39;re a huge reason why Python continues to be a popular language for backend development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My mind works best with examples, I was about to ask here when I stumbled upon it on the TLA site [0].The example starts out with a simple piece of code that exposes a bug, then the bug gets fixed and the following question is asked:&gt; Does the issue go away because we’ve solved it, or because we’ve made it rarer? Without being able to explore the actual consequences of the designs, we can’t guarantee we’ve solved anything&gt; The purpose of TLA+, then, is to programmatically explore these design issues. We want to give the tooling a system and a requirements and it can tell us whether or not we can break the requirement. If it can, then we know to change our design. If it can’t, we can be more confident that we’re correct.[0]: https://www.learntla.com/intro/conceptual-overview.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if it&#39;s possible to model how fucked up the Golang concurrency model is with TLA+?As a TLA non-SME I couldn&#39;t say, but would definitely find it useful and probably impressive.  Maybe Brad Fitzpatrick could team up with Aphyr and use it to make golang v2 a bit less crap.Note: I write this with love, as someone who&#39;s written hundreds of thousands of lines of Go, and am now turned off and afraid of the behavior at the sketchy edge boundaries. I&#39;ve now shifted to learning Rust, albeit slowly and finding it saddeningly challenging compared to what I can pump out with the Go.For reference, see &#34;Data Race Patterns in Go&#34;, posted 21 days ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31698503"</p>

You have a link down the bottom of the page, if I scroll to the bottom of the page (with space or down key or page down), it would be nice that it gets to the bottom, and then goes to the next page on the next keydown event.We implemented this in medical software for reading patient documents at one of my last jobs, and it&#39;s a feature I wish more sites that were focused on reading material had (docs, book replacements, etc.)Edit: just want to point out this is in no way a critique of this site specifically, so maybe off topic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Netherlands will be especially impacted by this. We refused actual legalization for many reasons, many of which will be invalidated by Germany decriminalizing. Our current stance on weed is so confusing that it&#39;s hard to explain to any foreigner, but strictly speaking weed isn&#39;t legal and not even decriminalized... But yes, Amsterdam is in The Netherlands."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the legalization of cannabis in Europe has a lot of potential. I just wish that we would take measures to avoid the ever increasing levels of THC dosage in weed to insane levels, like you see in the US or California specifically. I firmly believe that cannabis can do a lot of good, but the poison is in the dosage. It has been shown in the past that increasing THC while decreasing CBD leads to an increase in negative side effects, some being permanent [1].Let&#39;s see how it&#39;ll work out. I also think it&#39;s quite funny that the German meme &#34;Bubatz&#34; has made it into the highest levels of our government.[1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6312155/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In South Africa Cannabis has been legal for personal use in &#34;places where you have an expectation of privacy&#34; (but selling is still illegal) for several years now. So far the world has not ended, the country doesn&#39;t sit around stoned all day and we&#39;re not all hooked on Heroin.There&#39;s talk of introducing legislation to restrict quantities (government has plenty of securicrat control freaks), but since that violates the very principles which underpinned the Constitutional Court&#39;s overturning the legislation that made weed illegal in the first place, I can&#39;t see it going very far."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Commonwealth Fusion Systems | Wide Assortment of Roles | Remote &amp; Onsite (Cambridge MA, Devens MA) | https://cfs.energy/Decades of worldwide, government-sponsored research in fusion science have established the tokamak-based configuration as the leading approach to confining fusion-grade plasmas with strong magnetic fields. Yet, in the past, even state-of-the art superconducting magnet technology required tokamaks to be enormous to produce net fusion energy. Recently, a new high temperature superconductor has reached industrial maturity. CFS is using these high temperature superconductors to build smaller and lower-cost tokamak fusion systems. CFS will build first-of-its-kind high temperature superconducting magnets, followed by the world’s first net energy-producing fusion machine, called SPARC. SPARC will pave the way for the first commercially viable fusion power plant, called ARC. CFS is assembling a world-class team working to design and build fusion machines that will provide limitless, clean, fusion energy to combat climate change.Check out our open roles here: https://jobs.lever.co/cfsenergy"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;You&#39;d be surprised how many people get turned off by seeing something that other people tell them is simple, and then it&#39;s not simple to them.&#34;This. This should be every platform/infrastructure engineer&#39;s motto. Don&#39;t tell me your DSL is simple. Don&#39;t tell me that Puppet is so simple because oh my god, it uses Ruby. Don&#39;t tell me that HCL or terraform or whatever yaml crap is so simple because &#34;they are in yaml&#34;. No. They are not.Don&#39;t. Make. Me. Learn. It&#39;s not because I don&#39;t want to learn. It&#39;s because I want to learn fundamentals instead of your specific, non-generalizable, 6-month-or-less half-life stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate the trend of documenting by giving only examples and tutorials.Examples are nice to get started, but completely useless otherwise. Please just give me a list of possible parameters/properties with their meaning, type and possible values.For example, the Kubernetes documentation is a nightmare to me because it&#39;s not a real documentation, just a bunch of examples. Not only it is very inefficient to look for a very specific piece of information in that, but if my case happens not to be in it (which is most of the time) I can waste hours looking everywhere to finally learn that there is actually a x.y[0].z key that does exactly what I need.Other example: Github actions. If you look hard enough, you may find something close to a yaml specification, but it&#39;s quite hidden, confusing and difficult to understand which property belongs to what. In contrast, CircleCI is extremely easy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this idea (for digitalocean) of &#34;documentation as marketing&#34;. Every time I read one of their articles, I feel like &#34;oh wow their engineers must really know what they&#39;re doing, to be able to explain this so clearly&#34;. I didn&#39;t know they had a team of professional editors... kudos!Another team that&#39;s really great at producing documentation is the Cloudflare retrospectives/postmortems folks, who can very clearly explain the cascading failures from complex systems.I wish more devs/engineers wrote like that!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The first thing I looked for was a comparison with the official Slack client in terms of performance, since that&#39;s the only reason why I&#39;d consider using this. Numbers for CPU load, memory use, time to perform certain actions, crashes. Doesn&#39;t seem to be anything available on the site regarding this, which is a shame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks nice, but if you plan to try it as you default Slack client be aware it  is lacking many features:-    Edit posted messages (big one, TBA)
-    Authentication w/ XOXC tokens
-    Loading older messages
-    Typing indicators
-    Starring &amp; Pinning things
-    Search
-    Sharing messages
-    Screensharing and Calls (aka Screenhero)
-    Joining and creating channels"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very important line from the FAQ:Q: Is this still developed?Yes, it is used and developed. Just not very actively. Most importantly Shrugs does not yet support “XOXC” tokens, which are often required by company Slack installations. We are interested in adding this feature, but there is no timeline yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Python logging module is one of the worst modules in the stdlib. You can see it’s Java inspiration all over it, as being one of the oldest modules it was created before anyone really knew what “pythonic” code was.Things I really dislike about it is the lack of “context”. Usually log messages are about something - often a request. You can’t attach a request ID or something else a nested set of function calls that log.The whole library is just really rubbish and has not aged well. There’s no standard way of outputting JSON logs, but there’s a built in way to spawn a socket server that allows the logging configuration to be updated remotely via a bespoke protocol? And everything is built mostly around logging to files.It also hits that perfect sweet spot of being both overly engineered and totally inflexible. I wanted to funnel our log messages to s3 via the “s3fs” module, which supports a “file like” object that gets written to s3. I had to hack around the various handlers to support this because it assumes it’s a “real” file.Hate it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another great project for Python logging is loguru:
https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.htmlOne of my favorite features of loguru is the ability to contextualize logging messages using a context manager.  with logger.contextualize(user_name=user_name):
    handle_request(...)

Within the context manager, all loguru logging messages include the contextual information. This is especially nice when used in combination with loguru&#39;s native JSON formatting support and a JSON-compatible log archiving system.One downside of loguru is that it doesn&#39;t include messages from Python&#39;s standard logging system, but it can be integrated as a logging handler for the standard logging system. At the company where I work we&#39;ve created a helper similar to Datadog&#39;s ddtrace-run executable to automatically set up these integrations and log message formatting with loguru"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mentioned this almost every time logging and python come up but one of my favorite feature is logging.exception: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logge.... It allows you to attach the whole exception with stack trace without having to explicitly used “as e” and then use traceback or embed the error in the message. Something like logger.exception(“Failed to connect.”) will print the message and the exception in one go."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Much of this is due to the reversal of the tight hiring market.For the past several years tech companies were desperate to hire because everyone was growing and the hiring market was tight. This inevitably results in companies loosening their hiring standards and retaining underperforming employees because they can&#39;t afford to reduce team sizes.Layoffs combined with hiring freezes (or slowdowns) signal real stress within a company. However, many of these layoffs are single-digit percentage layoffs from companies that are still hiring across the board. That&#39;s not so much a traditional layoff as a pruning of the workforce. That pruning wasn&#39;t happening as much when hiring was tight, but now that hiring is easier and real, actual layoffs have put more good candidates back onto the market, the companies who simply collected too many underperforming employees can afford to churn some of them back out of the company. Doing it as a &#34;layoff&#34; makes it more palatable than going on a firing spree.That said, when it comes to interviewing you shouldn&#39;t assume that a laid off employee was necessarily underperforming. A lot of companies don&#39;t really perform layoffs with surgical precision and will instead drop entire teams at once. I&#39;ve watched great engineers get swept up in minor staff reductions simply because they were assigned to bad managers or doomed teams that they couldn&#39;t save by themselves. I&#39;ve also hired great people who came right out of layoffs at other companies and I would have missed those resumes if I had been using dumb filtering rules like ignoring anyone who had been laid off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All this panic about tech layoffs seems a little premature given we haven’t even begun to see the impact of rates hikes on quarterly earnings yet. Many companies still have open recs and budgets to keep hiring.I work at a company that just laid off 18% of the workforce (Coinbase) including many people in engineering. The day this happened my email, LinkedIn, Twitter inboxes exploded with companies asking me if I knew of anyone looking for a job or if I myself had been impacted.I reached out to many of my former colleagues who had been impacted to see if they needed help. All had multiple interviews in flight and were not having trouble finding jobs.Aside from many crypto companies the inbound jobs were from many public and private companies and spanned many industries.I expect tech layoffs to get worse and the white collar job market to tighten towards the end of this year and 2023.I expect the main driver for this will be cost reduction at public and private companies in the lead up to earnings or quarterly reports. Main cost for a tech company obviously being labor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While there is still a open question about how much the sudden reversal of monetary policy from the last 15 years of &#34;hey! all the money can print&#34; that led to companies going into debt to purchase their own stock to &#34;oh crap, inflation, let&#39;s tighten the money supply&#34; affects the durability of companies...that said...There are some very hyperbolic people comparing this to the .COM crash and also to 2008/2009.In 2001, there was literally a site doing nothing but reporting in flamboyant terms all of the &#34;fucked companies&#34; going under. IIRC, it was dozens a day, at one point, with people stating that the Internet had failed, and it was all going down the drain.In 2008, absolutely no one had any clue what was going on but everyone knew it was catastrophically bad. People were trying to guess if it would be merely the worst recession ever or the second great depression.This so far seems like a fairly normal correction. We will see if Debt blows up and changes that."</p>
