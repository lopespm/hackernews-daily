								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to be against standardized tests, but I grew up as a low-income minority in a single-parent household and I ended up getting into good schools pretty much only due to my high test scores, which has been a life changer. Other than test scores, I couldn&#39;t afford to do any fancy extra-curriculars. It felt a lot more achievable to know I can change my life if I just focus and do well on a test than it would if I had to somehow do a bunch of random things to look competitive on paper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Definitely for the best. Standardized testing was pretty much the only reason I and many other working class folks I know could get into good schools -- I was never going to do a million side activities, and my summers were spent working, not building my academic resume.Of course the real tragedy is that we fixate so much on college, even prestigious ones, at all given how unnecessary they are for making people into productive and happy human beings. This change is significant but affects less than one percent of the population each year.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hated taking the SAT/ACT, but holy cow are we in the US in a better situation than Chinese students dealing with the Gaokao. A Chinese pen-pal once showed me some calculus problems from the Gaokao and the example I saw (a bunch of integrals) looked like a math test a sadist would create: long, complicated expressions just for the sake of complexity, &#34;ugly&#34; numbers that turned into messy fractions you have to carry around. I (a graduate engineering student at the time) couldn&#39;t identify any trick or educational point to the complexity, only the malice of the people giving the test.EDIT: wording"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is pretty clear why peoples interests in nuclear power has gone up. Natural gas prices have gone up and as a result the energy price that customers has to pay is swinging up and down based on supply and demand. It the same story as in many other places in the world. Nuclear represent a stable price of energy that doesn&#39;t get impacted by changing fossil fuel prices, and while the initial capital cost is high, stability and freedom from fossil fuels has their benefits. Especially since fossil fuel and wars tend to be associated with each other. It is a bit indicative of the global age we live in that a war between Russia and Ukraine is dictating what a Japanese citizen is paying for electricity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Title is misleading and I think many commenters are missing the point. This is support for *restarting existing reactors* and not really a support for nuclear in general. This may lead to the latter, but it is very different turning on reactors that already exist (meaning some danger already exists) compared to creating more.Proposed title change:&gt; Majority in Japan backs restarting existing nuclear reactors"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was a time during the first shut down when my company decided to reduce peoples hours and also reduce their salaries instead of laying off more employees. I end up working 20 hours a week (instead of my normal 35) with a reduced salary (and I was even able to collect partial California unemployment benefits for the remainder of the reduced hours under a special program called Workshare).Honestly it was amazing - made me really want to find a job that was less pay but also that low in hours. Working less than 40 is nice but once you get down to 20 you have whole DAYS where you can do whatever you want. You sometimes start work at noon or end at noon and then have the remainder of your weekday to yourself or in the company of others. It was an odd experience seeing my neighbours and friends going through so much stress and pandemic related BS while I was (temporarily at least) having revelations about how much I wanted to work in life. Fortunately and unfortunately it was very short lived."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with the content of the article, but I don’t agree with the premise that these things aren’t also “work”.Engineers tend to obsess over, “focused work” like it’s the only way to be productive, and anything that’s not “focused work” is wasted time.  That is a surefire way to burn out.Instead, finding ways to “riff” on your job by doing work with longer time horizons of payoff keeps your job fun.It’s all “work”.  Maybe the title ought to be, “Stop obsessing over focused work.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Getting my task completed at my own pace makes me feel good. Often that is fast and on time. In my heart, when I touch the keyboard, I feel like a greyhound dog with a little Bob Ross afro - it can be a race, a competition, but it is also an expression of my art.This article makes me feel bad because in the authors world, people like me are relegated to worker bee monkies trying to please the bossman due to pathology or some such delusion. I work this way because it pleases me. Doing my tasks diligently and in a timely manner affords me more time to relax, review what I have created, and enjoy it rather than drag myself to the next task.A bit off topic but as of late there is this creeping normalization of intentionally subpar or less optimized results I&#39;m noticing in our industry but also general society.When did we become so not only complacent but also discouraging of any genuine effort? It is as if everyone is so aloof that if you show any effort or appreciation of your craft that you&#39;re societally acknowledging your own serfdom or that you&#39;re serving &#34;the man&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m a physician. I really appreciate Tom’s enthusiasm, but I think that enthusiasm led him to overestimate the significance of the problem. Moreover he didn’t really understand for whom he was building this product. At first he thought it would be a consumer product. But he realized that consumers would not pay/subscribe and later learned that advertising wouldn’t work. Next he thought doctors would pay because “Doctors have money, right?” Again paying for this or any service is an expense. Its value has to justify the expense. We pay hundreds of dollars a year for UpToDate because it’s valuable. Cochrane is the gold standard for meta-analyses and they’re publishing for topics that are of clinical significance. Ultimately I doubt anyone is going to change their practice based on this product because there isn’t a compelling reason to do so. 
My major observation is that Tom tried to make a healthcare startup with negligible understanding of healthcare: the players, how payments work, how physicians practice, and what patients want/need. By not understanding the environment you’re not going to be able to understand the Problem which means your Solution will probably fail. This is a mistake repeated by most of the engineer founded health startups I’ve read about.
Finally for anyone wondering I usually recommend ibuprofen 800mg every 8 hours and Tylenol 1000mg every 8 hours. This isn’t medical advice, just something you may find from a quick search."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In all honesty, I don’t think the author correctly identified his error. And I think that’s a shame. It’s right here:&gt; Here I was, living the Silicon Valley dream: making the world a better place through technology.I don’t know how this has become a thing people believe, however widely it might be believed. But if it’s representative of SV or tech innovation at all, it’s either wildly distorted through a wealthy person’s pet futurism project—or held in the imagination of someone aspiring to that stature. SV is about making money, that’s it, that’s the whole story.The totally overlapping error here was assuming those things—making the world better, and making money—aren’t inherently in conflict. And overlapping that: assuming that a profit driven health care system has altruistic goals as such, rather than in concert with its profit-driving priorities.This project could have been successful (and could still do if the author or anyone else wants to pursue it). And it could have been a valuable contribution to society.The author would probably have realized this error if he’d considered entering a global market where health care has different economic incentives. Programs like this which help people are funded by government contracts and grants, not by payment from arbitrary people acting on their arbitrary interests."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a fun read, but I think it came to the wrong conclusion. The real issue imo was &#34;I had practically only weeks of runway&#34;. You just don&#39;t have time to make it happen.As a fellow start up founder, I see most of my job being just buying time for the business. Buying time to make, to talk, and to think.It wasn&#39;t like the tool had no value to Susan, maybe with a booth at her go-to annual expo, mentioning a few past lawsuits the tool could avoid, and an affinity partnership with her industry association, the tool would have become a fact of life for her.It&#39;s a lot of work, I&#39;m not denying that. Yet, this is the sort of thing YC&#39;s idealized startup stories often fail to say. If &#34;instant Product Market Fit&#34; is so good, then how come practically every new high flying SV startup is using loads of VC money to &#34;bend the market to the product&#34;?Exciting Startups have to venture far, it&#39;s not about &#34;we let you buy your potatoes online&#34; anymore. Chances are you won&#39;t get deals by talking to people once. I wouldn&#39;t say that means your idea is bad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some good books on the general topic that I&#39;ve read over the years are Debt: The First 5000 Years by Graeber:* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debt:_The_First_5000_YearsMoney: The True Story of a Made-Up Thing by Goldstein (also of NPR&#39;s Planet Money):* https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/50358103-money* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacob_GoldsteinAnd The Power of Gold: The History of an Obsession by Bernstein:&gt; In this exciting book, the late Peter L. Bernstein tells the story of history&#39;s most coveted, celebrated, and inglorious asset: gold. From the ancient fascinations of Moses and Midas through the modern convulsions caused by the gold standard and its aftermath, gold has led many of its most eager and proud possessors to a bad end. And while the same cycle of obsession and desperation may reverberate in today&#39;s fast-moving, electronically-driven markets, the role of gold in shaping human history is the striking feature of this tumultuous tale. Such is the power of gold.* https://www.wiley.com/en-us/The+Power+of+Gold:+The+History+o...* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_L._BernsteinBernstein was also the author of Against The Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a data scientist, perhaps this is a case of a hammer looking for a nail, but  personal finance made a lot more sense when I started treating “money” as: 1) a collection of arbitrary rules invented by humans, 2) probability distributions over the ability to exchange certain assets at different points in time, 3) a giant optimization program.So, the terms “U.S. dollar”, “fixed rate mortgage”, “401k”, “capital gains”, etc. don’t really have any inherent meaning beyond the set of rules that govern their interactions. This rule system itself can change over time depending on politics and human emotions, so you have to try to model the dynamics of this meta-system as well, even though that’s pretty difficult.Once you’ve gathered all the different rules into some programmatic representation, then you decide what it is you want out of life and at what points in your life, then you start optimizing. For example, would you rather have a 10% chance of having $1,000 on some future date, or a 1% chance of having $10,000? The expected return is the same in both cases, so your optimization should really consist of targeting a specific shape for the entire distribution of outcomes rather than a single number (or specific assets).Not surprisingly, the average person (including me) does not have the right combination of 1) detailed knowledge of the global financial system and its rules, 2) how all these rules are likely to change, or 3) the technical background to implement the advanced mathematics required to optimize all of this in an accurate way that actually makes valid predictions.So most people instead just guess and base their financial plans on their hunches about how “money” works, and large organizations that have the time to do all of this modeling in a more rigorous way come out much further ahead.I still think simplifying the “rules” of finance would be one of the best things we could do to reduce wealth inequality, as inequality seems to largely be hidden in the highly volatile landscape of the cost function for the optimization problem I described."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s an indie game called Deep Sixed that felt this way for me. The plot is that you&#39;re a prisoner and your cell is a spaceship that gets moved around for various reasons, and to stay alive you have to constantly fix your spaceship while also battling incoming baddies. It sounded like fun but when I played it I had a genuine stress response. It felt a lot like fixing broken servers while being screamed at on Twitter.

It pushes up the price of that work and is the strongest-possible declaration that something is wrong.Source: Have quit from a field that I love deeply because the environment became intolerable.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have basically the opposite opinion of this article. I often hold up Rocket League as an example of a great free-to-play game. 1) You 100% can unlock a lot of cosmetic items through free play. 2) The items that you buy have absolutely no impact on gameplay and are just visuals.For the same reason that people wear nice clothes in real life, why are you surprised that some people want to look cool in a video game? Are you surprised that people don’t just wear monochrome black shirts in real life? Likewise, you can resell RL items, there’s a market for that. Are you surprised when you can’t resell a shirt you wore for a year at the same price as when you bought it?That’s not to say that games where progression is locked behind time gates where you need to buy 1000 Realm Warp Crystals or whatever just to actually play the game aren’t a toxic hell. But that doesn’t seem to be what the article is pushing against."</p>

A. Priority.&#34; If your bug is not an internal Google priority you are basically out of luck. Hope you like maintaining your own patches, for years.I&#39;m not saying that OSS projects from other large projects don&#39;t have similar problems, I&#39;m saying that every Google project I&#39;ve depended on has had all of these problems.The idea of my OS being run like this? Absurd.This just is a guess, but, I&#39;d wager that most Google OSS developers just wanted a fancy corporate job and got stuck interfacing with the public on an OSS project. I don&#39;t think that most of them aspired to be OSS developers and it shouldn&#39;t be a requirement.[0]: Just today a two year old bug that I&#39;ve been watching was closed by merging a pull request that was first opened in early-2020, closed as stale in mid-2021, and re-submitted/merged this week."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Careful to protect their exploits, the attackers deployed multiple safeguards to make it difficult for security teams to recover any of the stages. These safeguards included:  * Only serving the iframe at specific times, presumably when they knew an intended target would be visiting the site.
  * In some email campaigns the targets received links with unique IDs. This was potentially used to enforcea one-time-click policy for each link and allow the exploit kit to only be served once.
  * The exploit kit would AES encrypt each stage, including the clients’ responses with a session-specific key.
  * Additional stages were not served if the previous stage failed.

Is this a normal level of sophistication for a CVE?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am tempted to do this, at least as a FU to the monitor industry. There is so little innovation in monitor tech! Why are monitors so expensive and old tech compared to TVs? I just want an affordable large monitor with 120Hz refresh rate and USB-C for coding, but options are quite limited. All monitor innovation is into HDR and super high refresh rate which I don’t care about. And prices seem artificially high."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the comments:&gt; I’m curious as to how this affected your productivityAnswer:&gt; Productivity is through the roof. Even when noodling about on small side projects I find you so quickly end up with so much things open that you&#39;re constantly flipping between, so to have multiple terminals, text editors, reference documentation, version control, etc, immediately accessible is, honestly, life changing."</p>
