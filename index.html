								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"He&#39;s got Granny Smith in the shit category, and this just reminds me of a funny story about dogs!We had two corgis and my wife made all their meals by hand. Part of their diet was apples, but we found one of the corgis would almost always eat around the apple (usually just a cheap red apple) pieces and leave them for the other dog. Then one time Granny Smith apples were cheaper at the grocery store so that is what we purchased and provided. He ate them up!Turns out the dog just didn&#39;t like the sweeter apples and wanted the tart tang of a good Granny Smith."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now this is the kind of important tech/nerd info that I come to HN for! 10/10Notes:I&#39;m only familiar with several of the varieties on this page, but I definitely agree with the rankings. We used to buy Gala, Fuji or Juici, since there were the cheapest at the store and we didn&#39;t know better, but once we tried Honeycrisp we never went back. (Cosmic Crisp also ok but not as good. I&#39;d also rank Envy a bit lower.)Also, best cider I&#39;ve had is from Honeycrisp apples.Red/Golden Delicious are tasteless garbage. Granny Smith is ok for particular dishes so I&#39;d probably rank it a bit higher."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I once spent a month blind taste-testing apples with my wife to compare the apples in our supermarket.  We learned 4 things:1) Most of the Honeycrisp varietals that make it to market are good (Wild Twist and Cosmic Crisp being our favorites), but…2) The time of year makes a HUGE difference.  It seems obvious when I say it, but different varietals from different farms are best in different weeks.  Honeycrisp has an advantage here because it has so many growers that someone is keeping a batch in good condition for practically every week of the year.3) You have to go by the apples in your local market. Lists like these are hard to use because there are many more apples on it than you have available to choose from - most grocery stores only stock 3-10 varieties depending on time of year4) Your use case is critical. Obviously baking a pie requires a different apples from eating, but even if you are just eating the apples raw there are differences.  Some apples beat others in texture when cut up, but have the wrong density to eat by biting down on the appleAfter all our testing, we mostly went back to Honeycrisp because it’s so reliable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an improvement within the current paradigm of &#34;big ag&#34;, but IMHO tech is opening the possibility of a completely different way of doing things. For example, this comment which is below the linked video imagines a robot-maintained food forest, I think it&#39;s on point because I, too, believe that the future is swarms of small robots rather than a few big tractors:&gt; Imagine, a few years down the line, applying these principles to maintaining an edible polyculture ecosystem-farm. Not necessarily a big machine going through a flat field, but small drones tending to trees, vines, herbs, plants, pollinators and water features all in the location that is best for them based on local features. It could micromanage weeding and harvesting, but also composting, planting, grafting and nurturing keystone species and rare species while avoiding pesticide, nitrogen imbalance and soil compaction. A productive farm could look like the garden of Eden."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I see stuff like this sometimes I get depressed that I&#39;m building apps that just move little bits of information around the web and don&#39;t have any real demonstrable value to the world.How hard is the jump into the realm of computer vision/AI/robotics for someone with strong skills and experience building web applications? Is the coding much different? Is a company like this employing math/theroy-heavy people to develop new types of AI or are they working higher up the stack and just need people who can pipe data around?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems like it should hoe each weed instead of spraying it. I guess that&#39;s a little harder to do. Maybe a lot harder.Two other things I thought were interesting in the video. One, the idea of mapping the whole field is pretty cool. There must be useful things you could do with a millimeter-scale 3D map of an entire field. Two, this is happening in California, just a few hours&#39; drive from Silicon Valley. I hope some of the engineers laid off recently find work in ag tech, because there will be huge opportunities coming with the rise of computer vision and (hopefully soon) robotics."</p>

Having said that, he really made it obvious to me as an eng that the severance is the option I would be taking.  Going &#34;hardcore&#34; on things can be fun, at the right time in your life, for the right reasons, with the right people.  But somebody who takes over the company and accrues so much social debt so quickly for no other discernible reason than looking like the smartest person in the room misses the bar for &#34;the right people&#34; by a pretty significant margin."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Years ago, I worked at a place that attempted this. They were so giddy about it. There wasn’t even a known leak, or, arguably, anything particularly worth leaking. They were just tickled by the idea that they could gotcha anyone who tried to leak something.Then, as now, it strikes me as little more than sad and paranoid Tom Clancy cosplay.I’d like to say I’ve moved on to a place with a culture of trust and faithfulness, but it doesn’t seem like anyone really trusts anyone anywhere anymore, and recent general infatuation with petty lords of chaos doesn’t seem to be helping.So here we are, everyone fantasizing about espionage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s called whitespace watermarking and seems to be one of those ideas that keeps getting re-invented.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; To put it bluntly, I’m not sure I trusted Infosys to revoke this key in a timely manner. So I did it for them with aws iam delete-access-key --access-key-id=$AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, and now the key is useless:Hilarious.  Infosys is a known &#34;mass recruiter&#34; in indian colleges.  WITCH (Wipro, Infosys, TCS, Cognizant, HCL) companies is where talent goes to die.  No competent employee stays in those companies (from what I&#39;ve witnessed).  Wouldn&#39;t be surprised if this turns out to be just the tip of the iceberg, because putting people with 6-12 months of programming / computer &#34;experience&#34; (that they only signed up for because of the money) in charge of major production systems is a recipe for disaster."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This thread is full of generalized insults at a million people based on where they work. If someone did the same based on a different attribute of a population, they&#39;d be banned.I&#39;ve worked at one of these companies but left over a decade ago. I know how we&#39;re looked at when we do client work (part of why I left). Some of my colleagues were less competent, true. But, some will wipe the floor with the client employees we did the work for.To WITCH employees: 
If you are an employee at one of these companies, remember you are not the worst. Many of you come from humble backgrounds and are just learning the ropes. The world is cruel. It is a tough place, and you will be discriminated against. This is your fuel. You&#39;ve already made great strides; keep going. You have to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I applaud any bad press on InfoSys.
I picked up contract gig through them a few years ago. Here are some of the takeaways from my short lived experience: 
 - It took them over two weeks to send me a computer.
 - They cancelled PTO for everyone. (this was the most egregious single thing they did)
 - They had absolute worst internal site for accessing HR documents and accessing personal resources. Just a maze of links. You could only access it via Internet Explorer (I swear I&#39;m not joking). Everything took forever to load. It was like stepping back into 1997.
 - When I gave my 2 week notice, they refused and said I &#39;owed&#39; them at least a month. LOL not sure how they think they can control people like that. I gleefully told them to &#39;deal with it&#39;. This happened about 45 days after I started as it became obvious very quickly how bad this company treats people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was delighted when my book showed up on Z-library!  I of course was never paid for authoring that book; indeed I paid a subvention to publish it with Harvard University Press. At some point, the rights were sold to the giant publisher Brill, which was charging $30  per chapter for a book that has no value by chapter.Luckily, some kind soul at University of Marburg   uploaded it and   Library Genesis still has it.https://academia.stackexchange.com/questions/141915/https://libgen.is/search.php?req=Joshua%20Fox&amp;column[]=autho..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Me and my colleagues will be affected by the end of Z library and co related projects.Here in Brazil and for sure in most second and third world countries, people don&#39;t have money to spend in books.You can argue that people can go to the library, but in most cases it&#39;s even expensive to take a bus or taxi even a Uber.I&#39;m a law student at an university in brazil. Law books are really expensive. 
Even though my university have a library, sometimes it doesn&#39;t have the books that the professors ask us to read.Since I found z library I could have access to most of books that I needed.I do know that the writers and publishers have costs and they need to make money, but I don&#39;t agree with the fact that we have to pay to have knowledge. It&#39;s more like if we don&#39;t have money, we can&#39;t have knowledge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know this won&#39;t be a popular take on HN, but while I can understand and to a certain extent sympathize with pirating movies (the intentional friction and arbitrary geographic limitations on access imposed by the multinational movie-industry conglomerates), I can&#39;t see stealing some poor author&#39;s work in the same light.Sure, people get hung-up about DRM (which can easily be removed by widely-accessible tools), but e-books can be purchased pretty much anywhere in the world. I&#39;m in Sweden but buy most of my e-books from the US. But often buy books directly from publishers (hopefully they, and the author, get a better cut that way).The fact these people were trying to personally profit (some other HN:ers have documented this), while trying to present themselves as some sort of &#34;information wants to be free&#34; info-warriors doesn&#39;t make the whole thing any better.An enormous amount of work goes into producing a book - through a close friend who works in book-publishing I know a couple of authors who pretty much starve for a year or two to produce their work - and then the editing, typesetting, designing, proof-reading etc is all an enormous and personal investment.In spite of what people think, authors are not all budding J.K.Rowlings with movie-deals and a couple of billion in the bank, and if we don&#39;t buy their books, they won&#39;t be able to produce the next one for people to pirate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Most news accounts seem to portray the scale of the bankruptcy as relatively small.This is a key point.They lost $16B in customer deposits.LTCM lost $4.6B in investor funds.Enron lost $11B in shareholder capital.Interestingly, while Madoff is widely quoted as having lost $65B, that was almost all fabricated paper wealth, actual losses were around $18B and $14.4B of that was recovered and returned.All of these situations are obviously somewhat different, but if what we&#39;re starting to hear is correct, FTX may be one of, if not the, biggest financial frauds/scandals in history.  The media doesn&#39;t seem to be treating it as such."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Before or after they were bribing politicians for favourable regulation for FTX at the detriment of their competitors who were not fraudulent?https://prospect.org/power/sam-bankman-frieds-multimillion-d...&gt; Crypto’s supporters in Congress are determined to ignore the massive gap in capacity between the two agencies; in fact, they likely understand that its incapacity is part of its appeal to FTX. A bill proposed by Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) seeks to grant the CFTC “exclusive jurisdiction over any agreement, contract, or transaction involving a contract of sale of a digital asset that is offered, solicited, traded, executed, or otherwise dealt in interstate commerce, including market activities relating to ancillary assets.” Perhaps in anticipation of such a move, FTX has stocked up its ranks with former CFTC officials. Former CFTC commissioner and acting chair Mark Wetjen is FTX’s head of policy and regulatory strategy. Ryne Miller, who was legal counsel to Gensler when he led the CFTC, is FTX’s general counsel. The Tech Transparency Project has also identified 14 other cases of CFTC alumni revolving into the crypto industry.Vote these people out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article spends quite a bit of time talking about SBF&#39;s risk appetite and how it might be drug related. I think that&#39;s missing a fairly obvious piece of logic.In order to decide to go into crypto trading you need to have an extremely high tolerance for risk. The crypto industry is self-selected for risk in the first place, you don&#39;t need complex explanations of why they use lots of leverage on highly volatile assets, that&#39;s literally the reason why they&#39;re there. If SBF had a low appetite for risk he wouldn&#39;t have entered crypto or started a start up, he would have stayed in trad-fi getting paid massive sums of money for some fairly basic quant work. It&#39;s not that Sam has a high risk appetite, it&#39;s that in order to get into the position Sam was in you need a high risk appetite.And that obviously poses a big problem for people who want to use a crypto exchange - because they can only find exchanges run by people with a massive risk appetite making it likely to blow up in your face."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Building and selling macOS apps is a pretty good niche to be in right now.I escaped my stressful corporate job 1 year ago and I’ve been living comfortably since then from app revenue only.I’m making between $3.5k and $9k per month with https://lunar.fyi/ and the smaller apps I create at https://lowtechguys.com/It’s not much for some parts of the world.  But I’m well enough from this that I even took the time to build a small calendar app (https://lowtechguys.com/grila) from which all the funds will go to my brother’s college costs so he can stop working 12h/day jobs.Before this I tried creating paid web services but none took off. I realized I actually don’t use any indie web product after 8 years of professional coding. I’m only using web products from big companies like Google, fly.io, Amazon etc.Desktop apps on the other hand, most that I use and love are made by single developers.With the ascent of Apple Silicon, and the ease of SwiftUI, this has the potential of bringing a modest revenue while also being more fulfilling than a corporate job.In case you’re curious how the code looks for something like that, here’s a small open-source app that I built in a single (long) day, which has proven to be useful enough that people want to pay for it: https://github.com/alin23/Clop"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Coding pairs well and elevates many other side-hustles, I think.Nearly every job can benefits from automation, and if it can&#39;t, then the logical thinking that coding requires will improve it in some way.I paired coding with fiction writing and made a scifi podcast, which now represents 10% of my monthly income after two years!I wrote up my experience and advice here, if you&#39;re interested in the details https://www.0atman.com/articles/21/make-fiction-podcast"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The thought of returning to corporate working kind of disgusts me. daily meetings, middle management bs, politics, bureaucracy... im sure your familiar with the typical complaints.Have you considered working in a company that isn&#39;t like that?Things to look for:* Ownership: The owner should be the person running the business.* Size: Fewer than 20 employees. Ideally two or three; consider being the first.* Revenue: A reasonably stable revenue stream lets you take on mid-long term projects. Ad revenue from a niche content business is quite good here."</p>

We&#39;re talking about a discussion thread which 35 people have commented in, not universally in opposition, versus the ~120k users[1] who&#39;ve made an edit on English Wikipedia in the last 30 days.(Fun trick: use this URL to turn on the summary headers that&#39;re why I know how many people are in the discussion: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Village_pump_(propos... )[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was hoping someone could help me understand. The objective of the Wikimedia Endowment[0] is to invest until the profits fully fund Wikipedia, expenses, as is the case with most endowments. According to Wikipedia’s financial statements[1], their spending balloons by tens of millions of dollars each year.2015-2016: $66M2019-2020: $112M2021-2022: $146MAssuming a modest return of 5%, isn’t it the case they would need billions in their endowment to fully fund Wikipedia?0: https://wikimediaendowment.org/1: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Fundraising_statis..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is nothing about “intersectional scientific method” anywhere on the internet or on the org’s website. https://www.vanguardstem.com/serch.Non profits (WMF) grant money to programs that directly or indirectly affect the content of all products offered by the WMF. It’s not just Wikipedia. There are grants that goto volunteers to increase editorship/authorship of non English Wikipedia or in countries and culture where Wikipedia does not have as many articles.Calling this culture wars and simply saying “the money doesn’t goto hosting” is low complexity thinking that fails to account for all the things the foundation does."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I diagnosed when I was like... 8 years old. From then to 17 I was on various meds, finally gave them all up. So for about 22 years I&#39;ve coped with ADHD without meds. I am a Staff Engineer and make a good living, respected in my field.Regardless of anything else, I think the key thing to remember about ADHD is that you do not need to be a high-performing human being, at all, in life. You will forget things and get distracted and not get as much done. So what. You are still intelligent and caring and dedicated and responsible and a hard worker. You probably put more effort in (when you get around to it) than many others without the condition. And you will do about as well as everyone else, on average. And this is fine. Do not put pressure on yourself to live up to what someone else can do. Only do what you can do, in your time, and be at peace."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This short scene from Malcolm in the Middle is the best explanation I&#39;ve found of ADHD as an adult: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AbSehcT19u0He tries to turn on the light, the bulb is dead, unscrews it, then as he&#39;s getting the bulb the shelf in the cabinet it&#39;s in is loose.He gets a screwdriver to fix the cabinet, but the rails on the drawer the screwdriver&#39;s in are squeaky. He gets some WD-40 to fix that, but the can of WD-40 is empty. He then gets in the car, which refuses to start.Then his wife gets home, and he&#39;s underneath the car covered in motor oil. &#34;Hal, did you replace that light bulb in the kitchen?&#34; &#34;WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE I&#39;M DOING?!&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was diagnosed last year at 35. I&#39;ve tried and failed to launch my own projects since I was 13.I was a classic adhd child, at a time when diagnosis and treatment was rare.Children whose dopamine regulation issues are treated early can leave medication as their brain adjusts while still plastic.In adulthood you&#39;re stuck. I&#39;ve battled addiction, terrible damage to relationships and failure to achieve my full happiness potential.Founding a company is extra hard.I&#39;m glad I&#39;m medicated now. The result has been life changing and profound.The more we talk, treat and exercise compassion about this horrible neurological disorder the better.It isn&#39;t like a broken leg or depression, the symptoms are varied and express in complex ways.Thank you to anyone talking about this with kindness and compassion"</p>
