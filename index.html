								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Finally this is getting some attention. Somewhat related, Healthcare startups are struggling with this because the standards they have to comply with (for developing medical software) cost up to 280 EUR (for a pdf!). [1]One common workaround is to go to &#34;the Estonian site&#34; which offers the same, English version of standards for a much lower price [2].  Being a bit cynical, I would say that Estonia prioritises open information much more highly than.. other developed countries. I created a price comparison on my website [3].But: The core problem of standards being openly available is still not solved. Why is this not possible? For me, standards are very comparable to the law: A large number of people should comply with it. For that, they must be openly available to everyone. Everything else doesn&#39;t make sense. Is that unreasonable?[1] https://www.iso.org/standard/38421.html
[2] https://www.evs.ee/en/
[3] https://openregulatory.com/accessing-standards/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The price of standards makes me angry. They&#39;re essentially a form of legislation in many countries - to sell anything in the EU you have to comply with the relevant safety standards. Yet they&#39;re kept under lock and key - to read the rules which you need to follow to sell something in your own country, you need to pay a 3rd party hundreds of Euros.And when you read the standards, they reference other standards. Eventually you have to build a graph of standards to which you must comply, each one costing hundreds of Euros. It&#39;s a complete racket.The worst thing is that the standards themselves tend to be written by 3rd party organisations with an interest in that domain, so they have a strong incentive to make the standard match with whatever they&#39;re doing. So not only does a new startup have to spend months reading hugely expensive dry safety standards, you also have to build something which is essentially a worse version of the incumbents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The value of standards is in their adoption.Tim Sweeney correctly observes this, then continues to talk about &#34;millions of hobbyist programmers&#34;. I do not believe that ISO targets, or even has any remote interest, in this market.ISO is comprised of nation-state members who will inevitably mandate ISO standards as part of legal compliance. Various stakeholders actually participate in standardization efforts and thus also both already know the standard and are able to push it through. All of these categories (government, industries in highly regulated sectors and large stakeholders) have large amounts of capital. The amount of money required to fund a purchase of an ISO standard barely even factors in on a balance sheet.Hobbyist programmers arguably make a lot of open source software that builds the foundation for today&#39;s and tomorrow&#39;s platforms. However, when the big bulldozers from the previous paragraph roll in, hobbyist programmers give way to highly paid employees of these giants; be it by merging a patch or be it by being worked around with a greenfield project or fork.On the other hand, ISO has an incentive in charging money for their standards because this adds perceived value: If something is freely available, it is easier to dismiss it as a non-serious effort when debating whether it is worth to bind personnel for participation in the standards committees; the standards come across as valueless, worthless.Looking at this vector of interests of the various parties involved, I see little reason for this state of affairs to improve."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are so many better crypto-currencies. Better for the environment because they use proof-of-stake, and not proof-of-work. Better for users because transactions are confirmed in seconds, not hours, and without the ridiculous fees that Bitcoin has.I think this shows how truly powerful the network effect, and being first to market is. Because without those things, Bitcoin would be nothing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Bitcoin uses more electricity per transaction than any other method known to mankind, and so it’s not a great climate thing”That&#39;s the sole actual quote attributed to Bill Gates in that article (which doesn&#39;t even link to any source). The rest is the author conflating their thoughts with Bill Gates&#39;s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bitcoin is a beautiful concept that has been bastardized by economies of scale. The mining concentration is decreasing its security over time. The centralized block structure and exorbitant fees will afflict it more and more as it grows.Even arguments about renewable energy being used to mine BTC are moot, because they don&#39;t consider the opportunity cost of what could be done with all that energy instead.I truly believe in a decentralized means of exchange, but Bitcoin is the Encarta equivalent. There already is a Wikipedia equivalent, all it takes is a little research. Once you find it, you will know. I won&#39;t shill here, as I don&#39;t want that to dilute the points of Bitcoin&#39;s increasingly problematic issues due to its growing scale.That being said, the cryptoverse is drowning in sh*tcoins, and I completely understand anyone even remotely mentioning an alternative to Bitcoin being inevitably categorized as a shiller and therefore not worth listening to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just the other day I was in my logistics class and the professor started deviating into something that I believe was pure nonsense.He started the lecture by analyzing how many pieces a machine could manufacture per day. Fair enough. He extended the model to measure different ratios of capacity. Makes sense.Then he tried to extend the model to all machines, including humans. His example was: &#34;How do you measure the capacity of a legal team?&#34;. I thought it was a trick question, so I answered (paraphrasing) &#34;You can&#39;t answer that question the same way you answer for the machine. You can&#39;t give a single metric.&#34; He told me I was wrong and that the _right_ measure would be (total number of working hours/day).I was tempted to try to convince him otherwise. The analogy was deeply flawed. He certainly measured the machines in (number of pieces / day) but measured the legal team in (hours/day). So, in analyzing a machine, you take into account its efficiency, but you don&#39;t do the same thing for humans.I believe that is exactly the same thing that is going on in the post. Managers/Logistics/Economists are very susceptible to this kind of generalization pitfalls.Edit: Given that this answer has generated some discussion I feel the need to expand on it. The legal team was not expected to sell their services &#34;by the hour&#34;. In fact, any discussion about how their services were sold was shut down by the professor. From his point of view, the lawyers were machines and he was asking the question &#34;how much can this machine produce?&#34;Yes, other students also suggested taking the number of billable hours/revenue into account, but that&#39;s not the answer the professor was looking for.I don&#39;t criticize whether his answer is not technically right, but I feel it holds no real-world meaning. It was a purely academic question that leads nowhere instead of having a debate about how you measure the productivity of a group of human beings. And on top of that, his final answer was definitive and (from his point of view) was irrefutable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my most proud accomplishments was reducing the size of a driver from ~3000 lines of code to ~800. The file was 15 years old and had been modified by many people since. There were conditionals that were impossible to hit, features that had been abandoned years ago, duplicate code, and lots of comments that didn’t match the code anymore. After my changes and a few new tests, the driver had full MCDC code coverage and the code actually matched the device specification!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"CPI is a joke, they do something called hedonic adjustments to things like tech products etc. It&#39;s completely subjective and BS. Technology is deflationary, things should get cheaper because we go after producing them in creative ways one demand is high.CPI is absurd, it only perpetuates consumerism and punishes savers.
We product 2x the food society consumes - mostly wasted away, just with some supply chain efficiency - there&#39;s a lot more room for food not to be expensive though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone that is the food mostly spice trade prices have started going up in the last 2-3 weeks though prices have not even reached pre pandemic levels. Black Pepper prices have jumped 20+% in the last 20day that price is still 50% cheaper than what it was 4-5 years ago. The largest problem is not availablity of goods rather shipping. I would advise investing in shipping companies if you are active in the stock market. As now days they are charging 3-4 times the freight and still hard to get space so they probably rare raking it in"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice work!I&#39;m about 1850 in Lichess blitz, and it played at the level of an earnest 12 year old, which is actually meant as a compliment. It got crazy with its kingside pawns in the opening (no book knowledge), lost material pretty steadily and was checkmated down a queen, bishop and two pawns by move 25.But it developed some pieces sensibly, made obvious recaptures and was not reckless about king safety. It avoided pointless toggling moves and suicidal piece jettisoning.You&#39;ve earned the right to be a proud papa on this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sharing other people&#39;s amazement that such a tiny amount of code plays so well (I&#39;m an inexperienced, infrequent player and it beat me once and drew once), I was pondering that there&#39;s no absolute reason to think that small programs inherently must play games poorly. For many abstract strategy games, you could write an explicit game tree search in a relatively small amount of code and it would, in principle, play perfectly if you somehow gave it enough time to search the whole game tree. (That wouldn&#39;t be feasible for most abstract strategy games that human beings like to play, but would for small games like Tic-Tac-Toe, Hexapawn or Octapawn, Nine Men&#39;s Morris, maybe Hex on a small board.)In GOFAI (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbolic_artificial_intelligen...) there&#39;s a clear pattern where &#34;intelligence&#34; in abstract strategy games represents, in part, being able to prune game trees well without having to search them exhaustively. In some cases that means having a good evaluation function for positions, and in other cases having a cleverer search strategy in another way.Thinking about this made me realize that it&#39;s not just impressive that this program plays decently while being tiny, but especially that it plays decently and quickly while being tiny."</p>

It&#39;s not wrong, of course, but it&#39;s been repeated for many years and won&#39;t lead to fresh conversation.The goal on HN is curious conversation. Curiosity likes diffs [1], not generics [2, 3]. Try to comment in a way that leads to a new place rather than an old place.The easiest way to do this is to respond to the specific new information in an article. As a nudge in that direction, I&#39;ve swapped a different interrogative pronoun into the title, and have downweighted the generic subthreads which were rising to the top like bloated balloons and crowding out more interesting discussion (as typically happens in these cases).You don&#39;t only have to react to the specific new information in an article.

If ever something went catastrophically wrong with youtube this could be reactivated via the feed* He has a large email list which he uses to reach people directly and drive traffic to videos if people request these updates* He is also prominent on twitter etc and maintains secondary youtube channels, useful if main one taken down* He runs a large subreddit for his followingSo it is layers and layers of redundancy, built on a mix of other platforms and also two he controls directly (email and rss)Still faces a youtube risk but it would take a an earthquake across platforms to truly wreck his income streams.As someone who runs an online business and follows him it’s been impressive to watch how diversified he has made his comms channels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Linus SebastianSomething to understand, for those who might have just seen some youtube videos of him being goofy, is that he&#39;s an actor. The guy on camera doing stupid stuff is a stage persona. It&#39;s an intentionally cultivated image and media persona to get as many video views as possible.I sort of see him as one possible aspect of the low/medium budget TV production stuff which is common in his home city, Vancouver BC. People who&#39;ve met and worked with him in person report that he&#39;s a much more normal, calm, rational individual off screen.I won&#39;t judge him for being goofy on camera because it&#39;s hard to make a living as a working actor. For every person who gets a job in a vancouver-produced TV drama that might last 2 or 3 seasons, there&#39;s dozens more people who are working as restaurant servers while trying to get their big break."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a similar feeling, but with modern smartphones.Owning my computer is still relatively possible. I can build a computer from parts which I can choose, and have a choice in which operating system to install on them. Laptops are slightly more closed, but even on those I can choose the OS myself.Modern smartphones however, seem like walled gardens in which I have no control at all. I cannot choose any of the parts, and even doing simple reparation tasks like replacing a battery is a nightmare these days. I am locked into a single OS on my smartphone, which either spies on you or is locked down even more. Every iteration a bit more control is taken away from the user. And its increasingly hard to step away from them, since a lot of normal interactions such as banking almost requires you to have such a phone.Both Android and iOS suck. I&#39;ve made my own Android phone tolerable with F-Droid and trying to ungoogle it as much as possible. But unfortunately I find myself locked into using google play services since solutions like MicroG just don&#39;t cut it. They lock me out of slightly too much of my daily smartphone usage (note that this is definitely not the MicroG&#39;s developers fault, they have done amazing work)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This feels like it was made to get to the top of somewhere like HN but I&#39;m actually very confused.&gt;I want it to be, but which can also be used to communicate securely with anyone on the planet without being observed by a third party. I don&#39;t want to be spied on by Microsoft or Google.I don&#39;t want the NSA intercepting my conversations or even their metadata.I don&#39;t see what this has to do with the actual computer honestly. You don&#39;t want Microsoft to be involved so I&#39;m going to assume you are going to install Linux on whatever you get, awesome, this doesn&#39;t stop the NSA or Google from harvesting your data because that doesn&#39;t really have anything with the computer. Seems like you want a search engine and ISP that you own as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Except for a handful of very over-priced models that I can&#39;t afford to buy.This statement here made me pause for a bit. He wants a computer with specific features, but doesn&#39;t want pay for the models that offer those features because they are too expensive?Everyone wants to have their cake and eat it too, but unfortunately, reality has constraints."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The progression of headlines is funny:1) MIPS Strikes Back: 64-bit Warrior I6400 Arrives https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8258092We are still in the game2) Linux-running MIPS CPU available for free to universities – full Verilog code https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9444567Okay, we are not doing so great, maybe we can get young kids hooked?3) MIPS Goes Open Source https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18701145Open Source is so hip and pop these days, lets do that!4) Can MIPS Leapfrog RISC-V? https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19460470Yeah, sure, that&#39;ll happen5) Is MIPS Dead? Lawsuit, Bankruptcy, Maintainers Leaving and More https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22950848Whoops6) Loose Lips Sink MIPS https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24402107And there is the answer to the question from previous headlineAnd now we are here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 2010 MIPS wanted $2 million from Berkeley to allow them to use the MIPS instruction encodings for processor cores that Berkeley would design entirely themselves. So they made up their own encodings instead.The rest is history.In many ways modern MIPS and RISC-V are pretty much just different binary encodings of the same ideas.[this was already posted as a comment in a thread, but on reflection it probably deserves its own]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot to like about MIPS. It&#39;s a perfectly usable RISC architecture that:- is easy to implement- is supported by Debian, gcc, etc..- is virtualizable- scales from embedded systems (e.g. compressed MIPS16 ISA) up to huge shared-memory multiprocessor systems with hundreds of CPUsLike RISC-V, MIPS traces its lineage to the dawn of the RISC revolution in the 1980s, though on the Hennessy/Stanford side rather than the Patterson/Berkeley side.And it was supposed to go open source: https://www.mips.com/mipsopen/but that effort sadly seems to be dead: http://mipsopen.comThat&#39;s really too bad. MIPS doesn&#39;t deserve to die.Fortunately as mentioned above it will live on as long as there are PS2 consoles or emulators around."</p>
