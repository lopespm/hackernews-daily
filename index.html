								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is why my old hosting company changed its auto disconnection code to work at 11am on a Monday morning, never at a weekend.That way it&#39;s the bill-payers that notice and get in touch, not the poor tech on the out-of-hours rota.Also, it only firewalled the customer&#39;s public IPs from the Internet - it didn&#39;t stop servers. That way when the account is settled there was often nothing for the techs to do.Also it was only ever done after the bank reconciliation was marked as complete, just in case...We relied on goodwill and recommendation of engineers for our growth, so were keen not to make their lives harder for someone else&#39;s bureaucratic (or cynical) mistake."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A suggestion for engineers that lack business experience. As soon as your project grows beyond the non-hobby scale and starts making real money, invest some time to reach out to company providing the services that keep it alive and find an account manager that will take care of you.We&#39;re a Google customer and of course we had our fair share of issues (btw: it&#39;s the same with Azure, based on our experience), and we always escalate to our account manager. That usually starts turning the wheels much faster.Also, do not be afraid to ask your account manager for additional discounts. Everybody in sales has some wiggle room to get you a better deal. With Google their account manager actually suggested that we work through a reseller and we&#39;re getting % off the list prices.Dealing with Google, Amazon, etc.. is not like dealing with code. It&#39;s not only transactional and you need to invest some time in the relationship even if you&#39;re the customer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago I was working at a startup and we had just started moving some stuff over from AWS to GCP. Things were going pretty good with GCP until one day they pulled the plug on everything with no explanation. It turns out that our company credit card details had been fraudulently used without our knowledge. The criminal had decided to use the card to buy Google Ad Words or something like that - this is the same card we use on our GCP billing account. Anyway Google just took prod down with no notice on grounds of fraud. Could happen to anyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The most interesting part, to me, of a release like this is the amount of &#34;please don&#39;t abuse this technology&#34; pleading. No licence will ever stop people from doing things that the licence says they can&#39;t. There will always be someone who digs into the internals and makes a version that does not respect your hopes and dreams. It&#39;s going to be bad.As I see it, within a couple years this tech will be so widespread and ubiquitous that you can fully expect your asshole friends to grab a dozen photos of you from Facebook and then make a hyperrealistic pornographic image of you with a gorilla[0]. Pandora&#39;s box is open, and you cannot put the technology back once it&#39;s out there.You can&#39;t simply pass laws against it because every country has its own laws and people in other places will just do whatever it is you can&#39;t do here.And it&#39;s only going to get better/worse. Video will follow soon enough, as the tech improves. Politics will be influenced. You can&#39;t trust anything you see anymore (if you even could before, since Photoshop became readily available).Why bother asking people not to? I guess if it helps you sleep at night that you tried, I guess?[0]A gorilla if you&#39;re lucky, to be honest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Played with it for a bit in DreamStudio so I could control more of the settings.  So far everything it generates is &#34;high quality&#34;, but the AI seems to lack the creativity and breadth of understanding that DALL-E 2 has.  OpenAI&#39;s model is better at taking wildly differing concepts and figuring out creative ways to glue them together, even if the end result isn&#39;t perfect.  Stable Diffusion is very resistant to that, and errs towards the goal of making a high quality image.  If it doesn&#39;t understand the prompt, it&#39;ll pick and choose what parts of the prompt are easiest for it and generate fantastic looking results for those.  Which is both good and bad.For example, I asked it in various ways for a bison dressed as an astronaut.  The results varied from just photos of astronauts, to bisons on earth, to bisons on the moon.  The bison was always drawn hyper realistically, which is cool, but none of them were dressed as an astronaut.  DALLE on the other hand will try all kinds of different ways that a bison might be portrayed as an astronaut.  Some realistic, some more imaginative.  All of them generally trying to fulfill the prompt.  But many results will be crude and imperfect.I personally find DALLE to be more satisfying to play with right now, because of that creativity.  I&#39;m not necessarily looking for the highest quality results.  I just want interesting results that follow my prompt.  (And no, SD&#39;s Scale knob didn&#39;t seem to help me).  But there&#39;s also a place for SD&#39;s style if you just want really great looking, but generic stuff.That said, the current version of SD was explicitly finetuned on an &#34;aesthetically&#34; ranked dataset.  So these results aren&#39;t really surprising.  I&#39;m sure the next generations of SD will start knocking DALLE out of the park in both metrics.  And, of course, massive massive props to Stability.ai for releasing this incredible work as open source.  Imagine all the tinkering and evolving people are going to do on top of this work.  It&#39;s going to be incredible."</p>

that runs with local-only data (i.e. no internet access, no DRM, no weird API keys, etc like pretty much every AI-related application i&#39;ve seen recently) would be neat."</p>

We currently use the Mapbox JS library to create the pins etc. - could we use Headway with Leaflet JS for example? We also use the Mapbox geocoder, mainly for reverse geocoding of addresses.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"FWIW, it is still possible to get TVs without this stuff, albeit at a premium. TVs are still made for business usage in areas like conference rooms, wall displays etc. They&#39;re often found under labeling like &#34;commercial digital signage&#34; or &#34;business display&#34; or the like, they seem to often try to avoid using &#34;TV&#34; (if being cynical maybe to make them harder for normal people to discover and confuse them if they do). But they&#39;re often nice panels aimed at serious running hours, without this sort of junk (which would give enterprise IT conniptions) and can have very useful feature support like 802.1x authentication which so many devices still lack. Players like NEC will even advertise their use of an RPi compute and wink at lack of spyware [0] for some of their products, but lots of major &#34;smart TV&#34; providers also have a commercial lineup.I think they&#39;re well worth considering, particularly for the HN crowd, granted I suppose for people who truly want built-in netflix or the like without connecting something like a Roku or Apple TV maybe it&#39;s less optimal. But even they might change their tunes back to the concept of separate boxes and normal panels if they dislike all the ads and data tracking.----0: https://www.sharpnecdisplays.us/products/displays/me501"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Some may argue that there&#39;s no need to be dramatic and that there&#39;s nothing wrong in seeing an occasional ad every now and then.Oh, no, I am very dramatic about this. I will go to any lengths not to see advertising. I will entirely forgo any platform that shows me even one ad, especially when I pay them. Amazon Prime video is already pushing it with their preroll previews. The second it&#39;s something else I&#39;m canceling and going back to P2P. Fuck &#39;em."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At home, I&#39;ve never connected my TV to my network.  The few firmware updates I&#39;ve needed to do were applied using a thumb drive, and I use an AppleTV as my interface.When I travel, I bring along an AppleTV and plug the HDMI port into their set.  This lets me keep the services I subscribe-to and use them with their display.  This has worked great until my most-recent rental, which had a RokuTV -- presumably setup on Wifi.When content was streaming from my AppleTV, Roku would overlay a panel along the bottom-part of the screen proposing that I can watch what I&#39;m currently watching from a variety of other providers.  This must mean that the TV set is analyzing the video or audio signal to fingerprint what the content contained, then matching it against a library of content to feed into its profile of my use.This is the first time I&#39;ve seen something like this.  I&#39;d always assumed that if you used the TV&#39;s UI and if it was connected to the internet, then you&#39;d probably be subject to their ads and data analysis, but it never crossed my mind that they&#39;d perform the same data-analysis over any signal passing through its silicon.Is this commonplace or is Roku the first of what&#39;s likely to be many doing the same?"</p>

I have never needed a case for my phones or computers, and have barely even scratched the shell. I go on adventures for a good portion of the year and still manage to keep it intact, so i scratch my head when people say they break easily or that they always shatter their screen, it really seems to go beyond accidental damage and stray into carelessness.[0] https://manuals.info.apple.com/MANUALS/2000/MA2074/en_US/iph..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, in a conventional reactor, you use nuclear fission to heat/pressurize water and then use your hot, slightly radioactive steam turn a turbine. This mostly works because moving even very hot, very high pressure water around is kind of a solved problem in industry.In a molten salt reactor, you use nuclear fission to melt various corrosive salts into a fluid, and this is good because molten salts store a lot more energy per unit (volume, presumably?) at low pressures, so you can transfer heat indirectly to nearby turbine-turning water without irradiating the water or relying on high-pressure water to cool your reactor. Cool.But I was under the impression that the main stumbling block for molten salt reactors was that high-energy corrosion resistant materials for containing / moving molten salt simply don&#39;t exist (yet). I suppose this is less of a problem for a research reactor, but it doesn&#39;t sound like there&#39;s been a materials breakthrough here that&#39;s allowing them to get started. Are they just plowing forward and they&#39;ll need to replace the containment infrastructure every few years?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Damn, I had some fairly old opinion of Doctorow where I disliked him for some reason or other, but I am definitely revising that. I thought this was a great article.I am certain “bossware” will accelerate the downfall of already shitty workplaces.Very happy to hear Amazon is doing away with it. Strongly hope their workers unionize anyway. What kind of employer nickle-and-dimes a worker’s bathroom breaks? Not a good one, that’s for damn sure.I used to see these job postings on LinkedIn for Crossover for Work. I was intrigued by the claim of $400yr salary. Glad I didn’t end up working there. Thanks but no thanks, I am not going to work actively oppressing already downtrodden workers. A quick search turned up this fascinating article as well: https://medium.com/@whistler_12777/heres-why-crossover-is-a-...Fuck bossware. Fuck people who work to actively oppress others. Humanity for all, value of life for each and every person out there.Rant over. Thanks for the link."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On workplace surveillance / &#34;bossware&#34;:&gt; Mazzoli seems to have either not used his product, or, if he did, did so under conditions where he was in charge of it – using it the way an athlete might use a stopwatch to time their own sprints, and not the way a boss might: to decide whether to dock your pay or fire you.&gt; This inability to understand the difference between using a technology and having the same technology used against you is endemic to the industry.I think this is a key failure of understanding for the &#34;tech is neither good nor bad!&#34; camp: just as the Death Star clearly was never going to be used for mining planetoids, it&#39;s very clear how workplace surveillance tech will be used to harm workers, if nothing else because of how it is currently being used. Continuing to work on such tech just because it could theoretically be used for non-evil purposes is morally bankrupt, and something the industry needs to establish ethical standards to prevent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve recently watched Brazil, and the film has one of the most chilling dystopian views I’ve ever seen because it’s easy to see yourself as part of the machine doing your best just trying to get by.Similarly, I can see how the people working in this software slipped into this- they identified a need in the market with WFH, tried prototypes that were well received on the market, and keep iterating. Many of them legitimately are interested in time tracking and optimization, but of course the market for personal tools like that is very small and lots of employers want to pay you for this because they want more productive employees. Meanwhile the people buying them don’t really know what they are buying, they want to believe they have found a solution to the problem they are terrified of, employees pretending to work and milking them. And the employees exposed to it aren’t in a position of power to change it. And next thing you know we have a dystopian monster with enough funding to be responsible for people’s jobs itself, where no one individual has incentives to buck the curve or much ability to fight back.What’s the solution then? Doctorow mentions unions, and I’d agree that could work. I think there must be another faction to join that doesn’t ruin you, something to compete with the monolith in case the monolith gets sick in this way. Being able to quit and find somewhere else only works if that somewhere else is mostly differentiated by the fact that it doesn’t do these programs you disagree with- many people will put up with this and worse if there is a large pay differential between it and the next option, or if they would have to move and uproot themselves. And if a government gets sick in this way it might not let you quit the country. You have to be able to form collective groups that can bargain with the behemoth, like a union, or political party, or other action that relies on people for it’s power and not capital. That’s one reason why money in politics is so worrying to me, because the way I see it, it messes with this crucial release valve of political action."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The killer application for these e-ink dispalys is calendar/todo list display. I&#39;d love to have my org-mode agenda and todo-list/notes on such a low-powered, low-refresh-rate e-ink screen.I know this question has been probably been asked many times, but I&#39;ll ask again: why are these devices not mass-produced in great numbers? Clearly there is great market demand for it, so then why would the market supply not respond to this demand? Is it because the technology has some oddities that manifest in tricky manufacturing processes? Or is it some patent encumbrance issue?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat unrelated, but I&#39;m still waiting for an affordable PC monitor based on e-ink technology. Dasung has been making some progress in the area but their products are quite expensive, around $1000 or more for anything with a useable size.
People might disagree on the count of lack of colors, but to me e-ink technology seems very well suited for writing code. And who knows, maybe in a decade or so the refresh rates for these color e-ink might be in a usable range as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My ideal use case for this would be full size wall art. Similar to the Samsung TV that when off looks like art on a wall. Being able to have a new piece of art displayed daily along with as another commentator said your schedule. Wake up enjoy the new random art and see what your plans for the day are. Im sure the ability to scale this would be quite expensive. Buying many to connect and make your own custom size could work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great article. On the surface, it&#39;s about Snowflake. At a deeper level, the article is about the perverse incentives motivating SaaS businesses to do seemingly dumb, inefficient things and avoid seemingly obvious optimizations by default.Many SaaS businesses are perfectly happy to let customers shoot themselves in the foot if it generates more revenue. The BigQuery example (presently, by default, `select * from table limit 10` obediently scans the entire table at your expense!) is spot-on.As the article so well puts it, every SaaS company has a vested financial interest &#34;to leave optimization gremlins in.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Snowflake is not expensive. Snowflake is super cheap, IF you know what it is for and how to use it. Compared to if you had to solve the problem on your own.The best way to describe Snowflake is that it is a brute force method to run complex queries without creating indexes.If you have a more traditional database, you will notice you need to set up indexes to be able to get anything from it in finite time. What if you don&#39;t know the indexes upfront? What if you want your users to be able to ask arbitrary queries and get answers before bedtime?That&#39;s what Snowflake is for. It automates using ENORMOUS amount of hardware to get your query executed fast, very inefficiently.It is not for free though. That inefficiency will cause a lot of resources used for queries. It is meant for those few queries when your users try to get some insight into your data and you can&#39;t predict indexes beforehand. Sometimes this is exactly what you want, like when you let your data people in to figure stuff out. Or when you have very rare functionality that allows the user to build their own queries -- which you should avoid like hell (and there are tricks to make it index pretty well) but can&#39;t always avoid.For everything else, whenever you can predict your indexes, you always want to use more traditional database that can be very efficient on queries properly supported by indexes.The issue is a lot of people try to use Snowflake as a database or to support frequently executing queries of the same kind. This is bad and it will cost you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m the author of the article. Didn&#39;t expect it to blow up. Let me clarify a few points:1. I like Snowflake and I think they brought several innovations to the field: Instant scale out/up, time-travel, unstructured data query support. 
2. Snowflake obviously makes innovations and performance improvements, otherwise they would not be the market leader they are. But I&#39;m also suspecting that they make just enough performance improvements to be at par and then use the vendor lock in features to make switching hard.My argument is that their rate of performance innovation has considerably gone down and DataBricks, Firebolt, and open source alternatives just seem more attractive from a cost/performance ratio. I agree that Snowflake is still the best data-warehouse to start with if you have 100k, but not if you truly plan for a multi-year horizon and your usage expands.- Redshift also brought a lot of innovation that allowed people to execute analytical queries 100x-1000x faster than any OLTP that existed out there. I&#39;ve used Redshift for four years and they kept ignoring performance and features until Snowflake came out. All of a sudden because of competitor pressure, they put more effort into the product to maintain and gain market share. My hope is that Snowflake finds a solution to their innovator&#39;s dilemma, since competitors are hot on their tails.- Some people point out that 70% usage growth just shows that Snowflake is useful. Nobody disagrees with that. The issue is that majority of the companies don&#39;t experience a 70% revenue growth to catch up with the growth in costs. At some point, you have to clamp down on costs, which means that you have to look for alternatives to run things more efficiently."</p>
