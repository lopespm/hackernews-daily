								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve learned that when I have a positive thought about someone, it’s generally worth communicating it. If I think a coworker saved me on some project, I tell them. If my partner is making me feel warm and fuzzy, I tell her. If someone impresses me, I say so. I don’t think people express these things nearly as often as they feel them, and I expect that many of the positive things that do end up communicated have another motive behind them. Simple earnest positive comments are very much worthwhile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been on the receiving end of such gratitude, and it always brightens my day. It&#39;s easy to think your hard work isn&#39;t noticed, until you realize how seldom you acknowledge other people&#39;s work.Unfortunately, explicit gratitude is very rare. Donations are even rarer. The &#34;ask a question&#34; and &#34;support this site&#34; buttons on my website are next to each other. I get 15 questions for every donation. About 30€ per 100 000 visitors, from 1-3 visitors. Those who email me with questions never donate. I&#39;m not complaining about any of this, just illustrating my point: you can&#39;t use gratitude as a metric for the value of your work.Critics, on the other hand, are disproportionately loud. As a community moderator, I learned that for every complainer, there are dozens of quietly happy users. You can only tell by the votes. No one will create a thread to say &#34;everything is fine, keep it up&#34;.If someone made your day easier, or if they created something good, take a minute to thank them. If they saved you a ton of work, consider a small donation. A lot of people are tirelessly, thanklessly creating things that benefit you. It costs nothing to acknowledge it. Never let a compliment go unused.In the last few years, I became better at expressing my gratitude to creators, maintainers, colleagues and friends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was surprised to find that someone left a brief &#34;thank you&#34; issue on one of my open source projects (a Kubernetes hairpin proxy to fix issues with cert-manager and LoadBalancers) and it feels great to know that the right people are finding it and resolving the same problem that led me to build it.I humbly hope that sharing this might inspire more humanity and gratitude in the open source community."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This is the same IP address: 3232271615. You get that by interpreting the 4 bytes of the IP address as a big-endian unsigned 32-bit integer, and print that. This leads to a classic parlor trick: if you try to visit http://3232271615 , Chrome will load http://192.168.140.255.This was the source of one of my favorite “bugs” ever. I was working on multiple mobile apps for a company, and they had a deep link setup that was incredibly basic: &lt;scheme&gt;://&lt;integer&gt;, which would take you to an article with a simple incrementing ID.  This deep link system “just worked” on iOS and Android; take the URL, grab the host, parse it as an int, grab that story ID. Windows Phone, however… the integers we were parsing out were totally wrong, returning incredibly old stories!Turned out that the host we were given by the frameworks from the URL was auto-converted to an IP in dotted-quad format, and then the int parser was just grabbing the last segment… which meant that we were always getting stories &lt;256, instead of the ~40000 range we were expecting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My dad had a similar story about a bug report. This was back in the day when terminals still used paper rather than CRTs; actual teletypes. The bug report was something like &#34;if I print a page feed on such and such terminal model, it will catch fire.&#34;The bug report form (which was paper in those days) had a few of the usual checkboxes and fields to fill in, including one for &#34;is the problem reproducible?&#34; That box was checked. Someone had actually gone to the effort of standing by their terminal with a fire extinguisher, running the same command and putting out the fire when it caught fire again.It turns out the problem was in some software that emulated page feeds by doing repeated line feeds. Some overflow or underflow bug caused an integer to wrap around, so instead of advancing a few lines to the next page, it would try to advance thousands or millions of lines. This particular terminal model was a new, high speed one, so it would try to advance the paper really fast. It was using those perforated strips at the sides, with the pegs that went into the holes. The pegs and holes weren&#39;t perfectly aligned, so the pegs would sometimes clip the holes a bit, causing some bits of paper to shred and get kicked up as dust. Along with a spark, I don&#39;t recall if it was from the motor or just static buildup caused by the friction of the paper, and the paper dust would ignite, causing the terminal to catch fire.I just love the image of whoever submitted that bug report, seeing the &#34;is it reproducible&#34; checkbox on the form, and standing by the terminal with a fire extinguisher to put it out while doing the same thing to make sure the problem was reproducible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tell me if this is a bug...After driving a new car to work for 2 years, the traction control started kicking in on certain curves. I take a windy road to work and had never had traction control activate. When it kicked in, it pulsed the right front brake and slowed the car quickly, likely unnerving the guy tailgating me. This happened several times, both going to and from work. The road was perfectly dry, no snow or rain. Same turns at the same speed as always.The clues are was that my rear tires had worn and I replaced them a few days before. And, I drive a Tesla Model 3. It&#39;s a rear-wheel drive version and the front tires still had good tread so I didn&#39;t replace them.Why the right front tire?What I finally brained out, which you may have quickly realized, is that the diameters of the worn front and new rear tires were then slightly different. The front had a lower diameter than the rear and therefore turned at a slightly faster rate when driving.When I took a hard bank, the outside wheels also turned faster than the inside as they do in any turn. That increased the delta in spin rate the most between the outside worn front tire and the inside new rear tire. The traction control determined that the right front must be slipping and pulsed the brake on it.I replaced the front tires and everything went back to normal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I may have told this story before (perhaps back in 2008 if this was posted then) -- but my first gig in tech was QA for Hewlett Packard testing printer/scanner/copier units. At some point I scanned a photo of my then-girlfriend and crashed the unit. Was able to do it repeatedly, provided I scanned the image in straight/cleanly. I didn&#39;t come across any other images that reproduced the issue, only this one photo. The underlying bug was a buffer overrun of some sort, was fixed before shipping -- and the image became a part of the durable regression test suite for that department."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My knowledge of modern genetic engineering is limited to some popsci literature, so I understand only parts of this story.  I was surprside by this part though:&#34;Over many years of experimentation, it was found that if the U in RNA is replaced by a slightly modified molecule, our immune system loses interest. For real. [...]  The really clever bit is that although this replacement Ψ placates (calms) our immune system, it is accepted as a normal U by relevant parts of the cell.&#34;This sounds like a serious backdoor or attack vector to me - would there be any risk in introducing this Ψ, allowing some natural occuring permutations to turn wild or dangerous?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice article. There are more interesting things to say about RNA that makes it a bit less like code - for example that it too can fold to a 3d structure, with some cases that can cause problems - hairpins for example where the sequence is palindrome-like (in the complementing letters) ACG followed by CGU can fold onto itself. This caused the problems with the initial batch of CDC&#39;s PCR tests"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of “The Bell Jar” by Sylvia Plath, which has a quote Aziz Ansari used in his series “Master of None”:&gt; &#34;I saw my life branching out before me like the green fig tree in the story. From the tip of every branch, like a fat purple fig, a wonderful future beckoned and winked. One fig was a husband and a happy home and children, and another fig was a famous poet and another fig was a brilliant professor, and another fig was Ee Gee, the amazing editor, and another fig was Europe and Africa and South America, and another fig was Constantin and Socrates and Attila and a pack of other lovers with queer names and offbeat professions, and another fig was an Olympic lady crew champion, and beyond and above these figs were many more figs I couldn&#39;t quite make out. I saw myself sitting in the crotch of this fig tree, starving to death, just because I couldn&#39;t make up my mind which of the figs I would choose. I wanted each and every one of them, but choosing one meant losing all the rest, and, as I sat there, unable to decide, the figs began to wrinkle and go black, and, one by one, they plopped to the ground at my feet.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Much of my life hasn&#39;t played out how I expected. I had dreams like many people in high school and none of them came true. Instead of finishing college I joined the military after the stock market collapse in 2008/9. Impressions were left on me throughout my early life that I only came to know as an adult. My family got sick, I ruined the relationship that I&#39;d worked for, and at times I alienated people close to me out of my own sense of self-defense. I pushed myself to the brink repeatedly. My twenties were filled with stress, frustration, confusion, and at times anger. These things taught me acceptance and forgiveness of both myself and others. Looking back, I would not trade them for an easier or more prestigious life.When I came back from Afghanistan I had to scratch, claw, and climb a ladder without a degree thanks in much part to people who saw in me what I could only hoped to have seen in myself. I looked around me when I arrived and I saw Ivy League and top school graduates with multi-million dollar homes, Teslas, and their own literal fig trees in their back yards that complained about everything in life. I&#39;ve now had the opportunity to live in multiple cultures with varying degrees of prosperity. These things taught me to know my value but to have perspective on what I&#39;m really asking for.Here I am considering selling all my belongings, buying a truck and an RV to go embrace the new open road that is remote work. Life isn&#39;t about looking back. It isn&#39;t even about getting what you want. It&#39;s about navigating the road in front of you and making the best of the opportunities in front of you and for everyone around you. All that to say, I&#39;ve embraced the idea that whatever lies ahead is where I&#39;m supposed to be and I needn&#39;t look at what my neighbors value or what they have because I don&#39;t care. This life is mine to live."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fascinating subject. It looks like many people are commenting about alternative realities and that exploring them is a fool&#39;s game (BTW. I concur with that).The thing which bothers me is upbeat comments about living here and now and planting the seeds for future changes. It feels like current problems (and desire to wish them away via woulda/counda/shoulda) didn&#39;t happen entirely randomly. These problems are a result of systematic behavior/decision making.As an example, it&#39;s too easy to say to yourself, &#34;I will start doing sport tomorrow&#34;. However, you wake up tomorrow and notice that your day is so busy that you don&#39;t have time to do sport until 9pm and by that time you are exhausted and can&#39;t do sport. And you repeat the cycle saying, &#34;maybe tomorrow&#34;. You start teasing your day apart and find that to squeeze in sport won&#39;t require you just to add it, but also to kick something out. And that all the things you have the energy for in the day, you implicitly regarded as more important than sport. And as a result, you are stuck in the loop wishing to do something better but being limited by your other priorities.And frankly, this bothers me way more. The immutability of the past is normal. Being so set in your ways that you can&#39;t change the future - this is what scares the shit out of me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is going to open a huge can of worms when lawyers demand the document history for discovery. You think that the final contract, patent application, user manual, or product specification you wrote is what matters? When the lawyers, regulators, law enforcement, and litigious people want to get you, you&#39;ll have to defend every edit back to beginning of time.&#34;Yes, we know what the final contract says, but based on your edit on January 7, 2003, at 5:21 pm and 0.210403 microseconds, your real intent was ...&#34;.  &#34;And then on June 12, 2006, you took out some words that have a bearing on this lawsuit -- obviously you were trying to cover things up.&#34;I was quite surprised to learn that during patent litigation for example, the history and changes made to your application do matter. I assumed that the final patent as issued is what matters and everything else is irrelevant. Well, lawyers have made it matter, and now things will be 10,000 times worse when they want to find something to argue.So great, now we have to worry about how someone might interpret every single edit rather than the final document."</p>

Are the bindings for other languages usable? Is it possible to have my frontend emit LLVM IR in a text format, similarly to how you can feed assembly language source code to an asssembler? Or should one really just bite the bullet and use C++ to generate the IR? I noticed that the compiler in this tutorial has a frontend in Ocaml and a backend in C++, with the communication between them being done via protobufs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love when folks combine technologies in a new domain and get neat results.  This is a great little demo and probably a cool way to force yourself to learn the related technologies.My first thought was that this could be pretty easily commercialized, which meant someone has probably already done it:https://www.twinkly.com/Here&#39;s the setup, actually seems like a pretty nice UX - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMJ3bLBtGaQEdit: They sell them at BestBuy, brb lol"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll watch the whole video later (as standup maths is generally quite good!) but in quite a lot of skipping around just now, I&#39;m a bit shocked not to have seen a rotating cube drawn on the surface of the tree. That&#39;s the one thing I was specifically expecting for some reason."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Walking in circles within the house and talking to myself out loud: I do this all the time, especially when I need to figure out a particularly hard problem (an algorithm to solve a particular issue, an architecture that handles my business needs etc).Last time I started a new project and worked on its architecture, I walked over 10km in a single day, according to my cellphone pedometer. In a tiny apartment! This trend lasted for a month, after which I sat down to actually implement this.I thought it was just me being autistic but it&#39;s interesting to know others do it as well :)I never worked in an office setting, but I can only imagine it would be extremely prejudicial to people like me and the author. Restraining us to a table would limit our output for the sole reason we would be unable to pace and think (no space and too much social pressure).Anecdata: sometimes I visit my parents and work from their place. I can&#39;t pace there because I don&#39;t feel comfortable doing so, and that alone is enough for me to not be able to tackle challenging problems there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To solve a problem, we need to be smarter than the problem - or the problem needs to be dumber than us.When vocalizing something, you&#39;re forced to constrict the blob of complexity you&#39;re carrying in your head into a linear narrative, which is by definition simpler. Now that you have simplified the problem you are more likely to get hold of it and solve it.This happens all the time - when I am solving a technical/logical problem, sometimes I feel like my wife thinks I am just staring blankly at the screen day-dreaming. So I get insecure and start to explain to her how hard the problem is, but because she&#39;s a physician I have to translate it into common language first, and 99% of the time I say &#34;never mind, got it&#34; before I have a chance to really bore her.Come to think of it, this may be how therapy works. You are forced to take all the &#34;mess&#34; that&#39;s in your head and narrate it to someone else, in the process getting much simpler perspective on it.Writing is the same way for me. For example, all the ideas in this post were in my head in some amorphous way, but now that I wrote them out they became neat little analogies I can use in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is partly why Rubber Duck Debugging[1] can sometimes work, especially if you&#39;re vocalising the steps. I&#39;ve often started typing a question on Stackoverflow when suddenly I solved the issue just by the act of verbalising the question as I type.I&#39;ve found this to also help when I&#39;m doing any sort of creative work or brainstorming, simply talking and explaining as if I&#39;m presenting to an audience helps me generate ideas. Never spoken out loud to myself in public though...[1]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"</p>
