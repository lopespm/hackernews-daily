								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An interesting side point is that the graph optimization approach used here is somewhat similar to modern graph-based visual SLAMThe graph in the article can be seen as a factor graph. VSLAM systems usually have a (kind of bipartite) factor graph with vertices/variables that are either keyframes or ‘good’ features, with edges/factors between features and the frames that see them and between adjacent frames; each of these edges are the factors in the graph. This structure results in very large but sparse graphs, and there are factor graph optimization libraries that take advantage of this sparsity (e.g. g2o or GTSAM.) These libraries also use specialized optimization techniques for some of the nonlinear manifolds (e.g. SO(3)) that arise in SLAM problems."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In general it seems like moderating platforms with millions/billions of users is a fool&#39;s errand, but is required to be attempted due to the level of centralization we&#39;ve ended up with.Regardless of how much of it is automated away via blackbox ML algorithms lacking transparency or via outsourcing to cheap labor that spends their days looking at terribly offensive and shocking content, the end result is going to have countless false positives, a difficult (if even possible) path for users to appeal, and a largely discontent userbase that constantly feels wronged from multiple angles.Having millions of people with thousands of cultures, hundreds of languages, and countless niche styles of communication all be moderated by the same group of people (or the same algorithms) just isn&#39;t a good idea, and I hope that in the long-term we can find ways for communities to self-moderate in more decentralized manners to help improve this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps unpopular opinion, but the US vaccination system is about the worst when it comes to preventing spread.  Instead, it seems to be attempting to prevent death.I&#39;ve always argued that preventing spread would as a byproduct prevent death, but I&#39;m obviously not studied in the field.Put shortly, I would have vaccinated college kids and working age folks first.  They are not likely to die from it, but are far more likely to spread it than elderly and severely diseased folks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a hopeful but possible take. But the 501Y.V2 (B.1.351) and 501Y.V3 (P1) lineages have the mutation within the conserved region for coronaviruses near the spike protein cleavage site. These show massively (1000x) decreased monoclonal antibody binding for original genetic sequence designs. It&#39;s better for the mRNA vaccine produced human-body-made antibodies which show only 5-10x reduction in binding.But antibody binding isn&#39;t the full story and there may be T-cell stuff helping too. The data seems to indicate updated spike protein designs will be needed but if there&#39;s other stuff going on we don&#39;t know about old spike vaccines could still work. I can&#39;t say it will definitely help because the vaccine rollout is so slow and air travel is so fast that this negative pressure will probably provoke more variants as long as host numbers remain high.ref: &#34;Antibody Resistance of SARS-CoV-2 Variants B.1.351 and B.1.1.7&#34; [pdf] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03398-2_reference... https://i.imgur.com/8co1IoL.jpg &#34;SARS-CoV-2 VoC B.1.1.7 and B.1.351 neutralization evasion&#34; table.https://covariants.org/variants/S.501Y.V2 https://covariants.org/variants/S.501Y.V3"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I started free diving for abalone along the Sonoma coast in 2008. The first few years of diving were plentiful and majestic. But my friends and I noticed the changes around 2015. Less sunflower stars and star fish. After some red tide events, the abalone die offs were crazy. Coves that used to have abs stacked on top of each other were almost empty. Finding a 9” abalone became a chore. The thinner kelp forests meant less fish, less life. It’s been difficult to watch first hand. I get sad thinking about the reality that my children will most likely never see the underwater forests that filled my soul and gave me a deep love of the ocean. I hope we can help the system get back in balance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been diving in the Monterey, CA region since 1999 and have seen the change first hand. Sunflower sea stars are now extinct in the area; I haven&#39;t seen one in years. Some of the smaller sea star species have started to gradually recover but they aren&#39;t effective at preying on purple urchins. There is a local group culling urchins but they&#39;ll only be able to cover a small area.https://g2kr.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One reason we don&#39;t have kelp forests in Oregon is due to sea otters having been wiped out, which kept the urchins at bay.[0]Unfortunately, according to OPs article:Others have suggested bringing in another kelp forest predator, the sea otter, to help fight back the urchins. The problem with this appears to be that sea otters aren’t so interested in the skinny, starved urchins occupying the most barren areas, reports Anuradha Varanasi for Inverse. A separate study published this week in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, suggests the otters do eat urchins but that they prefer the more well-fed residents of the coast’s remaining kelp forests to the so-called “zombie urchins” clinging to life in the denuded barrens.[0] - https://oregonwild.org/about/blog/lost-sea-otters-oregon-par..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In terms of single-player games, the figure is more like 85%. You can probably get an additional 5% to work with various levels of tweaking, but compatibility is remarkably good these days. Many games perform better on Linux than they do on Windows (Borderlands, Overwatch), while others give you a chance to have a flawless experience with games that are pretty busted on modern Windows (Diablo 2, Fallout: New Vegas). As another commenter mentioned, the big issue is with anti-cheat: any game implementing EAC will outright not work, full stop. That makes it about a 50/50 chance that multiplayer titles will work on Linux, with some unfortunate casualties like Rainbow Six Siege and Halo MCC&#39;s online multiplayer.With that being said, I truly and honestly believe Linux is the way to go if you&#39;re not into multiplayer. Valve&#39;s commitment to Linux is nothing short of herculean, and it&#39;s heartwarming to see them give back to the open source community in such a remarkable way. If it weren&#39;t for Proton (and DXVK), I&#39;d still be using Windows on my main computer, which made development hell. Now, I feel comfortable moving to a system where I can enjoy Overwatch, Titanfall and Team Fortress on a regular basis without dual-booting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it&#39;s not the topic here so apologies for the digression, but the Mac compatibility on this list is somewhat misleading. Games like TF2 don&#39;t actually work on the Mac any longer unless you stay on or downgrade to Mojave. And even then, the performance and bugginess leaves much to be desired.If you&#39;re using this article at all to make decisions around a Mac for gaming, dive a little deeper to make sure the game you want to play works on Catalina+ (generally requires a full 64 bit port).Back to the actual topic: I had no idea Proton got this good. That&#39;s quite an achievement for Linux gaming. What&#39;s the state of modern GPU support?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was really annoyed when Rocket League dropped native support for Linux, but it turned out it runs much better on my potato under Proton. My only concern now is that they&#39;ll add anti-cheat to it (even though there&#39;s there no real need for it) and Linux will become flagged. The fact that they moved the game to only be available to new players via the Epic client has me worried they&#39;re moving in that direction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A big :+1: for running Docker containers with `--read-only`, forcing you to use explicit writeable volume/bind mounts for all writable data... it&#39;s not just the security benefits, you can also avoid entire classes of problems like:* minimizing the difference between `docker restart` (preserves overlayfs changes) and container re-creates (resets overlayfs back to the image state)* surprise data loss on container redeployments because data was unexpectedly being written to the overlayfs instead of a volume* unexpectedly running out of disk space in `/var/lib/docker` because data was being written outside of a volume* performance issues caused by excessive overlayfs writes (storage drivers and /var/lib/docker not necessarily designed for IO performance)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All of these isolation techniques (and much more) can be used inside systemd units. Write your .service as usual, then run this command on it:  $ systemd-analyze security service-name

It prints out a long list of hardening flags that can be applied inside of your service, like so:    NAME                                                        DESCRIPTION                                                             EXPOSURE
   PrivateNetwork=                                             Service has access to the host&#39;s network                                     0.5
   User=/DynamicUser=                                          Service runs as root user                                                    0.4
   CapabilityBoundingSet=~CAP_SET(UID|GID|PCAP)                Service may change UID/GID identities/capabilities                           0.3
   CapabilityBoundingSet=~CAP_SYS_ADMIN                        Service has administrator privileges                                         0.3
  ...

Here&#39;s what I typically use for a .NET 5 application:  WorkingDirectory        = /opt/appname/app
  ReadWritePaths          = /opt/appname/data
  UMask                   = 0077
  LockPersonality         = yes
  NoNewPrivileges         = yes
  PrivateDevices          = yes
  PrivateMounts           = yes
  PrivateTmp              = yes
  PrivateUsers            = yes
  ProtectClock            = yes
  ProtectControlGroups    = yes
  ProtectHome             = yes
  ProtectHostname         = yes
  ProtectKernelLogs       = yes
  ProtectKernelModules    = yes
  ProtectKernelTunables   = yes
  ProtectSystem           = strict
  RemoveIPC               = yes
  RestrictAddressFamilies = AF_UNIX AF_INET AF_INET6
  RestrictNamespaces      = yes
  RestrictRealtime        = yes
  RestrictSUIDSGID        = yes
  SystemCallArchitectures = native
  ProtectProc             = invisible
  CapabilityBoundingSet   =
  SystemCallFilter        = ~@clock @module @mount @raw-io @reboot @swap @privileged @cpu-emulation @obsolete

ReadWritePaths should be replaced with a combination of DynamicUser + writing local persistent data to $STATE_DIRECTORY, but I&#39;m too lazy to do that yet.See systemd.exec(5) for more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use Hadolint[1] as a CI job to check if my Dockerfiles follow the good &#34;rules&#34;. But there is one rule that annoys me the most and which is also present in this article, is the pinned OS package version rule[2]. While I understand its interest, I struggle to handle this problem.When I build new images and it fails because the pinned version is not available anymore, I have to dig into Debian or Ubuntu packages websites to find the new ones as they don&#39;t keep the old packages online.I know I could ask Hadolint to ignore this rule but I don&#39;t like this and I think it&#39;s important to stick to a certain version of a package to avoid problems. I&#39;m just trying to find any tip that could make me use pinned version and avoid this manual search every time I have to. Does apt-get install allows wildcard for example?1: https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint2: https://github.com/hadolint/hadolint/wiki/DL3008"</p>
