								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recall from my time in Google Geo years ago that the idea of integrating Search and Maps was a big part of the &#34;New Maps&#34; release that happened around 2014. The rumor I heard was that someone (possibly even Larry himself) wanted to be able to have interactive maps directly on the search results page, so that the navigation from a search query to a map wouldn&#39;t involve even a page reload. So the big Maps frontend rewrite actually ended up merging MFE into GWS, the web search frontend server. I recall seeing maps hosted at google.com/maps around that time, but I don&#39;t know if that was ever launched fully or if it was just an experiment.In any case, though, my understanding is that the technical capacity for this has existed for nearly 10 years now, just behind a configuration setting. So it&#39;s possible that this change is just a code cleanup. It&#39;s also possible that someone is trying to increase the percentage of searches that have location information, that doesn&#39;t seem terribly far-fetched either, and I can imagine lots of ways people could try to rationalize it as actually benefiting users. (Whether it actually does benefit users is of course debatable.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fantastic example of motivated reasoning. This &#34;change&#34; (which apparently isn&#39;t even new) can have so many different reasons, some of which are less harmful and some of which are probably worse (privacy-wise) than the one mentioned here. There is no indication that re/mis-using permissions is specifically what they wanted to do here, there is also no example of them doing it right now. Don&#39;t get me wrong, there is also no evidence that this isn&#39;t the real reason and that they wouldn&#39;t do that in the future. But the blog post basically list a single symptom and jumps right to the one conclusion that fits what the author expects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funny thing is, it depends on your threat model.Using google.com/XXX for all its services protect the user from being spied by external actors such as ISP because everything is hidden behind HTTPS.Whereas, with XXX.google.com, external actors knows that you are using service XXX."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon is the third largest advertising company after Google and Meta. Its ad revenue is $32B (and growing fast, the run rate is $40B). That is half the revenue of AWS, which is worth 70% of Amazon&#39;s market cap. The inescapable conclusion is that Amazon&#39;s advertising is worth the remaining 30% of Amazon&#39;s market cap and Amazon&#39;s e-commerce arm is deemed worthless by Wall Street, its only purpose being to support the advertising business, just what Google Search is to Alphabet.Think on that for a moment. The other inescapable conclusion is that whenever the quality of the shopping experience on Amazon and the needs of Amazon&#39;s advertising business clash, advertising will win (just as it has on Google). That&#39;s an even more foregone conclusion since Andy Jassy took on the top job, he&#39;s from AWS and owes no special allegiance to the historical e-commerce business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My process for getting usable results on Amazon (.co.uk, presumably the others too):1. Search for thing2. Filter by department (necessary for 3)3. Filter by Seller: only Amazon4: Filter by reviews: 4 stars+5: Sort by price, Low &gt; High6: (Further filters as appropriate)7: Look at only products with a high number of reviews8: For every product, &#34;See all reviews&#34; and filter on &#34;Verified purchase only&#34; and &#34;Show only reviews for {the product variant you&#39;re actually looking at}&#34;. Closely scrutinise 1 and 2 star reviews.But sometimes even this _still_ doesn&#39;t get me quite what I want, because when an item is sold both by Amazon and a 3rd-party it can be sorted based on the non-Amazon price.It does feel just a little like Amazon&#39;s goals might not be perfectly aligned with those of the customer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So the 8 pin modular connector(rj-45) may not be the best connector in the world(the 8088 sas connector is a serious contender for that honor), but it does one thing better than any most connectors, it is designed to be field terminated, and as such is easy to fix. the crimping dies are ubiquitous, the process is simple. because of this single fact, I think it is better than just about any other connector in widespread use. because you can fix the infernal thing.As such the article left me a bit confused, why not just cut off the end and putting a new plug on? with an 8 pin connector this is very easy. But I am in the industry and tend to have a crimper close to hand. perhaps some are not as fortunate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Around 2010-2015 there were a whole bunch of these distributed git bugtrackers and none of them took off.  Most are completely dead.  IIRC one of the biggest problems was its feature: issue state being distributed as it is, it was very easy for developers to end up with issues having different states/comments, and depending on the implementation even differed across local branches.  But also in a work environment there was no place for project managers to view/create/update issues.I remember listing out 4-5 of these in the past when the topic has come up, but the only old one I can remember/find right now is https://github.com/dspinellis/git-issueEdit - Found some more using duckduckgo instead of google:* https://github.com/jashmenn/ditz (last update 12 years ago)* https://bugseverywhere.org/ (I think this was the most popular at one point)* https://github.com/marekjm/issue (this is separate from git-issue above)* A blog post from 2012 that lists these and a few others (half the links are dead): http://www.cs.unb.ca/~bremner/blog/posts/git-issue-trackers/From the blog post, the additional ones where the links still work:* https://github.com/chilts/cil (last updated 11 years ago)* http://syncwith.us/sd/ (last updated 6 years ago)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Valve&#39;s continual focus on Linux (SteamOS 1.0 was released eight years ago) is honestly incredible, Proton even sometimes works better than native Linux builds. Truly nobody else (in the gaming space) is doing it like Valve are. I saw a talk[1] from a KDE dev talking about features Valve sponsored to be added to KDE Plasma and it&#39;s things that are useful for everyone outside the context of the steam deck.The only thing that doesn&#39;t really work I&#39;ve noticed is when games have an online component, whether it&#39;s like easy anti cheat which I&#39;ve heard should be just flipping a switch to enable but I haven&#39;t seen anyone actually do that,  or some weirdness happening with whatever the new Microsoft Flight Simulator is doing that makes it seemingly a 50/50 coin toss as to whether it&#39;ll run with the exact same settings.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0gEIeFgDX0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proton was instrumental in my move from Windows to Linux. With over 400 games in my back catalog, I didn&#39;t want to lose thousands of dollars not to mention thousands of hours on games which I enjoy.Thus far, 92% of games have ran flawlessly for me on Fedora (4 failures in the last 50). The main issues have been related to games that have kernel mode drivers for copy protection or other exotic types of anti-cheat. Perhaps most amazing (to me anyway) is the fact that mods and workshop items work perfectly. In most cases, I could pop open a saved game and continue on Linux, custom mods included.Performance-wise, I haven&#39;t noticed a difference but I generally run very modern hardware which works better with the DirectX to Vulcan implementation. I also swapped to an AMD chip/gpu when moving to Linux and I think that removed the headaches that people often have with Nvidia drivers. Overall, it&#39;s been fantastic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had to go figure out what Proton is:&#34;Proton is a tool for use with the Steam client which allows games which are exclusive to Windows to run on the Linux operating system. It uses Wine to facilitate this.&#34;https://github.com/ValveSoftware/Proton"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since the list mentions grep -o (--only-matching) and regex. Here is my preferred trick to extract a specific part of a line and circumvent the lack of capture groups in grep.Imagine you have a line containing  prefix 1234 suffix

and want to only grep the number but need to match prefix and/or suffix to not grep another unwanted number.Can be solved with  grep --only-matching --perl-regexp &#39;prefix \K\d+(?= suffix)&#39;

The magic is &#39;\K&#39; which kind of resets the &#39;matched buffer&#39;. [1] So anything before \K is matched but not outputted with -o (or without -o anything before \K would not be highlighted).And for the suffix: (?=) is a positive lookahead [2] which checks if, in this case, &#39; suffix&#39; is found after the number but also does not include it in the &#39;matched buffer&#39;.So the output for  echo &#34;prefix 1234 suffix&#34; | grep --only-matching --perl-regexp &#39;prefix \K\d+(?= suffix)&#39;

is only  1234

PS: instead of \K the prefix could also be wrapped in a positive lookbehind (?&lt;=prefix )[1] https://perldoc.perl.org/perlrebackslash#%5CK[2] https://www.rexegg.com/regex-lookarounds.html"</p>

Most &#34;You might like this&#34; algorithms go straight for the low-hanging fruit, and often fail to take any kind of nuance into account.I can&#39;t tell you how many of the streaming services will see my Black Sabbath play history and immediately recommend, &#34;If you like Black Sabbath, you should love...Slipknot!&#34; But I&#39;ve never had a real person make that mistake, because a real person who looks at my last.fm history and has an understanding of the genre says &#34;Gee, this guy has plenty of Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, and tons of doom metal on his list, but doesn&#39;t have Slipknot, Korn, or Pantera in his history. Maybe that&#39;s intentional.&#34;Human review and recommendation still beats algorithmic recommendation by a mile if you have discerning tastes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last.fm died (as in for me personally) when I stopped cultivating my own music library. I used to have gigabytes of MP3s and FLACs, all neatly organised into folders, usually by artist/album, and meticulously maintained ID3 tags. All played through software like Winamp with the audioscrobbler plugin, or iTunes when I had my beloved iPod classic.All of that drifted away as I got older, and the dawn of streaming services like Spotify came onto the scene. I&#39;m not sure where my music is now, probably on a hard drive somewhere, dumped amongst other junk.I think spotify used to come with last.fm support but I think I just lost interest in the whole thing, I don&#39;t consume music in the same way as when I was a younger man.EDIT: Just logged into my last.fm account and it looks like the scrobbling still works from spotify, so it&#39;s been scrobbling all this time, probably for 10+ years without me logging in!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Contrary to popular belief Last.fm never really died (and I hope it never will), however it lost years ago its most valuable thing: *its own streaming service*.It was just perfect at everything, was it finding new releases, discovery obscure gems, or play your favorite things all over. It was so magical that you could hardly believe it was computer generated.Also, it was a wonderful &#34;sane&#34; social network where music and only music was at its heart: no vanity metrics (eg: counting likes) / vanity egos (eg: influencers) or purely material interests (eg: make money from this or that).Anyway, it&#39;s sad it lost the streaming war pretty soon. Maybe it was just too genuine to compete with services driven by dark patterns, suspicious agendas, and mostly, greed.Wait, is this a metaphor of the old internet versus the present state of digital affairs? Or am I just getting nostalgic here?I don&#39;t know. Long live Last.fm!111,920 Scrobbles from 9,137 Artists since Jul 2006."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s a liquid-sodium-cooled, graphite-core system with no need for pumps, aka &#39;passively cooled&#39; via heat [edit] pipes. Output is:&gt; &#34;The microreactor can generate 5 MW of electricity or 13 MW of heat from a 15 MW thermal core. Exhaust heat from the power conversion system can be used for district heating applications or low-temperature steam.&#34;Control systems are kind of interesting:&gt; &#34;The only moving or mechanical parts in the reactor system are reactivity control drums, which manage the power level and allow absorber material to passively turn inward toward the core if power demand is reduced or lost, and turn a reflector material toward the core if demand increases automatically. Hence the term “nuclear battery.”&#34;I&#39;m generally not a nuclear advocate but if they&#39;ve really managed to eliminate the need for active cooling, and have a robust system that can safely shut down with concerns about meltdown even without external power, that&#39;s a pretty big advance.  Looks remarkably promising... keep your fingers crossed. (New nuclear tech hasn&#39;t had the greatest track record over the past several decades, i.e. pebble beds didn&#39;t work out etc.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the price is right and medium size communities could get their acts together, something like this could potentially disrupt the entire grid model. In California, regardless of what wholesale electricity costs, the retail cost is something like $200/MWh more than could be considered reasonable. Put another way, the utility (PG&amp;E) is charging an immense premium.  Normally, displacing PG&amp;E would be impractical:a. The actual transmission system is a phenomenally large capital investment developed over many decades.  You can’t just VC up a new electric grid in a developed area.  And the incumbent mostly owns the existing infrastructure.b. Regulation, good and bad.It’s possible to sell power to the utility for a reasonable price per MWh.  But one can’t easily sell to the utility’s customers.But this reactor is small!  5 MW could serve maybe 1000 expensive homes in an expensive area without an enormous transmission system.  Anyone trying to disrupt the incumbent utility with something like this has $200/MWh of inefficiency to exploit. $24k per day of operation will offset a decent amount of capital cost and regulatory effort to get the electricity to customers.Put another way, a wealthy community could buy a few of these, figure out local distribution, and ditch the incumbent utility. This could be fantastic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most of the OP is quotes from the article which discussed a few days ago here:Why Meta’s latest large language model survived only three days online - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33670124 - Nov 2022 (119 comments)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I replied to LeCun&#39;s claims about their latest protein structure predictor and he immediately got defensive.  The problem is that i&#39;m an expert in that realm and he is not.  My statements were factual (pointing out real limitations in their system along with the lack of improvement over AlphaFold) and he responded by regurgitating the same misleading claims everybody in ML who doesn&#39;t understand biology makes.  I&#39;ve seen this pattern repeatedly.It&#39;s too bad because you really do want leaders who listen to criticism carefully and don&#39;t immediately get defensive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a bright-eyed science undergraduate, I went to my first conference thinking how amazing it would be to have all these accomplished and intelligent people in my field all coming together to share their knowledge and make the world a better place.And my expectations were exceeded by the first speaker.  I couldn&#39;t wait for 3 full days of this!  Then the second speaker got up, and spent his entire presentation telling why the first person was an idiot and totally wrong and his research was garbage because his was better.  That&#39;s how I found out my field of study was broken into two warring factions, who spent the rest of the conference arguing with each other.I left the conference somewhat disillusioned, having learned the important life lesson that just because you&#39;re a scientist doesn&#39;t mean you aren&#39;t also a human, with all the lovely human characteristics that entails.  And compared to this fellow, the amount of money and fame at stake in my tiny field was miniscule.  I can only imagine the kinds of egos you see at play among the scientists in this article."</p>
