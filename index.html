								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You might want to check stuff like virtual office service, incorporation in an EU country, they start really cheap, as well as getting a VPS to bounce from. And stuff like Electronic Money Institutes for at least some really basic banking.Fair warning though, some of these things look rather shady so use some common sense and be careful with your local legislation (See MrDisposables response)edit: To elaborate on the last part see what happened in Kazakhstan recently. Their outage lasted luckily only shortly but you might not have to think about only western sanction but also Russias distaste for VPNs as well as the possibility for having your internet cut. Sure Kazakhstan is a lot smaller in terms of internet infrastructure, but there didnt seem to have been a way around their shutdown. You are then only left with satellite as well as maybe coverage from the neighboring countries. Both getting really expensive with a devaluing currency and at high threat of sanctions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article hits on something I&#39;ve felt for a long time. The idea that &#34;hooks are superior&#34; to me is ridiculous. If a linter is required to tell me when I&#39;m writing a bug that is not immediately obvious, that is a failing in the framework to round those edges. Lints are not rounded edges!Solid is nice and _seems_ to fix the issues with hooks, but as another comment mentioned, the challenge is with building at scale. It&#39;s unclear to me how this scales and where the sharp edges are.React IMO trades off performance in exchange for ergonomics. These ergonomics bear fruit early on, but you start dealing with this debt very quickly. As &#34;nice&#34; as Redux is, I shouldn&#39;t need it so early. React is designed in a way that results in pretty terrible performance. I once wrote a React app, and discovered perf issues 2 weeks in. Any UI framework I used in the past would have scaled beyond this point without having to have the data layer rewritten. Frameworks of the past also had what seemed like way less &#34;magic&#34;.I totally accept that it&#39;s seriously nice to write, but how many trees has React alone burnt?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"New JS frameworks always make for compelling hello world examples.Can you branch on state or use loops over data in Solid.js? The reason _why_ React has a virtual DOM is to enable more interesting relationships between your data and your presentation. Anyone can make a framework that makes the source code for an incrementing number look pretty!As an example of this point, check out the &#34;Simple Todos&#34; example for Solid.js[1].In React, we render lists by using regular JavaScript idioms like loops, arrays, and array methods like map. However in Solid.js, much like traditional templating languages, we get a construct like &lt;For&gt; that reinvents a concept that&#39;s already in the language.I&#39;ve been writing React and React-alike code for a long time. I think that fine-grained updates avoiding reconciliation are a good idea, especially for performance. At one point, I built a React-like library for Roblox and Lua whose most novel feature ended up being &#34;Bindings&#34;[2], which look sorta like Solid.js state containers. They create little hot-path data dependencies, but the bulk of your components still use normal React-like rendering.  [1]: https://www.solidjs.com/examples/todos

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author lost me in the introduction.&gt; &#34;Ohhh, an OO pattern with a couple of one-liner lifecycle methods is just WAY too much code!  Higher likelihood for errors and worse developer experience.&#34;...&gt; &#34;So instead, I&#39;m going to replace this with a functional pattern, that crams a couple of lifecycle functions into a closure, and is riddled with edge cases and common developer mistakes.&#34;This article perfectly crystalizes why my career has tracked toward the backend over the past decade.  All of the virtual ink in this article, and honestly most of the complexity in the field overall... and it seems to really all just boil down to, &#34;I think this looks cooler.&#34;"</p>

A lot of apps from various APK mirrors just straight up don&#39;t work, even when they seem like they shouldn&#39;t be affected at alll.F-Droid has been a great source for apps, especially when I&#39;m seeking a particular need without a specific app in mind. Most recently that&#39;s been wanting a file browser and a PDF reader. The open-source focus is a nice bonus, but more importantly I consider its stability to be the best of all Play Store alternatives I&#39;ve tried."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; A pat on the shoulder might be a friendly greeting—or a search for a sacred thread that some dominant-caste Hindu men wear beneath their shirtsI&#39;m a non-dalit Indian working in silicon valley. I know that caste based discrimination is still prevalent in India and not surprised that it continues in here in silicon valley as well amongst Indian community but I&#39;m surprised to read this part in the article. I have never heard of someone doing a scan for sacred thread. Also, it&#39;s worth noting that most non-dalit people also do not wear this sacred thread so whoever is doing this scan isn&#39;t familiar with India or probably this part is made up in the article.That said, I know that it&#39;s much harder for a dalit person to progress in India as the society still tries to pull them behind. Indian govt has reservations in colleges and jobs for dalit community, which I believe has helped the community a lot in last 50 years or so, helping many to bring their families out of poverty. But, still there&#39;s a long way to go. Also, a long way to go for non-dalit community to abolish this discrimination.My heart goes with our dalit brothers &amp; sisters and glad to hear that their issues are being discussed in silicon valley as well now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The reason for my current user name here at hn was this exact form of racism. It is the first post I made when I created this throwaway. I was assured that my experience was unique and not widespread. I am both sad and happy to see this, sad because it exists, happy because it is getting some attention here at HN.I would like to take this opportunity to point out that everyone of us needs to be vigilant about this type of racism. One thing I recommend to my hiring managers is to not allow people from frictioned backgrounds to manage and interview people from the other side. Example problematic pairs for candidates/interviewers (not including the cast situation) include: Indians and Pakistanis, Serbians and Bosnians, Greeks and Turks, Chinese and Japanese.One way I solve this is by introducing an independent observer/participant when situations like this emerge. This is costly but it has really worked to not only address this problem but also created an amazing diversity in my teams because it takes care of some of the implicit bias we all have to some degree."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"6) Sending data but staying on the current page.You can make links or forms submit but not cause browser navigation by having your server respond with a 204 No Content.I feel like this is a completely forgotten technique, but we used this a ton pre-AJAX for little one off things to shoot a message to the server without interruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1–4 are good, but 5 is not. The checkbox hack is decent in a few places (though I’d say &lt;details&gt; is normally a better choice now, and the checkbox hack should be accompanied by certain ARIA properties and augmented with some JavaScript to twiddle properties as it’s used), but dark mode is not one of them. The checkbox hack is only suitable for transient state that you actively don’t want to persist over page loads. Probably the most popular historical application of it is hamburger menus (but &lt;details&gt; or `:hover, :focus-within` are better for that now). I think a more reasonable solution for dark mode is the media query (prefers-color-scheme: dark), following the browser preference by default and augmented by JavaScript to allow overriding that. https://chrismorgan.info/blog/dark-theme-implementation/ describes my own implementation, which is the most comprehensive and efficient client-side-only implementation that I know of, as perfect as it’s possible to be while being client-side-only and without getting into service workers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"2 (Sidebar) is not usable on mobile, because there is no good hover event. Since mobile-first is almost a necessity, it won&#39;t work this way.Accordions make most sense as a table of contents, although they are often used in FAQs. But in FAQs, you can&#39;t use the browser&#39;s search on page to find collapsed words. So you trade better scrollability for searching on the page. Not sure how many people use &#34;search on page&#34; on mobile devices though.1 + 3 are great though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"F-droid gets many things right (e.g. verifiable builds), but it&#39;s just not usable in practice.Installing applications is a rare event, updating them is frequent, and needs to disrupt the user as little as possible. Android used to not allow alternative app stores to update apps without user interaction, but now supports this through UPDATE_PACKAGES_WITHOUT_USER_ACTION, which doesn&#39;t seem to be supported by F-droid. So it&#39;s manual clicking for each update.F-droid also somehow gets the regular update flow wrong and often (always?) shows an error when you try to install the update from the notification. That has remained unfixed for years. So you have to manually open it, initiate the update, then click through the dialogs.Additionally, the official repos update so slowly that they&#39;re useless for fast-moving stuff like NewPipe.Together with Android bugs like https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/204233247 (resetting all &#34;open with&#34; URIs on update), this makes using packages installed through F-Droid a nightmare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"App developer&#39;s perspective.  I have a few apps on all major places, including F-Droid.  The &#39;no user accounts&#39; thing makes developing and distributing on F-Droid a freeing experience, as compared to the G/A &#39;jails&#39;.  There is no pressure to meet arbitrary undocumented restrictions, you are not subject to the whims of dehumanizing AI routines, there are no ratings and reviews (the feedback is direct). The build and deployment process is not really my problem, as part of their Reproducible Builds, even that aspect is taken care of. https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Reproducible_Builds/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried something like this once and it worked surprisingly well, even for a UGC site.Years back we were doing something that included users documenting TV shows. We had a big meeting where people put every feature they wanted on index cards. We laid the cards out a founder&#39;s dining room table. The host got their change jar and each person got a certain number of pennies to mark features they thought were vital for first launch.After the first round of token-voting, the &#34;user accounts&#34; card had no votes. At first it seemed impossible. But after some discussion, we realized that viewing users didn&#39;t need accounts for launch. For people who wanted to edit, we let them type in a name to take credit for their contributions if they wanted, but with no verification. At worst, we figured we could add something more robust if the need were stronger.It turned out fine. The launch got out earlier and we got to test a number of key product hypotheses without having to build any sort of user account system. Months later it did eventually become the highest priority. But not having accounts worked way longer than I expected."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I follow some of the writings of Nassim Taleb. I came to the conclusion that RISC-V will &#34;succeed&#34; because there&#39;s no way for it to fail. It&#39;s like Linux.I don&#39;t think licensing fees to ARM are a problem per se, it&#39;s the &#34;frictional costs&#34; that it introduces. My understanding is that the Raspberry Pi developed their RP2040 because ARM had a reasonable package available for its low-end Cortex-M processors, which doesn&#39;t apply to their higher-end Cortex ones.RISC-V doesn&#39;t even have these restrictions. Even extremely small outfits can play around with RISC-V designs. Most of them won&#39;t go very far, but with enough lottery tickets, one of them is bound to draw the winning numbers.Sure there are considerable obstacles. I toy with microcontrollers. For hobbyists like me, ARM processors are still the most sensible choice. I&#39;m not expecting any shift from that for at least five years. But who knows after that? Anything can happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real reason RISC-V is succeeding, relative to ARM:If you make your own CPU- With ARM, You have to pay ARM for ISA license (after a several months long negotiation), and you cannot license your CPU design to anyone, as ARM has the exclusive right to do that with their designs.- With RISC-V, you get a free ISA license, and you can license your CPU design to others.If you do not make your own CPU- With ARM, you can (after a several months long negotiation) license one of the few designs ARM has available. There&#39;s no other vendors that can offer you ARM CPU designs.- With RISC-V, right now, you can license any among hundreds of options available, from tens of vendors. The licensing process is usually very short and straightforward. Alternatively, there are some open hardware designs. You can get commercial support for some of them.Frankly, unless ARM does radically change their business model, I do not expect them to survive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work with RISC-V these days.many AI chips are using RISC-V.A non-technical perspective about RISC-V: China is leading to some extent in RISC-V land(Sifive works with Hifive in China, Alibaba released its RISC-V,etc). China could not license x86, could not acquire MIPS, tried to get part of ARM now(the China ARM company is fighting with ARM), but the big land needs to &#34;own&#34; a CPU core at will desperately, RISC-V fits perfectly well."</p>

A plaque states &#34;The operational semantics of the most basic primitives of your operating system are designed to simplify the implementation of shells.&#34; You hesitantly lift your eyes to the item presented upon the pedestal, take a pause in respect, then turn away slumped and disappointed but not entirely surprised. As you walk you shake your head trying to evict the after image of a beam of light illuminating a turd."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Ninja, which needs to spawn a lot of subprocesses but it otherwise not especially large in memory and which doesn&#39;t use threads, we moved from fork to posix_spawn (which is the &#34;I want fork+exec immediately, please do the smartest thing you can&#34; wrapper) because it performed better on OS X and Solaris:https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/commit/89587196705f54af..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Long ago, I, like many Unix fans, thought that fork(2) and the fork-exec process spawning model were the greatest thing, and the Windows sucked for only having exec() and _spawn(), the last being a Windows-ism.I appreciate this quite a bit. Vocal Unix proponents tend to believe that anything Unix does is automatically better than Windows, sometimes without even knowing what the Windows analogue is. Programming in both is necessary to have an informed opinion on this subject.The one thing I miss most on Unix: the unified model of HANDLEs that enables you to WaitOnMultipleObjects() with almost any system primitive you could want, such as an event with a socket (blocking I/O + a shutdown notification) in one call. On Unix, a flavor of select() tends to be the base primitive for waiting on things to happen, which means you end up writing adapter code for file descriptors to other resources, or need something like eventfd.Things I don&#39;t miss from Windows at all: wchar_t everywhere. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good, this should be standard.I don&#39;t  understand how you can have a labor market where only one side has information on what the salaries are for an industry through a team that does market research. It depresses wages, mostly for internal employees who aren&#39;t paying attention bc they&#39;re content with their jobs.Price transparency leads to more efficient markets, no reason the labor market is any different. A company hiring an employee under market rate, because the employee doesn&#39;t know what market rate is, is a failure.EDIT: Wanted to add that this hits closer to home for me b/c I&#39;ve personally experienced this.Went out and jumped companies and got a 300% raise b/c I was underpaid at the prev, only know that thanks to levels.fyi. New hires at my level were making almost double what I was.When other engineers at my current company talk about salary, or total comp more generally, they vastly underestimate the state of the market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a candidate, I hate applying to jobs only to get a lowball offer at the end. So I appreciate bills like this.As a hiring manager, I see that this is actually not so simple. You give someone a range, say $100-150k. I ASSURE you that they are thinking they are closer to 150k than 100. So good luck giving an offer for $100k, even though that might be what that particular candidate is worth to you.It&#39;s never gonna happen, but what i&#39;d rather see is an option to instead give current median total comp on the team i&#39;m interviewing for, plus maybe the 25-75 percentile range. That gives me a sense of what I should expect, plus what the salary growth path might be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"this is one of those ostensibly good ideas that has some downsides which are often not discussed - the main one of which, is salary depression.Forcing employers to publish salaries on job ads will inevitably lead to wide salary bands (lets see how absurd they get) with a low ceiling on the upper tier. Employers know that if they publish a high number, job candidates are naturally going to want to shoot for it, and would be disappointed if they got significantly less than the maximum advertised, compromising offer acceptance rates. Hence employers will set a lower &#39;maximum&#39; salary than they might actually pay if the salary was hidden.See UK public sector for evidence of this; salaries must be published, maximum is always significantly lower than equivalent job in private sector."</p>
