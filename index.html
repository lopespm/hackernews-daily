YouTube will say the reporting was misuse of their terms and was a cyberattack from state level actors implying their reporting algo isn’t actually at fault. They will mention that the automated algo protects children and at risk people. They will then reinstate the accounts and say they are sorry for the temporary inconvenience and pleased that they could respond so swiftly. And the algos won’t change, not one bit. And there will still be no human oversite of these sorts of bans."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Again, simply watching or having watched live streams from Kiev might net you a ban.&gt; If you watched any Kiev livestream it may have been the reason for your termination. It happened to a lot of us too, it seems some Russian bots have been mass-reporting every single person that watched them&gt; Yes, yesterday night I watched a livestream. Im shocked&gt; I also watched a Livestream yesterday night. How i wish I didn&#39;t now since my account got terminated.https://www.reddit.com/r/youtube/comments/t1445p/this_accoun..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This should come as a surprise to absolutely nobody.  People have been complaining for a decade now that all automated takedown bots are ripe for abuse are are actively being abused by media cartels.  You can&#39;t be shocked when systems that enable abuse are abused by foreign intelligence services.Google has said it is cheaper to ignore the problem and until that changes they aren&#39;t going to fix it.  And remember that on the other end of these abusive systems are corporations that are willing to sue individuals for literally billions of dollars over sharing files.Big corporations will not have your back when it could affect their income stream."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Author here, didn’t expect to see this here again after two years!I guess I’ll give a quick update on how things have been since this article was written. I haven’t used or studied French much since then, and have gotten quite rusty, though I’ve had a few conversations fully in French in the last few months and can still maintain a conversation. I have been thinking of picking up French again soon, as traveling to a French speaking country becomes more of an option.I also did roughly the same thing with my Spanish in the following year, with similar results, though I’d say I probably reached a solid B1.5 or weak B2 after a year (due to COVID I was unable to take the proficiency test and lost some motivation to continue studying to a high level as a result.)My recommendations are still largely the same, though I haven’t used these resources (e.g. Duolingo) since I stopped studying a while back. And as others have noted, for other languages, particularly those that are less closely related to English (e.g. Japanese), you’ll have to follow a different path to achieve the same proficiency. However, language learning resources are getting better constantly, so you can certainly still learn quite a lot without total, in-person immersion, as I did!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned Spanish, too, in about 12 months to dogfood my new app for learning vocabulary (which I just recently launched) [0]Even though I made an app that helped me along the way to learn words, I don&#39;t believe in a single app/book/approach for learning a language. You need to expose yourself to A LOT of different language materials.I was learning for about 2h a day, 6 times a week. I would read articles, books, websites in Spanish. I would watch YouTube videos [1]. I would read news, initially for beginners [2] and later regular [3]. And most importantly, I would have 4-5h a week itakly conversations.After 6 months I understood quite a lot, but couldn&#39;t speak almost at all. Then magic happens and 6 months later, I was having a normal conversation (though still with some errors) about any range of topics: politics, global warming, travel, engineering etc.I believe the key for me was to read a lot of books which were interesting to me. For example I read Bill Gate&#39;s book &#34;How To Avoid A Climate Disaster&#34; in Spanish, as well as about ~8 others in the first 12 months.[0] https://www.obstino.com[1] https://www.youtube.com/c/DreamingSpanish[2] www.newsinslowspanish.com[3] https://elpais.com"</p>

I can 100% confirm that all money in the world is just literally numbers, and it is balanced by the different federal reserve systems around the world to ensure no one can &#34;create&#34; money without notifying everyone.I guess if I was super cool I would do an AMA because this is the only thread that is really my time to shine hahaha."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I often wonder how money is stored.It can&#39;t be just a number on a computer in a bank, right? Otherwise some Russian bank could just increase that number to whatever they like. And say &#34;Look, we own 100 Trillion USD. Now let&#39;s go shopping.&#34;.So I guess USD needs to be recognized by the US somehow?Could the US simply &#34;void&#34; all USD that are owned by Russia?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Russia has also been building an in-house system since 2014—the last time SWIFT cutoff was threatened—which may mean they are able to temper some of the impact a cutoff would have on its economy.If they&#39;re building a replacement, doesn&#39;t that also mean we should use &#34;cut off SWIFT&#34; now, rather than later when it&#39;ll be ineffective?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d actually put the blame here on browsers, and how limited the default inputs are.There are too many needlessly reimplemented components, but anyone that has ever needed to style a &lt;select&gt; to make it look in line with any modern design quickly reached desperation.I&#39;d love to be able to use standard components everywhere, but most of my users care if my website looks like it&#39;s from 2004."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Worst of those I encounter regularly is US sites trying to constrain your input to numbers only on certain fields.
Not &#34;letting you input anything and marking it invalid if you put something other than a number&#34;, but listening to which key is pressed to allow the typing or not.
On French keyboards, typing a number requires the use of the SHIFT key. So I regularly need to change my keyboard layout just to type a couple numbers in a form field because someone thought they&#39;d be smart..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with the author that custom components don’t capture all the interaction details. Many times they are not accessible or cannot implement cross-platform input well.However, I disagree with:&gt; The browser’s built-in controls are quite sufficient.The problem is that browser components are good for simple forms but insufficient for other types of interaction.A good example is select. Using the select tag is the best way to have a dropdown list that’s accessible and supports mobile. But, select doesn’t cover most of the cases that you need for a complex app.Many of the WAI ARIA authoring examples  (including the combobox patterns) are not covered by built in components. Interaction patterns like pop ups, dialogs, or lookup lists are quite common for an app… but hard to do in an accessible/cross-platform way.Web browsers need to do something different to support accessible/usable apps. The idea of leaving all those things to WebComponents makes sense, but the result is reinventing the broken wheel on each app."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PeerTube is pretty sweet.  If you post videos on YouTube, I&#39;d suggest you also find a PeerTube instance you like, and host your videos there as well.  Think of it as a backup for YouTube, for when they nuke your account for some unknown/undisclosed reason[0][1][2], while also participating in (and thereby somewhat supporting) platforms that don&#39;t surveil your every granular action.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30401241[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23758547[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12163892"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was looking at this before and went to https://open.tube/ to explore the content to see how the community looked.  The front page had a video of extreme violence on it and I never returned.  Looking now the front page is mostly political flamebait.A real community growing on the back of this technology will require either YouTube screwing up royally or some sort of grassroots effort based on micro payments to content creators (as opposed to ads) I think."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really hope that activitypub and the federated web end up becoming the technologies that &#34;win&#34; out of all the nonsense that is &#34;Web3&#34;, but the wildly successful monetization of traditional web platforms and the &#34;different-but-more&#34; monetization of the crypto-obsessed vision of Web3 are nearly impossible for platforms like Peertube and Mastodon to effectively win out against."</p>

One of the top devs took a look at it, and saw that the text was sent to Grammarly&#39;s server unencrypted and warned everyone not to use it. Some still did.At my previous engagement, a large number of staff spoke English as a second or third language, and Grammarly was prevalent. Even as a native English speaker, they wanted me to use it as a sort of proof reader. I&#39;ll admit that it caught some of my dumber mistakes, but I never felt comfortable using it. I could have proof-read my work better is all. Perhaps if I wasn&#39;t given mind-numbing work, the quality would have been better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a huge AMD fan but this is bonkers.Yes, Intel has floundered for a number of years, but at the same time they are a foundry themselves, second only to TSMC (for now), have incredible manufacturing capacity, and seem poised to start pushing interesting CPU designs as well as having their foundry half finally start executing correctly. Also their growth potential for their GPU business is huuuuuuge.As someone who enjoys AMD for the competition they bring, I am worried what the next few years might look like for them for the following reasons:1. AMD GPUs were actually very competitive with their RDNA2 architecture, but at the same time AMD enjoyed a huge silicon advantage as they were on TSMC while NVIDIA was on Samsung (for consumer). The next generation of NVIDIA consumer GPUs will be made by TSMC and if their professional GPUs (see A100 which are made by TSMC) are any indication we can see potentially up to 1.5x to 2x efficiency bump for NVIDIA.2. Intel seems to be cleaning up shop and their latest generation of CPUs feel like a 1st Gen Ryzen moment. Also, Intel does not have to clearly surpass AMD, they just need to be competitive as they can simply out produce AMD given AMDs relatively small allocation at TSMC.3. Intel GPUs pose a moderate threat on the horizon for AMD for both low end and portables and at the same time they are eating up available capacity at TSMC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just want to clear things up.The reason why AMD is suddenly catching up to Intel in valuation is because of the confirmation / success acquisition of Xilinx. Which triggered the conversion of 250M Xilinx shares to new AMD shares. Adding roughly $40B to its market cap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something that has gone unmentioned in these comments: Intel has a lot more debt than AMD (38B vs 661M on 12/31). That does affect their comparative market cap by, you know, roughly 37 billion dollars. (give or take some amount related to their credit rating and the very low cost of money right now, I would think, and if you want something to argue about there&#39;s always the fact that Intel has an even better credit rating than AMD...)Intel has much, much more income than AMD and they&#39;re valued similarly by the market and... that is not a mystery.https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC/financials?p=INTChttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD/financials?p=AMD"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If I understand this correctly, the FCC has allocated the 4.2GHz-4.4GHz band for radar altimeters. The FCC has also allocated the 3.7GHz-3.98GHz band to 5G. It turns out that the radar altimeters, as manufactured, use spectrum outside their allocated band, down to and including part of the 3.7GHz-3.98GHz 5G band.Am I missing something?If a rancher buys a plot of land from 34.42°N to 34.44°N to graze his cattle on, but in actual fact grazes his cattle all the way from 34.37°N to 34.47°N. Then a farmer buys a plot of land from 34.37°N to 34.398°N to grow wheat on. Does the rancher still get to herd his cattle down to 34.39°N to feed his cattle? The cattle have to eat, after all, and cutting down the grazing land by 30% could cause some cattle to starve to death. And the rancher has a vested financial interest in ensuring his cattle are well fed, and that wheat is good eating. And the rancher has always been grazing his cattle there, what right does the farmer have to till the soil on the racher&#39;s grazing land? And we, the American public, have the right to buy beef. Why should the farmer purchasing 34.37°N to 34.398°N interfere with my ability to buy a steak?Does any of this make any sense to anyone?Unless there&#39;s additional information I&#39;m unaware of, it seems as if the design and/or manufacture of the radar altimeter is not fit for purpose. Using 3.7GHz to 3.98GHz for 5G doesn&#39;t break the radar altimeters; the radar altimeters are already broken and must be fixed or grounded, because the equipment is broken and unsafe.If 5G equipment is emitting outside of its allocated 3.7-3.98GHz spectrum then the FCC needs to drop a brick on that of course."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t know much about aviation or electrical engineering, and I’m wondering if anyone could help me understand something.It seems like the telecom and aviation industries (along with the FCC and FAA) disagree on a question of fact: does 5G equipment interfere with radio altimeters?There’s a way that the FAA could convince me, and probably all the politicians. Shoot a video with a radio altimeter and some 5G equipment where the radio altimeter malfunctions. Put it on YouTube. Do a press release.This seems like an obvious step if the underlying issue exists. Any reason they haven’t done this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this along with potential interference problems in weather radar [0], it&#39;s obvious the FCC bungled allocating the 5G spectrum. What a shame that they gave into industry pressure over other practical considerations.However, it doesn&#39;t surprise me that the FAA, which allowed the Boeing 737Max fiasco, is back here coming to Boeing&#39;s defense. What happens when 2 captured regulators collide?Edit: added spacing and changed &#34;radio&#34; to &#34;radar&#34; for clarity[0] https://www.npr.org/2019/07/02/737919100/forecasters-caution..."</p>
