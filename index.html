								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, clearly Google has too much power over the internet, it&#39;s arbitrary and opaque, etc.  I agree.  However, I think it is worth pointing out that:1) malware is often very aggressive and fast-spreading, and once it&#39;s on a user&#39;s computer it&#39;s hard to get off, therefore...2) the system to detect it and stop access to the site has to be automated, not a human-in-the-loop system that might take hours or days to shut off access to a site which is infecting many users per minute, and...3) the more clarity there is on how exactly that automated system works, the more certain we can be that malware will be able to evade it; it&#39;s much like how spam detection or search page rankings are opaque, because the incentives to game the system are very greatI&#39;m not saying Google&#39;s system is perfect, but I am saying it&#39;s a very hard problem to solve in a way that doesn&#39;t give us an even worse time stopping malware spread than we already have.  So while it is hard to feel sorry for a company as wealthy and powerful as Google, I think the issue is not as clear-cut as some comments on this thread seem to suggest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Now we run automated tests to monitor server uptime and check server for problems every 30 seconds. Unfortunately automated test scripts were happily getting HTTP/200 replies while people using the Chrome browser were being told this is a scam business trying to steal their bank account information.I was surprised this wasn&#39;t part of the lessons learned. But it seems the monitoring basically failed but that wasn&#39;t a lesson.I feel like majority of uptime monitors are falling for this same trap. One of the reasons why for my monitoring service I choose to do full page load monitoring via Chrome instead of just a http request via Curl or whatever. Main reason, people care if the webpage loads or not. People care how long it takes for their webpage to load. Having a website respond in 200ms is great but if it takes 8000ms for all the JS to load and process your website is still slow. I get why sites are just doing curl requests because it&#39;s way cheaper but really you&#39;re monitoring one part of the stack while really caring about all of it. If your website starts producing javascript errors you want to know, etc.[1] https://www.ootliers.com (The landing page and everything are terrible and I&#39;m working on improving that)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They can remove your YouTube account, app, entire Google account or even your website at any time and you can only make guesses why did that happen, because they always make the rules really vague and it&#39;s never clear what is or is not allowed. And even when they do admit the mistake and get you back up, they still won&#39;t explain anything and nothing is ever fixed. Thank you Google, very cool."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"0data appears to be a curated collection of five best-in-class libraries/frameworks that enable building SPA apps with user controlled data, rather than Big Tech controlled platforms and services.1. Autonomous Data2. remoteStorage3. Solid Project4. Unhosted5. Fission[1] https://noeldemartin.github.io/autonomous-data/introduction....[2] https://remotestorage.io/[3] https://solidproject.org/[4] https://unhosted.org/[5] https://fission.codes/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone dabbling with such an app right now, there are several hurdles if you want to exclusively use self sovereign identity.1. Local data gets lost, so you need to sync for backup. But when your device gets lost or when you need to access it from elsewhere, how would you login to the said backup service? The most intuitive option is still a username and a password.2. It&#39;s hard to transfer data from one device to another. And to asynchronously share data with friends and family. Solutions like ipfs exist, but in practice they rely on many centralized services (eg: for pinning). And besides, securely sharing private data is not an option on any of them.3. Lay people being able to safely handle cryptographic keys is an unrealistic assumption.So IMHO, perfect 0-data is not going to happen. It used to work earlier (pre-internet) because we had only one device, didn&#39;t  have a lot of media, and could carry floppy disks for the rare occasion.What I think would make a difference is: browser apps being able to do TCP/UDP (with safe-guards) and sandboxed local disk-access. This allows web apps to do things like SSH, and login to the vast storage infrastructure that already exists - such as GitHub. Data remains fully under your control and becomes portable. Git IMHO is a better path to where Solid wants to go.  Especially once SHA256 commit hashes land - to become your personal, consensus-less blockchain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the vast majority of users, isn&#39;t having solid export options enough, or even better than this? Your average non-techie isn&#39;t going to want to configure each app to get syncing with NextCloud or Dropbox working just right, they just want to perform a task with the app and move on with their lives, regardless of where the data lives. And with an export option, if the app dies, you&#39;ve still got your blog posts or pictures or drawings or whatever it is you were using the app for.I think being in this bubble of working in and thinking about tech 24/7 can often make us miss the point - these apps are just meant to be tools to do a task."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If anyone from the dolt team is reading this, I&#39;d like to make an enquiry:At bugout.dev, we have an ongoing crawl of public GitHub. We just created a dataset of code snippets crawled from popular GitHub repositories, listed by language, license, github repo, and commit hash and are looking to release it publicly and keep it up-to-date with our GitHub crawl.The dataset for a single crawl comes in at about 60GB. We uploaded the data to Kaggle because we thought it would be a good place for people to work with the data. Unfortunately, the Kaggle notebook experience is not tailored to such large datasets. Our dataset is in a SQLite database. It takes a long time for the dataset to load into Kaggle notebooks, and I don&#39;t think they are provisioned with SSDs as queries take a long time. Our best workaround to this is to partition into 3 datasets on Kaggle - train, eval, and development, but it will be a pain to manage this for every update, especially as we enrich the dataset with results of static analysis, etc.I&#39;d like to explore hosting the public dataset on Dolthub. If this sounds interesting to you please, reach out to me - email is in my HN profile."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wordpress would have benefited from this.What a lot of webmasters want is, test the site locally, then merge it back. A lot of people turned to Jekyll or Hugo for the very reason that it can be checked into git, and git is reliable. A static website can’t get hacked, whereas anyone who has been burnt with Wordpress security fail knows they’d prefer a static site.And even more: People would like to pass the new website from the designer to the customer to managers — Wordpress might have not needed to develop their approval workflows (permission schemes, draft/preview/publish) if they had had a forkable database."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dolt might be good but never underestimate the power of Type 2 Slowly Changing Dimension tables [1]. For example, if you had an SSIS package that took CSV and imported them into a database, and one day you noticed it accidently rounded the value incorrectly, you could fix the data and retain traceability of the data which was there originally.E.g.,
SSIS package writes row of data: https://imgur.com/DClXAi5Then a few months later (on 2020-08-15) we identify that trans_value was imported incorrectly so we update it: https://imgur.com/wdQJWm4Then whenever we SELECT from the table we always ensure we are extracting &#34;today&#39;s&#34; version of the data:    select * from table where TODAY between effective_from and effective_to

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently worked for one of the biggest mobile game developers. While I game a lot and have been for over 20 years I never played anything on my phone (PC gaming only) so I was pretty shocked at the state of the industry. They have meetings about making the game more addictive, taking away any chance to get ahead in the game by skill or grind so you must spend, targeting vulnerable groups, making it hard to see how much you actually spent in the game.To have these people paint themselves as oppressed and offended... is exactly what I&#39;ve come to expect after every online social justice controversy I&#39;ve witnessed so far.And I know exactly how they would respond to me: What do you mean by &#34;these people&#34; you *ist!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I believe has happened here is that the well-pointed satire actually offended some people who have made their career doing what the satire criticizes. Thus they have mobilized all sorts of specious attacks to take it down - arguing that it is somehow contributing to sexism or elitism [0], and arguing it makes the documentation more confusing (&#34;oh won&#39;t someone please think of the new developers!&#34;).[0] https://twitter.com/LiaSae/status/1367074344313237507?s=20"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Life is controversial by its very nature. I&#39;m not saying you have to go full teenage edgelord, but we have to learn to accept that everyone has different lives and experiences. These experiences lead to different viewpoints and opinions. I have very different viewpoints than even myself a few years ago. I imagine a completely different person in a different city or country would disagree with at least some of them. And you know what? I am okay with that.I don&#39;t like this fake-wokism SV monoculture creeping into everything. I wouldn&#39;t mind them sharing their opinions on things if they didn&#39;t have teeth. Somehow the professionally oppressed are backed by nearly every major corporation on the planet. It makes me overreact. I don&#39;t like it. Most people don&#39;t like it. Everything they say sounds like &#34;Pick up that can, Citizen.&#34;Archive of twitter thread that started this: https://archive.md/VpYl2"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Huge fan of this. Gas-powered blowers are responsible for a disturbingly large portion of US air pollutants. Something like 10% of all CO, 5% of VOCs come from gas-powered lawn equipment, and they produce &gt;30%* of the non-car pollutants.Traditional American lawn maintenance is a horribly unsustainable (and in my opinion, ugly) practice. We should encourage alternatives.See: Banks, &#34;National Emissions from Lawn and Garden Equipment&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Has anyone else noticed the trend of ever-increasing laws and ever-decreasing enforcement?It’s not a good mix.  We end up with a system that punishes people following the rules and doesn’t do anything about the many people breaking the rules.  It also creates the sense of unfairness and general lawlessness — that laws are recommendations that can mostly be ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Used to live across the street from a neighbor who got his yard cleaned up by a crew with a gas blower twice weekly.  They were already banned in that town, but it was never enforced.  The noise would wake me up and the fumes—like standing next to a 1960s Mustang with a cold engine—would drift into our apartment and linger for 15-20 minutes.  Gas blowers are gross and their time passed a while ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Rackauckas has done a lot of work to create the whole scientific machine learning (SciML) ecosystem (with collaborators).Symbolics.jl is the new step to a universal CAS tool in Julia to bridge the gap between symbolic manipulation and numerical computationIt is especially useful as a foundation for equation-based simulation package ModelingToolkit.jl. In the foreseeable future, I expect ModelingToolkit.jl can be comparable with the Modelica ecosystem to provide fast, accurate modeling and simulation capability and easy integration with machine learning methods for Julia ecosystem, which is crucial for engineering application and scientific research."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very cool. Computer Algebra Systems are like a super power. I’ve been able to use the TI-89’s arbitrary precision to do pretty sophisticated cryptography work. Symbolics.jl has the ability to modify some of the rules of the algebra, which should allow even easier implementation of number theory related cryptographic concepts (as well as compression and error correcting codes... or quaternions or bra-ket quantum mechanics) without needing specific libraries. I love this as I’m trying to teach myself the fundamental concepts in mathematical terms and not just something in a specialized black box library. (And without paying the insanely high price of Mathematica if I ever want to use it professionally.)I’ve looked briefly into Julia in the past, but if stuff like this becomes pretty standard (in the way numpy is for Python), I think I could become pretty comfortable in Julia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"CASes are one of the most difficult things to write and they’re never complete. There are always bugs, performance concerns, anemic mathematical domains, etc. Every major free or commercial CAS that’s still in use is under active development to battle these inadequacies. Dozens of CASes have come and gone in the past 30 years, the majority of which have bitrotted or stopped being maintained. And not a single CAS has reigned supreme as the CAS that beats all CASes.It’s very exciting to see more work in CASes being done, but I worry that “starting a CAS from scratch” isn’t the right approach. The Axiom [0, 1] project rightly identified that building a general-purpose CAS for working practitioners of computational mathematics is an effort requiring nearly generational timespans [2], and that you must have the right language to describe mathematical objects and their relationships. They had a literate programming policy, where all math code must be accompanied by publication-quality documentation, precisely because it’s so hard to build and maintain these systems. Some of the greatest computational discoveries and expositions came out of the development of Axiom, like the richest and most complete implementation of the renowned Risch algorithm for doing symbolic integrals.Axiom fell into disuse for a variety of reasons, but from my perspective, found new life in a fork called FriCAS [3, 4], which is actively developed and allows a more “software engineer friendly” approach to the development of the system. The code they have is enormously complex and has mountains of knowledge from foremost experts in computer algebra.I really wish new computer algebra initiatives attempted in earnest to make use of and extend Axiom/FriCAS so that we could continue to build up our knowledge of this exceedingly delicate and tricky subject without constantly starting from zero. Axiom has a manual that is over 1,000 pages of dense mathematics and that’s really hard to rebuild correctly.(The only project I know who honestly tried to build upon and subsequently extend CAS functionality is Sage [5], which builds upon a plethora of existing open source general-purpose and specialized computational math systems.)[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom_(computer_algebra_syst...[1] http://www.axiom-developer.org/[2] Quote from Axiom manual (http://fricas.sourceforge.net/doc/book.pdf):&gt; With that in mind I’ve introduced the theme of the “30 year horizon”. We must invent the tools that support the Computational Mathematician working 30 years from now. How will research be done when every bit of mathematical knowledge is online and instantly available? What happens when we scale Axiom by a factor of 100, giving us 1.1 million domains? How can we integrate theory with code? How will we integrate theorems and proofs of the mathematics with space-time complexity proofs and running code? What visualization tools are needed? How do we support the conceptual structures and semantics of mathematics in effective ways? How do we support results from the sciences? How do we teach the next generation to be effective Computational Mathematicians? The “30 year horizon” is much nearer than it appears.[3] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/FriCAS[4] http://fricas.sourceforge.net/[5] https://www.sagemath.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, WebGPU support is really cool. Graphics is usually an afterthought in programming language runtimes, which is crazy when you consider that most devices these days have a GPU which is physically larger and has far more raw compute power than the CPU.I understand why. The extremely proprietary and platform specific nature of graphics APIs and hardware makes it hard. WebGPU is a good choice for portability."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like Cloudflare isn&#39;t happy about this url:https://deno.land/posts/v1.8/webgpu_triangle.png"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was curious about how `Deno.permissions` prevents things like &#34;requesting the permissions, then clearing the screen and asking to press &#39;g&#39;&#34;. Apparently, `Deno.permissions.request()` just stops program execution waiting for user response, so it&#39;s impossible to do anything after this call.
It also seems to reset text color, so it&#39;s impossible to make text invisible.
iTerm custom escape sequences allows program to change color profile on the fly. Setting bg and fg to the same value hides Deno messages and allows someone to conceal which permissions are being granted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is actually pretty cute, I just wish there was perhaps a &#34;patience&#34; mode that would just be a slower version of the screensaver mode. I&#39;d love to leave this on my second display and let it grow over the course of an hour or a work day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool! I set it up on Repl.it. Just hit run to try it: https://repl.it/@amasad/cbonsai"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very interesting. My initial thought was that this should be something that runs in the background and grows very slowly, and then you could check it from time to time by running `cbonsai` from the console, or have it show on your desktop or screen saver.  You know, kind of like a real plant, but it grows slightly faster and you have no maintenance."</p>
