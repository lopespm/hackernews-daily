								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is great overall, but there is some stuff you should do differently, if you&#39;re wanting to follow in the author&#39;s footsteps:1. Just use UPC connectors everywhere unless you have really good reasons not to.2. Use single mode fiber (SMF) everywhere, including internal wiring. SMF is infinitely scalable for future needs, multimode (MMF) is not. These days the cost differences for cabling and optics is negligible. In fact, SMF cabling is often cheaper than MMF. And no, you generally won’t have to worry about attenuating signal.Also, in my extensive experience, FS.com optics modules are typically better manufactured and more reliable than OEM modules.I resisted the &#34;cheap chinese&#34; modules for a long, long time, but then discovered that most of my uplink carriers used them.It&#39;s been years now. I&#39;ve had many Cisco OEM, Dell OEM, and a couple from another 3rd party manufacturer go bad, but I have yet for one FS.com SFP to go bad. I&#39;ve got several hundred deployed in a wide variety of environments, from great (cool, clean areas) to bad (hot, dirty areas)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always end up green with envy that people seem to have pre-existing conduits in their walls for running new cables.  There&#39;s no way, in my old house, of doing this without some invasive smashing in to walls."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice read, and great work on the terminations.I did an extensive amount of both fiber and CAT6A in my recent house build, totally about 21 miles together. I did a mixture of single mode and multimode only because of some AV device support for multimode, and because all of it was so cheap compared to the labor and time.I ended up with significant fiber runs between the MDF and IDF closets, the server room, and all of the AV endpoints which is a typical layout. I did run single mode fiber to all 18 wireless AP access-point locations, but I suspect those will not get used much given I also have 2 CAT6A shielded wires to each AP that can support 10G AND provided power.  I do use a direct fiber connection in my office to provide 10G to my network core from that desktop, but that could have been done over copper as well.Perhaps the biggest gain over copper is my switch interconnects which are 40G from the upstairs closet to the server room.  If needed it would be easy to upgrade those to 100G, and since there are 24 strands available you really could expand as far as you are every going to need to go with WDM and the like.The one really good use case for only fiber was running it down my driveway to our gate, which is about a 1/4 mile in distance. That is something that would be more challenging to do with copper. [although I do have copper installed].From my perspective the cost of running fiber was almost 0 compared to the entire project because so much more cost is involved in path finding and clearing ( cutting holes, etc), and the actual pulling.  I was very fortunate to have a large group of friends who spent a couple of days working with me to do the large pulls, combined with many weeks of evenings and weekends doing the rest myself.  Many hands makes that task much much easier.My particular build is documented in a build thread:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It varies through regions. It is completely the opposite in China because:- No extra app. People scan the QR in WeChat (everybody has it) on the table, it will call a mini-app dynamically (somewhat similar to React Native but interpreted in WeChat).- You are putting orders directly.- You are paying within WeChat as well so it&#39;s seamless.- The app is smooth because almost every restaurant is using the takeout giant Meituan&#39;s mini-app.- Almost every single restaurants in China is tech savvy enough to use those systems because it&#39;s already a take-out centered society. Restaurants not leveraging these systems have virtually zero chance to survive the competition.- You don&#39;t have to wait for anything or talk to anybody in the whole process.The problems people mentioned in this thread:- Minorities, people without smart phone or those are less tech savvy, are left behind.- The walled garden and monopolies and such.These problems are real, but it&#39;s probably not the QR menu to blame, because it&#39;s a far greater problem - in China, you are not allow to go anywhere without WeChat and scanning QR code due to those draconian regulations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like it. It&#39;s annoying to wait for the waiter to come over with menus, it&#39;s annoying to wait to ask them to bring a menu back because you want to order more, and it&#39;s gross when you get a menu that hasn&#39;t been wiped down properly and is sticky with god knows what, and it&#39;s wasteful when they&#39;re printing hundreds of fresh menus a day for the places that give everyone a fresh one.Keep a few backup printouts for those who need them (like your phone gets no signal), but otherwise it&#39;s a fantastic step forwards. Goodbye to grimy wasteful printouts.Plus the bonus of never having to experience &#34;oh sorry we&#39;re out of that&#34; if they update the menus dynamically is fantastic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate QR code menus as they are often poorly implemented.However, I just experienced a QR code check for the first time.  That was really nice ..  I scanned the QR code with my iPhone, it downloaded the Toast &#34;app clip&#34;, which allowed me to pay the bill with Apple Pay.   It was totally seamless and far better than handing my credit card to a server to get lost or cloned."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I continue to be genuinely shocked that we don&#39;t treat touch screens in cars the same way we do as phones in cars (that is to say, it is literally illegal to use them while the vehicle is moving in most places because the distraction is such a danger). Moving away from tactile in-car controls has to be among the more boneheaded things we&#39;ve allowed that industry to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GM also has electronic primary door release mechanisms in their vehicles.  So if the car has no power, you can’t open the doors from inside.Granted, because of regulatory requirements there is STILL A MANUAL RELEASE… on the floor, near the chassis sill (and might be driver-seat only).  So you save money going to electronic releases, but still have to put a manual one in anyways.The glovebox is merely annoying (though I can think of edge case situations where it could lead to your death), but with the door release, there are documented instances where it HAS led to someone’s death:  https://jalopnik.com/texas-man-and-his-dog-die-after-getting..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hate the US penal system. I grew up a semi conservative individual. Good guys and bad guys. Three strikes and your out sounded great. Tough on crime. All of that.A couple years ago, I was asked by my faith congregation to serve as a volunteer at our local maximum security state prison, offering Sunday services to the inmates. I did so for 3 years. It changed me.We’re there some truly troubled/warped people there? Yes. Do I kid myself that their “stories” weren’t surely one sided? No.I was struck by how arbitrary the whole thing is. And how utterly ineffective it is. What troubled me the most is that we have outsourced    this whole raft of problems, without sending it overseas. We want “problems” to just go away. And stay away. And so we outsource the existence of human lives to an alternate universe that exists right beneath our toes. And we maintain fascinating opinions about these people and their lives, with almost zero insight into what the existence we consigned them to was.  When people heard I went to the prison every Sunday to visit with inmates, they would immediately wax their opinion about what it must be like. And I found over time that their imagination did not match my reality. Their can be no empathy in that scenario.I dream (pointlessly) about a world where a much higher percentage of lay civilians spent volunteer time in prisons. Awareness leads to empathy. And only then when we weren’t outsourcing the issue, we might actually be moved to find something more effective."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent a month in the hole. It wasn&#39;t pleasant.- I stayed asleep for as long as I could, whenever I could. Chlorpheniramine was readily distributed to prisoners.- Exercise was difficult for me after the first week, as was motivation for basically anything.- I read anything they would bring down there.- We didn&#39;t have a choice in the books we had, so picking something to study wasn&#39;t really an option. Outside of the hole, I eventually had an outside person send me a biochemistry textbook though. However, being autodidactic is difficult with a single reference.- No one talked to me in the segregated housing unit, except for correction officers and during the 5-10 minutes I was able to use the phone a day.- I didn&#39;t experience any prison administrators attempting to provoke any inmates. Although, the grievance system was basically a journaling activity.- I found it very difficult to write anything longer than a paragraph to anyone my whole time in prison.- I was a known atheist in prison, due to some reading material I received in the mail. Outside of the SHU, people often tried to engage me about my beliefs, which I avoided."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So is prison meant to reform or punish? Life without parole clearly means the person will never renter society, so there’s no point in reforming. It’s just punishment. So why not allow the guy to read literature? Or is it because that would be enjoyable for inmates, and we want them to be punished? But the analogy of a tree falling in the woods and no one around to hear it is apt. I can’t think of a single time I’ve contemplated how prisoners are punished and thought “man it’s so great they’re sitting in there bored out of their minds, this makes my life so much better and I feel happy about it.”  They’re completely removed from society, they may as well be on Mars. It has no bearing on me or anyone else whether they’re having a good or shit miserable time. They will never leave, they will die in there. Can’t they just read a goddamn book if they want to?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wasn&#39;t aware of SAFe until one new manager got our director to loose his head for it and institute it in all teams.It was a total disaster.The idea of Agile is for each team to be responsible to improve their processes. Because improvement loops involving higher management are taking forever to complete and because each team has its own needs. &#34;Agile&#34; (quotes intentional) as practiced today is bad enough -- teams are not really improving their process, only implementing something taken from a book.SAFe is taking it one step further by absolutely obliterating team&#39;s ability to influence the process.At least with &#34;standard Agile&#34; it was possible for some teams to do the right thing, as long as they had a manager that understood what Agile really is.With SAFe that was gone.I was told that we can&#39;t even modify our t-shirt sizing because &#34;It has to be standardised, otherwise there would be too much chaos. BTW, we are definitely not creating a new request form to change t-shirt sizes in Jira&#34;Forget about changing any other part of the project. We had a bunch of testers and business analysts which did absolutely nothing but had to stay on the team because they were required in the process by higher management. We did not need them. I spent time hiring people who could do the work from discussing requirements with the business people through design, implementation up to deploying it to prod, but that did not matter.Talk about crazy projects..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SAFe seems to be a bit like &#34;internet scale&#34;, it&#39;s designed for very large organizations building very large single software solutions. Most organizations wildly overestimate their size and the size of their solutions. A Microsoft Office release probably can benefit from SAFe, an update to an auth microservice maintained part/time by a team of .75 FTE doesn&#39;t.SAFe seems to sort of be a micro-waterfall approach inspired by Conway&#39;s law [1]. It build massive communication and coordination teams so that this gets reflected into short-term development waterfalls that produce software that mirrors the system that managed it. But this team needs to be dwarfed by the development effort they are trying to push forward or they&#39;ll end up dominating all of the activities with largely useless communication and coordination activities resulting in very slow forward software movement, confused goals and priorities, and overstaffing of projects.Example: I once ran a team that was developing some internal tools for a large org, but we were outside of the main SAFe effort. At one point we became dependent on some service the SAFe effort was going to produce. It took 60 people 3 years to not produce a correctly working service. Exhausted with this, I finally just had 1 person build the service we needed as a stopgap. She spent 3 months building it with part-time support from one other engineer for a couple weeks. More than 3 years later that is the service that&#39;s still running and the SAFe effort never did manage to get a properly working solution out the door. I can think of half a dozen similar examples where the parallel effort by a smaller team with less organizational overhead radically outperformed the giant SAFe team -- and they did it mostly by just ad hoc communication channels between the small teams.1 - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway&#39;s_law"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t forget the classic parody of SAFe which shows it as the overblown &#34;waterfall in agile clothing&#34; that it is: LAFABLE. https://www.lafable.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t say nice things about Oracle very often, but they deserve some praise here. Graal is a very, very ambitious project, and Oracle has been funding it for years. It&#39;s still rough around the edges, but it promises to enable new programming languages to run on a high-performance JVM, compiled to native code. Write-once, run anywhere, at native speed. And now they&#39;re donating it. It&#39;s very decent of them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GraalVM is truly great stuff.GraalVM native compilation helps Java in the data center to avoid being a cost sink and to reduce start-up latency. Oracle needs Java to sell enterprise software.Oracle contributing to OpenJDK may be required for Amazon cooperation (since Amazon is pushing its own JDK build) and probably helps the library ecosystem work towards native compatibility.Native support for reflection (used in many libraries) requires &#34;reachability metadata&#34;, maps of reflective API usage, at build time.  Anyone can do it, but enterprise requires authoritative sources.  Until authoritative reachability metadata covers the transitive graph of library+version dependencies in enterprise software, GraalVM native AOT builds are a PITA.- https://github.com/oracle/graalvm-reachability-metadata- latest release: https://medium.com/graalvm/graalvm-22-3-is-here-jdk-19-build...- graalvm &#34;community&#34; roadmap: https://github.com/orgs/oracle/projects/6(As a side note: Mark Reinhold has run the JDK team since 1997: is there any comparable example of such stellar leadership for broadly-adopted software across multiple technical and organizational eras?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I refuse to praise Oracle for anything. But I could make an exception if they put Isolates in the CE version of Graal and not only the Enterprise one. :)Also, obviously Oracle didn&#39;t do this out of the kindness of their hearts, if they didn&#39;t contribute Graal into the OpenJDK the would risk to Graal never become anything other than a niche VM because most people, specially big clients don&#39;t want to change VMs and the CE version will be their new gateway drug to their Enterprise version of Graal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m sure not everyone came here to hear tech book recommendations, but I will add another vote for Designing Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppman. It’s one of the best tech reference books I’ve ever read. It manages to explain SO much while requiring so little prior knowledge from readers.Another book that is relatively new that I loved was Designing Machine Learning Systems by Chip Huyen. I worked in productionizing ML systems for 3 years and this book equips you with exactly what you need to do so. It does a great job of explaining the whole ML modeling pipeline and some of the commonly overlooked nuances that can cause your models to fail spectacularly in production. I will be referencing this book for years to come."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How the World Really Works by Vaclac Smil is one of the best book I&#39;ve read this year. It gives such a great perspective on how much energy and material we use.It&#39;s one of the most readable books by Smil and has gems like this :“Moreover, within a lifetime of people born just after the Second World War the rate had more than tripled, from about 10 to 34 GJ/capita between 1950 and 2020. Translating the last rate into more readily imaginable equivalents, it is as if an average Earthling has every year at their personal disposal about 800 kilograms (0.8 tons, or nearly six barrels) of crude oil, or about 1.5 tons of good bituminous coal. And when put in terms of physical labor, it is as if 60 adults would be working non-stop, day and night, for each average person; and for the inhabitants of affluent countries this equivalent of steadily laboring adults would be, depending on the specific country, mostly between 200 and 240. On average, humans now have unprecedented amounts of energy at their disposal.”My review is at : https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4708765021Another excellent book is Arbitrary Lines by Nolan Gray - which is a great book about zoning and why we should all be YIMBYs.My review is at :  https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4800787011How Asia Works by Joe Studwell is a fascinating look at why Japan, South Korea and China have done so well.My review is at : https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4806521204Another book I really enjoyed was Firepower : How Weapons Shaped Warfare by Paul Lockhartreview at : https://www.goodreads.com/review/show/4417950705"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"- Conquest: Cortes, Montezuma, and the Fall of Old Mexico by Hugh Thomas , because he brings history to life and the story of the Spanish and the Mexica is stranger than fiction, more subtle and terrible than you might think, and has many lessons on human behavior applicable to today.- Ecclesiastes by Qoheleth: In my opinion, superior to Marcus Aurelius&#39; Meditations. &#34;Go, eat your bread with enjoyment, and drink your wine with a merry heart; for God has already approved what you do. Let your garments be always white; let not oil be lacking on your head. Enjoy life with the wife whom you love, all the days of your vain life which he has given you under the sun, because that is your portion in life and in your toil at which you toil under the sun. Whatever your hand finds to do, do it with your might; for there is no work or thought or knowledge or wisdom in Sheol, to which you are going.&#34; (Eccles 9:11)- Amusing ourselves to death by Neil Postman: We thought we had to worry about 1984 and big brother. We were wrong. We are living in Huxley&#39;s Brave New World where digital media has made us dumber, distracted and cut our connections with one other. Our smartphones substitute rosaries and entertainment becomes the dogma.- Structure and Intepretation of Computer Programs by Hal Abelson and Gerlad J. Sussman: Need I say more? This books makes me fall in love all over again with programming every time I pick it up.- Nichomachean Ethics by Aristotle: What does it mean to live well? How can we be happy? Aristotle makes the striking claim that everyone knows how to be happy, but we have to create the habits that are in accord with reason and right judgement in order to get there. Also, happiness is not a state but rather the result of our active will and right ordering of desire. Required reading for any political leader.- Theory of Computation by Michael Sipser: Javascript frameworks come and go, language standards change, Computer platforms rise and fall, but math and the underling concepts of computation stay the same. Knowing what computation is, what its properties are, etc. will not only make you a better programmer but a better thinker. Church-Turing Thesis essential reading for anyone serious about algorithm design and analysis."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not directly related but anecdata. We migrated for chart.js to plotly.js to finally bite the bullet and plonk down the $$$ for highcharts.Highcharts is no panacea, but at we just hit performance and capability issues really quickly with all the free stuff out there."</p>
