								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As others have said, there are more cost effective options than just getting your attorney to do a patent search for you. There are definitely plenty of companies that will do it for you for far less. But the quality is... variable, to say the least.As a point of shameless self-promotion, I&#39;m the founder of a company seeking to improve the patent system, starting with prior art search [1][2]. We&#39;re not one of those companies that will do it for you for less. Instead, we empower you to do it yourself, then have your attorney go deeper if needed. The idea being that you don&#39;t need to be a patent expert or lawyer to do it; anyone with knowledge of their technical area can search effectively.  Plus we&#39;ve got some collaboration features so when you&#39;re ready to hand off to your $500/hr attorney, you can. And not just hand off -- collaborate.If a patent troll is shaking you down, reach out to us and we&#39;ll do you a generous deal, no strings attached. We very much do not like patent trolls.[1] https://www.amplified.ai/[2] https://www.amplified.ai/en/blog/22062020/introducing-amplif..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hooray for him.Patent trolls have a business model, which he&#39;s disrupted:1) buy a patent, the broader and better-tested the better2) start threatening the easy marks; the ones who roll over and write you a check right away.  Their trick is to ask for a settlement small enough to say &#34;hey, it&#39;ll cost you more than that for attorney&#39;s fees!&#34;

3) use that money to threaten the harder targets: the ones who will fight back. Those people get asked for much larger sums.4) maybe actually go to trial with a very big target, one that&#39;ll get dinged for a 9-figure judgment if the troll wins. In the Eastern District of Texas, juries tend to do that.Researching the validity of a patent does not require $400/hour attorneys. Anyone with a basic knowledge of patent law and computer science can do it. (And no, I&#39;m not advertising for myself. I&#39;m retired.) Do you think those expensive attorneys do it themselves? It is to laugh -- they assign it to a junior who knows technology."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Every time a company settles it just funds the trolls to wreak more havoc. This is especially true for companies larger than $100 million in revenue. I’m looking at you Texas Instruments, VIA Technologies, Renesas, ASUS, Caterpillar, Nuvision International, and Netgear, just to name a few of the companies that have dealt with Jason Nguyen’s Altair Logix. When you roll over and pay the trolls it hurts smaller companies terribly.I wonder if those companies consider this a &#34;feature&#34;?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Worldcoin issues tokens to people for scanning their retinas. Their magical orb device sends a biometric hash to their network.Here&#39;s my take on it: You can possibly replace their biometric device with a random hash generator.* If it works, it means the currency is not fairly distributed, but anyone sending valid hashes to their network is issued tokens, irrespective of whether the eyeballs described by those hashes exist. This is called a Sybil attack.* If it doesn&#39;t work, it means there is some secret or centralized check that the network performs, which means the currency is not open.This is why we still use proof-of-work in spite of its energy expense: it is simple to understand, it can not be faked, and it can be openly verified.So, do not support this biometric-gathering enterprise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;20% of all Worldcoin tokens will be set aside for the development team. In crypto, this used to be known as a “premine” and ranks among the biggest red flags that a project is intended to enrich insiders.&#34; https://www.coindesk.com/tech/2021/10/25/why-everyone-is-mad..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I understand it, the distribution mechanism of Worldcoin is not part of the protocol. The protocol does not know anything about eyes.So the distribution seems completely centralized. A central authority distributes the coins however they wish.Today they might use a process involving eye scans. Or maybe not. There is no way to check. Tomorrow they might change their approach however they like. And we would have no way of knowing.The issue that seems to be overlooked is that there is no way to look at a hash and decide if it was created via scanning an eye. The hash is signed via some key that - according to the makers of WC - sits in an eye scanning device which behaves a certain way. But we have no way of checking that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It’s also worth noting that end-to-end encryption is necessarily broken as messages to (and from) WhatsApp, Signal and Telegram pass across the bridge(s). The bridge(s) operates in Element’s trusted EMS environment, with no content scanning or datamining, but currently bridged conversations are not stored end-to-end encrypted in Matrix (they will be in the future).As a Signal user, I kind of don&#39;t want this to take off. I like knowing that when I message someone on Signal, it&#39;s for their eyes only. It feels like this service starts fragmenting some of the privacy guarantees of the bridged providers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back in the day before the rise of Facebook, there was an open source service that combined all the popular messaging protocols - MSN, AoL, IRC, etc.It was called Pidgin[0], and it never got particularly big.I see the same thing here. While it&#39;s interesting, I&#39;m failing to see what the use case is. What&#39;s the niche that needs this solved in a big way?[0] https://www.pidgin.im/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nicely timed.Brief history: when Hangouts was going away and Google Chat coming in, I pitched Matrix to my friends as a better alternative that didn&#39;t require unique phone numbers, awkward desktop limitations, and a better federated future. We stuck with Google Chat because inertia and networks suck that way.I revisited the instance I had setup and got the mautrix-googlechat bridge working. It&#39;s pretty nice but one friend lamented that he did not have the technical skills to self-host such a thing. And here comes this announcement! Sadly, there is a major hurdle: neither Google Chat nor SMS/GVoice are listed here and those are the major protocols that my social group uses.At the same time, my social group is conservative in adopting new core technologies and wary of cloud lock-in for critical roles (Google being both an unfortunate anchor and precipitator of that). I&#39;m not sure adding those protocols would tip the balance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just upgraded to Monterey on my Macbook Pro 2018 15-inch and after rebooting, all of the USB-C ports stopped working, including the power adapter. I spent some time on the phone with Apple Support trying to figure out how to fix it. After about an hour and a half there was about 18% battery left before I started to panic and figure out how I was going to back everything up.After panicking, the 3rd Apple Support Representative and I endeavoured to try and reset the System Management Controller (SMC) [1] once again. At this point I had realised that the first few times that I tried this with a previous support representative would not have worked, as I was holding shift on the left-hand side of the keyboard (the previous support representative did not specify) and not the right-hand side as outlined in the support article for Macs with the T2 chip.Good luck!1. https://support.apple.com/en-au/HT201295"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven’t seen this anywhere when I’ve looked, so I’ll ask here on the slim chance maybe they really added something I badly want and somebody knows…Is there any application forced sandboxing feature yet?Something users can control to forcibly stop bad behavior from certain “must have” apps. Chrome, for example, has been caught doing entire drive scans on Windows, and I’m not sure I entirely trust Zoom either. So I’d like to lock down what they can access in terms of files, paths, devices and so on and be fully confident that even if my employer demands I run some software installer provided by their “partners” that it hasn’t installed some creepy daemon and configured launchd to keep it running after I kill the app or even kill -9 the process.Yes we can use VMs for this, but Mac laptops aren’t generally beefy machines, so that’s not an optimal solution.There used to be sandbox_exec, but I’ve heard they removed it entirely from this version. We’re now supposed to get things from the (cr)App Store, which guarantees the app will only have entitlements that Apple approves. But vendors are abandoning the App Store in droves for many good reasons, and after recent events I don’t totally trust Apple to prevent malicious use piggybacking on top of a legit entitlement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SharePlay to Mac (I tested audio) is utterly broken. Shockingly so. I just tried it again, and my music isn&#39;t paused, yet is stuck at 0:02. Pausing and unpausing it, and the song starts ticking, 0:03, 0:04, and so on, but you can&#39;t hear any audio. Pause it again. It goes back to 0:02. Now try this with AirPods connected to your Mac. Connect your iPhone&#39;s Apple Music to AirPlay to Mac. The YouTube video you had playing on your Mac gets paused, for no reason. But at least you hear your iPhone&#39;s audio on your Mac. Now pickup your iPhone. Your AirPods have now switched to your iPhone, that&#39;s still AirPlaying to Mac. You can&#39;t hear your music anymore. You reconnect the AirPods to your Mac. You can hear your iPhone music for a few minutes. Suddenly you can&#39;t hear anything. Pick up your phone, the volume slider in the Music app went all the way to the left. You can&#39;t move the volume slider to the right, like it&#39;s frozen; but the song is still playing. You go to Control Center, and finally manage to increase the volume. A minute later, the volume goes to zero again. If you were hoping to compensate for Spotify Connect not being on Apple Music, you&#39;ll be disappointed.Also, Safari has a bug that ignores your setting to not reopen non-private windows, and reopens them anyway, so if that&#39;s important to you, you may want to temporarily switch to another browser.And yes, it still has the &#34;occasionally laggy trackpad cursor&#34; bug on M1 for me.But other than that, it seems quite a bit faster than Big Sur, and so far (past 2 weeks), very stable on the core stuff."</p>

It just seems like AWS is so configuration heavy that it is ripe for a Vercel-for-backend to emerge.Does anyone know of an existing open source framework + hosted cloud platform that is a one-stop-shop for writing a production-ready backend in the vein of Next.js + Vercel?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The best agrument is that privacy is power.[0] It is the power to influence you, show you adverts and predict your behaviour. Our personal data is being used as knowledge against us - as power against us. It is used to make us do things we otherwise would not do: to buy a certain product or to vote a certain way.As companies share more information with governments, they are able to learn more and more about their citizens. Take Facebook, a company that Laura Poitras described as &#39;a gift to intelligence agencies&#39;[1]. Facebook allows governments to arrest people planning to participate in protests before they have even begun. This is just the tip of the iceberg.Our privacy is eroding. As a society, we are beginning to accept this lack of privacy as normal: and this is extremely dangerous. Privacy provides a place for us to be ourselves, to express ourselves in new ways without fear of being watched by preying eyes. If we lose privacy then we lose this ability to experiment, and, more importantly, we lose our power.[0]https://aeon.co/essays/privacy-matters-because-it-empowers-u...[1]https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2014/10/23..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is actually more than that. Privacy is exclusively cast as an individual / personal concept. But that is just the basis. If people have no privacy, any organizations, or enterprizes they form have no privacy either.Privacy is one of the very foundations of social and economic organization. It is deeply connected with ownership and agency. Holding on to a private piece of the information universe is what underpins also all civic and commercial activity.It is not clear why we still just talk about privacy instead of actually doing something meaningful about it [0]. This is maybe the most glaring example of how modern society has degenerated / cannot solve any of its self-inflicted diseases.[0] That&#39;s obviously not a critisism of the tor project :-), these early pioneers are the saving grace of our society."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So glad to see PouchDB included. We use it and have generally had a great experience! We use it with CouchDB on the backend, and Couch seems like a fantastic way to go for use cases involving syncing data between devices with an offline mode and syncing between clients. It was built from the ground up with replication in mind.Biggest bummer of CouchDB? If you’re not hosting it yourself, there’s only one major player in the market that I know of: IBM Cloudant. They contribute much to Apache CouchDB though, and hosting it yourself doesn’t seem too difficult, especially for small, simple use cases.Anyone else using CouchDB?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last write wins is not a strategy for conflict resolution, it&#39;s a surrender.So I&#39;m glad to hear something else apart from Pouch actually handles it. Anyone familiar with rxdb and can chime in on how they do it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not directly related to the post (which is focused on which database to host for your app), but I&#39;m writing desktop apps (think DAWs) in C++ and Rust (not JS), and want to synchronize settings through a Dropbox or Google Drive (so I don&#39;t have to host my own cloud sync servers). What&#39;s a good library or schema to achieve this?Personally I usually don&#39;t have multiple instances of the same app open on multiple machines, but other people might open the same or different files on their desktop and laptop.- Not all settings should be synchronized (don&#39;t include machine-specific &#34;recent files&#34; paths).- How should settings be stored locally (if I may have multiple instances of my app open on a single machine)? Registry (Windows-only)? INI with atomic saving (requires care and locking to prevent multiple instances from trampling or racing with each other)? SQLite?IMO Stylus is a pretty good implementation of offline-first cloud settings sync over Dropbox/etc. It&#39;s currently based around one JSON file per CSS file (Dropbox/Apps/Stylus - Userstyles Manager/docs/uuid.json), and what appears to be a transaction log (Dropbox/Apps/Stylus - Userstyles Manager/changes/number.json). Cloud sync has been 100% reliable in my experience, though I do notice temporary file lock errors when switching between different machines in my dual-boot setup (but sync seems to be eventually consistent nonetheless).uBlock Origin is worse. Instead of merging settings, it expects the user to upload and download the entire settings blob at once (and pulling an old blob can erase changes you&#39;ve made locally). And in the past it&#39;s entirely failed to sync because the blob was too big to upload to Mozilla&#39;s servers. (Right now it &#34;works&#34; but takes several minutes for one computer to see a config uploaded from another computer.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was actually thinking about my wishlist for recipe apps the other day. Some key features:1. Split up ingredients into more parts.2 tbsp ground black pepper is actually:
Quantity: 2 tbsp
Ingredient: Black Pepper
Preparation: Ground2 finely chopped scallions, just the white parts
Quantity: 2
Ingredient: Scallions
Preparation: Finely Chopped
Note: Just the white partsOften you&#39;ll have apps (like plan to eat) that adds the preparation to the ingredient and makes shopping lists much harder to manage2. Ingredient replacements. Often you&#39;ll see recipes calling for one ingredient and then has &#34;You can replace this with x and y&#34;. It would be extremely nice to have this programmatically available. I know if I can&#39;t find scallions, I can replace it with garlic and onions.3. Variants. Often I have the same core recipe in my recipe book with just different variants. Meringue cookies with different flavors. 90% of the recipe is all the same, but it&#39;s duplicated a dozen times for a dozen specific flavor add-ins. It would be extremely nice to have this somehow programatically available, so I can have the base recipe and all the variants with a reused core :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;in order to give the M1 Max some real competition, one has to skip laptop chips entirely and reach for not just high end desktop chips, but for server-class workstation hardware to really beat the M1 Maxthis is really interesting"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There’s really no way to understate what a colossal achievement Apple’s M1 processor is; compared with almost every modern x86-64 processor in its classOn the other hand I&#39;m sure there&#39;s more than a few chipheads out there who are saying &#34;it&#39;s about time&#34;, there was a longstanding prediction that the arm architecture would overtake x86."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always wondered why Apple was pushing so much functionality into the iPhone that almost all users really didn&#39;t need. I was thinking it would get them ready for coming AR glasses and whatnot, but it was also preparing them to win on the Mac side as well."</p>
