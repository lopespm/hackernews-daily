								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just to put this in perspective, the global population of mountain gorillas is 1,063, so this represents the symbolic adoption of over 3 times the mountain gorillas alive in the wild!I hope this unexpected boon in capital will allow for some meaningful work in preserving and protecting these rare animals.  It would be an interesting footnote in history if we can look back in 50 years and draw a line between an internet meme, reckless asset trading, and a change in the trajectory of the fate an endangered species."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The title is confusing, perhaps worth changing &#34;Reddit investors&#34; to &#34;Wall Street Bets users&#34; or something similar. I genuinely thought the article would talk about owners of Reddit, not it&#39;s users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have not significantly used Notion, but this isn&#39;t really a replacement for it is it?Notion seems to be focused on wiki and notes, with built in structured data allowing you to setup things like boards and task lists.This seems to just be the boards and task lists without the free form notes and wiki? It pretty clearly replaces Trello and Asana. Notion seems like a stretch from the 5 minutes I poked around in it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just downloaded and tested the standalone desktop app. It has a very pretty and responsive interface compared to Kanboard.I have been self hosting Kanboard on my rpi for my own work, and I think that Kanboard still has many &#39;poweruser&#39; features that Focalboard is missing.If there is an easy way for me to migrate my Kanboard data over to Focalboard, I would definitely give it a shot as a daily driver."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder if they have any sales to large enterprises or similar institutions.In my experience, the larger organizations will have a &#34;security&#34; questionnaire required of their vendors, and the person administering it is a droid, incapable of evaluating whether the questions, originally written in the mid-00s and only updated for buzzword compliance since, are applicable to modern security practice today, or to the particular product/service/vendor in question. And no firewalls or routers would be massive, disqualifying red flags on such a questionnaire.Never mind that a KISS setup tends to bring security because of its minimized attack surface. In the minds that write and administer those questionnaires, security only comes from sufficient amounts of the right kinds of complexity.I&#39;m sure it can be done. IIRC, Cloudflare doesn&#39;t use any firewalls, and they do some big business. It just isn&#39;t easy to get past the droids programmed to ensure that all pegs shall be properly square, IME."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I start the day with a short walk outdoors. I don’t want the first thing my eyes see to be print, and I don’t want the first thing my body does to be sitting. So I walk a bit.I like that. I like that a lot. That&#39;s a very enviable practice. I think I know what I&#39;ll be experimenting with this next week.Did not expect to read that article and have the most stand out thing be a routine change I&#39;d want to copy. You never know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice article. rsync.net is one part of my personal computing setup that I never even think twice about. It&#39;s simple and it works, and that clearly applies to the infrastructure too. I use ZFS locally and it has made managing my own data strangely pleasing, and it&#39;s nice to have the same system on my off-site storage too.On the laptop-front, I find myself drifting towards a similar setup to John. I have a hefty workstation laptop but the battery life is dire and it weighs a ton, so I pretty much just run it as a headless machine next to my server now. I&#39;m planning on picking up a Pinebook Pro as an &#34;outdoors&#34; machine to just remote in. I also find myself extremely unwilling to arse about swapping multiple machines on my monitors so being able to keep my work machine separate and secure but operate it from my desktop is a nice compromise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The idea was to create a tool to sort the named CSS colors in a way that it shows related colors together. So, next time I can&#39;t decide between a few CSS colors, I can just check them here side by side.I&#39;ve created this tool last summer, but I hadn&#39;t shared it here back then. It&#39;s a PWA that I made with pure JS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is definitely a cool way of exploring CSS colors.But, serious question: does anyone actually use CSS colors except for a handful of the basics (&#34;red&#34;, &#34;blue&#34;) for prototyping/debugging?I mean, the idea of typing &#34;background-color: lightsalmon;&#34; just feels so bizarre to me.Whenever I&#39;ve needed to come up with colors from scratch, I&#39;ll just start with an intuitive best guess -- e.g. &#34;hsl(30, 80%, 50%)&#34; -- and then iterate a couple times till I get what I&#39;m looking for.It seems like even more effort to try to select colors from the CSS palette when it might turn out that there isn&#39;t even a satisfactory one. The CSS colors are still extremely limited. E.g. the distance between neighbors like &#34;dark cyan&#34; and &#34;darkslategray&#34; is huge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good reminder that in CSS, darkgray is a light gray and gray is a dark gray. Also presumably up is down and wet is dry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; While our log analysis, conducted from March 5 through March 8, confirmed that this was a rare issue, it could not rule out the possibility that a session had been incorrectly returned but then never used. This was not a risk we were willing to take, given the potential impact of even one of these incorrectly returned sessions being used.It is funny how they make it seem like they are super cautious. When in fact they had no other choice than do it when you rephrase the problem as &#34; there were maybe some people who got the admin right of the github account of some of our customers&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well that&#39;s embarrassing. Passing a mutable dictionary—containing callbacks that could be closed over heaven-even-knows-what, no less!—between threads? And it&#39;s re-used between requests?They are lucky this wasn&#39;t much, much worse.Why does the error reporting service need to call the web thread back anyway?Yet another case where immutable-everything would have prevented this hairball from accreting in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; One such performance improvement involved moving the logic to check a user’s enabled features into a background thread that refreshed on an interval rather than checking their enablement while the request was being processed.This type of thing is why PHP&#39;s shared-nothing model is vastly undervalued IMO.Does PHP have the ability to use threads if you really need it? Yes.Are they generally a PITA to use? Yes.Is this a problem for the vast, vast, vast majority of projects? Not in the slightest.Having a separate invocation of the runtime for each request is a feature, not a failing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really love when program authors actually explain what is happening behind the scenes like this and even go into details about how they made the small details work.I may or may not use this program but I did definitely learned another cool thing about Linux just now and that would most certainly be useful to me sometime in the future in an all together totally different context.Thanks for the software and the explanation!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a clever use of fuse/sshfs and chroots to allow you to run programs on remote computers. However, for many workloads, isn&#39;t the network I/O going to outweigh the benefits of remote CPU cycles?I really think this is a clever hack, but I&#39;m not sure how useful it is. Is it really good for the transcoding example? I could see that being good if the remote machine has a better GPU, but I&#39;m struggling to see how this could work for other use-cases. Maybe compiling (which was one of the main use-cases behind Sun&#39;s SGE)?I do most of my work on HPC clusters, so moving compute out to remote nodes is something I&#39;m very interested in... and I&#39;d love to learn more about what kinds of workflows the authors had in mind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried an openMOSIX cluster back in the day when it was fashionable. Cluster-Knoppix could transform a bunch of old pc&#39;s in an instant SSI cluster with almost zero configuration needed. Though I know it is not the most efficient way, I miss the simplicity of it.A shell script that simply launches a new process on the most idle node of a network would be enough to get back some of that experience. Live migration would be even better, almost perfect for that. Hope some day I can easily build a bewolf cluster out of my ARM SBC&#39;s with an experience similar to the old days of Cluster-Knoppix."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems to be a lot of questions about how bootstrapped startups handle customer support.I&#39;m the cofounder of Eureka Surveys. We&#39;re bootstrapped, profitable, and just crossed 1M+ users. We&#39;ve had an amazing experience hiring customer support in the Philippines. I have a thread about it on Twitter: https://twitter.com/t0mstah/status/1356296043009253382The tl;dr is that you can hire cheap ($3.50/hr), high quality virtual assistants from the Philippines to handle customer support for you, all from day one. Having CS has really made a difference for us in our business and is one of our main differentiators as we&#39;ve scaled up the CS team.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"the problem with wanting to write biographies of failures is the same problem with publishing negative results in science: there are too many failures, and too many ways to fail. It&#39;s like entropy - there are so many ways to do something wrong that it&#39;s not very efficient to learn how to do something by enumerating all the ways you cannot do it. Much rarer is success, which is why it&#39;s more worth the time to study. Maybe this is a controversial opinion.Maybe adjacent failures are worth study - studies of people who very nearly succeeded compared to someone who did, where subtle differences ended up being significant. These kinds of things can create &#34;what to watch out for&#34; kinds of guides.In addition - what is failure? Was Nikola Tesla a failure? He died broke... but he still invented AC generators..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Henry Petroski has written several excellent essays and books about engineering failures, why it is inherent in engineering pursuits that there will be failures, why it is important to learn the right lessons from these failures, and why each new generation will forget past lessons.Start with: &#34;To Engineer Is Human: The Role of Failure in Successful Design&#34; (1985)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amen! I&#39;ve found that 9 times out of 10 successful people follow the same advice and believe the same things as unsuccessful people (at least they SAY they do). So it&#39;s really useful to look at people who failed yet followed the same advice.    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias"</p>

Isn&#39;t there some conflict from the investor when the companies are so similar?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for licensing this under a proper open source license. Out of curiosity, how would you feel about a company selling this as a service? It&#39;s obviously legal per the license, but I&#39;m wondering what your perspective is. If you encourage it, do you have any plans for how to ensure everybody are happy and turns a profit from it?I have grown cynical over the years with these kinds of open source challengers as it seems to be a playbook these days to bait and switch, going from a) freely license a competitor to b) build a large user base to c) switch license to consolidate power over the software, make money and slowly kill it.Of course what&#39;s once open source will always stay that way, but if you&#39;re large enough when you branch, your engineering resources alone might be enough to turn people off the OSS fork."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love it. This (your commercial product) will go in an MVP I&#39;m building. I&#39;ve been using Intercom, which seems like the best option, but it&#39;s just so damn expensive for an MVP and that top tier price is not met by their medium tier product imo.tbh I&#39;d pay even for the first agent (perhaps a free trial would have sufficed), but the Hacker tier does make it a certainty I&#39;ll trial it.Something most tool providers don&#39;t seem to get is that when I&#39;m first building something I&#39;m extremely price sensitive, but once I&#39;ve got going I don&#39;t really care, like a tax if you take X% of my profit but you make my life easier and make it easier to grow that profit, who cares? That&#39;s fine compared to rinsing me when I&#39;m not making any revenue (as with intercom). And if your product is any good, there&#39;s no way I&#39;m going to switch once I get some traction,  as the cost of any tool is ~ zero compared to the cost of employees."</p>
