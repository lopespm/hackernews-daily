								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oof, that sucks and I feel for you. That said...&gt; setting up in a new region would be complicated for us.Sounds to me like you&#39;ve got a few weeks to get this working. Deprioritize all other work, get everyone working on this little DevOps/Infra project. You should&#39;ve been multi-region from the outset, if not multi-cloud.When using the public cloud, we do tend to take it all for granted and don&#39;t even think about the fact that physical hardware is required for our clusters and that, yes, they can run out.Anyways, however hard getting another region set up may be, it seems you&#39;ve no choice but to prioritize that work now. May also want to look into other cloud providers as well, depending on how practical or how overkill going multi-cloud may or may not be for your needs.I wish you luck."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is nothing new, Azure has been having capacity problem for over a year now[1]. Germany is not the only region affected at all, it&#39;s the case for a number of instance types in some of their larger US regions as well. In the meantime you can still commit to reserved instances, there is just not a guarantee of getting those instances when you need them.The biggest advice I can give is 1. keep trying and grabbing capacity continuously, then run with more than what you need. 2. Explore migrating to another Azure region that runs less constrained. You mention a new region would be complicated, but it is likely much easier than another cloud.1. https://www.zdnet.com/article/azures-capacity-limitations-ar..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great potato story. Loosely related story here. My late grandfather in Belarus (the land of potatoes) loved potatoes just like everyone around. Well, he was an electrician at the concrete/brick making factory for entirety of his career, from right after the war until he retired in the late 80ies. The amount of electricity used to fire the kilns for bricks is well known to be huge. He said that they&#39;d see the rats scutter along the power lines on the wall and every once in a while they&#39;d touch the rails wrong and disappear in the scintillating disintegration. Oh, and he let me weld random junk together with his own cobbled together electrical welding kit when I was like 8, oh I loved that so much. I miss him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah I thought this would be a new take on that apocryphal bayesian story&gt;An engineer draws a random sample of electron tubes and measures their voltage. The measurements range from 75 to 99 volts. A statistician computes the sample mean and a confidence interval for the true mean. Later the statistician discovers that the voltmeter reads only as far as 100, so the population appears to be &#39;censored&#39;. This necessitates a new analysis, if the statistician is orthodox. However, the engineer says he has another meter reading to 1000 volts, which he would have used if any voltage had been over 100. This is a relief to the statistician, because it means the population was effectively uncensored after all. But, the next day the engineer informs the statistician that this second meter was not working at the time of the measuring. The statistician ascertains that the engineer would not have held up the measurements until the meter was fixed, and informs him that new measurements are required. The engineer is astounded. &#34;Next you&#39;ll be asking about my oscilloscope&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google locked our company out of using our own domain on Google Workspaces because a former employee had signed up for a Workspace account using our domain, and we had no way to recover it. We literally manage our domain in GCP but they wouldn&#39;t accept that we own our own domain and thus won&#39;t let us use our domain with Workspaces, which screws you out of a lot of Google functionality. Never seen a company that was too incompetent to allow users to use its own product and make zero attempt to solve the customer&#39;s problem.Google Cloud CEO Thomas Kurian said &#34;We need scale to be profitable.&#34; No, you need to stop treating your customers like crap to be profitable. We don&#39;t trust you, you are a pain in our asses, and we have alternatives, so there is really no need for us to spend our money on you. It&#39;s now a matter of when we all move to AWS and Azure, not if."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow I&#39;m really sorry this happened to you. I do believe your conclusions are correct about AWS. Azure generally seems fine too.Google&#39;s aversion to customer service makes them extremely dangerous as a cloud provider in my mind. This also goes for other critical business services, like Gsuite (I know! It&#39;s convenient).If you have GCP or Gsuite now and you&#39;re trying to evaluate how big of a deal it is my suggestion would be to pick up a phone and attempt to talk with someone at Google about your account. This experience can act as a preview of what that process might look like when services are turned off.If you try to call Amazon on the other hand it feels like Jeff Bezos might hop on the call if things aren&#39;t going well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the beginning of the year, I was recommended by a friend working at Google to test GCP using the tutorials on https://www.cloudskillsboost.google/Google banned my account while I was doing one tutorial. One step failed, the provisioning of something, and I had to redo a few things again. It succeeded but I had used more egress bandwidth than allowed to run the tutorial correctly so they banned me automatically a few minutes later.The support unbanned me after some time but I thought it was a sign to not use GCP yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a wonderful article. Thanks for sharing. As always, Cloudflare blog posts do not disappoint.It’s very interesting that they are essentially treating IP addresses as “data”. Once looking at the problem from a distributed system lens, the solution here can be mapped to distributed systems almost perfectly.- Replicating a piece of data on every host in the fleet is expensive, but fast and reliable. The compromise is usually to keep one replica in a region; same as how they share a single /32 IP address in a region.- “sending datagram to IP X” is no different than “fetching data X from a distributed system”. This is essentially the underlying philosophy of the soft-unicast. Just like data lives in a distributed system/cloud, you no longer know where is an IP address located.It’s ingenious.They said they don’t like stateful NAT, which is understandable. But the load balancer has to be stateful still to perform the routing correctly. It would be an interesting follow up blog post talking about how they coordinate port/data movements (moving a port from server A to server B), as it’s state management (not very different from moving data in a distributed system again)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever I see the name Marek Majkowski come up, I know the blog post is going to be good.I had to solve this exact problem a year ago when attempting to build an anycast forward proxy, quickly came to the conclusion that it&#39;d be impossible without a massive infrastructure presence. Ironically I was using CF connections to debug how they might go about this problem, when I realized they were just using local unicast routes for egress traffic I stopped digging any deeper.Maintaining a routing table in unimog to forward lopsided egress connections to the correct DC is brilliant and shows what is possible when you have a global network to play with, however I wonder if this opens up an attack vector where previously distributed connections are now being forwarded &amp; centralized at a single DC, especially if they are all destined for the same port slice..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; However, while anycast works well in the ingress direction, it can&#39;t operate on egress. Establishing an outgoing connection from an anycast IP won&#39;t work. Consider the response packet. It&#39;s likely to be routed back to a wrong place - a data center geographically closest to the sender, not necessarily the source data center!Slightly OT question, but why wouldn&#39;t this be a problem with ingress, too?E.g. suppose I want to send a request to https://1.2.3.4. What I don&#39;t know is that 1.2.3.4 is an anycast address.So my client sends a SYN packet to 1.2.3.4:443 to open the connection. The packet is routed to data center #1. The data center duly replies with a SYN/ACK packet, which my client answers with an ACK packet.However, due to some bad luck, the ACK packet is routed to data center #2 which is also a destination for the anycast address.Of course, data center #2 doesn&#39;t know anything about my connection, so it just drops the ACK or replies with a RST. In the best case, I can eventually resend my ACK and reach the right data center (with multi-second delay), in the worst case, the connection setup will fail.Why does this not happen on ingress, but is a problem for egress?Even if the handshake uses SYN cookies and got through on data center #2, what would keep subsequent packets that I send on that connection from being routed to random data centers that don&#39;t know anything about the connection?"</p>

So if you want to see if an email address has an account, try signing up for a new account with the same email address.This is not true if the signup flow is implemented correctly. Signing up for an account should always respond with the same message &#34;we sent an email for you to confirm your account signup&#34;. The owner of that email address then receives an email - either 1) normal signup process, or 2) &#34;did you just try to sign up? You already have a valid account for this email address.&#34;This way you cannot tell via the signup web form alone whether an account exists or not.

Even giants (at the time) like Nokia would release phones which couldn&#39;t dial the emergency services, or put out more than the legal limit of radiation, or were in other ways defective.We&#39;d test, send a report back, wait a few weeks, get a new firmware, test again, repeat until everything worked. It took months. That was fine when phones weren&#39;t expected to be updated by users.But when more modern phones arrived with flashable firmware, customers couldn&#39;t stand the delays associated with testing.  They&#39;d see a new firmware had been released and complained that the mobile network operators were delaying progress, dragging our feet, deliberately depriving customers of something cool.The fact was, operators very often didn&#39;t certify the firmware because it contained *dangerous* bugs.  I&#39;m sure there was also a cost element - why pay to re-test a phone that you&#39;re no longer selling? - but that wasn&#39;t the primary driver.Well, the manufacturers and customers &#34;won&#34;. If you buy a phone through your network, it probably has a network-certified firmware blob.  If not, you&#39;re at the mercy of the manufacturer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article, dating back to January, lays it out pretty clearly: https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2022/01/google-fixes-nightma...&gt; If you&#39;re logged out, launching Microsoft Teams 10 times will result in 10 duplicate PhoneAccounts from Teams clogging your phone. Teams shouldn&#39;t do this, and Microsoft&#39;s update stopped Teams from doing this, but a bunch of duplicate PhoneAccounts also shouldn&#39;t be enough to bring Android&#39;s phone system to its knees.&gt; Next bug: when picking a PhoneAccount to run the emergency call through, [...] it&#39;s possible for this to result in an integer overflow or underflow, and now the phone subsystem is going to crash.&gt; A third bug in this mess is that Microsoft Teams does not even register itself as an emergency call handler.&gt; An update is not arriving for the Pixel 6 yet. Google&#39;s newest flagship is going though a bit of an update crisis at the moment. The December 2021 update was pulled due to unrelated &#34;mobile connectivity issues&#34; (phone calls don&#39;t work). While Google scrambles to fix everything, the next Pixel 6 update with this 911 fix is due in &#34;late January.&#34; Until then, it&#39;s normal to be on the November patch. Both of Google&#39;s &#34;early January&#34; and &#34;late January&#34; patch timelines seem incredibly slow for a bug that could cause users to literally die.If the OP article is correct, then apparently this still hasn&#39;t actually been fixed yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m all over the place with pocket computing devices and remain confused.  I once has an iphone.  Beautifully crafted, both inside and out, but so frustratingly locked down that I was desperate to leave it behind.  They have progressively opened up the platform, but it always lags behind (I remember I couldn&#39;t access the cloud storage from anything other than a mac).My favourite devices have been more alternative.  E90 running symbian, which was fairly &#39;open&#39; for its time - I could install any software, proper multitasking.  The N900 also, full linux system, great phone.  But then the apps I find useful, are often not available for that platform.At the moment I&#39;m on Pixel, which has been a good balance between being well supported, while still fairly open.  I can sideload apps, run a linux distro in the form of termux.  As a bonus the camera is great.  I have to remind myself that while it might not quite compare to iphones in terms of refinement and hardware, I do at least have more freedom on the platform, and it&#39;s easy to take that for granted until you lose it."</p>
