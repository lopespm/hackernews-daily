								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is probably the only tech acquisition that&#39;s ever made me sad. I just hate Adobe so much. The nightmare of their installer, the weird store with horrible designs popping up when you activate normal ui stuff, the difficulty in canceling a subscription, and the stasis in their product and ui. Oh and the sloppiness of Lightroom on mac with it&#39;s weird ui and that it didn&#39;t even import and manage photos well.I&#39;ve been so happy to have Adobe out of my life these last 10 years. I never even cared about the cost.And figma has been so admirable, one of the best browser based apps. Always squeezing incredible performance out of the web with their crazy c++ engine. And their fast pace of delivering new features, often reworking ui just for the craft of it. It&#39;s been fun to just read the release notes.https://www.figma.com/blog/webassembly-cut-figmas-load-time-...Perhaps the silver lining will be the talent scattering, moving to and founding other companies, but for today this sucks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"According to the FTC the law states that mergers are illegal when the effect &#34;may be substantially to lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly.&#34;Pretty positive this would lessen competition in design software and restablish Adobe as a monopoly. This merger should be blocked.https://www.ftc.gov/advice-guidance/competition-guidance/gui..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a current software engineer at Adobe, I was really disappointed when I got the internal email announcing this this morning. It&#39;s reminiscent of Microsoft&#39;s anticompetitive behavior in the early 00s. Figma is the better product and Adobe knows it - but instead of using that to light a fire under them and work harder to create a better product, Adobe just used its deep pockets to make the problem go away. I was already planning on leaving the company for other reasons but this is the nail in the coffin for me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Used to work for a “high risk” payment processor, we inherited tons of accounts that were terminated by Stripe, Square, and PayPal. Here’s one small bit of inside info that may help the newer businesses out there:Most real payment processors (e.g. banks, merchant services companies) “underwrite” a company BEFORE allowing them to process. Underwriting means they look over the business model, financials, etc and make sure the business is an acceptable risk, not doing anything illegal or against their terms, etc. So you’re more likely to be declined initially, but if you’re lit up, you should be good for the future because the underwriters actually saw the deal and approved it.While I haven’t worked for these other companies, a lot of experience seems to show that Stripe, Square and PayPal operate differently: they light up ANYONE, and then only underwrite when the account hits a critical threshold of revenue. So it’s easy to get an account there, but if you scale up, that’s when you’ll be scrutinized and potentially terminated. It’s a very unethical practice because it ends up hitting businesses at the worst possible time, when the termination or suspension causes a huge financial hit.So basically, always have a backup processor and use these web based services at small scale to prove out your model, but NEVER rely on them as your sole payment solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a very similar experience, except it was on our launch day.We hadn&#39;t charged a single live customer yet, but we had done plenty of tests using the Stripe testing environment. So we go live with a huge launch event, and we have customers signing up in droves. When they get to the last step -- payment -- they get an error.Logging in to the dashboard I didn&#39;t see any indication that there was anything wrong with our account. No alerts or notices. We had already gone through the approval process you go through when signing up, and been told we were approved.The thing that surprised me the most was that there was just no indication anywhere that our account would not be able to charge cards. Wouldn&#39;t it make sense for there to be an indicator somewhere that just says &#34;Not ready yet&#34;?Apparently, they had never even begun reviewing/vetting us since the time we signed up for the account months earlier. We reached out to customer support and it took them about two weeks to get us activated. And, similar to OP, they never gave us a shred of information about what was going on. I still don&#39;t know to this day what the issue was.Next time I build something with Stripe I&#39;m going to test it in production before launching, with my own real credit card!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The worst part about these type of cases is not being able to get a straight answer. There is a whole subset of big tech that has taken the &#34;you must be a fraudster therefore we can&#39;t unfuck the situation&#34; approach to customer support.It&#39;s an arms race with fraudsters that eventually sucks in legitimate businesses."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Prior to the merge ethereum’s trust was controlled by the organizations with the most money who bought/built massive data centers to mine it.With the merge &amp; staking that abstraction layer has disappeared and it’s still the organizations with the most money who control it.Sure it’s great that non-productive math problems no longer need to be solved &amp; consume so much energy and hardware to make it all work. And it may be an incremental improvement over traditional global finance because there is a much greater ability to publicly scrutinize what goes on.But no one should consider this a fundamental paradigm shift &amp; democratization compare to traditional financial systems controlled by a a very small number of big players. Their influence still can override the mining process that’s supposed to be the final word on transactions.Although I’ll clarify a bit: I’m actually a proponent of having a layer of human judgement that can fix a problem when things go off the rails. The issue is that in crypto this layer is even less accessible to smaller players than in traditional finance. The DAO was able to throw its weight around and get a hard fork, but how many other groups with much less influence have suffered from similar problems and exploits without that same benefit?Yes, even in traditional finance there are some types of irreversible fraud. But for every day transactions, for using money as a daily part of transactions necessary to live your life and not just as a speculative investment, crypto falls far short.If a criminal spies on my credit card # as I make a purchase and uses that to go on a spending spree I can fix it with the credit card company with little cost but a few hours of time and frustration. If my wallet is pick pocketed or I simply lose it by accident I have a similar recourse to mitigate the fallout. Crypto? No. It may, eventually, have some other benefits though that’s yet to be seen. But as a major change &amp; liberation of people from massively powerful banks and governments there seems to be nothing more that shouted rhetoric and wishful thinking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It&#39;s like Finland has suddenly shut off its power gridSo, have we observed global energy usage go down by about one Finland?Shouldn&#39;t that be observable somehow? Shouldn&#39;t there be some power stations reducing their output as a reaction to reduced demand?Anyone know how this would be visible, and on what kind of time frame we expect it to become visible?I&#39;m not claiming it hasn&#39;t happened. I just feel surprised to not see more coverage of that in this article, nor here in the comments. Energy efficiency is largely the point of this major change. Shouldn&#39;t there be graphs of the power grids everywhere showing a big drop? Maybe my expectations are just off on that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Merge is one of the largest technological events in the industry to date.I feel kinda ashamed. I work in the IT industry and I claim to have knowledge about (&#34;good&#34;) software engineering practices, distributed systems,  compilers, algorithms, etc. Nevertheless, I didn&#39;t understand a word of what the article is saying. Could you recommend serious references (preferably books and not random blogs) I could read to catch up with what&#39;s going on with crypto these days? I&#39;m not planning to &#34;buy&#34; crypto; I would like to understand the technicalities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sounds like they have a interesting history behind the creation of Penpot:&gt; Penpot was (effectively) born in a Kaleidos personal innovation week (PIWEEK, aka recurring hackathon) in 2018. Back then we had been recently forced to break one of our sacred rules at the company “only open source tools and platforms are allowed to build technology” due to F1gm4’s overwhelmingly productivity boost for designers at the company. “We are second-class citizens in open source, it’s frustrating and it’s painful!” they cried, and they were right.https://kaleidos.net/ seems like an interesting place to work as well.Gonna be exciting to see where Penpot moves from here. I&#39;m a 100% Figma user who just signed up for Penpot and gonna see if it&#39;s possible to adopt for my own workflows.Particularly interesting for me as a Clojure/Script developer is that Penpot is written in Clojure and ClojureScript, but the average user won&#39;t care about that. But will also be interesting to see if they&#39;ll be able to keep iterating at the same speed as they currently are, and how the language will affect it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the beauty of FOSS. It might be rough at the edges but you can always have access to it and not have to worry about losing your daily driver (talking to you Figma). Every organization  needs to start thinking about this and invest in good FOSS tools for any recent technology to avoid business continuity  risk."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m excited to see alternatives to Figma, because using it is like an emotional rollercoaster for me. There are times when I&#39;ll open a massive project file with hundreds of frames, each with thousands of graphical nodes. And even then, I can zoom in and out with no friction at all, it&#39;s just buttery smooth. I&#39;ve been a developer for over a decade, and I have no idea at all how they&#39;re able to pull that off. It&#39;s a technical marvel.On the other hand, it&#39;s far from what I would want for a modern design tool. Managing tokens, or anything from the &#34;design system&#34; world, is an absolute headache. Compared to the efficiency of the dev tools I use, it feels like Figma (and every other design tool) is just light years behind.Even when I use a tool that&#39;s built specifically for that purpose, like Supernova, I still feel pretty underwhelmed. I&#39;m not sure exactly what I&#39;m looking for, but I know that the current landscape doesn&#39;t cut it for me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Notable highlights for me:&gt; Lockdown Mode is available in iOS 16 and coming soon in iPadOS 16 and macOS Ventura.&gt; Web browsing - Certain complex web technologies are blocked, which might cause some websites to load more slowly or not operate correctly. In addition, web fonts might not be displayed, and images might be replaced with a missing image icon.The first sentence I believe is referring to disabling JIT (just in time compilation of Javascript), which is dangerous as it allocates W+X pages which are often used by the final stage of an exploit. Apple did an amazing job already of hardening iOS by severely restricting which applications can use JIT (and this is their justification for why non-Safari browser engines are not allowed on iOS) and even enabling per-thread memory page permissions. Many more details are in this fantastic post from Google&#39;s project Zero: https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2020/09/jitsploitatio...Overall it&#39;s very interesting to see Apple invest so significantly in something that will benefit relatively few users -- not that I&#39;m complaining!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For kids over 1 year, some sanity saving notes (I have more than 4 kids, was about to go crazy when I got my second and then learned the things below):- everyone wakes halfway up multiple times each night to see if everything is OK. Make sure they don&#39;t fall asleep with anything that can&#39;t stay with them during the night: music, tv, light, food, drink or another person (you or others).- to teach kids to sleep, make them feel safe about it. What I did was walking in at a fixed schedule, starting at exact 3 minutes between the first night (I used a digital kitchen timer back then, a smartphone later) and increasing by two minutes every night. Surprisingly fast, my kids learn that I didn&#39;t disappear, and he&#39;ll be around even if they don&#39;t cry. Once they realized this they started playing with the toy the were allowed to keep in the bed. But, keep in mind: don&#39;t stop coming back if they are silent. A major part of the idea is that they realize that they don&#39;t have to do anything to make sure we don&#39;t forget them. Oh: and keep a very close ear with them in the beginning so they don&#39;t wake up and think they are alone.I never really could get myself to accept the idea that &#34;they need to cry themselves to sleep&#34; and every thing I tried before this didn&#39;t work on my oldest.This worked on my oldest kid, she started sleeping through the night within a week and also became calmer and I got my sleep back. With the rest of them it took 2-3 days only since I started earlier (shortly after they was a year old).Maybe other methods work too, but this was easy for us and we didn&#39;t have to let the kids cry to sleep or anything else I have seen recommended online that I didn&#39;t like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My partner is a doctor mainly working in early childhood prevention. When she did some recent training on evidence based early childhood care (which is surprisingly rare, most early childhood care is not really evidence based), she learned a couple of things that she said she really would like to have known when we had our children were born.One is that you get told a lot about averages. So commonly parents get told that babies (should) sleep around 12h a day. What nobody talks about is the variance. There are babies who sleep only 8h a day and others who sleep close to 20h. So you end up with parents who thing they need to get their child to sleep, even though the child is absolutely not tired.Also a lot of people talk about not giving children too much impressions/stimulation. Which is also generally false, giving them stimulation will actually make them tired and sleep better, they also learn stuff. Obviously you don&#39;t do that just before or when going to bed."</p>

I&#39;d take reading papers like this over mommy blogs every day of the week, even if it&#39;s to state the ostensibly obvious.Does anyone have any other interesting child-rearing resources in this style?"</p>
