								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An interesting quick dive into how some of the artifacts of historical implementations can carry forward decades later. I&#39;m saving this one. While everyone on HN is probably familiar with a pile of examples of this in our own work particularly if you do anything lower level, this is a nice example because it&#39;s really easy to grasp even for total non-programmers and gives a feel for the layers upon layers the digital world is built on. Details on the x86-64 bootstrap sequence are interesting to tech people but this is the sort of thing I might show in a school class.That said at first I thought the author was being a bit tongue in cheek on the suggestion to fix it with:&gt;A downside to making any changes is that the badly formatted GIFs won&#39;t render any more. I reckon just be bold, like the release of Netscape 2.0...If Netscape was fine with breaking poorly-made GIFs, we should be too!But we kind of have a bit more content now then when Netscape 2 was released, and it seems they&#39;re serious?  Support more than 256 colours in a single frame of GIF animation
  Support fast GIFs (10ms delay)
  No confusing behaviour with small delay = slow GIF
  Better compression for GIFs with multiple small areas updated per frame

But frankly at this point why? We&#39;ve got good universally adapted image formats that do more than 256 colors. We&#39;ve got webm and so on (even Apple caved on that one in the end) for baked animation which is much smaller and more powerful than gif, and plenty of CPU and libraries for generation on the fly. We&#39;ve got powerful ways to do animation purely with HTML/CSS/SVG/JS. GIF is a historical artifact with a lot of its value at this point purely about old things. This wouldn&#39;t even retroactively bring newer capabilities to older systems because it would require updated code which by definition means the ability to run new browsers and thus modern capabilities.I get they really enjoy hacking on gif but come on. Only way I can see it working is if all the players agreed on some metadata that could be added to gifs which wanted &#39;standards&#39; vs &#39;historical&#39; playback with the default remaining historical, and potentially also make it a browser setting. That&#39;d still leave the ad issue, but maybe at this point that&#39;s moot given the advancements in blockers (and it&#39;d be a very easy thing to look for as an indication of an ad, and thus be selected against)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the ”Internet Explorer 5 is closed source, but could hypothetically look something like this” bit.Is this source code available through MS partnership programs or an old leak?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rate limiting or clamping &#34;0&#34; delays upwards can also help for polling applications where you want to be as fast as possible, but you&#39;re never going to be actually zero. For example if you have a thread that&#39;s pulling images from a camera (publishing at 30 fps) in a loop, you can delay for 1ms between polls and nobody is going to know, but that can have an enormous impact on CPU usage; especially on embedded platforms. Instead of running at 100% thread usage (calling camera.read() and waiting for it to return true), the spin/loop cost is basically free and you only need to worry about the cost of acquiring/decoding the frame. In theory branch prediction should help because you&#39;ll take the &#34;no image yet&#34; branch 99% of the time, but in practice that just makes the loop iterate faster. I learned this the hard way writing a custom camera publisher in ROS, but I&#39;ve seen it a lot in tutorial code and I think a lot of beginners make that mistake."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"IMO this would be more enjoyable if the shapes were more different morphologically, and fewer (ideally no) close pairs which differ only in the length of a segment by a single block.After the first couple of wrong guesses (though I&#39;m pretty sure one guess was correct - could be the bug https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30408567) I started to count segment lengths rather than relying on mental shape rotation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sometimes the initial rotation hides a part of the shape.Also, I have always wondered if there&#39;s a way to translate these shapes to strings for quick &#34;mental algorithm&#34; matching. Something like, &#34;5, left turn, 3, right turn...&#34;I guess you&#39;d need a normal form. The first turn can be defined as always &#34;right&#34; or &#34;left,&#34; and subsequent turns can be right, left, up or down. The first turn that&#39;s &#34;up&#34; or &#34;down,&#34; can be defined as &#34;up.&#34; That leaves two ways to read any shape, but that&#39;s an uhh constant-factor overhead. :)(I can&#39;t think of a way to define a normal form reading direction that wouldn&#39;t involve potentially reading an arbitrary distance in before having to re-start the other way.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For VR (Quest/Steam) There is a beautiful minimalistic game called Cubism that uses a similar set of shapes in 3 dimensional space where you need to fit the group of blocks into increasingly complex forms.  It&#39;s a very soothing environment and the graphics are so clear with technical touches like a high frame rate (120hz), perfect hand controls, and use of AR/passthrough, all possible due to the relatively simple game requirements.   Highly recommend the experience if you can do it.There is also a free open version similar to Cubism built in WebXR called Plockle that follows the same theme [2].[1] https://www.cubism-vr.com/[2] https://constructarcade.com/game/plockle/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On personal anecdotes, I&#39;ve used the same internet identity across all platforms and it&#39;s not hard to locate my real life identity from there...since like 20 years ago when I got on the internet. So all the good reputation and bad reputation followed me through all the time, and surprised me in better and worse way depending on the context. There&#39;re times when I wished I had concealed myself saying certain things (or just haven&#39;t said it), and times when I felt the joy of recognition when people connected dots. Now as I&#39;m getting old, it&#39;s just a habit, no longer about risk or rewards.Both younger me and older me will probably be very indecisive about doing this if they&#39;ve never done it and are told about all the fortune/misfortune from this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As careful as some of the things he suggests are...if you&#39;re truly wanted by a state-level actor or sufficiently motivated attacker, you won&#39;t be able to hide by simply using VPN and Tor. Especially if you&#39;re running something with many transactions like AlphaBay. You would need to obfuscate quite a bit more:- if you&#39;re using VPN traffic but most people &#34;around&#34; you aren&#39;t, you&#39;re a suspicious node; your ISP could easily flag you to your government. If you use wifi at a common point you&#39;re likely to be flagged and there isn&#39;t an easy way other than keeping on the move. But moving often is another anomalous event, and it&#39;s very difficult to do even for Drug Lords ( El Chapo ) or Terrorists that it behooves to do. This puts you in a sort of Zugzwang, to borrow a chess term.- there&#39;s always leakage, for instance, in the way you talk with people in the real world. At some point you send enough communication for sophisticated frequency analysis.- and there are other patterns of usage that could be used to identify you, like searches or even keyboard frequency on anonymized accounts can be de-anonymized by very specific markers ( ML works! ).- off ramps for crypto aren&#39;t very good. If you&#39;re in e.g. Brazil, haha, yeah, good luck spending bitcoin or any other crypto and going unnoticed. Mixers and tumblers will eventually leak and you&#39;ll be caught.- you&#39;re very vulnerable to social engineering by people you do business with. one slip where you stop communicating in a transactional mode of communication and that&#39;s a weak link in your armor.In the end, the FBI only has to be right once, and you have to be right every time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Or you can just be a known drug lord, launder billions of USD through a respected  international bank, no one goes to jail, small fine, and they&#39;re probably still laundering 10 years later and no one cares. No one is anonymous. They&#39;re probably all using SMS and corporate email.Sell a little bit of drugs through the silk road and you&#39;ll get royally f-ed! Sell all the opioids in the world through a public pharma corp and you can keep enjoying your jet-set life and yacht.The allegedly smartest people in the world are focusing on the dumbest problems while being reamed by the frat-boys that went to Wall Street and Politics, guns and drugs.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"God damn... this is it, this is the end-game. There&#39;s no way to fight this unless you customize and maintain blocking scripts for each individual website.Yes, websites could always have done this, but the REST (CDN-bypassing) requests&#39; cost and the manual maintenance for the telemetry endpoints and storage was an impediment that Google just gives them a drop-in solution for :(I think Google is happy to eat some of the cost for the &#34;proxy&#34; server given the abundance of data they&#39;ll be gobbling up (not just each request&#39;s query string and users&#39; IP address but -being a subdomain- all the 1st party cookies as well). I don&#39;t have the time or energy to block JavaScript and/or manually inspect each domain&#39;s requests to figure out if they use server-side tracking or not.I honestly don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any solution to this at all. Maybe using an archive.is-like service that renders the static page (as an image at the extreme), or a Tor-like service and randomizes one&#39;s IP address and browser fingerprint."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has spent a lot of time on both sides of this, I think this is a great outcome, personally.The most annoying part of ad-tech for me, as a user, was the fact that I was running all sorts of random javascript, any bit of which could blow up performance on my browser.As someone who used to lead an e-commerce operation, I hated running all of this crap in my users&#39; browsers because I knew it would get blocked randomly or cause hard-to-diagnose errors.I eventually moved us to basically this approach using a home-grown solution and everyone was happier. It was even more robust because it just used session/cookie data and didn&#39;t require running any javascript execution to work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Citing adblock feels like clickbait. Google Tag Manager can&#39;t run ads so I don&#39;t follow the comparison. Marketing analytics could always side-step anti-adblocking tools through server-side tracking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would also add something along the lines of &#34;building big webapps&#34;. Large frontend codebases used to be scary Lovecraftian horror where things were only touched out of utmost necessity. Runtime errors for weird corner cases. Dangling dependencies that no one could figure out whether they&#39;re safe to update/remove or not. Refactoring was both an art and an arcane incantation at the same time. Modern tooling and best practices have made most if not all of these problems nearly non-existent, and I&#39;m grateful for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who leans frontend,  I find firebase and serverless (somebody else’s server) solutions really powerful for prototyping an idea or building a proof of concept. You can get something in front of your users tomorrow.  I would second guess SaaS startups that start by building the infra/data models unless they’re going for a highly technical play (aerospace, hardware, etc) or already have a ton of market knowledge.I’m in the middle of a mongoDB to Postgres migration for a product with 0 users. When you’re trying to scale from 0 to 1 user then everything should help you explore the user’s problem space, even if it seems backwards to build the UI before the backend."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That shouldn&#39;t be a surprise. At an old job with far smaller user base, we used to do something very similar and while the shadow profiles were not materialized in the form of actual profiles, the amount of data you can gather about someone just by having his/her number pop up in the contact list of several of your actual users is staggering: full name, workplace, city/neighborhood where they live, their partners, their hobbies and all sorts of things which you generally should not know. And we are not talking people who have their entire life published online, but people with little to no online visibility. Assuming that facebook is not doing something similar considering that their main business comes from profiling and modeling user behavior is just naive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook also has shadow profiles for non-users that connect directly to name, email address, and/or phone number.  At the very least these seem to be populated when people share their contact list with Facebook.I have long wondered whether they can match these two kinds of shadow profiles together. One profile with personally identifiable information. The other profile with detailed browsing history. That would raise a huge privacy concern especially since these are non-Facebook users and therefore people who have not opted into this at any level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A link that is shared on facebook gets an additional fbclid query parameter (interesting that google has it&#39;s equivalent glclid query parameter for links from google adds).I think that it is easy to get rid of this query parameter, when want to use such a link. (just adding, as I don&#39;t see that mentioned in the pdf)I think that the purpose of this query param is to act as a substitute for cross site cookies: when you click on some link then the original url is further transfered as the http referrer header of the http request, if they can get hold of the logs of some affiliated site, then they can possibly track the flow of these fbclid attributes.Interesting to observe, how every tiny detail is getting used for tracking purposes. I guess that browsers won&#39;t get rid of any specific query parameters when the url is passed as the referrer header, as that would be a violation of the protocol. However it may be possible to write a browser plug-in that does so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love little compression hacks like the one given in the article.I created a word search game way back in late 1978/early 1979 4KB of RAM. I had about 2KB for storing the word database. And I recall I had about 2,500 words. Which I had to type in by hand.I used the 26 tables of words trick too, to drop the first letter. I also treated each word being made up of 32 symbols. I called them letters, but they didn&#39;t represent individual letters necessarily.Edit 36 minutes after writing my original comment: Having just checked my notes from December 24th 1978, I need to correct myself and say it was 38 symbols. Though I seem to recall I actually got it down to 32 symbols. I need to keep looking through my notes to refresh my brain on the solution.A word might end in &#34;ING&#34; so that was considered a single letter/symbol. Words were between four and seven letters long.Most words took up two bytes, some only took up a single byte, only a few took up three bytes, maybe a few dozen took up four bytes. And I judiciously pruned the database to minimize the words that took up three or four bytes so that I didn&#39;t have too many of them. I also packed the bits, so that there was no gaps between words.And it was all written in 6502 assembly, originally for the CBM PET, and later for the Acorn Atom.I was 11 years old and so proud of myself for such cleverness. I still have my notes and scribblings, including the digitised versions from all those years back.Later, when I wrote a much more complex Bookworm type of game I had to take a word list that was about 8MB long, uncompressed, which would just barely fit on the hard drive, and turned it into a trie, which brought it down to just a few dozen kilobytes, which handily fit on a SS/SD 100KB 5+1/4&#34; floppy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got nerd sniped and compressed it to under 28K, which was good enough for the goal of fitting it in a 32K NROM cartridge for the NES. On the NES, you don’t need to do better than that, because you get a separate 8K for graphics, and 4K is plenty of space to fit the code for your Wordle clone.https://www.moria.us/blog/2022/01/dictionary-compressionThe annoying part is that the NES only gives you four background palettes, and you are constrained to use all four of those to color your words."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related but not the same: does anyone have information on how the old T9 pre-smartphone system stored its compressed and fast dictionaries? I remember reading about it a long time ago but can&#39;t find it now.That system used some sort of lossy compression that created artifacts like fake words that don&#39;t exist but look enough like real words from the dictionary&#39;s point of view that they can be generated.I find it fascinating."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes, I used to,but No, I fixed it :)Among other things, I am team lead for a private search engine whose partner-accessible API handles roughly 500 mio requests per month.I used to feel powerless and stressed out by the complexity and the scale, because whenever stuff broke (and it always does at this scale), I had to start playing politics, asking for favors, or threatening people on the phone to get it fixed. Higher management would hold me accountable for the downtime even when the whole S3 AZ was offline and there was clearly nothing I could do except for hoping that we&#39;ll somehow reach one of their support engineers.But over time, management&#39;s &#34;stand on the shoulders of giants&#34; brainwashing wore off so that they actually started to read all the &#34;AWS outage XY&#34; information that we forwarded to them. They started to actually believe us when we said &#34;Nothing we can do, call Amazon!&#34;. And then, I found a struggling hosting company with almost compatible tooling and we purchased them. And I moved all of our systems off the public cloud and onto our private cloud hosting service.Nowadays, people still hold me (at least emotionally) accountable for any issue or downtime, but I feel much better about it :) Because now it actually is withing my circle of power. I have root on all relevant servers, so if shit hits the fan, I can fix things or delegate to my team.Your situation sounds like you will constantly take the blame for other people&#39;s fault. I would imagine that to be disheartening and extremely exhausting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What do you find exhausting?One anti-pattern I&#39;ve found is that most orgs ask a single team to handle on-call around the clock for their service. This rarely scales well, from a human standpoint. If you&#39;re getting paged at 2:00 in the morning on a regular basis you will start to resent it. There&#39;s not much you can do about that so long as only one team is responsible for uptime 24/7.The solution is to hire operations teams globally, and then setup follow-the-sun operations whereby the people being paged are always naturally awake at that hour, and allows them to work normal eight hour shifts. But this requires companies to, gasp, have specialized developers and specialized operators collaborate before allowing new feature work into production, to ensure that the operations teams understand what the services are supposed to do and keep it all online. It requires (oh, the horror!) actually maintaining production standards, runbooks, and other documentation.So naturally, many orgs would prefer to burn out their engineers instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience is that the expectations on what your average engineer should be able to handle has grown enormously during the last 10 years or so.
Working both with large distributed systems and medium size monolithic systems I have seen the expectations become a lot higher in both.When I started my career the engineers at our company were assigned a very specific part of the product that they were experts on. Usually there were 1 or 2 engineers assigned to a specific area and they knew it really well.
Then we went Agile(tm) and the engineers were grouped into 6 to 9 person teams that were assigned features that spanned several areas of the product. The teams also got involved in customer interaction, planning, testing and documentation. The days when you could focus on a single part of the system and become really good at it were gone.Next big change came when the teams moved from being feature teams to devops teams. None of the previous responsibilities were removed but we now became responsible also for setting up and running the (cloud) infrastructure and deploying our own software.In some ways I agree that these changes have empowered us. But it is also, as you say, exhausting. Once I was simply a programmer; now I&#39;m a domain expert, project manager, programmer, tester, technical writer, database admin, operations engineer, and so on."</p>
