								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Text is mightier than the Metaverse.Kids can do video calls with their smartphones but prefer texting.We could discuss Hacker News stories with video chat but we prefer text.News and politics junkies prefer reading text tweets on Twitter to watching talking news anchors.Once upon a time Amazon was a company that only sold books. Dried ink on dead trees. And in the early internet age this book seller outperformed many more &#34;forward looking visionary&#34; startups.Billions and billions spent on making movies as polished as possible, yet &#34;I thought the book was better&#34; is what we always hear.The Metaverse will be programmed with text.The quarterly reports outlining its financial losses will be written in text.When journalists ultimately write its obituary, they will write text."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Metaverse is not bullshit. It&#39;s a sign of desperation.Facebook has _nothing_ for the future.* Blue app is already on it&#39;s death bed.* Instagram is already seeing a massive decline in quality and engagement as its getting close to the end of its lifecycle.* They managed to survive Snapchat, but I think that made them think Instagram is too big to fail. Thus, they didn&#39;t go after TikTok. It was a mistake.* What&#39;s App is not monetizable.* Oculus is not becoming the next PS4/Xbox like they hoped.Facebook is usually being compared to the likes of Apple, Google and Amazon. It&#39;s nothing compared to them. It&#39;s not even gonna be able to do a Microsoft/IBM pivot as it has no monetizable developer ecosystem.I personally think they should&#39;ve acquired TikTok last year when TikTok was looking to be acquired by Microsoft. They probably would&#39;ve extended their survival for another 10-ish years (lifecycle of a social media)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This thread feels like 1860&#39;s consilium on what future will look like 500 years later. The shape of the metaverse will be formed by a new generation, not by older guys (and not by fortnite addicts who play by the rules of the former) who know nothing better than drive a fancy “car” on the “road”, as if roads or a concept of physical movement or the euclidean rule would still be there for common use and not for museums. Virtual worlds up to date, like second life, were mostly just stupid copies of “real life”, which was designed after some physical limitations, or fantasy worlds of parallel earth-likes with a limited magic.If the only limitation of metaverse is Code and Content, and if that would be much easier to create, then in a blink of an eye it will turn into something absolutely inconceivable to mercedes benz drivers. What really is bullshit, is lack of imagination in people and a shitload of thought inertia. Personally, it feels like the article author has never ever been in the internet, confining themselves at a small circle of “social” networks bs. Those will live in an exact copy of their current environment, paying to bigcorps with their work hours to achieve “expensive” toys, to impress similar narrow-minded guys. I’ve seen second life at its peak, and this is exactly what they were doing there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an 80&#39;s kid I have fond memories of this toy. Being all mechanical you could explore and marvel at it.I remember trying to get the spin faster/slower, stopping the spring, etc.Since it required no batteries it was always working, even when you found it at the bottom of toy bin after months/years.This modern version is a complete scam, especially since the outside look seems absolutely identical to the original. I&#39;d be very disappointed if I bought one for a toddler, only to realize when unboxing it&#39;s crap.By the way, we still have the original toy from my childhood. It&#39;s been passed around to relatives, but last I heard, it still works after what must be almost 40 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The original Fisher-Price &#34;Record Player&#34; is really a kids version of a Polyphon [0] a type of record like music player that was popular in the late 1800&#39;s to early 1900&#39;s.  You can see some playing on YouTube [1]I thought it would be interesting to 3D print additional records for the thing. Was super disappointed when I bought one for our daughter last year and found that they had changed it to a digital music player that only uses the records for song selection.A lot of the modern day versions of the original Fisher-Price toys don&#39;t hold up to the originals.  For example on the xylophone they replaced the Wood base with plastic and the thing sounds like crap.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyphon[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk4zjQshq14[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=soQLAvqnTOQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure how common this is in other countries, but here in Germany we have quite a few &#34;water playgrounds&#34;. There are some pumps in the sand, sometimes small aqueducts and the likes, so during summer, the kids can play with water. The pumps used to be real pumps. Now they are electronic. They have a sensor to detect how fast the handle is moving and at a certain speed you&#39;ll hear a clicking sound, a valve opens and the water starts flowing.I think some children will realize how these things work. They might start to find them dumb if they find out that the strenuous repetitive movement is in fact unnecessary. At least to me it feels like a dishonest contraption and I&#39;d prefer if they simply put a button on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When you make housing an investment, by definition, it has to become less affordable in the future.Until a country decides to stop making policy to support this notion that a basic need should be an appreciating asset and not a depreciating one like food, transportation, etc, this completely unsurprising trend will continue. It is a strange world we live in where we collectively believe that a basic need should increase in price over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately the article is extremely sloppy with the numbers and that makes it very hard to understand what is really going on.Primarily, they keep mentioning &#34;average house-price-to-income ratio&#34; but appear to be using average home price and median income.  Both housing price and income distributions are enormously skewed.  In the Unites States average income is almost double median income and that difference has been increasing over time.  So right there, even if median house price to median income has stayed constant, you would notice the pattern pointed out.I don&#39;t doubt the central premise that housing prices are rising faster than income within household, but unfortunately the article does nothing to show it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m always a bit amused at this sort of article.At it&#39;s heart it is an attempt by someone who makes their living selling a thing (real estate) to instill a since of FOMO in order to motivate you to buy something now rather than perhaps later. You can&#39;t really fault them, it does tend to work.I happen to live in the &#34;red hot&#34; Bay Area and twice wince I&#39;ve been living in my house its value has gone DOWN year over year rather than up. I have never considered it an &#34;investment&#34;, rather it is a fixed cost that I have to pay to live indoors. My parents live in Las Vegas, and that housing market, which has been largely unconstrained, demonstrated exactly what that means. Houses in Vegas for a long time depreciated after you bought them, just like cars. They did that because there was so much new housing being built that you could buy a &#34;new&#34; house for the same price as a &#34;used&#34; house. Guess what, people opted for &#34;new&#34; and used houses needed to sell at a discount if they wanted to sell.One of the truisms for years was the value of a house was intimately tied to its location. This because it was close to jobs, or schools or what not. It is my hope that remote work really takes hold and you can work just as reasonably in a $100,000 house in Missouri as you can in a million dollar house in the Bay Area. That would really create some downward pressure on prices because of simple market dynamics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tangentially, the physical labor jobs I had when younger never really tired me out the way that the mental/bureaucratic/political job I have now does.Physical work actually energized me, I mean this is all confirmed today as well, we know all the benefits exercise brings on well being.There&#39;s something about desk jobs that is frankly soul sucking and literally mentally draining in a way where when the day ends, it&#39;s as if you suffer from temporary depression. Even getting motivated to do things you want to do is hard, resorting to the laziest activity is often what happens, phone, social media, television. Sometimes I can&#39;t even get myself to play a video game and I love video games.And when the night comes, you&#39;d think sleep is what you need, but that same day of desk job actually gives you insomnia, falling asleep is hard, and while you sleep it&#39;s as if all of that mental activity is still happening in your head from the work day.If physical labor work paid me as well and provided the same benefits, I&#39;d probably switch back to it honestly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This feels off.Farming today is a seven day, every day work week.  There is no day off with livestock, no matter what century, and what season.  If the sun sets, or the weather is bad outside, there are plenty of work to be done indoors.I would presume it was even harder without all the automation and technology in the Middle Ages.  Maybe they did not labour for the employer all the time, but all the &#39;free time&#39; was spent labouring for sustenance, and other life&#39;s maintenance.If I recall correctly, the 8 hour day, 40 hour week, and five day work-week are all 19th century trends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This analysis is solely focused on the &#34;job&#34; aspects of pre-industrial life and includes almost none of the domestic considerations. I&#39;m not sure if it would be fair to call all non-wage time &#34;leisure&#34;. Once work was still over there were still things to clean, fix, prepare, butcher, etc.Although, I think it goes without saying that before affordable lighting and heating, we all underestimate how lazy winters were for the average peasant, whether idyllic or not (accounts I have read make it sound incredibly, incessantly dull).And I think the best evidence we have that we are overrating the quality of pre-industrial leisure time is that people developed almost no leisure activities! Common people had almost no sports, no games (beyond precursors to Bocce or backgammon), no literature! They supposedly had half a year of doing nothing, and perhaps singing and drinking was sufficient to fill the time, but you&#39;d think they would show lots of other innovations. Or even steal the activities of the rich (organized sports)!Instead you don&#39;t see leisure activities develop until the rise of the 40 hour workweek and the availability of consumer appliances.Edit: I hope people understand that the argument the article presents is largely a romanticization of poverty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I already force-enabled EGL in firefox 93 on Arch Linux with the 470.74 nvidia driver, and the performance is stellar compared with what it used to be. Before EGL all desktop applications (including firefox) would stutter when a video was playing in firefox.I did not encounter any bugs so far."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Will you be affected? Here&#39;s the gist from the article: As of Firefox 94, users using Mesa driver &gt;= 21 will get it by default. Users of the proprietary Nvidia driver will need to wait a little bit longer as the currently released drivers lack an important extension. However, most likely we’ll be able to enable EGL on the 470 series onwards. DMABUF support (and thus better WebGL performance) requires GBM support and will be limited to the 495 series onwards.Ubuntu 21.10 currently comes with the 470 series driver."</p>

He carefully conjectured what could be observed e.g. binary stars in amassing data points. Naturally, in a logical progression, he looked for stars which behaved as if they were in a binary systems but the partner i.e. &#34;dark stars&#34; could not been seen because its mass would be so big that  the finite speed of light couldn&#39;t &#34;escape&#34;. Brilliant.He, also, inherited Cavendish his &#34;torsion balance&#34; apparatus for measuring the mass of the earth for what later became the famous &#34;Cavendish experiment&#34; yielding an accurate measurement of the gravitational constant. The experimental basis for the advancement into the nature of gravity.Quite impressive.And he did not yell about it or seemed to care about what nowadays would be called the &#34;impact factor&#34;.His impact was quite of another nature."</p>

My pretty modest home network and the various services running make 20-25k queries per day and I get a lot of REFUSED responses. Google on the other hand has no problem serving all of them.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You don&#39;t start by choosing an architecture. You start by understanding the problem and the pieces in the solution space. You then figure out how those pieces can work together to solve the problem. After that you can see the system as nested subsystems and interactions, which you can draw as diagrams and call it an architecture.So I see &#34;architecture&#34; more as a teaching and communication technique, applied after the fact. Altho since we&#39;re always moving between the details and the big picture, having organized abstractions (ie an architecture) in mind will help keep the design clean.The architecture evolves and sharpens as a system comes together. And this evolving architecture provides the team with a common terminology and overall direction.But you rarely start by choosing a specific architecture. Unless you already know a lot about your solution."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m kinda confused by the criticism of the industry and NASA not designing for Starship.The author argues that NASA doesn’t understand Tempe game changer that Starship is, but I don’t think that’s accurate. I think the risk to NASA of assuming the benefits of Starship before it’s proven are just too high.If NASA (or other industry players), assume Starship will deliver the benefits it promises, they to fundamentally alter their approach to space. But that leaves them with no backup plan in the event that Starship fails to materialize or deliver on its promises.Whereas this other approach, of treating Starship like a much better vehicle but integrating it into its old processes, gives them an out if Starship fails in some way. Because they’re still using the “old” assumptions, they can fall back to other “old space” style providers.I think once Starship has proven itself capable of deliver on its promises, you’ll see NASA changing its approach radically in the manner the author describes.So, fundamentally, I think it’s not a lack of “understanding”, but a different calibration of “risk”. This also applies to many existing space companies, and I also think this gives opportunities for new companies that have a higher risk tolerance to take advantage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Spacex is building the transcontinental railroads of the solar system. There is mind boggling upside for them. I&#39;m kinda disappointed Blue Origin seems to have fallen in a rut. I&#39;m sure Musk will be happy to provide transportation for Bezos space colony construction projects!https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Railroad_TycoonEdit My point isn&#39;t to disparage Bezos, but to highlight the fact that anyone with grand aspirations in orbit/solar system will have to go through Musk and Spacex until a competitor does appear. RE space colonies, I believe the natural sequence of events for space tourism is: sub orbital, oribital, long term orbital (a small space &#34;hotel&#34;) culminating in orbital habitat ala O&#39;Neil Cylinders. Cheap kg to orbit enables all of that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Starship is intended to be able to transport a million tonnes of cargo to the surface of Mars in just ten launch windows.So at 100tons per starship sent to Mars that&#39;s 10,000 trips or 1000 per launch window. But the current plans call for something like 16 starship launches just for refuelling the one starship for the lunar mission. Suppose we can do the Mars trip with the same number of flights that&#39;s 170,000 launches  to transport that 100million tons?
And this guy is mad that nasa is not assuming that this is achievable?"</p>
