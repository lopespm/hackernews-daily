								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s time to have a big talk about transparency.Some of the people who defend the ultra-rich are also the ones who claim to be in favour of free markets. A small bit of economic orthodoxy is that for free markets to work, parties need to be informed (and externalities priced in, but that&#39;s another story). This is not just in terms of &#34;this is the price of bananas&#34; but also in terms of knowing eg what various salaries are, which businesses are profitable, etc.How can we have free markets when we don&#39;t even know who owns what?As for taxation, there needs to be an overhaul. Things need to be simpler, and I say this as someone who has used international tax advisors. There&#39;s no reason the tax guy&#39;s diagram of your business should be more complicated than your own diagram. Moving profits to other countries shouldn&#39;t be possible, or rather, it should be more fixed by the nature of the business than by the desires of the CFO. We simply hear too much about &#34;selling IP rights&#34; to subsidiaries and similar schemes that are clearly meant to lower tax rather than increase revenue. Granted some things will be legitimate, but it&#39;s important that some vague concept of fairness is adhered to. This again goes back to transparency. We invented corporations to help improve society, so we ought to know what kinds of things people are doing with them.Edit:Perhaps the way to see it is, if you say &#34;we make money by selling coffees in the UK&#34; you would expect that entity to report a tax structure that contains a bunch of coffee and UK related entries. Reporting to investors ought to mirror reporting to the taxman."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I see here is tax evasion. But done in a roundabout legal loopholish kind of way.1. Establish profitable company in your home country.2. Establish 2nd company in a tax haven country.3. Give 2nd company some kind of ownership, and then pay rental fees, licensing fees, or simply set up a high interest loan that the 2nd company loaned the first.4. Once you set up a way to make it look like you owe the 2nd company tons of money, now your 1st company no longer is &#34;profitable&#34; and actually in debt losing money, which means it doesn&#39;t need to pay taxes on the massive profit it&#39;s making.While I believe it&#39;s legal it hinges on bad ethical practice. But many large companies do this, such as cruise ships and I think Apple."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve wondered a lot about this with the Snowden and Wikileaks stuff, and I wonder about it with this topic too: the most salient part of this story, and about Panama Papers etc. before it, is how small a dent it seems to make in the discourse, and in the world as a result. At best, these stories get a good chunk of the airwaves for a couple of weeks, and then it&#39;s on to the next thing.In history books, you get a sense sometimes that there were eras in which stuff like this sent people into the streets in rages. In which governments were voted out or overthrown, in which meaningful legislative responses were made. Or, you know, riots.But I look around after reading those books and wonder what makes us so different. It&#39;s weird to live in this era. I read a Guardian article like this and look at the staggering sums, this entire &#34;shadow financial system&#34; devoted solely to one notion: I&#39;m going to take as much as I can, in whatever way that I can, regardless of legality, and I&#39;m going to give nothing back because I sincerely don&#39;t believe I owe anything back -- oh, and I&#39;m going to keep it all a secret.And I look around and not only don&#39;t see any riots; I sometimes get the feeling that people are actually envious, sometimes even respectful of the ingenuity it takes to manufacture these schemes. It&#39;s tough.The only silver lining I can think of is what all the secrecy says: we&#39;re not just doing this in the open because we&#39;re still afraid we&#39;ll end up like the Romanovs if too many of you get angry. I think that while they&#39;re still afraid, there&#39;s still some hope.EDIT: Reading some replies. It&#39;s weird to have to say this to such a smart crowd, but I&#39;m not advocating riots as such; I&#39;m advocating a substantive response. Of course riots are &#34;bad&#34; in some sense, but my observation is really about the odd contrast between the huge size of the &#34;stimulus&#34; (theft of wealth, much of it yours, on a staggering scale) and the tiny size of the &#34;response&#34; (newspaper articles and web forum discussions), especially when contrasted with other historical periods. So while I wouldn&#39;t &#34;want a riot&#34;, seeing one would make me go &#34;well, that makes sense&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m more than willing to believe there&#39;s insider trading, but the data presented at the beginning is not convincing.&gt; Of the 496 trades [Filler has] made since 2014 in Alabama’s ServisFirst Bancshares Inc., where he sits on the board of directors, and Century Bancorp Inc. of Massachusetts, where he’s the largest shareholder, 372 of them, or 75%, have shown a profit three months later.&gt; Besides Filler, other TipRanks stars include Steve Mihaylo, the CEO of telephone services company Crexendo Inc., where he owns a $60 million stake. Mihaylo has turned a three-month profit on 83% of his trades over the past five years even as Crexendo’s shares have seesawed.We&#39;ve also had an unprecedented bull market over the past 10 years. If you pick any random stock at any time and hold it for three months, what are the odds that it will be worth more?The article compares the returns to the S&amp;P500, but that is the net performance of those 500 stocks. You&#39;d have to compare it to the base rate of picking a random stock to see if it&#39;s actually remarkable.Maybe the S&amp;P 500 performed lower because 75% of the stocks in it went up and 25% went down. But that means that if you randomly pick one stock, you&#39;d have a 75% chance of it being one of the ones that went up, and you&#39;d outperform the S&amp;P500. (Well, not quite, maybe it could go up, but not as much as the S&amp;P500 as a whole. But still, most of the stocks that go up, would have to go up more than the average of the whole index in order to compensate for the ones that go down)Later in the article, when they mention that insiders tend to reliably sell stock ahead of bad news, that seems much more damning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Remember, you can trade stocks without trading stocks.What do I mean? Mark Cuban sold a collar on his Yahoo stock through Goldman for $[I forget] billion dollars. That was an off-market trade in which someone bought his entire block off of him. In today’s world, with tons of low interest (as in, single/double-digit basis points) loans and other fun weird contraptions, you have a lot more options to trade without trading.I have no grand reveal here, but there’s probably an entire “dark dataset” regarding that activity that is missing from this conversation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Eh, kinda. Calling something a &#34;best practice&#34; is basically an appeal to authority. It means, &#34;this is the right way to do things, for reasons I don&#39;t have time to explain.&#34; There are times when that&#39;s appropriate.But really, &#34;best&#34; and &#34;right&#34; are highly situational. Any rule of thumb, even the most basic and uncontroversial, has a situation where it doesn&#39;t apply. I was part of a discussion on a mailing list years ago, where somebody got flamed harshly when he mentioned using a global variable. He then explained that he was working on an embedded control system for cars and all the variables in that system were global. The team was well aware of the pitfalls of global state and used a combination of documentation, static analysis, custom tooling and elaborate testing to mitigate them. It was a considered design choice that made it possible to develop high-performance, hard-realtime software that could run on very limited hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest issue I saw with &#34;best practices&#34; in my career is the failure to take into account who it claiming it to be a best practice, and in what context. I saw too many junior developers read a rando blog article, then get a non-technical / semi-technical manager excited about something that made their life easier, even though it was by no means a good practice for the context at hand. Or alternatively, believe some vendor carte blanche when they tell you their product somehow follows a best practice.The overarching problem is that yes, there is software engineering going on in the world, but most organizations are not willing to do engineering. I don&#39;t blame the technical staff - they often have good intentions - but rather the typical business is not willing to pay the cost in time or money to do long-lasting engineering practices. This is one of the things not enough of us think about in our career choices - am I going to a place that practices fire drills or engineering?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; How can Software Engineers call themselves engineers when there’s no rules, governing bodies, or anything to stipulate what true Software Engineering is?We call ourselves software developers in Canada.According to Canadian engineering[1]:
The &#34;practice of engineering&#34; means any act of planning, designing, composing, evaluating, advising, reporting, directing or supervising, or managing any of the foregoing, that requires the application of engineering principles, and that concerns the safeguarding of life, health, property, economic interests, the public welfare, or the environment.To be considered a work of engineering, then, that a piece of software (or a software-intensive system) must meet two conditions:1. The development of the software has required “the application of a systematic, disciplined, quantifiable approach to the development, operation, and maintenance of software.”2. There is a reasonable expectation that failure or inappropriate functioning of the system would result in harm to life, health, property, economic interests, the public welfare, or the environment[1] - https://engineerscanada.ca/news-and-events/news/when-softwar..."</p>

Many have commented on this, and one of his colleagues, Haro von Buttlar, collected stories told by Houtermans and privately published them in a book with more than 40 pages. One story purports to explain the contributions of seven of the twentieth century&#39;s most exceptional scientists, Theodore von Kármán, George de Hevesy, Michael Polanyi, Leó Szilárd, Eugene Wigner, John von Neumann, and Edward Teller, all Hungarians. According to Houtermans, they are Martians, who are afraid that their accents will give them away, so they masquerade as Hungarians, i.e., people unable to speak any language but Hungarian without an accent.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fritz_Houtermans#Personal"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My father put together a (vacuum tube) Heathkit tape recorder in the late 1950s and made recordings of my great grandparents (on both sides) in 1959 and 1960.  They talked about their lives growing up, how they met, and some of the hardships they endured.  They were probably 35-40 years younger than the gentleman in the video, but they also described a time before automobiles, electricity, radio, and telephones were commonplace.I converted those recordings to MP3 about 15 years ago.It&#39;s amazing how far we&#39;ve come in such a short time."</p>

If they want to go cheap they go on one our river sloops.&#34;One of the most incredible things to note here is that this was around the time planes were being invented, the first commercial airplane trip was just made few years earlier, and this a fairly rural interview of an elder so it&#39;s sane to think this person has never even seen an airplane."</p>

Sure, you have some experts who can talk about how parts of the algorithm work, you have the underlying bones of page rank, you even have SEO experts who can get you reasonably close to the top search results.But is there a single individual on earth who knows all the ins and outs of all the minutiae of every single aspect of Google search - from search result algorithm to ingestion to crawling to artificial intelligence? Not a chance.You don&#39;t even have to get as complicated as Google search - any reasonably complex software system with hundreds of engineers working on it will be beyond the comprehension of any human being - fully understanding that is (which also entails knowing exactly all the edge cases, all the bugs, all the unexpected results possible, etc.)How does the economy work? Nobody knows - but that doesn&#39;t mean nothing intelligent can be said about it, or that the Fed can&#39;t make reasonable decisions on imperfect information - just like any other incredibly complex system that humans struggle to understand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the problems with looking at the economy through the lens of inflation is defining &#34;inflation&#34; itself.Consider the Wikipedia definition:&gt; In economics, inflation (or infrequently, price inflation) is a general rise in the price level of an economy over a period of time.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InflationWhat is &#34;the price level of an economy?&#34; How do you measure it? What factors are included and excluded? Why? Who decides?Do we include real estate? Financial assets like stocks and bonds? Or do we stick to things like milk and eggs. Housing? Is that an asset or a consumable?And this happens before we can really talk about what causes inflation to increase or decrease. The problem with most of the discussions of inflation I&#39;ve read and seen is that each side has its own, often implicit, definition of inflation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried this and it doesn&#39;t work. Turns out my MacBook was throttling to 30% due to overheating. This happens more frequently if you drive the GPU with an external monitor. Unfortunately the OS does nothing to notify you of overheating and throttling, which is an insanely stupid oversight by apple.  I only found out because I noticed that the computer ran fine while running the AC, so I installed an app through Brew called &#34;Hot&#34; which tells you temperature and throttling percentage, and confirmed that this was indeed problem.This happens when the room is over 80 degrees Fahrenheit, even when the CPU is at 3% utilization. Can&#39;t find root cause, or if this is even considered abnormal, but the laptop is defective in my opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also recently discovered that something like 12% of CPU on my 2020 macbook air is used whenever I&#39;m in a room with anything greater than perfect silence, by &#39;coreaudiod&#39;, because it apparently is constantly listening to the microphone built in near the keyboard and spending cpu cycles trying to filter out background noise. Apparently running the signal desktop app in the background is enough to keep coreaudiod constantly wasting battery. Because signal is open and has been granted permissions for microphone and speakers, even if no call session is open?https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=macos+c...meanwhile, &#34;Slack Helper&#34; is reporting 15% cpu usage just sitting there doing nothing. Imagine the cumulative kilowatt-hours wasted globally by all the CPU cycles spent by slack just to exist as basically a glorified IRC app.If you really want to see slack waste CPU and battery, leave a channel open that somebody has pasted a high FPS animated GIF into, in the slack window in the background. Easily 35% usage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My 2019 16-inch MacBook Pro (2.3ghz i9/64gb ram) becomes unusable with 2 of the LG 5k monitors plugged in (one on each side). Worst MacBook I have ever owned."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Go has warts and 101 faults (depending who you are and how hard you squint)...But what I absolutely love about Go is how easy(relative to other languages) it is to &#39;read&#39; most of the Go code in the wild, including the std libs !YMMV...Every tried reading C++ libs/header-libs ?"</p>
