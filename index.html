								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What a truly beautiful and elegant design. This is so reminiscent of the hacker ethos in how it captures the potential and love of technology. How can a project this creative not be more famous? I have seen many of these kinds of &#39;small, powerful computer projects&#39; before and I&#39;ve never felt inspired by any of them. But this project really captures the imagination with the potential of modularity / expanding capabilities.This is honestly so creative. It makes me filled with that childish sense of wonder I initially had with coding. What things could you make if you had a whole box of snap-ins and a few Pockits? This is frigging insane. If you&#39;re an angel investor consider throwing this guy a bone!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As far as I can tell, this is a single individual that has done all of this work. I am floored at the design and intricacy of this project.Really, truly blown away. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of edge cases to correct for but I haven&#39;t gotten so excited by a demo in a long time. I&#39;ve obviously signed up to learn more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sometimes the point of a technology is not its direct utility but to
carry forth or promote an idea.Because of what&#39;s happening with climate, pollution and e-waste, the
future is modular. Modular phones, computers, cars and even nuclear
reactors.Having this kind of thing in schools helps kids get used to the idea
that technology is configurable at the physical level without
electronics skills.Strong interoperability legislation should be a part of technology
going forward. Industry will welcome and adapt to it because it&#39;s
ultimately a better compromise than tougher regulation and export
controls."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article doesn’t really provide much in the way of explanation for why this law is being enacted. Here [0] is a better article that quotes supporters and objectors to the law.It includes the (IMHO not very convincing) figures that &#34;Between 1993 and 2003, around 130,000 Palestinians were given Israeli citizenship or residency through family unification, including children, according to court filings. The Shin Bet security service told the Knesset on Monday that between 2001 and 2021, about 48 were involved in terror activities.”48 of 130,000 amounts to 0.037% being involved in terrorist activities which seems very low to be used as justification for a law around security.[0]: https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-coalition-battle-knesset..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We see more and more similar laws being passed in recent years, laws that are blatantly discriminatory. This may raise the indignation of many people, but in my opinion, Israel is shooting itself in the foot by passing these laws, because it reinforces the argument that it is an apartheid regime. Israel is slowly losing its support in the free democratic world where people believe in the inalienable universal rights of individuals and are less and less willing to turn a blind eye to such institutionalized racism."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve seen this issue in a slightly different context.  A few years ago, my Android phone began dying much more quickly than before.  Looking at the built-in battery stats, nothing was amiss and there were no apps causing excessive wakeups.  It was only when I used Android Battery Historian that I saw there was a ton of bluetooth wakeups caused by Google Play Services.But why would it be waking up so much?  Usually the wake requests originate from some other app, but I didn&#39;t see any associated wakeups in the stats dump.  After a while I remembered that I installed GasBuddy recently, and a Google search revealed that other people had Bluetooth battery drain issues after installing it.  Apparently GasBuddy had an ads SDK that aggressively scanned for Bluetooth beacons.  Removing the app stopped the drain.I was shocked that no battery stats screen showed GasBuddy was the culprit.  Even the Battery Historian tool (which requires the user to run a Docker image and dump a bugreport) only hinted that there was some Bluetooth wakeups, but didn&#39;t show which app they originated from.This AirTag seems to be a similar issue, especially if a less experienced user doesn&#39;t realized all the &#34;Find My&#34; wakeups are caused by nearby AirTags.I think Apple needs to make the &#34;deep sleep&#34; states of their devices more strict so they can minimize drain when sitting (both when sitting overnight on a nightstand, or for a week in a living room).  Notifications (besides calls) can usually afford to be batched since users are asleep or not nearby.  As for AirTags, if one is being carried through an area, there&#39;s probably other iDevices that are being actively used nearby.  They&#39;re already awake and using RF, so they can handle the AirTag ping with virtually no additional power consumption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a concern I had since day 0. I have been asking about things like this and been talked down to constantly as if I don&#39;t know how bluetooth works...My other concern was if these are hijacking your data plan. Maybe it&#39;s not that significant amount if you have a huge plan but like Ting for example gives you 100MB of data usage each month on their basic plan. That&#39;s MEGAbytes. I checked my system clock app for example, and it&#39;s using like 500 MB a year of cell data. So the cumulative data it uses per year is about half of that plan&#39;s budget.Settings uses like 1/5 of a month of data. What does settings even use cell data for? Every random app has data usage like this. Sure, you can turn it off but why should that be the user&#39;s problem in the first place? We don&#39;t live in an opt-out society.If you&#39;re a cargo delivery guy and someone decides to ship 500 airtags for fun that you walk by, are you now just screwed in over charges because Apple decided it was OK to use your cell data for whatever purposes that have no benefit to you?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dislike how companies are not only pushing proprietary mesh networks, but also making them automatically enabled for their users and opt-out. It feels like the companies are piggybacking on my internet connection, hardware and electricity for free to literally power their closed network. I don&#39;t get paid a penny for it, but their shareholders sure do.Open mesh networks could be really cool, but instead of open networks, we get mesh networks that only allow Alexa to pump ads into your home, while excluding you, me and everyone else except Amazon and their partners from doing amazing things with the meshnets."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I met one-on-one with Google’s senior leadership in 2000 to talk about their internationalization efforts. This was very early in their trajectory, so I even sat down with Larry Page and chatted with him for half an hour.A year or two later I’m in Tokyo and talk to a new Google product manager based there. I tell her it is insane that Google serves me Japanese pages on my English-configured PowerBook just because I am in Japan. It doesn’t matter that I read Japanese just fine… Making this determination purely based on my IP address is madness, I tell her.Over two decades later, nothing has changed. Each year I spend several months abroad, and this is one of the most infuriating experiences I encounter. Google is the offender that frustrates me the most, but they are far from the only company to engage in this abhorrent practice. I am tempted to create an Internationalization Wall of Shame just to embarrass the companies that do this. (Not that I expect them to care.)Why do they do this? My theory has always been that in any given country, there are far more native speakers with misconfigured computing environments than there are visitors and nomadic folks like me. So it’s merely a numbers game: I may be frustrated, but at least Google and other companies aren’t losing business when folks with misconfigured computers close the tab because they got a page served to them in, say, English instead of their native language.I can’t say for certain whether this is the actual reason for this behavior. What I can say, however, is that I absolutely loathe this practice and actively avoid doing business with any company that uses geo-IP location to serve me pages specific to that locale. If this frustrates you as well, be sure to vote with your feet!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article talks about Microsoft, and boy, it&#39;s even more terrible in some respects: for example, language of some Office tools like Excel is bound to the organization!I worked for a French company, and I was forced to use web Excel in French, including keyboard shortcuts being FR-specific (&#34;ctrl-g&#34; for &#34;bold&#34; - &#34;grossir&#34;).I had my language set to English everywhere in browser, OS, MS profile, Office profile etc., not important.(FWIW native Windows Excel didn&#39;t have this issue, so I sticked with native Excel).---Re: location based on geoloc: I remember some HN user from Switzerland saying that IIRC either his IP is being moved around in geoIP databases between Swiss regions, or getting slightly distinct IP each time; as a result, he randomly gets all kinds of websites in French, and sometimes in German. Imagine this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some predictions:- The government&#39;s not going to have an official true cryptocurrency where anyone with a computer and an Internet connection can just generate a private key and anonymously send / receive coins.- The system won&#39;t allow an address to send / receive coins without approval from a government key, and that approval will only be given if the government&#39;s gotten a name / SSN / real-life identity to associate with that address.- The system will provide a function where a government-controlled key can freeze any address&#39;s ability to send or receive funds.- The government&#39;s going to say &#34;But we need to take a stand against terrorists / Russian oligarchs / drug kingpins&#34; and then it ends up being used against successively lower and lower degrees of criminals, such as money launderers / tax dodgers / deadbeat dads / unpaid parking tickets, and eventually ends up targeting ordinary citizens."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t really get the author’s argument. A lot of it seems very “slippery slope” to me.The government already can (and does) restrict what people can and cannot buy. The idea of limiting spending on certain things (like gas) is interesting, but that isn’t exactly a new thing. The government could already just straight up ban the sale of anything, this would just give them more nuance to their policy.Other things mentioned, like automatic taxes and preventing money laundering, seem… good?The more extreme authoritarian uses cases like financial “imprisonment” are certainly bad, but similarly can already basically be done. Look up what happens to those few people each year that are accidentally declared dead and can’t open lines of credit etc. The government can already ruin your life with the press of a button.I’m not sure I support CBDCs, but these seem like weak arguments. There are definitely benefits to taking away power from existing financial institutions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was amusing until this part:&gt; There’s a message from the Fed: “You have already spent more than the $400 maximum weekly limit on fossil fuels specified in the FedWallet User Agreement. Your remaining account balance cannot be used to purchase non-renewable energy resources.At that point, the conspiracy-theory vibe stopped seeming ironic.  If the government wanted to phase out gas-usage, wouldn&#39;t they just raise gas-tax?  Having cheap gas, but a sudden limit leaving motorists stranded, just seems a little too wacky, even for a thoughtless comedic argument."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Firstly - love love love Substack. It&#39;s so simple but it&#39;s so rapidly become a place where I do so much reading. I have a few questions (mostly not about the app though, I&#39;ll have to wait for Android support to try that).1. How did you guys manage to attract writers? I know you have been signing fronting agreements. Superficially, Substack is a (fairly basic?) blogging platform + email + payment processing system. That doesn&#39;t feel particularly hard to put together, though maybe I totally underestimate that. So what&#39;s powering Substack&#39;s growth is that you were able to get guys like Greenwald, Taibbi, Scott Alexander etc on board. How much of your growth do you think is product vs business/dealmaking?2. You&#39;ve been strong defenders of free speech, especially in the last two years where there&#39;s been a ton of censorship. Really, it&#39;s helped a lot, I&#39;ve felt like Substack was one of the few places I could find rational and logical takes on things like lockdowns at a time when everyone else was losing their minds. Do you have some sort of strong philosophical take on this, or is it a sort of default because censorship takes specific effort and you&#39;re busy with growth?3. Related to that, the pattern of tech firms being open access and supporters of free speech for some years and then later losing that as they hire more and more people (especially, new grads) seems to be a recurring one. Given you&#39;re based in San Francisco, do you have a plan to actually keep Substack the way it is, in the face of hiring employees who might demand you constantly cancel the witch-du-jour?4. There&#39;s IMO a ton of potential for innovation with group discussions. To me, Slashdot was actually the peak of innovation in large scale anonymous forum discussions with many clever features, crowdsourced moderation, friends/foes, meta-mods etc. Do you plan to try new things with discussions, or stick to a conventional approach? Right now it&#39;s pretty basic."</p>

I&#39;ve been using them for a long time.I added to one of my lists only the accounts that I really want to see on my feed (no old school friends, acquaintances, nor random people that some of the accounts I follow just started following: only sources with added value).The result? Open your list, and you&#39;ll see all the tweets sorted chronologically, only from the accounts you really care to follow.The quality of the time I spend on Twitter has dramatically increased since this change. No more time wasted scrolling through whatever irrelevant tweets the platform wants me to see. Twitter for me has basically become like an RSS feed aggregator with a curated list of sources to follow, reported in chronological order. And that&#39;s exactly what I wanted. Fck their algorithmic sht: I know better than them what I want to read."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They&#39;ve been battling the widespread preference for chronological timeline for ... well, forever.As the common belief goes, the &#34;algorithmic&#34; one is more profitable. I buy this, intuitively, because it seems natural that it&#39;d be harder to sneak in something jarring if you were viewing a more traditional timeline.But I can&#39;t fathom why seemingly no effort has gone into monetizing a chronological timeline. Why is it&#39;s foregone conclusion that it won&#39;t work with advertising the way the algorithmic was works?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want &#34;Twitter&#34; without ads, algorithmic feed manipulated by marketing, actual moderation, and actual community, I suggest joining a Mastodon[0] instance (and you probably already know people who are on the platform, making it easier to choose which instance ;)).  It&#39;s kinda like using Twitter in 2007, but with way more features.  For example, selective permissions per-&#34;toot&#34; (&#34;followers only&#34;, or &#34;unlisted&#34; which makes it not show up on the public timeline, but still visible on your profile or to followers), content warning on toots (like a spoiler warning), full image description support, much longer posts...Personally I&#39;m closer every day to abandoning Twitter and just focusing solely on Mastodon.  Many in my social circle have already done so.Oh, while I&#39;m at it:  if you want to view Twitter posts without having a Twitter account (or just don&#39;t want to see ads and trending crap), check out Nitter[1].  Alternative front-end.  It also has minimal JS and is far more resource-efficient (viewing my profile loaded 1.56mb of resources on Nitter, compared to 9.2mb on Twitter)[0] https://joinmastodon.org/[1] https://nitter.net/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a weird tip I think I could only share with the hacker news crowd. Once I learned about gut bacteria I started thinking of my cravings as something external to me. Like instead of saying &#34;I&#39;m hungry and I&#39;m in the mood for something sweet&#34; I would realize &#34;the hormone ghrelin is sending hunger signals to my brain and the gut bacteria in my body is asking for something that&#39;s not actually in my best interest.&#34;  Being able to emotionally distance myself from my feelings let me make decisions that I knew were better for me.Just remember that it gets easier, I think a lot of people struggling with addiction to unhealthy food try to resist temptation for a day and go through hell. They think &#34;I can&#39;t live the rest of my life like this,&#34; but the thing they never make it far enough to learn is that it doesn&#39;t feel this hard all the time. Every night I go to bed resisting a sugar loaded soft drink I wake up stronger, and the sabotaging gut bacteria is one battle weaker than the healthy gut bacteria."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m shocked to see how many people are saying that exercise is the way to lose weight. Exercise is a great way to strengthen your lungs, heart, and other muscles, but it&#39;s not going to be the way you lose fat. Diet is the answer. I know this because I&#39;ve seen it time and time again, and because of recent research showing that a tribe who moves far more than we do burn about the same amount of calories as those who are sedentary. The calories just go to other things.A very simple solution that definitely works is Clean Simple Eats. They give you a weekly shopping list and the recipes you need to eat every day. I said simple, not easy. It takes will power to stop eating everything in sight. It takes will power to spend so much time in the kitchen.You don&#39;t need a weird tip. You need to do what is time-tested and true. Diet, sleep, and exercise. That&#39;s how you&#39;ll gain health and a better body composition.80% diet, 20% exercise"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m far from being an expert, but the CO2 is just a byproduct of your body&#39;s metabolism. And although oxygen only makes up 21% of the air, your lungs don&#39;t extract 100% of it and even if it did, it wouldn&#39;t get used, or you would pass out.
Or even worse, you would get used to having 100% oxygen delivered to your lungs, your red blood cell count would drop and then you would pass out as soon as you stopped using the O2 tank.I&#39;ve read a comment about gut bacteria, and I&#39;ve also read a study about it and I was able to lose weight. If you think about types of gut bacteria that are helping you digest your food like little populations, you need to stop eating bad food like pizza, fast food, etc so that you can starve the population that&#39;s constantly secreting hormones that make you hungry for that kind of food. Then the craving goes away.Declare war on those bacteria.
No, it&#39;s no easy, it&#39;s pain and suffering. The first two weeks are hell.
Then it gets easier and easier.What I did was:
- Sunday I cook meals for the week, two small portions every day. 
- Two options of tasty but healthy food.
   - Like mashed potatoes and grind meat or chicken and rice.
- One small cake that should last the entire week as an emergency craving snack.
- A ton of fruits.
- A cheat meal on Saturday.Do your best to stick to it, if you feel hungry you can try to eat one more portion, or fruits and in the worst case, a piece of cake.The cake should also be very &#39;fit&#39; like carrot cake with no fillings or frostings.I have no weird tips or hacks, I&#39;ve tried and fooled myself too many times.There are no cheats, there are no tricks."</p>
