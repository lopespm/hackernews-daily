								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is awesome in terms of avoiding all of the weird things when a person typed pip rather than pip3 and module didn&#39;t seem to get installed anywhere. That said, watching perl trying to kill perl5 with perl6 (unsuccessful) and python trying to kill python 2 with python 3 (more successful) it struck me how ridiculous it is that open source languages have to put up with this. Clearly &#34;major&#34; numbers are insufficient, the only real answer is to rename the entire freaking language when you make incompatible changes to it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m in an awkward chain of dependencies.  You see, in my industry there are very few players, and the current version of their software depends on much functionality and rather exacting specifications from products which are made using ArcGIS 10.2.1.  Not 10.2.  Not 10.2.2.This is a very conservative hunk of software because this is not a &#34;move fast and break things&#34; industry.  This is a &#34;people die when we screw up&#34; industry.  So they haven&#39;t moved from ArcGIS 10.2.1 for our version.  Change is coming but they have to be careful.So ArcGIS 10.2.1 comes with a python install of 2.7.2 (I am pretty sure it is .2).  And you are very strongly advised NOT TO UPGRADE THAT in big bold letters on the relevant help pages.  So I need to use 2.7.2 to manipulate some stuff out of ArcGIS 10.2.1 to do &#34;stuff.&#34;And there I sit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s telling that there are a number of commercially available Python libraries targeting enterprise customers for which the Python 3 version is free, but there&#39;s a hefty license fee for the Python 2 version.  Maybe that&#39;s an appropriate tax on sluggish software/IT departments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those on windows(and with an Intel WiFi card) there is a hidden but an extremely useful feature - &#34;project&#34; can be used to turn any other windows PC/Laptop/Tablet into a second screen, just enable &#34;cast to this PC&#34; in settings, then from the host PC press Win+P from anywhere and the second machine becomes a secondary display instantly. To windows it appears as a normal display, without any hackery involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those interested in something similar with sway, you can:- Add a headless display with `swaymsg create_output SOME_NAME`- Configure its resolution and position like you do for other outputs- Start a VNC server on that output with `wayvnc --output=SOME_NAME`- Start a VNC client somewhere else you want to use your second screen (there are some that are browser-based)Unfortunately it is somewhat undocumented: https://github.com/swaywm/sway/issues/5553 but you can find some info on the net: https://www.reddit.com/r/swaywm/comments/k1zl41/thank_you_de...I saw in that readme that they wanted ways to get rid of dummy adapters. That above is one such possible way for sway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that it is definitely possible to use this without those horrible dongles and even if you don&#39;t have any spare video ports at all.Unfortunately, on both Windows and Mac, open-source solutions don&#39;t exist because no single developer wants to deal with driver signing.On Linux, you can do this a number of ways:- the evdi kernel module can create fake video outputs (I&#39;m currently working on a CLI for it - stay tuned)- xrandr can force-enable disconnected video outputs (I believe even if you&#39;ve used up all the CRTCs)- xrandr with Intel drivers can create virtual screens- swaywm has a config option to make virtual screens"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here is the discussion on the Chromium embedder-dev mailing list: https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/embedder-dev/c/NX...Most interesting to me is that even though the Chrome team specifically provided API keys for open-source Chromium builds to use back in 2013, they are now claiming that &#34;the Terms of Service don&#39;t allow this usage, and [the previous developer] didn&#39;t have authority to change the terms.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To reiterate, the APIs were not designed to be used by third-party software, so short of a complete rewrite, there is no unfortunately no option.The unfortunate (for Google) reality is (as had already been pointed out to this fellow multiple times before he said that): whether they turn off these Linux distros&#39; keys, people can still write third-party software to (ab)use these APIs, using Google&#39;s own keys. The CFAA is only going to keep legit uses from using Google&#39;s keys. This does not, in any way, fix the issue that Google is claiming it fixes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would take require changes to Chromium (with regards to authentication), but Brave&#39;s sync server is open source and protocol-wise mostly compatible (client side encryption is enforced):
https://github.com/brave/go-syncI doubt Chromium authors would accept changes to authentication (even if you put guards around it like `#ifndef GOOGLE_CHROME_BRANDING`). If there were a 100% compatible service available, you can change the service URL using CLI arg `--sync-url`There is also a local sync backend which is interesting as it writes to disk. You could potentially sync this via OneDrive or something similar. You can enable with the CLI arg `--enable-local-sync-backend`. Directory settable using `--local-sync-backend-dir`You can watch the data being synced via chrome://sync-internals"</p>

Having been talking to different content/marketing teams, they hate it so much because of the complexity it brings. Editing content? Sign in to this headless CRM app, want a form? Go sign in to another app. It might be a fun project for devs but the actual users if these systems will almost always have a hard time using it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a little disappointed at the percentage of comments which extrapolate personal anecdotes into societal behavior, and without addressing the data in this study - even to poke holes in the methodology, which is totally fair game (though IMO quite good, especially for what they had to work with).The whole point of a 15,000-person survey like this is so that we&#39;re not all stuck guessing based on our own experiences. Obviously one can argue that what employers were telling employees they would do post-COVID as of October 2020 is not what employers will actually do (and give reasons why!), but it&#39;s still likely to be more accurate than any individual&#39;s speculation (including mine!).In particular, the survey addressed 2 topics that a lot of comments seem to not incorporate:1. At population, employer, and individual level, it&#39;s not either/or. The paper title doesn&#39;t do a good job of conveying this. All 3 entities seem open to everything on the continuum, based on their employees, work type, and so on.Statements like &#34;I promise that it won&#39;t stick for the broader society&#34; imply a more binary outcome than the survey results predict (and maybe than anything predicts). The survey concludes that, of the roughly 50% of employees who can work from home, they&#39;ll average 2 days per week (or 23% of total hours worked). IOW, WFH doesn&#39;t need to move everyone all the time in order to have massive effects. Some people changing some of the time is enough.2. Employer plans vs. employee desires. Lots of commenters state their preferences and then try to generalize from that, but.. the survey captured that too. To just skim those results, scroll to page 60 for employee-desired vs. employer-planned % of working days. Gist: if WFH is roughly the same productivity, employers plan ~22% of days and employees desire ~45% of days to be WFH. In all productivity cases, employees preferred a higher % of days to be WFH than employers.Page 43 shows answers to the pay raise or cut employees would take in order to work from home 2-3 days per week.It also breaks down the change in perception about WFH by demographic cohort on page 55. For example, those with no children and those with children at home both had significant improvements in their perception of WFH. Those with children had more improvement in perception than those without children. As the study wrote: &#34;This 23 percent figure [post-COVID WFH as a % of full time days] is almost five times larger than in the pre-pandemic time use data, but still half as large as what workers want in a post-pandemic world.&#34;Of course, there&#39;s a place for speculation and anecdotes. This paper - and hopefully soon, more studies like it - should let us evolve from speculating based on only our personal experience to thinking about its methodology and results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been 100% remote and run remote teams since 2014 and I promise that it won&#39;t stick for the broader society. Here&#39;s why:1. Socializing is the primary activity that happens at work for the vast majority of workers. The gal or guy coming by your desk to &#34;check in&#34; or &#34;see how your weekend was&#34; etc... is literally where they find their social outlets and personal connections.2. Managers like to be able to watch their direct reports because it makes them feel more in control than they are3. The commuting routine, even if it&#39;s a nightmare, offers a sense of normalcy that most people have gotten used to and in a weird way rely on for grounding.4. For a huge swath of Americans at least, work is an escape from the drudgery of the home.To truly work from home 100% of the time you have to be a master at controlling yourself and your ability to be distracted. Most people don&#39;t have this control and need a framework to insert themselves into. Add to that the contextual dimension of an &#34;other&#34; place that is a world apart from your home life and you have something that allows for a depressurization for most people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is ironic coming from Stanford, who is currently fucking up every single aspect of their handling of covid, as many Stanford students will attest to. Colleges are basically scammers at this point. The whole benefit of going to college is being able to meet like-minded smart, young people like yourself. Remote college isn&#39;t a thing and never will be. College is about people, as much as it is about learning. The unfortunate K-12 and college students are learning this the hard way.Personally, I don&#39;t think that remote is here to stay. I think working will be augmented by remote tools, but it cannot be replaced by remote. Humans just aren&#39;t robots and they need community, and work is the biggest source of community after college. To me, online college is a complete joke and is not what students after high school need. It&#39;s just not healthy.  Humans need interaction in person, and they do their best work when they are working with people who they see on a weekly basis, especially young 20-somethings.This whole thing is becoming evident as people are starting to really just not care for the lockdowns at this point. Parks in SF are a complete shitshow because people want to be out and about. You will never be able to force them to be purely remote, and after covid, if your company is purely remote, you will not attract the best young talent, period. You might attract older folks, but you know you want young talent.This whole thing makes no sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Forensic methods used by police and intelligence go much deeper than just looking at phones near the crime scene.1. They look at phones moving towards the crime scene and going dark when getting close. This is also how you can detect secret meetings between people. They move towards the same area and shut down their phones.2. They look at suspect phone going dark anywhere around the time of the incident.3. Leaving a phone at home that is not answering calls or creating traffic during the time of interest is also a lead (if you already have a suspect)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"All cells phones, at all times, are tracked everywhere. I&#39;m sure there are 1000&#39;s of cameras that are also used to capture visual data (in DC area). Every person flying (domestic/international) is already tracked. MC/VISA/Bank/ATM records are tracked. Every txt, post, voice call, letter you send, package you receive, is tracked (OCR&#39;s). Your vehicle is tracked via programs like Onstar, etc, even if you don&#39;t sign up for the service.People are waiting for the day when you have zero privacy and anonymity. It&#39;s already here.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something particularly concerning about this incident is buried further down in the article.Under the heading &#34;Why Facebook Doesn&#39;t Ban Everyone&#34;, Lincoln explains how social network theory can identify individuals in networks that are influential. This isn&#39;t an exaggeration - basic graph heuristics (such as comparing in/out degree of an individual relative to other parts of the social graph) can easily identify such individuals. Censoring those individuals can have an amplified effect on the graph structure as a whole.For an example of how just a few individuals can make a big difference on graph structure, check out Watts &amp; Strogatz&#39;s 1998 paper, Collective dynamics of &#39;small-world&#39; networks [0][1]. I&#39;d highly recommend reading it - it&#39;s very short and easy to understand.Essentially, a small number of connectors connecting with random individuals can seriously reduce the average number of steps to connect any two individuals. If Facebook wanted to stop the spread of a narrative that they didn&#39;t like, censoring just these few individuals would make it much harder for information to flow through the graph as a whole, and hardly anyone would notice (since Facebook&#39;s only censoring a few people.)Scary.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts–Strogatz_model[1]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9623998/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think FB has a fundamental issue here, which is that:1) they don&#39;t feel they can NOT police content2) they are wayyyyy too big to police content manually3) any AI they train to police content, is not going to be able to state clearly why a given post/account was banned, and anyway...4) if you state objective, clear rules that are automated, it will be pretty easy to game them (e.g. using euphemisms or code words for objectionable content)I don&#39;t see how FB can get out of this situation.  Any social network that is as large as it is, which relies on advertising (and thus cannot be as content-neutral as e.g. phone companies are regarding what you talk about on the phone), is going to face the same situation.Of course, if FB ends up getting way smaller as a result, that would be fine by me.  But I&#39;m not holding my breath..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Stress resilience is one of the most important things when it comes to knowledge work, also one of the most neglected aspect. Mindfulness, stoicism, exercise help, but nothing helps as much as a good night sleep. Also the other thing people usually fail to note is the vicious stress-sleep cycle (lack of sleep induced stress &lt;-&gt; stress induced lack of sleep). It took me years to realize that so much of my problems with bedtime revenge, burnout, non-clinical depression, permastress was basically just lack of quality sleep. FWIW, it helps to think of productivity in terms of sleep and stress when you are working in the knowledge economy. Just like sleep debt, you can also accumulate productivity debt due to lack of stress resilience, lack of sleep, which can eventually lead to things like burnout."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had great success picking up a consistent meditation habit with the greasing the groove-approach[1].. in essence, every time I would feel a bit foggy in the head, I would take a 3-15 minute meditation session. It usually results to 3-5 sessions per day. It&#39;s such a great mental reset, and I haven&#39;t since experienced the kind of complete depletion that you get from pushing yourself hard through the day.I bet some Zen master would reprimand me for this being the wrong approach, but I found it quite difficult to get into the habit of doing, say, a single 30-60 minute session per day. Now I can consistently drop into the meditation session with no urge for procrastination and have also successfully experimented with longer ones.[1] refers to the method of increasing your pull-up capability by installing a pull-up bar in your office / bedroom doorway and doing a set every time you pass through the doorway"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many of us are wearing devices with continuous optical heart rate monitors. Heart rate variability at rest is one of the best indicators of stress and these devices are pretty good at estimating sleep duration and sleep cycles.Regulators need to recognize that continuous tracking devices are a new tool for establishing a health baseline and they should not be expected to match the performance of single-test medical devices. Apple, Garmin, and Fitbit need to build standards to share this baseline data with medical professionals and offer analytics to determine when changes occur.Questionnaire based medicine seems backwards given the digital tools available."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"WhatsApp worldwide usage is estimated to be more than 2B+ users. Even if this article is accurate, it doesn’t really mean much. In the HN bubble lots of people have migrated to Signal with all of their contacts but outside of that bubble nothing much seems to be happening. Note that I’m not agreeing with these changes, I’m just observing reality.To put things into perspective, let’s assume that 25M users (as stated in the article) actually moved to Telegram - which I use and like by the way. Let’s assume they fully moved and stopped using WhatsApp (very unlikely). That means less than 1.25% users moved to another platform - and this means assuming many things that aren’t probably real.It reminds me a bit of the articles about DuckDuckGo vs Google where many people think big changes in usage are happening while ignoring that the average Joe will keep using whatever it’s using unless there’s way too much trouble to continue using it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand why FB needs to do this, but the execution was so out of touch it&#39;s bizarre. My elderly parents called me and were alarmed that WhatsApp is threatening with removing their account unless they agree to share their data. They wondered if FB will be able to track their transactions or perhaps even get into their bank accounts. After years in the tech industry, I&#39;ve learned that my parents&#39; feedback is a good predictor for how well my messaging will be perceived by the wider world. I would have assumed that at FB they would do something similar (or rather, that their testing is 100x more sophisticated), so it&#39;s bizarre that they would miss the mark with messaging and with their prediction of overall success when it came to something so strategically important and sensitive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s why ToS and privacy policy must be readable for John Doe. If it isn&#39;t clear what will happen with users&#39; data, rumours and theories will grow. That will hurt your business like WhatsApp just shows (although I&#39;m not sure Facebook will care all that much, to them it&#39;s just a drop in the bucket)."</p>
