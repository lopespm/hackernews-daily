								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent the last ten years of my career building iOS apps, all but one you would likely known at the time, and whoever in charge of this app is an idiot. Shipping an app to the general public with symbols intact? Really? If they didn&#39;t know/didn&#39;t care, it tells me no one there likely cared about any other quality issue either. It&#39;s highly likely that any relevant lead person probably screamed about this daily, but higher ups don&#39;t give a shit.At my last job our legal team would have had a cow shipping labels. Our apps are gleaned by blogs looking for scoops on upcoming features.I once interviewed at a major airline (not United) and at the time they had outsourced their entire app and web to some foreign companies, including any and all oversight. Their app was a POS and they had hired someone to write a new one -- the same company. Now they had no idea why it was so delayed so they wanted to hire someone to embed in the other company to spy on what was going on. Of course I wanted nothing to do with this travesty. This was years ago, no idea what happened.You&#39;d be amazed at how pathetic mobile development can be even at big companies. Mobile doesn&#39;t have to be hard, but if management tries hard enough, can make crap at scale."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I worked on an early SoC with a display on the dev-board, our test software didn&#39;t do anything with the display. Depending on the last state of the system, the display usually had a bunch of ugly LCD noise on it.Eventually I got around to implementing a rudimentary framebuffer to send to the display. Wondering what to display, I figured I&#39;d compute a Mandelbrot fractal!People liked it, and I was happy to have made our dev systems a little less ugly.I went to work on other things for a few months. When I came back, they had replaced my fractal with the company logo :\(I suspect, but don&#39;t know the codec, that the jpeg used to store the company logo ended up using more space and cycles-per-pixel than my fractal)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love whimsy and Easter eggs in our industry, and I add them whenever possible. There is always a reason to take them out (performance, potential user confusion, grumpy devs, whatever), but prioritizing them says a lot of good about the team and project.In most cases, in my experience, I can tell what generation an engineer comes from based on attitude to whimsy. Younger devs almost always don&#39;t like them. Too much effort, too much potential for trouble. Older devs, especially past retirement, almost always like them. This industry started with a sense of humor and fun."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks like a decent deal looking deeper into it.Things that weren&#39;t obvious on first pass:(1) The VR specs are much higher than consumer level.  I suspect this is what makes it reasonable to read text on it.  The comparison headset is this: https://varjo.com/products/aero/  (They named it, but didn&#39;t google it)(2) They said &#34;VR Computer&#34; but don&#39;t define the term.  They mean that it&#39;s a full PC with a headset instead of a regular display.  Oddly they don&#39;t include a mouse or keyboard.My feedback for Simula one:(0) The value proposition here is (a) the included equipment and (b) the software.  They together have to justify the price at some level.(1) You have to really push the point that this is a full computer, not another headset.  I suggest you include a keyboard/mouse, and include it in the pictures with the headset (the pictures with just the headset, not the ones with the people).  Perhaps a keyboard with a trackpad.(2) Show that the headset is substantially higher-spec than the consumer ones.  Show a comparison chart.(3) Dump the AR coffee shop video.  Show AR in a home office.  Don&#39;t assume/require that your customers are that VR gun-ho.(4) Show more than a bunch of shells in the VR screenshots.  I can alt-tab as fast as I can move my head, with less work.  If this is your underlying value proposition, it sucks.  I&#39;m sorry.  If you have something more interesting, like a combined VR/app environment, then it can work.(4.1) Is there some useful interactions between 3D visualization and high-quality small-text rendering?  If you have good VR/3D developer stories, then this can work.(5) Simula One - is it Ubuntu with a 3d window manager and custom rendering stack?  Does it do anything else?  Does it just make a (claustrophobic) shell of windows around the user in VR?(5.1) Are there any integrations with anything?  Like https://blog.jupyter.org/ipygany-jupyter-into-the-third-dime... ipygany?(5.2) What do you expect people to do with it?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see people have issues with the price tag, and while it is by no mean cheap, since it&#39;s actually a full blown computer AND a VR headset all in one, it is somewhat justified. The computer specs match my Framework laptop and the headset is, on paper, on par or better than other high-end VR headsets (and a miles ahead of my Meta Quest 2 and other consumer-grade VR headsets)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So many people are complaining about price of a first gen enthusiast device.You know the Apple II (~1500 in 1977) is 5k in modern dollars, and sold over 5m units, right?If the device solves a genuine productivity problem for you, 3k is cheap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The code design is also very elegant in its simplicity.You have two static lists of words in the JS code - known words, and a smaller, random pre-shuffled list of words the game will select from.The selection is done on the client, by date, from the second list - every day at midnight (your local time!) the next word in the pre-shuffled list is selected - no hashing or randomizing or anything. No cookies are involved in making you play one game per day, no server side calls are involved in gameplay at all. And yes, this means that changing your time zone will let you play tomorrow&#39;s game, and that you can just view source to know tomorrow&#39;s word - it appears right after today&#39;s word in the code.This is so counter to how we usually design software in so many ways, it&#39;s just delightful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually think the OP and the comments are too focused on the programmer-related aspects of this. I&#39;ll add a few things.1. It&#39;s not trivial but it&#39;s not that hard if you have a decent vocabulary and some intuitive sense for word frequencies (and word pair frequencies) for different locations in a word. The answer list does not seem to include really hard words as naively picking all the words in the MW dictionary would be. It&#39;s a fun 10-15 minute puzzle.2. Five letter seems like something of a sweet spot.3. The answer word list does not appear to have a lot of plurals or common vowel endings for past tense, etc. Or obscure words.4. It lends itself to what I&#39;ll casual cheating, i.e. there are easy ways to get some hints without giving the answers away while focusing on a strategy.5. Basically, it&#39;s got good gameplay for a casual game. It would be easy to build something along similar lines that didn&#39;t have as fun gameplay for a casual gamer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One more factor in Wordle&#39;s popularity that I haven&#39;t yet seen commentators identify much. The game&#39;s word roster tilts heavily toward words with neutral or cheerful connotations.So your brain conjures up something happy at the end. You don&#39;t slog through the puzzle solving to end up with VIRUS, ENNUI, GRIEF, SLAVE, INANE or other such morose words.Instead, we get the likes of AWAKE, BLUSH, FOCAL, etc. That helps make the game a mood-stabilizer or even brightener. We&#39;re usually clever enough to find a solution most days. When we&#39;re slow and need all six turns, we get a cheery &#34;Whew!&#34; to console us. It&#39;s a simple, barely noticeable bit of gamification at its nicest."</p>

However, maybe a release or two of deprecation or better optimized defaults under new names or a new (kinda gross but...) strict mode which is opt-in but is the new default for new instalations.1. Warn the user on startup of potential misconfiguration
2. Allow error_log off to work, as users are expecting it to

4. Acknowledge the confusing syntax and find a better solution than blaming users

9. Fix the proxy hash algorithm so that it hashes the whole address (why only first 3 octets?) or give it a new name; see also 1

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My biggest gripe with nginx is the documentation. I ran into an issue with proxy_buffering being off yet I was still getting 502 errors because the upstream was passing too large headers for the default 4k buffers. I naively assumed that with proxy buffering off that it would send data to the client immediately and, y&#39;know, not buffer it, as [0] suggests. Turns out that turning proxy_buffering off doesn&#39;t turn proxy buffering completely off.While working on that issue, I also needed to set the proxy buffer size. Quick, what&#39;s the difference between proxy_buffer_size [1] and the size argument of proxy_buffers [2]? I still don&#39;t know, because the docs for each directive sound to me like they&#39;re restating the same exact thing.[0] https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#pr...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised the &#34;set a resolver with a dns ttl&#34; isn&#39;t on here; it&#39;s probably my only headache with nginx. If you have an upstream that you specify with a hostname, nginx will lookup the host, cache it, and never refresh it by default.I don&#39;t know why it happens to me so often, but I will set up nginx containers that proxy to some load balanced service (via DNS), and then one day the IPs will change and that service would break because I forgot to set resolver."</p>

He tried few distros (including the older version of Ubuntu they recommend) and the problems persisted. His screen also had issues and colors would slightly shift. I lent him my colorimeter and he said the monitor would lose calibration after several days. He also complained about trackpad not tracking his finger properly. In the end, he returned it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I kinda feel bad for Docker. The prevailing wisdom seems to be that you shouldn&#39;t be using Docker anymore, use Podman. Often the reasons for this is that Podman is daemonless, supports rootless containers, etc. But I feel this is misplaced:- The Docker daemon is actually really useful. It can run containers as other users, perform a bunch of mounting and networking stuff you can&#39;t do as rootless (or at least requires some hacky workarounds), and can monitor/maintain your containers. Podman can do lots of this as well, but requires the use of systemd. So in those cases you&#39;ve just swapped one daemon for another.- For most of my use cases, I don&#39;t really care about rootless. On servers I run all my docker containers as non-root anyway, and if I&#39;m on a workstation I have privileges and don&#39;t need rootless.- Although Podman claims compatibility with Docker, I&#39;ve always found issues with trying to use it even up to a few months ago, prior to this release. Mostly when trying to use compose, although it does improve every release.I basically just view the Docker daemon as an init system like systemd. It&#39;s a privileged daemon that runs other processes. But for some reason it seems to have been made into a bogeyman."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like Podman, and I&#39;m happy to see this new release. This little nugget about non-released features makes me most excited though:&gt; More features, including support for volume mounts from the host, are planned for Podman v4.1, so stay tuned for more updates.IIUC host volume mounts for podman-machine are the last major missing feature in Podman that would allow something like Podman Desktop Companion [1] to replace Docker Desktop on Windows/Mac for most use cases - if it works well. It&#39;d be great to replace that nagging-for-updates and nagging-for-subscriptions with a completely open source replacement tool. (I&#39;m sympathetic to the Docker team in need of a revenue source, but I&#39;m really happy OCI containers on Mac and Windows can be made accessible without vendor lock-in).[1]: https://iongion.github.io/podman-desktop-companion/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there an eli5 or similar on the differences between podman / docker / rancher / others?Feels unexplained (at least for me), how do I know which to choose when and what are the trade offs?I recently went deeper on Rancher Desktop and it’s use of containerd vs dockerd backends and it is totally not obvious what you lose if not using dockerd and how you might fill the gaps. Feels like because docker established the space and put a bunch of related components together (cli, image building, image storing and container running) and other projects make difference choices it can be quite confusing to compare them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the article:&#34;I often encountered videos that were uploaded again and again, no matter how many times I removed them. One day, a woman emailed me, calmly explained that her ex-boyfriend had uploaded a video of them having sex, and asked me to remove it. I deleted the clip. Later that week, it was re-uploaded. The woman wrote again, I removed it, and this continued for months; I must have pulled the same video down a dozen times. This was before I had ever heard the term “revenge porn.”Requests like this were not uncommon. Once, a woman wrote to say there was a video of her on Tube8 that showed her being sexually assaulted after someone spiked her drink at a party. The video had tens of thousands of views, so I had to review it before making the call to remove it. In the clip, the woman is clearly high, laughing and head lolling, having sex on a bed surrounded by fully dressed people holding drinks and watching as colored lights flashed and music blared in the background. I took it down, but it was uploaded again repeatedly in the following months. Each time, the mortified woman flagged it, and each time, I removed it; both of us were aware that there was nothing we could do to stop the clip from resurfacing.&#34;I have read the same thing from Facebook content moderators.  They got so frustrated at having to watch and take down the same videos over and over.This seems to be such a simple problem to solve:  record a hash of the video file, don&#39;t allow uploading it again.  That would probably get rid of most re-posting.It could be bypassed by modifying the file slightly, but the hashing could also get more sophisticated.  At some point, an ex-boyfriend is not likely to want to keep modifying a video to piss off his ex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Be careful working in this field (pornography). In 2017 I wrote a mildly pornographic app (http://driftwheeler.com) and it appears on my resume. When hiring managers or recruiters take a look, some of them get upset.For example, a scheduled interview was abruptly cancelled the night before. I pursued the matter through a friend who had a senior role at the hiring company and it was determined that the (middle-aged female) in-house recruiter had been deeply offended when she followed the link on my resume and had cancelled everything. Eventually, I received a sincere apology from the CEO.There is a real stigma, and it will affect you. Beware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; One day, I received inquiries from journalists looking to find out more about Manwin. Believing it was a major threat, I sent off a panicked email to the owner of the company and some vice presidents. My bosses were stunned, and not in a good way. Corey, the guy who had originally hired me, marched me into an office, and I nearly got canned. They had mercy on me. I think they could tell that I was trying to protect the company in my own overzealous, entirely inappropriate way. It was true — I felt like part of a team and wanted to do my best for them. But I had blown it.&gt; After that, with my reputation tarnished, my fortunes at the company started to dwindle.That seems wrong to me, but I&#39;m interested in other people&#39;s responses. It doesn&#39;t seem like &#39;blowing it&#39; at all. How many companies have problems with employees that are too motivated?First, afaik, CEOs generally work to have open lines of communication with their lower level employees - the problem is people not paying attention, not communicating important information, or it getting filtered by the interests of layers in between. Second, Manwin can&#39;t be that big a company. It&#39;s not like emailing the CEO of Microsoft, who has &gt;100,000 people working for them (and again, wouldn&#39;t Satya Nadella just say - &#39;hey, thanks for keeping a sharp eye out and for the heads up. It may look bad, but we&#39;ve seen it many times before. I&#39;m going to forward this to corporate communications, who can handle these things astutely.&#39;)Maybe other companies are just different than the ones I&#39;ve seen."</p>
