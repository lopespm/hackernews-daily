								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Around 1 year ago we got hit badly on our [blogging platform][0] by people/groups submitting fake customer support description of other big companies, either being Microsoft, Facebook, Comcast etc.Rolled out a machine learning model and trained it on the database. 99% of them vanished.Next day, the machine didn&#39;t work and success rate was around 5%.Found out, they have learned the trick and now using symbols from different languages to make it look like English.Trained again, success rate went up again.Next hour, success rate fallen.This time, they mixed their content with other valid content of our own blogging platform. They would use content from our own blog or other people posts and mix it to fool the machine learning.Trained it again and was success.Once a while such content appear and machine model fails to catch them.It only takes couple of minutes to mark the bad posts and have the model get trained and redeployed and then boom, bad content is gone.The text extraction, slicing through good content and bad content, finding out symbols vs sane alphabet and many other thing was at first challenging, but overall pretty excited to make it happen.Through this we didn&#39;t use any platform to do the job, the whole thing was built by ourselves, little bit of Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn and some other spices.Worth noting, it was all text and no images or videos. Once we got hit with that we&#39;ll deal with it.[0]: https://www.gonevis.comedit: Here&#39;s the training code that made the initial work https://gist.github.com/Alir3z4/6b26353928633f7db59f40f71c8f... it&#39;s pretty basic stuff. Later changed to cover more edge cases and it got even simpler and easier. Contrary to the belief, the better it got, the simpler it became :shrug"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you host blobs for free, somebody is going to use you as their host. Even if you just hosted audio, I&#39;m sure somebody will quickly come along with a steganography tool to hide their content on your site (and use your bandwidth).Similarly, if you make compute power available, people will use you to mine cryptocurrency. Even if all you host is text, somebody will come along to be abusive. When you put a computer on the Internet, it&#39;s open to the entire world, including the very worst people.If you&#39;re hosting a community, start from the beginning by knowing who your community is and how they will tell you who they are. If the answer is &#34;everybody&#34;, then know what everybody means -- it means some people won&#39;t want to be there, because some people will make life hard for them.It&#39;s no longer 1991, when you could assume that such people wouldn&#39;t find you. They will find you -- for money, or the lulz. You have to plan for that on day 1. You can&#39;t fix it after the fact."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll never forget having to be a moderator for a somewhat popular forum back in the day and oh man did I learn how a few people can make your life hell.One thing not mentioned many times in these discussions are the poor moderators. Having to look at all that stuff, some of which can be very disturbing or shocking (think death, gore, etc as well as the racy things) really takes a toll on the mind. The more automation the less moderators have to deal with and then usually its the tamer middle ground content."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is interesting ...For the longest time we tried to convince people that they should have an off-amazon archive of their S3 data ... we even ran an ads to that effect in 2012[1].The (obvious) reason this isn&#39;t compelling is the cost of egress.  It&#39;s just (relatively) too expensive to offload your S3 assets to some third party on a regular basis.So if R2 is S3 with no egress, suddenly there is a value proposition again.Further, unlike in 2012, in 2021 we have really great tooling in the form of &#39;rclone&#39;[2][3] which allows you to move data from cloud to cloud without involving your own bandwidth.[1] The tagline was &#34;Your infrastructure is on AWS and your backups are on AWS.  You&#39;re doing it wrong.&#34;[2] https://rclone.org/[3] https://www.rsync.net/resources/howto/rclone.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really curious to see how this goes. If they live up to the following paragraph, that&#39;s pretty game-changing:&gt;&gt; This cheaper price doesn’t come with reduced scalability. Behind the scenes, R2 automatically and intelligently manages the tiering of data to drive both performance at peak load and low-cost for infrequently requested objects.  We’ve gotten rid of complex, manual tiering policies in favor of what developers have always wanted out of object storage: limitless scale at the lowest possible cost.The amount of effort it takes to understand and account for S3 Intelligent Tiering is somewhat mind-blowing so to get rid of all of that (and the corresponding fees) would be really nice and TheWayThingsShouldBe™ for the customer -- on top of that most users just don&#39;t even know S3 Intelligent Tiering exists so it&#39;ll be great if Cloudflare just handles that automatically.We at https://vantage.sh/ (disclosure, I&#39;m the Co-Founder and CEO) recently launched a cross-provider cost recommendation for CloudFront Egress to Cloudflare which was really popular and I can imagine doing something similar for S3 -&gt; R2 once it is live and we are able to vet it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know the Cloudflare team hangs out here, so thanks, and great job! This was absolutely necessary for my line of work. Couple of quick questions/confirmations:* R2 will support the same object sizes as S3? We have 500GB+ objects and could go to a 1TB per object. 
* R2 will support HTTP Range GETs, right?Egress bandwidth for objects on S3 is the biggest line item on the AWS bill for a company I work for, by an order of magnitude, and this will just wipe it off for the most part."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A tip: If anyone finds themselves in a tragic situation like this where they can’t work but also can’t afford to take leave, investigate your short and long-term disability benefits ASAP. Also read up on the documentation necessary to begin disability claims.Engage with a doctor early on who can document the severe depressive symptoms that are preventing work (which the author specifically cites in his anecdote). Do it as early as possible to generate a documentation trail. Don’t wait until you’re close to being terminated to begin documenting anything because that will make the claim much weaker compared to someone with months of doctor’s notes documenting the situation.I can’t speak to Amazon’s specific benefits, but most big tech companies I’ve worked for have provided some base level short and long term disability coverage as part of their core benefits, partially to avoid situations like this where employees are unable to work due to external circumstances but are unable to go on leave."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What sucks about stories like this is, while my heart breaks for what this guy went through, managers don&#39;t have the same luxury of defending their side of the story to Mother Jones.I worked as an EM at Amazon. I went into this ready to think he had a bad boss (because those definitely exist at Amazon), but after reading this I feel like there&#39;s another side to this that has more compassion than is being reflected here. He was at turns informally warned, encouraged to take leave, and offered severance. It sounds like he expected a pass on all this for his life circumstances until it was too late. Without more details from both sides as to what the performance issues were, this reads as using a tragedy to get more than he&#39;s owed.I can&#39;t even imagine what this guy went through. He had to watch his wife slowly die while raising two girls and providing for his family. Watching my father die from cancer after a long life was awful enough and affected me for years. His grief has to be phenomenal. I imagine part of his grieving process is lashing out at his boss for not being more understanding. That said, I think his story would be the same no matter where he worked. It&#39;s just more in vogue to bash Amazon.If he wants to lash out at anything, I suggest lashing out at a system that requires us to work while going through such awful life circumstances. That man shouldn&#39;t have had to work. He should have been safe to be unemployed while focusing on being there for his family. The idea that he felt compelled to work to avoid his family going bankrupt is lunacy to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Believe it or not, this isn&#39;t a rare attitude among managers at Amazon. A significant percentage of SDMs believe they must &#34;keep a high bar&#34; and remove any dissenting subordinates. Word has gotten out about it, mostly on the blind app, which forced Amazon to raise pay bands for engineers 50-100k. This is costing the company a lot of money.The difference going forwards for Amazon is that the stock is mostly stagnant, and so employees are no longer putting up with miserable harsh working conditions, the financial incentives are no longer there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who is intimately familiar with the Chrome extensions internals and is not employed by a big tech company, I believe most of the changes seem like a step in the right direction.*I&#39;ve been working towards implementing greater support for Chrome extensions in Electron which has involved reading and interacting with Chromium code [0].- Using service workers instead of a hidden background webpage is more idiomatic for web developers.- Forced non-persistent extensions guides developers to a better implementation which relies on less resources.*The deprecation of webRequest&#39;s blocking behavior is what&#39;s most concerning. The implementation in Manifest V2 requires sending a message back and forth between processes with JS processing for each network request which seems to be in part why they redesigned it.However, that optimization costs so much for innovative ad blocking technologies as gorhill of uBlock Origin has mentioned. When ad blocking begins requiring new methods of detection or filtering, it&#39;ll now be up to Chromium maintainers to implement support for it in the new declarativeNetRequest API. This is a tradeoff of performance for reduced flexibility where it is absolutely needed.[0] https://github.com/samuelmaddock/electron-browser-shell"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a stupid idea. But first, a bunch of questions:- Can you legally advertise a product you&#39;re not affiliated with? Is this OK by the ToS of major ad networks?- Is it possible to target ads by user&#39;s browser?I&#39;m thinking, maybe we should crowdfund a public interest ad, targeted at people browsing from Chrome, with some attention-grabbing art or distracting colors, and a clear message: &#34;Want to stop seeing this ad? Stop using Chrome, install a different browser and an ad blocker. Click here to learn more.&#34;, which links to a site directing people to install Firefox and uBlock Origin (and linking to crowdfunding campaign to keep the ad going). Alternative for A/B testing: &#34;Don&#39;t click this ad, it costs us money.&#34;Come to think of it, maybe someone like EFF should do that - they&#39;re well-known and reputable enough that people wouldn&#39;t immediately assume it&#39;s some weird Firefox ad, avoiding the effect being the opposite from intended."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me (I imagine a lot of others as well), it&#39;s simple. If Chrome removes adblock, I&#39;m going back to Firefox.HN ilk don&#39;t represent a good target market. Can&#39;t really make money off traditionally tracked ads off of us.FWIW, I love Chrome, still do. I&#39;ve been here since those entirely useless but super viral and catchy speed test ad/vids. It worked on me. I love the debugger as a web developer, more so than Firebug.Overall, will be sad to go. Pour one out for Chrome when the day comes."</p>

Excellent use of sequence numbers for stateless send/receive (SYN cookies): https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan/blob/master/src... (very well-documented source too, a pleasure to read).I once (2016) used it to scan port 22 on the whole ipv4 (had to experiment with rate limits to not trigger alarms and get complaints forwarded by my VPS provider; the clever ip+port randomization technique helps a lot with that). Then took the ~22m (iirc) IPs which responded and ran ssh-keyscan on them to extract and analyze some ~15m ssh banners and public keys (a bunch of them broken, through debianized PRNG etc.) I think most of the scanning + extraction was done overnight, via ~13 VPS rented hourly (whole thing cost &lt; $10, and very few complaints). Fun times :) I should write it up some time, and do it again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For what it’s worth, the thing I find really exciting about Spaces is that they provide a way to create a decentralised global hierarchical directory structure for realtime data. It’s like a free-for-all global USENET hierarchy that anyone can curate or contribute to, complete with decentralised ACLs. Or like DMOZ but for chatrooms. We haven’t published a “root” space as Matrix.org yet (as the “subspace” hierarchy feature is still in beta), but I cannot wait to kill off the public room directory for Matrix.org (which is a total tirefire atm) and replace it with decentralised hierarchies of rooms that the community can moderate and curate like any other content.Add in voice/video rooms, async comms (messageboards, forums, mailing lists, newsgroups), decentralised metaverse worlds like  thirdroom (https://youtu.be/e26UJRCGfGk?t=2263) and then you end up with a skeleton for a whole open universe of interoperable communication.Next up: decentralised search for discovery as well as decentralised hierarchies…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s awesome for teams to focus on just work conversations but unfortunately not enough.We&#39;ve completely switched our work communication to a self-hosted matrix+element with SSO, so we can be sure our matrix auth is secured the same way our other internal services are.However, some of us also have personal matrix accounts which are offline during work hours and corporate accounts are offline outside of work hours which forbids using matrix as an emergency contact method. It would be great to either ability to sign into multiple accounts or an ability to sign into a single space using account other than the default one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to built for people with a lot of rooms/people. I think it&#39;s a classic mistake to enable it for all users, and I see it in all kinds of products. Everyone starts out by building something simple, but eventually it&#39;s bloated with features that I don&#39;t need (I&#39;m sure someone does).Personally, I use matrix every day. However, it&#39;s only for a single room. With this new feature, I lost 70 &#34;pixels&#34; (or 140 actual pixels) of horizontal space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love the idea of doing this. Just like I do the idea of using Apple&#39;s &#34;hide my email&#34; feature. But in reality you&#39;re completely locking yourself into that provider. What if I want to change provider or the provider decides to sunset this feature. My logins are now split up so much it&#39;ll be a full time job getting them set back to my primary email address. It&#39;s a trade-off I guess because you can&#39;t solve it any other way from what I know of!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This would be a large personal disaster and a full time personal project if the service provider decides to shut down the service. One would have to crawl through all services they have signed up for to update the email addresses.Instead get a domain. Configure email as well as a catch all address. Example anything@yourdomain.com would reach name@yourdomain.com which you use as your primary email address.And say, if I am signing up for Netflix, I would give the email as netflix@yourdomain.com. The email automatically reaches my single primary inbox with the catch-all behavior. And if I find a lot of spam to netflix@yourdomain.com, I know which service is leaking my email address and I can quickly block all emails sent to netflix@yourdomain.com"</p>

While I agree that it would be best to not be locked in to particular providers, these are two of the providers who have a lot of my trust and to whom I’m paid up years in advance (at least in Fastmails case).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I thought the comments to this were well above average on the entertaining scale. Pretty embarrassing, though, that probably the majority of comments seemed to take it seriously, even reprimanding the creator for not being serious enough, not taking his Business seriously enough. It seems to create dissonance among many that such a thing even exists. People seem deeply confused it&#39;s not full speed ahead, like every other commercial site, trying to grab money from users. We on HN constantly complain that the internet was taken over by smooth, malevolent, lying mega-corporations, with 1GB ToS&#39;s and thousands of employees..and here&#39;s something completely different and people entitledly shit on it.It&#39;s a joke, people! From HN&#39;s own Stavros. Or, who knows what it is. Something Stavros did for fun and uses himself. A thing. Can&#39;t things just be allowed to be what they are?  It&#39;s like people can&#39;t tolerate the existence of unique things, and have to see them as just really bad versions of a known category of things. &#34;This round thing is bad because I can&#39;t force it into this square hole.&#34; And I guess when someone posts something to HN it gets judged as if submitted by the author and designed, badly, for the person now reading it. Ugly font! Bad colours! Unprofessional tone! Bad marketing! etc. ..Wasn&#39;t the internet 100% like that in the good old days?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been hoping for an Imgur replacement for simple, hosted image sharing.I&#39;m happy to pay $1/mo, but when I tried to upload https://camo.githubusercontent.com/9ec8d13de2878c899fda0bd43... I got this, which doesn&#39;t look like what I uploaded: https://cln.sh/4coS9T / https://imgz.org/i5qphFzd.gif"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The swap of Meng Whenzhou for the two Canadian Michaels demonstrates why it doesn&#39;t matter if Huawei&#39;s equipment is trustworthy or not.Canada was obeying international treaties when it detained Meng.  The Chinese state took Canadian hostages and held them in questionable conditions until they were eventually able to force a swap.  It is now clear that the Chinese government expects certain Chinese executives and corporations to be above both international law and the law of foreign countries in which they operate.If your country permits Huawei to do business within it&#39;s borders, that puts your own citizens at risk of being taken hostage.  Let&#39;s not kid ourselves that national governments care more about people than economics, but letting foreign countries take your citizens hostage without repercussion can threaten your chances of being reelected.Thanks to this episode, public opinion in Canada is now overwhelmingly against letting Huawei operate in Canada.  Given this and pressure from its allies in the five eyes, it seems almost inconceivable that the Canadian government won&#39;t soon ban Huawei from participation in 5G networks.This episode has also raised questions about permitting the operations of other Chinese corporations that are too closely associated  with the Chinese government.  e.g. If a Chinese mining corp operating in a foreign country had it&#39;s operations shut down for environmental law infractions, would there be reprisals in the form of trade sanctions, etc. from China?This kind of lawless behaviour is going to have a chilling effect on all commerce with Chinese companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Again, there is sooo much talk around it in all directions.But has there actually been a backdoor exposed?With all the attention turned towards it and that it has been a topic in geopolitics since years - there should have been some ressources allocated towards some reverse engeneering, that clearly shows it is not trustworthy?If not, why not? I mean it surely is not easy - but I always only hear blame without proof.(And I don&#39;t need proof, that the ccp is not nice. I know that.)In either case, my takeaway is, that we need more open hardware, that can be easily verified to do what it claims."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US has never proved that there is any kind of Chinese surveillance going on with Huawei equipment. Lying and anti-market strategies seem to be the tool of choice of the US government to block the advance of societies that are not deemed to be part of their empire."</p>
