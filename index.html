								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First, I’m so glad this turned out to be hypothetical, and you didn’t have to suffer through such a catastrophic loss. Second, if you had actually suffered such a loss, your digital life would hopefully be the last thing on your mind, and you’d just be glad to have your life and your family - the only real things that matter in this world.That said, planning a strategy for offsite data storage or a secondary authenticator is of course wise. A safety deposit box or other offsite location that you can frequently refresh and keep up to date would be a good investment. If you’re worried about keeping a master key to your life in a single place, you could separate your data and your authenticator. The how likely depends on your threat model, several people on this site may find it insufficient. To whatever degree you obfuscate or complicate your recovery path, you also increase the risk of losing access to it yourself.You might also consider it’s not necessarily the “thing you have” that might go MIA, but due to physical injury, age, or just forgetfulness, the “thing you know” could also be at risk. I realize this the older I get. Finding a secure way to store a master password in the event you cannot recall it, or perhaps in the event of your death, is something you may also consider. In this case, I would avoid a cipher or something else you’re likely to forget."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two-factor authentication terrifies me.For my bank from my country of origin that I maintain, I get a battery-powered RSA token. From that I can generate a mobile 2FA token in an app that I can use to log in for day-to-day transaction. If I lose the devices with the 2FA token, I have to pray that that CR2032 is still alive or I lose access to that account until I spend thousands of dollars on international flights (replacing the battery resets the device)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This recently happened to me after my laptop and phone were stolen on vacation.  Everything is in 1Password.  I of course didn&#39;t have the recovery paper with me.  I recently changed my iCloud password to be more secure, and luckily I remembered it.  But I needed 2FA to log in still.I had to go to an AT&amp;T store, port my phone number to a different iPhone, restore from an iCloud backup using the SMS 2FA, and then I could finally log into 1Password for my passwords and MFA.If I didn&#39;t have a memorable iCloud password this would have been impossible without the 1Password recovery paper.Devices are often lost/stolen on vacation where the myriad layers of protection are extremely hard — if not impossible — to penetrate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few months ago, the IRS made me verify my identity using some janky video conferencing software where I had to hold up a copy of my passport. The software was so hard to use, that I can&#39;t believe average people manage to do it. Now, real-time deep fakes are literally easier to create than using the video verification software itself. This will have interesting societal implications."</p>

I&#39;m using a throwaway account because I&#39;d rather not be identified (and because surveillance is quite controversial here).Axis has developed a way to cryptographically sign video, using TPMs (Trusted Platform Module) built into the cameras and embedding the signature into the h.264 stream.[1] The video can be verified on playback using an open-source video player.[2]I hope this sort of video signing will be mainstream in all cameras in the future (i.e. cellphones etc), as it will pretty much solve the trust issues deep fakes are causing.[0] https://www.axis.com/

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of people saying &#34;USB-C cables aren&#39;t even compatible with each other!&#34; (Nintendo switch etc.) Guess what: that&#39;s exactly the problem this regulation is intended to solve. Fake USB-C cables like Nintendo&#39;s that have the right shape but do not adhere to spec should gradually disappear along with lightning cables. The regulation actually says that cables can no longer be bundled with the devices themselves, so Nintendo would stop sending you that fake cable with your switch, and you would just buy a real one to work with all your devices.Other people saying &#34;what about innovation!?&#34; That&#39;s fine. Let&#39;s say the USB consortium releases USB-D with input from Apple, Google, and many other stakeholders. The EU can set another deadline for newly released devices to adhere to the new version instead of the old one. The transition will involve a period of time where older devices are still on C and newer ones on D, which is totally compatible with the regulation and is necessary with or without regulation. It&#39;s ludicrous to think companies won&#39;t be able to &#34;iterate&#34;: you would be crazy to go to market with any cable technology that isn&#39;t already very mature. Apple spent years designing lighting chargers because they knew that once they were released they&#39;d be around for a long time (and they have been!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By the way, that&#39;s also how Tesla and all other cars have the same electric plug in EU(not the USB mandate but the car plug standardisation mandate).Of course, the first thing that comes to mind is what happens if better solutions are found. Will EU block innovation?That question is addressed in the Q&amp;A: https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/QANDA_...In essence, they seem to believe that wired charging is mature enough for standardisation but further technologies can be implemented through &#34;Radio Equipment Directive&#34;. In the same time, it appears that the  wireless charging is unaffected because the tech is new and fast changing, therefore the manufacturers can include whatever wireless charging they see fit.It really boils down to &#34;No funny cables, why don&#39;t you try wireless charging of your liking if USB-C doesn&#39;t cut it for you?&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s just really not clear to me that regulators need to be mandating product design.I have no expectation, for example, that these same regulators will stay on top of this and revise it when USB-C stops being the preferred or best choice.Twenty years ago, we really DID have a snarl of competing and proprietary phone ports. It was a mess -- Blackberry chargers didn&#39;t work with Palm; most WinMo devices had their own ports; etc. It was ugly.Now, pretty much everything is either USB or Lightning. This is good! What problem is the EU solving here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"hey, OP here, figured i&#39;d clarify some things about this project:1) yes, I realize this is going to be way harder than it seems, but I&#39;m actually going to do my best to hopefully get a good user experience out of this and I&#39;m easily preparing for this to be a multi-year effort, but I&#39;m not going to give up right at the gate2) Custom HALs were actually an option, up until very recently, since as of Windows 10, version 2004, the HAL is now statically linked into the kernel, meaning that if I wanted to use the AIC natively I&#39;d need to write a patch finder that runs before the Windows kernel loads (This is what EfiGuard does for example to disable PatchGuard)(Yes this is actually more tenable than it may seem, due to some undocumented policy files Windows is able to use, but I have already decided to hold off on this until after I get Windows working under the thin hypervisor)3) HAL Extensions (for those unaware they are tiny modules that allow you to extend the Windows HAL with functions for non standard hardware) are not tenable at the moment since they&#39;re limited in the APIs they use4) I am well aware that Windows is going to need a lot more help than just purely the interrupt controller, I&#39;m currently trying to bring up the vGIC first since the distributor and redistributors need to be emulated and I need to bring up Project Mu first5) as for the GPU, I&#39;m way too far away from that being a concern to figure out the approach lolif you have any feedback btw, please do feel free to comment it i&#39;ll try to address it as best as I canyes I&#39;ll update the website theme soon enough, thanks to the commenter who remarked about readability."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am struggling to see here how this shouldn&#39;t be something that Microsoft does itself. And, if Microsoft is doing it, they can just call Apple and get what they need re: documentation or specs or questions answered. They might just need appropriate NDAs between the two companies (which I&#39;d have to imagine they already have?)?With Linux they have to reverse-engineer it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been working 4 day workweeks for well over a decade now, took the pay cut myself.As for the goal to maintain 100% productivity whilst cutting back on hours, I&#39;m confident that they will succeed. In fact, they&#39;ll succeed in this without requiring some kind of brilliant plan, as this recalibration happens automatically.When you start working one day less, nobody will reduce your workload by 20%. You&#39;ll have the exact same workload as before and now need to achieve it in less time.There&#39;s many ways to cross this gap. An obvious one is that a typical 5 day work week has moments of slack, depending on the culture. Friday after lunch is where productivity sinks in many offices. Wednesdays are also slower as it&#39;s typically the first moment in the week where things are running (planned, prepared, on track). In a 4 day work week you sacrifice this breathing room, the 4 days become more compressed.Another natural change is to take a more aggressive stand in rejecting non-sense. Excess meetings, unimportant emails, etc. This works very well and is extremely effective for the simple reason that you MUST. As such this time compression is a blessing, a cleansing mechanism for yourself and the organization.You&#39;ll be amazed at how much time you can win back. Let&#39;s say you do need to attend a meeting. It&#39;s a 1 hour meeting. You&#39;re needed in the meeting. Go in and say you only have 20 mins. As if by sheer magic, what needed to be discussed gets done in 20 mins. Without this forced &#34;budgeting&#34;, people would just fill the hour with bullshit.Counter intuitive, but by being rigid instead of elastic, you maximize value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is part of a wider scheme in the UK whereby 60 firms and 3000 employees are piloting 4 day weeks.https://www.theguardian.com/business/2022/apr/04/thousands-o...From the article:Employees from a wide range of businesses and charities are expected to take part in the scheme, which will run initially from June to December, including the Royal Society of Biology, the London-based brewing company Pressure Drop, a Manchester-based medical devices firm, and a fish and chip shop in Norfolk.It comes as the push for companies to adopt a shorter working week – crucially with no loss of pay while aiming for higher productivity – gains momentum as a way of improving working conditions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish them luck. I understand their need to have folks in the office, and this is one way to make that more attractive.But it is only one factor. Good management, strong teams, and a whole lot of &#34;soft&#34; stuff is even more important than beanbag chairs and foozball tables. The &#34;good management&#34; part is where most companies go pear-shaped. I wouldn&#39;t want to go to Buckingham Palace every day, if I hated the people I worked with/for, and felt like my work was being treated badly[0].Although I work exclusively at home, and have no desire to ever dress &#34;business casual&#34; again, I think that a good* office environment can be extremely conducive to great work.* As in &#34;not like 99% of today&#39;s offices.&#34;[0] https://dilbert.com/strip/1996-06-02"</p>

You&#39;ll never get the time back that you spend working on unimportant projects, sustaining old builds, placating unhappy people, working on slow computers, etc.  Unless it&#39;s the fastest way for you to deliver whatever good you have to the world, put it aside, especially if you&#39;ve invested time to get good at tending it.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would have kept the same hardware forever too, but for some reason my tools seem to take more and more resources every year.Silly example is gmail, which loaded in 1s on my 2011 MacBook Pro when new, if it load it again today (I just tried) it takes 35 seconds before I can click anything.Another might be everyone’s favourite software to hate on: Teams.On my 2011 MacBook Pro: fans squealing, UI of the OS becomes unresponsive, beachballs. But chat/video software of the era was not so heavy.What annoys me is that this machine is supposedly faster than yours, (i7, 8GB, SATA SSD) but the capability of the machine has been whittled away over time."</p>

I use it for gaming, light room and Photoshop no problems! I live in Canada and have good income - but there&#39;s genuinely no reason for me to replace these.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a low-energy quantum physicist, I completely agree: Experimental high-energy physics has become primarily an industrial subsidy scheme[1], and if we want the highest chance of reaching a grand unified theory, it seems the money would be much better spent elsewhere (cosmology, space-based observatories, research positions for young physicists without publish-or-perish incentives to run for the latest fad).The short history of physics in TFA is spot on: Einstein and the quantum pioneers added abstractions to build physical theories with prediction power, whereas current high-energy physics theory seems to be mostly a mathematical exercise. This has been confirmed by numerous insiders, including by Hossenfelder as mentioned in the article, and Lee Smolin (&#34;The trouble with physics&#34;) who is also a theoretical physicist.Things have changed a lot since accelerators became a must-have for high-energy physics: Today we have detectors and computing power that let us observe the natural experiment of the universe with a precision and diligence that would be impossible when LHC was commissioned. I find it much more likely that we would learn new physics by giving 10-year grants to 1000 young physicist of revolutionary spirit, and let them use the tools they could build themselves, than by handing that money to the old guard which has produced nothing of significance for the last two generations.[1]: The industrial subsidy angle is not touched upon in TFA, but it is clear that there is a large number of people and companies making a good living from mega-physics, and  talking to colleagues in the field, I get the distinct impression that it is not always they physicist walking in the front when asking for more machines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who did their PhD at CERN - I agree.The place is fantastic, you get to meet great people and life is cool.But what you are working on is completely useless for humanity. Knowing that there is a quantum foam is knowledge that brings us nowhere. If someone could answer to this &#34;and so what?&#34; in a meaningful way I would be glad to change my mind. For the time being, the energy scale we are making these discoveries is not useful.&#34;yes, but this is fundamental science...&#34; → yes it is, but where does this fundamental science helps in everyday problems? Have we had a case where the Higgs boson changed anything in our life?The quantum mechanics of the 1920&#39;s changed our everyday world. We could build a whole technology on it, and understand things that changes our everyday life. Is there a comparable impact on knowing that the Higgs boson is +/- 10^-9 (or whatever) aligned with the theoretical model?We have so many problems where physics is needed (energy production to start with, and then exploring biology), the money should go there instead. Even if it means having less particle physicists the same way we have less philosophes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cannot disagree more.  &#34;Making a car is expensive, so let&#39;s not do that to explore 1000 miles out.  Let&#39;s just have 1000 people walk one mile and explore.&#34;  Simply ridiculous comparison.  But sure, let&#39;s find a way to build/experiment LHC++ less expensively.What&#39;s concerning to me, however, is the attitude towards curiosity that this article exhibits.  They should rename their domain to smallthink.com."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello, I&#39;m the developer of Leek Wars, thank you for sharing my link!I&#39;m from France and I&#39;ve been coding this game with my friends since 2012 when I was in University. I try to add features and improve the language from time to time.The source code of the game (frontend and fight generation) is available at https://github.com/leek-warsHappy leek coding :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"LeekWars has been around for a while now. I remember having a blast playing it with colleagues at least 10 years ago.From memory, as you level you get access to more and more API features. A good way to have a stronger leek was to manage to implement algorithms before they were officialy available to you through the API. Ex: instead of waiting to level up to get access to A* pathfinding, you could get a huge advantage against other leeks by implementing it yourself within the memory and cycle constraints you were given for your AI code.Happy to see it&#39;s still apparently going strong..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminded me of another fun programming game called Elevator Saga (https://play.elevatorsaga.com). Essentially, you need to write the code for a system of elevators to transport the maximum number of people in a given time.It&#39;s a problem I&#39;ve thought about every so often, but never bothered to look up how it was commonly implemented. For example, If you have a large building with multiple elevators, is there an optimal way to arrange the elevators while they&#39;re idle to minimize transport time? Or what about accounting for time of day? (e.g. stacking the elevators on the bottom floor in the morning as people arrive at the office). Or what advantages do you gain mathematically from having Up/Down buttons vs. the touchpads where people select the exact floor? Seems like an interesting problem if you work on elevators installed in tall office buildings."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Excited to show off something that we&#39;ve been working on: the Bitcoin Note. The Bitcoin Note is a cash instrument that is backed by Bitcoin via multisig. Each note is printed with beautiful, currency-grade elements that use secure printing techniques typically reserved for government documents like microtext, raised print and foil. More importantly, each note includes a secure NFC chip which is where a multisig lives that allows you to claim the Bitcoin at any time.We were heavily inspired by OG Bitcoin physical money like Casascius coins, however, we wanted to created a design whereby (1) anyone can spend, gift and share the Bitcoin for years to come without having to worry a sophisticated attacker who extracts a private key from under a label or scratch off and (2) trust was minimized on that part of the printer (us).This lead us to the design we landed on for the Bitcoin Note1) An NFC chip readable by nearly all modern smartphones2) A two part multisig where (1) we write an encrypted private key to the note (and don&#39;t keep a copy and (2) you write a user key to the note in plaintext and then load the note3) We only release the decryption key when someone cuts the note and reports this via an authenticated and encrypted way to our server4) The multisig reverts to only your key after a printed expiration date on the note5) You can re-key the user key on the note you receive if you want to hold it for a long timeWe believe that the result of this design achieves the goal of Bitcoin that&#39;s incredibly easy to use - like cash - but still preserves the important quality of self-custody. Take a look at http://bitcoinnote.com/ to learn more and reserve a spot in line for our release later this summer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Am I missing something about how cutting notes works, or am I correct in saying that cutting notes relies on a centralized single-company-controlled server being both online and releasing a decryption key?This entire release seems a little bit light on technical details so it&#39;s not clear to me exactly what notes are doing when they&#39;re transferred, but it does seem like on first glance there are a lot of red flags here. I would love to see a more detailed technical breakdown on that website that isn&#39;t just promotional material.----Even ignoring the centralization angle, all of the verification advice I&#39;m seeing boils down to &#34;scan each note and cut it when you receive it.&#34; And if everyone is going to do that, what&#39;s the point of using a physical note instead of an app? The promo images and descriptions clearly expect that this is going to be used like cash so that technical burdens are lessened for people who aren&#39;t good with more traditional cryptocurrency transaction methods.But if non-technical users use it like cash, they&#39;re not going to scan anything. And if you think you can teach them to scan every bill in their wallet with a phone, then... why not just teach them to use the phone?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, it&#39;s paper money, but one that won&#39;t survive heat or strong electrical fields, and that you need to use with your phone. And will lose all value if the central repository goes under. And is not recyclable or efficiently burnable.Top work everyone, nailed it."</p>
