This is just another &#34;how I installed kubernetes&#34; thing only without any real scale behind it.  There are other ways to deploy and run things, and it takes people toying around with alternatives for something unique to spring up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;A common question I get is about work/life balance. And I view it a little different too now. At Facebook I could get by barely working a few hours a day. But the job was so unsatisfying that it spilled the frustration in the “life” part&#34;This is the golden piece for me. I too recently left a big corp to a smaller place, expecting to sacrifice WLB and my free time - yet I ended up feeling happier and spending less time consuming short-form online contents, to the point that I even have more free time now! It never occurred to me that my self-indulging online addiction is actually a coping mechanism towards the unsatisfying and meaningless daily job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; At Facebook I could get by barely working a few hours a day.A note of caution that this is not the common Facebook experience. I joined being fully aware of their reputation for poor work life balance, but even then it was soul-crushing. The pressure to perform is near constant, consequences of not performing are real, and the bar for meeting expectations is very high to start with, such that externally hired senior engineers are frequently overwhelmed by the sheer amount of expectations.I was a manager there and got the distinct impression that the expectations bar was also rising over time. FB/Meta tends to hire the overperforming types, who put extra pressure on themselves to get those Exceeds and Greatly Exceeds ratings that come with real monetary rewards. The problem is you can&#39;t have everyone exceeding, not at the macro level anyways. So there&#39;s a real pressure on the managers with too many of those Exceeds ratings. The goal is to prevent a manager that misunderstands the expectations from giving everyone Exceeds, but the side effect is that over time there is a drift of expectations from Exceeds to Meets side. Having been with the company for so many years, the author likely did not notice this drift and was able to adjust over time naturally. Newer hires (which, given FB&#39;s rate of growth, is the large majority) aren&#39;t so lucky."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It always blows my mind how most interview in our field. When I first started in tech I was afraid to talk about not knowing leetcode to my peers. 15 years in and I now can confidently say I’ve yet to meet someone who thinks these are a valid metric.Why do we make this the gate keeper to our industry when we know (except for the very specific roles) we will rarely need leet code type problems. When we do we just google them.So silly to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve noticed in the past 2-3 months that results from StackOverflow, Wikipedia, and official programming language documentation sites seem to have been abruptly downranked. They used to typically be in the top 3 results for me for appropriate queries, but now they frequently aren&#39;t even on the first page."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the utility of generic search engines is coming to an end. Services like Google, Bing and DDG are numbered in usefulness.Instead, I am guessing (maybe hoping) that we see a return of the moderated directories, like Yahoo or DMOZ of old. A 2.0 spin on these directories, with lessons learned from all the years.Imagine that you just go to StackOverflow and search there directly for your answer. Want a funny laugh, go to your favorite comedy website (like facebook.com) and search directly. Want some news, go to CNN or Fox (depending on your persuasion) and fill your echo chamber.Not kidding. I think search as we know it is dead. And there is a new paradigm just sitting out there ready for the next generation to make.A directory of well known lists of websites with specialty search engines available on each."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a rather standard tech company model: you build a product so good it becomes indispensable, then you stick the customers in a vice and squeeze until all the money comes out. &#34;Produce the best search results&#34; hasn&#39;t been the guiding principle for a good decade now.&#34;Not growing is failing&#34; is the most toxic principle of modern business. There is a finite amount of people, of money to be made. Ever-increasing income is fundamentally impossible. When you can&#39;t increase revenue by further improving your product, you increase revenue by making the same product more profitable, which generally means a worse product. In the eyes of the business major, the ideal business is one in which all of your customers hate you not quite enough to stop using you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; 2FA tokens for all users worldwide were subsequently revoked to ensure the new infrastructure was in effect. We have mandatory 2FA policies on both the frontend and backend to protect users during this revocation phase, as outflows such as withdrawals have a requirement to setup and use 2FA in order to withdraw.How is this supposed to work? They revoked all of their 2FA for all accounts? Doesn&#39;t this just open them up to credential stuffing attacks? This is a really, really odd response to me. I can understand migrating to a new 2FA system, but they&#39;d have to re-establish the chain-of-trust somehow. Are they just hoping that users don&#39;t have compromised email/SMS accounts in order to enable the new 2FA system?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Boy this whole thing just reeks.&gt; No customers experienced a loss of funds. In the majority of cases we prevented the unauthorized withdrawal, and in all other cases customers were fully reimbursed.so which is it? no one lost funds or everyone that lost funds got paid back? where did that money come from?&gt; transactions were being approved without the 2FA authentication control being inputted by the user.the withdrawal system allows for non-2fa when its enabled, but informs the risk system when it happens? what kind of feature is that?&gt; While Crypto.com already performs internal and external penetration tests, Crypto.com has immediately engaged with third-party security firms to perform additional security checksah yes. the &#34;we already had 7 double checkers, better add an 8th&#34; solution. sounds like maybe the problem is not with the testing and auditing suite.&gt; releasing additional end-user security features as we move away from 2-Factor Authentication and to true Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)2fa isnt true MFA? did we evolve some new jargon im not aware of?&gt; WAPP is designed to protect user funds in cases where a third party gains unauthorized access to their account and withdraws funds without the user’s permission. WAPP restores fundswait i thought they said they already did this? are they gonna start charging for it now because they lost money?&gt; To qualify for the WAPP program, users must: Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transactionwtf is that? a PSK? a TOTP?&gt; File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; andhello, local police department? i need to file a report - my cryptocurrency wallet just had an unauthorized funds withdrawal. no, i dont have a suspect, or evidence, or any action for you to take. just come down here and write down that i said this happened please."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Worldwide Account Protection Program seems to be a way for Crypto.com to limit their exposure, while marketing it as &#34;protection&#34; for the customers.Around $34million stolen, 483 users affected. If the funds were spread evenly, then each user would have lost about $71k. But the funds won&#39;t be evenly spread (average). It&#39;s likely some users will have lost much more, and some much less.From the announcement, it looks like Crypto.com is making the users whole again;&gt; No customers experienced a loss of funds.This means that (in some cases) Crypto.com was on the hook for much more than $71k / user. The WAPP appears to put a series of conditions on the user, and introduce an upper limit to the amount that Crypto.com will return in the future.&gt; WAPP restores funds up to USD$250,000 for qualified users; terms &amp; conditions apply.&gt;     Enable Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) on all transaction types where MFA is currently available,&gt;    Set up an anti-phishing code at least 21 days prior to the reported unauthorized transaction,&gt;    Not be using jailbroken devices,&gt;    File a police report and provide a copy of it to Crypto.com; and&gt;    Complete a questionnaire to support a forensic investigation.This looks more like a mechanism to limit Crypto.com&#39;s exposure to future events than it does a policy to protect users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dislike Google and their products pretty much universally, but having this sort of thing done by a competitor is not just distasteful, I see it as verging on corporatism.Make a better product and beat them, don&#39;t use the fact that a government is banning them to upsell your own tracking software.All tracking is bad, from Google or not. I understand the &#34;companies need to make informed decisions&#34; argument but I disagree with it, mainly because tracking software is involuntary and it&#39;s in the interest of the tracking software maker and the company using it to make it as stealthy as possible.PS: What adds salt to injury is that you&#39;re using Google Fonts on this website.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This message is brought to you by&gt; PostHog is the only open source product analytics platform where customer data never leaves your infrastructure.Hosting my own Matomo installation I beg to differ. Matomo is open source and my visitors data never leaves my own server.Except they only do backend tracking and see https traffic from website frontend tracking reaching my analytics server as it &#34;leaves your infrastructure&#34;.But they at least made one thing obviously clear to me. I would never consider using them in the future.Also they are wrong factually. Google Analytics is not illegal in Austria. The court made this clear. Transmitting the IP without anonymizeIp is. Also transmitting PII data unencrypted to GA us (but GA does forbid that in their TOS as well).So not caring about the law when implementing GA and doing it just wrong is forbidden in Austria. Who would have thought. Using it correctly and adhering to data privacy best practices is just fine with GA."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"WASM being the “new k8s” is only one small fragment of where it is going to go. I think there is a good chance it’s going to become the defacto deployment target for a lot of software, so in addition to browser and server:- Plugins for desktop/mobile apps, wasm provides a nicely sandboxed environment for them.- Gaming, the combination of WASM and WebGPU will be the perfect platform for cross platform game development. I could see Steam, for example, creating their own runtime.- Embedded electronics, simplifying the development and deployment of IoT devices.When it comes to wasm on the server, it’s often talked about as targeting the “edge”. I believe this the next area of massive growth, however the part that I don’t think is fully solved yet is on the database side. If your server app is making multiple database calls from the edge to a central db there is a good chance that it will slower than a traditional (single location) deployment.What’s needed is a edge first database, we need at least read replicas to be at the edge with your app. Fly.io have something like this with their Postgres’s product. The alternative is to use an eventually consistent db such as CouchBD, but that causes other problems. I’m interested to see if CloudFlare do anything in this area as it’s the part of their stack that’s missing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think he understands what K8s is. WASM is the new Docker, but you still need something to manage/orchestrate/schedule all those WASM instances. What if your WASM process goes down, who will restart it? What if you need 10 extra instances to handle a traffic burst? How do you isolate associated WASM instances from the rest of the environment, and manage their access to/from the outside world? How do you provide them with configuration or credentials?You still need something like K8s, even if you&#39;re not using docker underneath . Indeed you can already use other runtimes under K8s, so what he is proposing is nothing new anyway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So be it!Until XyZ is the new WebAssembly and @!# is the new XyZ!As long as my Django backend works and browsers support my HTML/CSS/JS frontend, I am fine.I have the same LAMP (Linux, Apache, MariaDB, Python) SAAS project running for decades now, paying all my bills, letting me live a free life.As long as nobody touches that, you can do all you want. Invent new fancy stacks every other year, make courses for it, migrations to it, a religion of it - I don&#39;t mind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m making Windows/.Net based app for managing queues - QueueExplorer.
Started with MSMQ support back in 2005, now it supports Azure Service Bus, RabbitMQ and ActiveMQ. It&#39;s old fashioned perpetual licensing, so revenue is a rollercoaster. Because of that, it&#39;s emotional rollercoaster as well. Good thing is you get paid for full license at the time of purchase instead of collecting it in 10-20 months. Bad thing is every month starts at zero.Although .Net went multiplatform years ago, my app relies on WinForms a lot so it&#39;s Win only, except through Wine. I would love to support Mac as well but the only realistic option looks to be Electron based, and it would be a significant step back for my Windows users. Maintaining two different GUIs looks like a problem for micro company.The best thing about desktop software is it can&#39;t break for all the users at once like server-based app can. That gives some piece of mind when you&#39;re micropreneur. Sure, there are bugs, but they affect only users who downloaded buggy version. You can&#39;t crash all installed instances just like that.The worst thing is, it&#39;s hard to ask for a subscription.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Our company sells HW and SW for the dental sector.We have a desktop app that processes DICOM data to do implant treatment planning (where to place an implant in the patient jaw). Output is a STL file to print a drill guide for the oral surgeon to perform a guided surgery.Our desktop scanners for dental labs and our intra-oral scanners for dentists generate 3D meshes of the patients oral situation.Those meshes are the input data for the CAD/CAM Software my team builds. It is a desktop app for the digital design of dental restorations. The GUI is in javaFX and 3D visualization is done with OpenGL 4.5.Once the restorative Design is done, that app can generate many different output formats.

My app revenue eclipsed my iOS/NodeJS consulting in 2021 and I hope to double revenue in 2022. Read more at https://label.live/features.The tech stack for this app is really interesting (to me at least, natch). Lots of native node modules that need finesse on both macOS and Windows. I don&#39;t yet support Linux because out of thousands of users, only 2 people have emailed about Linux support (probably both from HN!).I really love building Electron apps. It&#39;s a total joy bringing something (albeit &#34;inefficiently&#34; wrt memory and &#34;native&#34; qualities) like this to market for a niche that&#39;s otherwise a dumpster fire of old and clunky 1980s-era Windows-only software.As for licensing, Label LIVE is licensed per computer. I wrote a custom license implementation leveraging JWT. The JWT is signed by my license server and the app verifies the signature and that the contents match the &#34;fingerprint&#34; of the computer being licensed, expiration, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of the Subaru BRAT in the early &#39;80s. There was a 25% tarrif on imported pickups. So Subaru added two plastic jump seats in the back of the BRAT, even making them face backwards. No seat belts as I recall just handles. They weren&#39;t even really intended to be used. They were just cheap plastic. But they served the purpose of making the vehicle a four-seater car instead of a pickup, with only a 2.5% tarrif.Tarrif averted, thousands sold!https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subaru_BRAT"</p>
