								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This post, and how it explains that there&#39;s 30 people working there now, made me realize that if I care about signal continuing (and I do, since I really like it, especially that it has a dedicated desktop client), that I should see how it makes money and whether that&#39;s sustainable.  Turns out it&#39;s donations, and now I&#39;m a donor through monthly charges through the mobile app.  I actually opted for that specifically because their web site noted that they can&#39;t give you a badge in the app if you donate online, and I thought showing the badge would be a good way for other people to see and inquire about, and hopefully realize they can donate too if they care to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just hope that moxie&#39;s replacement is someone with as strong a reputation for fighting for the principles at stake and the ability to defend them. How many people could have written the Cellebrite blog post? Probably not many. The hidden pressures on Signal staff must be enormous, as likely the the world&#39;s single most valuable surveillance target."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been a user and evangelizer of Signal (aka TextSecure and even RedPhone when the audio piece was split off as a separate app) for a very long time now. I admire the work that Moxie and the entire team have put in over all these years. Thank you all so much for the great work, whether it be writing blog posts rebutting the &#34;I have nothing to hide&#34; people or implementing open and secure-by-default protocols and apps that put privacy within reach of even the least technically-savvy among us!I hope the next adventure is as fruitful as this one was Moxie. Cheers!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A significant part of how YC thinks about this deal has not yet been articulated in the thread. (This is just my personal interpretation, not anything official.)Some comments are describing $500k as &#34;not much&#34;. Most people would gasp at hearing that. Only a tiny slice of humans are a position to think that way—for example, people who have family wealth (or maybe an elite educational credential) to fall back on, or who have already managed to break into the fundraising scene (or maybe a FAANG job) and have gotten used to comparing themselves to all the $multimillion deals they keep hearing about.A big part of what YC is about is to be a bridge for everybody else to enter this space—no matter who they are or where they live or what demographic they belong to. YC has a long track record, right from the beginning, of funding founders who never would be given a chance by more mainstream institutions [1]. The new YC deal is particularly important for these sorts of founders. Geoff said it in the post, but I haven&#39;t seen anyone pick up on this yet:We also hope that this deal will encourage more founders of any age and from every demographic group and geographic location to take the leap into the startup world.YC does that because it&#39;s in its business interests to do it and because it&#39;s good for the world. The idea that those two things go together, and that the way to maximize them is to help founders as much as possible, is in YC&#39;s DNA: https://www.ycombinator.com/principles/.Capital-rich climates notwithstanding, many founders are not necessarily in a position to step out of YC and raise millions right away. Geographic and demographic disadvantages don&#39;t suddenly disappear. (And let&#39;s not forget the disadvantage of just working on something weird.) Being in YC helps, of course, but all the same imbalances are still in play.For those founders, YC going from $125k to a $500k deal is a gamechanger because it gives them a lot more runway—more time to build, to grow, and prove what they can do, before stepping back into fundraising. Then they can hopefully raise from a position of strength instead of potentially having to accept less favorable terms.[1] Me, for example. I wouldn&#39;t be here right now if it weren&#39;t for that, and I could tell a long story about how most investors weren&#39;t interested in us even after we got into YC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The entire reason I didn&#39;t apply last season was because despite being my startup looking for funding, and despite us having our best traction to date (functional MVP deployed in big retail partner, making sales) - the $125k (minus the cost of uprooting our team and product to CA) was just a bad deal. We&#39;ve been in talks with some angel groups with 500K being the ask for the pre-seed, and that has been well received. So I think 500K is right on the money for now. It&#39;s a good change to see!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This makes it much easier to get to profitability[0] and never raise again after YC (especially as a SaaS). I wonder how this will impact the decision to raise money after YC.0 - Including paying the founders a reasonable salary"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would think Apple has some leverage to force it if they really wanted.If Apple really wanted to force the issue, they could tell T-Mobile no more iPhone contracts unless you do it. Apple can survive and thrive on fewer networks - the iPhone was AT&amp;T exclusive for a long time at the beginning.If that happened, there would be no way for T-Mobile to get a supply of iPhones. People would need to buy iPhones from Apple and then replace the SIM cards themselves. It would make T-Mobile bend pretty quickly unless they managed to get Verizon and AT&amp;T to join them on the issue.But then Apple has a second card to play, and that&#39;s the court of public opinion. If Apple wanted to make a public ad lambasting the carriers for undermining people&#39;s privacy, the damage would also force them to bend.Finally, of course, there&#39;s the fact that carriers need Apple just as much as Apple needs carriers. However, between the carriers and Apple, who has $200 billion in the bank to do things themselves if they wanted?Edit: Heck, T-Mobile has a market value of $130 billion. AT&amp;T has a market cap of $188B, and Verizon $223 billion. If Verizon and AT&amp;T joined T-Mobile in protest, Apple could theoretically attempt (or at least threaten) a hostile takeover of any of them. That would cause a lot of discussion among the carriers and send a strong message very quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think you should avoid T-Mobile if you can. Not just as a matter of principle, but also pragmatism. They have an extremely crude SMS censorship/anti-spam system [1] which even blocks links to lichess.org, the popular online chess website.They have poor security practices like storing passwords in plaintext [2], and they had a large data breach (probably about 100M customers affected) last year. [3]A̶n̶d̶ ̶n̶o̶w̶,̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶s̶e̶e̶m̶s̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶y̶ ̶a̶r̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶r̶o̶w̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶ ̶p̶r̶o̶t̶o̶c̶o̶l̶ ̶b̶l̶o̶c̶k̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶o̶o̶.̶PS: This isn&#39;t protocol blocking at the packet/port level, so I may have used &#34;protocol blocking&#34; a bit inappropriately. Apparently Apple allows the carriers to prevent people from enabling iCloud Private Relay, and T-Mobile is doing that. Apple is probably doing so due to the pressure by the carriers. In August, four carriers (Vodafone, Telefonica, Orange and T-Mobile ) signed a letter urging the European Commission to stop Apple from providing Private Relay. (According to a report by The Telegraph: https://archive.fo/BRUS4#selection-915.74-925.194) This, of course, still quite preposterous.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29744347[2]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16776347[3]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28192423 (The first comment by @jonathanmayer has a list of other recent T-Mobile security incidents)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Like I pointed out in the sister thread about EU telcos:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29875805Phone carriers do not want to be a dumb pipe - and having Private Relay go through their networks breaks:- HTTP header enrichment (which they use for self-care/customer sites/services),- zero rating (which they set up deals for with social networks, music streaming services, etc., often applying specific QoS tags) and- all sorts of value added services (many using deep packet inspection and DNS analytics) that they offer instead of raw, unfettered connectivity.I don&#39;t think many people are aware of exactly how much data telcos are sitting on, anonymized or not.And, of course, it also plays havoc with legal interception because there is no easy way to do MITM.(edit: readability)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been working as an ML Engineer for a few years now and I am baffled by the bar to entry for these positions in the industry.Not only I need to perform at the Software Engineer level expected for the position (with your standard leetcode style interviews), but I need to pass extra ML specific (theory and practice) rounds. Meanwhile the vast majority of my work consist of getting systems production ready and hunting bugs.If I have to jump through so many hoops when changing jobs I&#39;ll seriously consider a regular non-ML position."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ML/DS positions highly competitive these days. I don&#39;t get why ML positions requires hard preparations for the interviews more than other CS positions while you do similar things. People expect you to know a lot of theory from statistics, probability, algorithms to linear algebra. I am ok with knowing basic of these topics which are the foundations of ML and DL. But I don&#39;t get to ask eigenvectors and challenging algorithm problems in an ML Engineering position at the same while you already proof yourself with a Masters Degree and enough professional experience. I am not defending my PhD there. We will just build some DL models, maybe we will read some DL papers and maybe try to implement some of those. The theory is the only 10% of the job, rest is engineering, data cleaning etc. Honestly I am looking for the soft way to get back to Software Engineering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This book has fun problems! Example:During the cold war, the U.S.A developed a speech to text (STT) algorithm that could theoretically detect the hidden dialects of Russian sleeper agents. These agents (Fig. 3.7), were trained to speak English in Russia and subsequently sent to the US to gather intelligence. The FBI was able to apprehend ten such hidden Russian spies and accused them of being &#34;sleeper&#34; agents.The Algorithm relied on the acoustic properties of Russian pronunciation of the word (v-o-k-s-a-l) which was borrowed from English V-a-u-x-h-a-l-l. It was alleged that it is impossible for Russians to completely hide their accent and hence when a Russian would say V-a-u-x-h-a-l-l, the algorithm would yield the text &#34;v-o-k-s-a-l&#34;. To test the algorithm at a diplomatic gathering where 20% of participants are Sleeper agents and the rest Americans, a data scientist randomly chooses a person and asks him to say V-a-u-x-h-a-l-l. A single letter is then chosen randomly from the word that was generated by the algorithm, which is observed to be an &#34;l&#34;. What is the probability that the person is indeed a Russian sleeper agent?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"On the topic of &#34;who wrote this shit&#34;, I&#39;d really like to plug the idea that some of the most high-impact documentation you can write is a good commit message.Say you track down a bug, find a line of code that makes no sense, and `git blame` it, to discover that you wrote it yourself, 2 years ago. If the commit message is &#34;bugfix flaky builds&#34;, good luck figuring it out.If the commit subject rather, is &#34;bugfix flaky builds&#34;, followed by a message that explains what the flakiness was, why you think the change will fix it, what other bugs or limitations you were working around, and what upstream changes you might be waiting on that prevented further work, you&#39;re in a much better position. Suddenly you have a lot more context on what you were doing, why you were doing it, why you didn&#39;t do it better at the time, and in some cases it can even catch you from making an obvious but subtly-wrong mis-step.Similarly, if someone&#39;s confused by your code during code review, that&#39;s a great opportunity for either in-line comments, or commit messages, as appropriate.Unlike PR discussions, tickets, emails, slack threads, wiki pages, or photos of whiteboards, commit messages + git blame has an uncanny ability to be exactly the documentation you need exactly when you need it. Good git history practice can be one of the highest returning investments."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my first corporate job out of college (a NOC at an ISP) I was asked to update the documentation for troubleshooting quality of service issues. I checked our wiki for what was already there and it horrendous. I started to mentally thrash the person and was going to go confront them about it. When I checked the edit history I was greeted by a single edit and my username a week after I started the job.I learned a great deal of humility and compassion in that moment."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Email is in a funny space. Spf showed up. And although it meant some political fights when people expected to send email from anywhere, it was free to run in the dollar sense. Same with dkim.Dmarc is increasingly required to get past spam filters. And doing dmarc properly requires a reporting service. Either you run servers or use a hosted service like the one that created this page. That&#39;s fine for some business, but putting a cost on dmarc reporting and then making dmarc a heavy signal in spam filters is a huge pain for some scenarios.It&#39;s not highly expensive, but  on non monetized side projects it can frustrating how how much the internet expects you to have dmarc on every domain now."</p>

We&#39;re still very unclear on the long-term effects of COVID, after all.Couple that to daycare/preschool shutdowns: if there&#39;s a case in the class we&#39;ve got to keep our kids at home for a week. We both work. We can deal with it, lord knows we&#39;ve had to do it enough times already, but it&#39;s absolutely draining. And the stress of waiting/expecting the phone call from the school is always there, particularly in this Omicron phase where it feels like everyone and their dog is contracting it. And this comes from two parents that work from home. We&#39;re the luckiest of the lot!Pfizer has already announced their trial with under 5s was not successful and they&#39;ll have to restart. Moderna was supposed to close out a trial in late November but instead expanded it to hundreds of new participants. Why? Unclear. Last I saw no-one seems to be covering it in detail. Out of sight, out of mind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like COVID has become like a marshmallow test for adults, where those who can manage their emotions and make rational decisions can set themselves up for greater long-term rewards.It looked for a while there like this could be a thing that gets “done”—that we would get a good vaccine into enough people, then incidence would decline so far it just goes away.That didn’t happen. We’re stuck with it for a foreseeable future. Well, one can cry for the world that was, or one can get up and live in the world that is.We’re not going to be done with vaccines and mandates. And that does not have to be a big deal. I have had to prove vaccination status of my kid for schools and camps for years. It’s annoying but not any harder than keeping my car registration up to date or any other minor bureaucratic headache.I know someone who almost quit a great job because they were mad about a vaccine mandate from their employer. They were going to give up a good salary, great benefits, and a stable career because they were “so over COVID.” That is what failing the marshmallow test looks like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve gone through cycles with this. Mostly I am done arguing. I hate arguing about this. It&#39;s just more of the culture war shit that so many different media sources love pushing to keep people amped up.I double vaxxed and boosted. Stopped wearing a mask for the most part, but with Omicron I started wearing a mask again because I just don&#39;t want this stupid virus. I&#39;m healthy and would probably not have a symptomatic infection. But I still don&#39;t want this stupid virus, and I don&#39;t want to spread it.I think for 2022 I am going to try to argue less, and focus more on my areas of personal expertise. I&#39;ve done a lot of arguing and feel like I&#39;m generally worse off for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was very young I worked a tough job that had a mandatory union and it was quite terrible / weak.  Working conditions were pretty bad, physical labor, etc.  But it was not until I worked a job with no union that I realized every element of that job that didn&#39;t suck was due to the union.  For example we had supervisors but they didn&#39;t follow you around and micromanage you.  You were just expected to do your job.  If you didn&#39;t you would be reprimanded of course, but no one was on your case at all.  Supervisors had to show you a base level of respect: there were rules on that stuff.  There were a lot of rules, actually, and even though the union didn&#39;t have a lot of power I&#39;m pretty sure every single positive one, anything that gave employees even a sliver of autonomy and power, were things that the union fought for and got for us.I still was kind of anti-union after that.  &#34;Anti Union&#34; is the wrong phrasing, it was more... I was very suspicious of their structure, their own profit motive(s) etc.  People working for the union had it so much better than the people actually doing the work, and we were the ones paying for and funding it, right?  That aspect of it I never got over, but I now think that it may have been the wrong point of view.I have recently come around full swing and am 100% pro union.  And it is stories like this.  Starbucks, Google, Amazon, these companies will spend millions to fight unions.  This is prima facie evidence to me that unions benefit workers.  These companies all talk the same talk: &#34;we believe companies work best when team members can work directly with the company with no union in the way&#34;.  As though Amazon warehouse workers have some kind of communication path to improve their working conditions when they are being managed and fired by an AI.  What a buncha fkn BS.Things cost.  Good things cost money.  You are paying for someone to fight for your interests and not the company&#39;s interest.  Maybe that is worth paying for.  And if you don&#39;t pay money to a union to fight you pay with your physical health, your safety, your respect, your mental health.  If you work for Amazon you pay with your life when they threaten to fire you if you try to leave in order to hide from a hurricane.  We should all be in unions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people seem confused why a lot of tech people aren&#39;t pushing for unions.For me it&#39;s simple: Tech has brought me from near poverty to pretty darn wealthy. Why mess with that?Could a union help increase wages even more? Maybe. Are we being paid too little compared to our output? Maybe. But at the same time I&#39;m being paid more than I could have possibly imagined before I entered the field."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s a real shame that the middle and upper classes in the US have abandoned having their teens work in favor of various, expensive, college application boosting fluff.I went to work at McDonalds at age 15 and was part of a union. I have direct experience with what that is like. I don’t need to get my knowledge on the subject from flamewars between people pushing ideological agendas (most of whom themselves have apparently never had direct experience.)"</p>
