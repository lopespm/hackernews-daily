								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am Lithuanian; Lithuania&lt;-&gt;Taiwan&lt;-&gt;PRC conflict is frequently a topic of discussion these days among my peers.My position, shared by a few others, is that this is the next best thing that happened in Lithuania after leaving USSR: the first being joining NATO and EU in 2004.Everyone in the world can (and almost everyone do) endorse PRC. &#34;You won&#39;t get fired for picking IBM/Oracle/PRC&#34;. While very few countries have the guts and the internal political structure that allows opening a Taiwanese representative office. Lithuania shows that it prefers dealing with a country that takes the human rights into account; being the first one &#34;in the party&#34; to do so bring us significant advantages. Both Taiwanese investments and Lithuanian exports to Taiwan are picking up pace.This will hurt us in the short-term, sure. It already does: packages(/containers) from PRC are delayed or cancelled, invoices are not being paid, we are losing business there. In the long term, if we don&#39;t change our mind (not impossible), I think this is for the better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A Lithuanian hereMoral questions aside (as everyone here seems to focus on it), the people are split into roughly three camps: 
- Anti-vaxers: hate anything government because Vax-Pass, including the China oriented diplomacy
- Libtards: love anything government and worship the leader of the main party. They celebrate this and openly bash China because their Leader said that it is good 
- Non-involved people - worry about the economic consequences to businesses and people&#39;s lives. Most of them would have a hard time finding Taiwan (probably even China) on a blank map.In my opinion:Our Minister of Foreign Affairs went into this without really understanding what it would mean to the CCP and what possible counter-actions they can take. Lithuania was hit more than the politicians expected and we are, essentially, alone in this fight (save for endorsements and pats on the back). I guess that we will be in a pretty rough spot in short-term, while mid/long term can go either way depending on how the western powers and Taiwan will act."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks great, I love the clean GTK for this user interface. Say what you will about GTK and Gnome... for beginners on an operating system such as Ubuntu, having a consistent application concept is very important.Curious how this compares to Lutris[1]. I can see it has support for it as a runner, however as far as I can tell it achieves the same thing by maintaining separate wineprefixes.[1] https://lutris.net/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m confused...Crossover (a commercial product using Wine as its backend and contributes back to the Wine project[1]) uses the term &#34;bottles&#34; for its container-like method to install Windows apps on Linux and macOS. Is this an offshoot or extension of Crossover, or is it a blatant ripoff of their already existing service and name? Codeweavers (the makers of Crossover) have been using the term &#34;bottle&#34; in this paradigm since at least the late 2000s[2].[1] https://www.codeweavers.com/crossover#linux[2] https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/crossover-and-bottles.5..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like a replacement for ye-olde PlayOnLinux, which if I ever move to Linux Desktop[0] was going to be something I would write my own tooling to replace[1].It is not clear from looking over the website, but since bottles appear closely related to Flatpak I am wondering if they support being installed to a different path than the default. Flatpak doesn&#39;t allow you to do this in a piecemeal way[2], but it does allow you to set up more than one entire Flatpak environment to different paths[3]. I&#39;m hoping bottles can at least manage that?[0] There are dozens of tools on my list for this, mostly around application and container management.[1] I am a very vocal critic of the way Linux Desktop does things, but Windows is becoming worse at an alarming rate so it will probably be the least-worst option in a few years.[2] A regression from features we had in desktop OSs since the 80s.[3] Not that any GUI frontend for it pays attention to that. sigh"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; British soldiers in World War I were equipped with a Brodie helmet, a steel hat designed to protect its wearer from overhead blasts and shrapnel while conducting trench warfare. After its deployment, field hospitals saw an uptick in soldiers with severe head injuries.&gt; Because of the rise in injuries, British command considered going back to the drawing board with the helmet’s design. Fortunately, a statistician pointed out that the dramatic rise in hospital cases was because people were surviving injuries that previously would have killed them—before the introduction of steel the British Army used felt or leather as headwear material.I&#39;ve seen this same story except with warplanes during the War. Story goes that an allied air force tried to improve the percentage of planes that would return from a bombing raid, so they inspected returning planes, found the places where they had holes in them and added extra layers of steel to those areas for the next bomb run; but this had no improvement on the percentage of planes that returned.That is until a &#34;statistician&#34; realized that all of the places on the plane that they found holes in were actually parts of the plane that could get hit and survive and return. They then started adding extra steel to the parts of the planes they found no holes or damage assuming that if those parts were hit the plane would get shot down and not return. After this change they started seeing a dramatic increase in the amount of planes returning from a raid.Does anyone know the true source of these stories?Regardless, it really opened my eyes to how changing your perspective on the cause of the problem can help find the best solution, and to this day I still think of this story when solving a problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are three kinds of web developers:- Those who don&#39;t care about performance, as long as it loads within a few seconds on their own beefed up system on the LAN. This article is for them, and we can only hope they will listen.- Those who care about performance, and work for people who care. They are already doing great work (or are about to), producing those rare low-friction, high-speed, content-is-king sites which we all love.- Those who care about performance, but work for people who don&#39;t. Since the developer doesn&#39;t get to decide what to work on, they can either get cracking on feature #357, work on performance on the sly at the risk of losing their job, or quit. Not much of a choice, really, unless you have some other-worldly lax schedule and minimal oversight. And don&#39;t forget, if you are allowed to work on performance the burden is on you to prove how much faster things are with your changes (which can be really hard to show conclusively) and that your N days is worth more than Bob working N days on that sexy ticket #357.Substitute &#34;security&#34;, &#34;UX&#34;, or anything else you want for &#34;performance&#34;, it works the same way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh God yes.Back in the 20th Century, I was on a team for a major web browser. They were attempting to extend web browser technologies to crawl and cache web sites. The idea was to enable complex web experiences in a time when Internet service was analog telephone, 9600 baud.We worked for months on that. At the office. In Silicon Valley. On $6000 Compaq computers.When I returned home via my two-hour commute, I would try it: dial up and crawl, overnight, and surf around on the train to work the next day.I was the only person on the team to actually do this.I could understand that; after a 12-hour day of intense times at the office, the last thing most of us wanted was more of it, as soon as we got home.A year later, I was at an ad agency. Big clients, national brands. Everyone there used the very latest Macintosh machines. Those could be like $8000 each. Beautiful work in Photoshop, then stuffed into a web browser.They had a room with a few PCs, but nobody went in there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this sounds more like some sort of fingerprinting attempt. It good to see that random access to these kind of resources fails due to new(er) browser controls. However, this does not mean that the fingerprinting actually failed.There is probably some way to determine if the request was denied automatically by the browser or manually by the user (e.g., time to get &#34;response&#34;), which is definitely something which can be used for fingerprinting.Which reminds me of fingerprinting by tiny differences in the audio API provided by browsers [0]. Super interesting, but also a bit depressing. Also works for things like canvases and WebGL.EFF allows you to check how fingerprintable your browser is [1]. Do note that the results may not be very accurate.[0]: https://fingerprintjs.com/blog/audio-fingerprinting/[1]: https://coveryourtracks.eff.org"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is not google, but a third party ad network serving ads through google.Google tries to sandbox the creatives in an attempt to prevent issues exactly like this, and develops browser features to prevent issues exactly like this.This is likely a script that somehow avoided google&#39;s malware scanning pipelines.This is definitely not google&#39;s malintent.Disclaimer: Ex googler, worked in ads, dealed with problems like this all the time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is concerned that an ad might be able to surreptitiously turn on the camera or microphone, but these are not accessible by default. In this case, it isn&#39;t even getting as far as a permissions prompt because the default Feature Policy doesn&#39;t allow camera or mic access in cross-origin iframes. (Ex, for Chrome: https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/dev/Home/chromium-se...)   Instead, I think the most likely thing happening here is that an advertiser is running a script that is trying to do fingerprinting, and which is blocked by the browser protection.(That it&#39;s an iframe running on https://[random].safeframe.googlesyndication.com tells us it&#39;s an ad served through Google Ad Manager, and the contents of the iframe are supplied by the advertiser.)Disclosure: I work for Google, speaking only for myself"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people mocking the author or others for being scared and worried are basically blaming the victim here, and I would like them to stop.The nature of legal practices in the USA is such that the answers to &#34;Are you totally in the clear legally?&#34; and &#34;Will you lose significant amounts of money proving in random courts that you are in the clear legally?&#34; are often both yes.As a result, any researchers who send out thinly veiled legal threats as a &#34;research experiment&#34; are firmly in the wrong ethically, and should be called out by all the people to whom they have issued these veiled threats. Review boards that approved this experiment should be themselves subjected to an audit and potentially dissolved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone help me understand the ethical problem here? If I as an ordinary citizen contacted the webmaster with a similar worded email, the result would have been the same. The fact is that this “experiment” did not create any more or additional stress than is created for normal citizens/businesses simply engaging in normal legal activities. If submitting such a request has the potential to cause such undue stress, shouldn&#39;t society create protections or disallow such requests?Edit: It&#39;s not that hard to see that there are potentially some social problems here e.g. &#34;the message is easily construed as a legal threat&#34; or &#34;the message was mass mailed in a spam-like nature&#34;. However, my comment is in response to the title of the blog post which implies that the webmaster believes there&#39;s an ethical problem that this &#34;experiment&#34; was even run in the first place. For the purpose of this thread, assume the email was worded perfectly and the university was very thoughtful and deliberate in who they contacted. I&#39;m interested in discussing the ethics behind how a perfectly legal and reasonable thing can in one case be ethical and another case be unethical simply by virtue of the context in which the action was carried out."</p>

I can control them from Mac and Linux with hot keys that trigger the appropriate ddc commands."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lunar (https://lunar.fyi) supports up to 3 hotkeys to switch input using DDC.Also the functionality is completely free, the Pro license isn’t needed if you only switch inputs and occasionally adjust brightness or volume.This might be a more comfortable solution if your monitor allows input switching through DDC.https://static.lunar.fyi/img/input-key/1920_input-key.png"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An alternative approach that I&#39;ve taken is to have the HDMIs from my work desktop plugged into a capture card on my main Windows desktop. I then use the preview from OBS to see the display and also hear the audio. Still need a separate keyboard + mouse, but I like being able to move/minimize my work OBS window off to the side when I&#39;m not actively working.I also use this setup with gaming consoles so that I don&#39;t have to dedicate an entire monitor.https://github.com/obsproject/obs-studio"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well, it is a workers market right now.Professionally there is nothing special about me except that I really enjoy working, but for the last two remote jobs, the offer letter I received was more than what I verbally agreed on with HR. Since I am also 70 years old, I take this as good evidence of how pro-worker the job market is right now.I offer free mentoring (see my web site) and always talk about the importance to having a beginner’s/learner’s mind. I think that what companies want is: prioritizing the company’s interests, being flexible, and being observant looking for opportunities to improve the business. Fairly straightforward strategy.Good luck reaching your financial goals/salary number but also please remember money isn’t everything, and is much less important than our relationships with other people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You just need to apply for roles with public companies that offer liquid equity. Very few of us are getting 250k+ on base salary alone. Most of us have the salary bands you’re already in, but have additional equity pay on top. It doesn’t have to be a FAANG either. There are loads of public companies out there hiring engineers at 250k total comp."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Leverage.If your work improves the productivity of 100+ other people, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If your work saves $500k+ in annual costs, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If hiring you cripples key competitors, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If you can enable new revenues streams through knowledge that only you have, you&#39;re surely worth the price.If hiring you does not increase productivity, reduce costs, fend off competition, or bring in more revenue, then you&#39;ll be fighting an uphill battle to justify that salary. But if you do, talk about it. People gossip and those companies who have the biggest multiplier to benefit off your work will be working hard to reach you.In my opinion, remote or not is less important than you think. The key decisions will be based on whether hiring you at that price is a net positive for the company or not.EDIT: And if you&#39;re outside of the US, set up a local LLC so that US-based companies can treat you like an independent contracting business. That&#39;ll make it much easier to hire you across borders. And at that price, you can surely afford the $1000 annually for a tax advisor retainer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who has lead a devops team, and still has a devops team reporting to me, I have also struggled with the idea of having a team called devops, since it does go against the devops philosophy of devs owning their software in production.However, in our case (and probably many others), our devops team is responsible for creating and maintaining the tools and processes that allow the dev teams to manage their systems in production. At a larger organization, it doesn’t make since for each individual dev team to have to create and maintain their own deployment and management systems… that would end up with a lot of duplicated effort and a wide variety of systems that would need to be maintained. Devops creates the tools and procedures, and dev teams use them.You might say this is just sysops, but I think the key difference is that the dev teams are the ones who are using the production management tools, not the sysops team. Devops is not the ones who are paged if a system has an issue, the dev team who owns it is paged. Devops is only paged if the tool that the dev team is using to handle the issue has issues itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m frankly astounded at the complexity around modern development due to dev ops and how much worse developer experience is because of it.  I used to develop in a great IDE with debugging, right click re-run failed tests, I could follow the console right there in a nice, clean window integrated with my IDE, click on stack traces, etc.Now I&#39;m running my app via multiple docker images, trying to get a buggy remote debugger protocol to work (no local variables, wtff?) where I have to coordinate the container and the IDE, command line wrangling / using print debugging in the container to chase down stuff, digging around through multiple log files, copying-and-pasting stack traces into my IDE to analyze, which kinda works in some cases since the file paths are different, and on and on.DevOps came and took my nice dev environment away, and I am mad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had to basically give up my full time role as a Data Engineer who is supposed to solve &#34;big data&#34; problems (Storage, Streaming, Machine Learning pipelines) etc, and had to solely focus on DevOps because there was no other expert in the team.We (a colleague and I) basically learned Terraform, then Kubernetes, and then Helm in an extremely stressful environment. I wouldn&#39;t recommend that to most people. (Also, I can hear &#34;you don&#39;t need k8s&#34;, but tbh, it makes the difficult things possible, and that&#39;s what we needed).I&#39;ve done Ops in bare-metal environments before, and at least there, even if there were new skills to learn, the environment just wasn&#39;t so hostile for beginners, and the learning curve was simpler.The YAML (or heaven forbid, jsonnet) does *not* help. TBH, I&#39;m convinced if the IaC bits were done in a regular Java/Go/Rust SDK style instead of mixing and matching YAML glued together via labels and tags, I would have had a much easier time.The positive side of that is that now the IaC bits are mature enough that even the Data Scientists in our team write their own Terraform code, and I&#39;ve upskilled myself quite a lot. I&#39;m slowly going back to solving Storage/Data/ML issues, which I enjoy a lot more.Maybe I&#39;m just becoming a cranky Software Dev as I enter my 30s. I do _not_ enjoy reading YAML."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For me, the special part is truly viewing any job as just that: a job.I no longer assess my worth as a person as a function of job title, salary, or anything else.I take contracting work primarily and expect absolutely nothing more than a paycheck. Work is a transaction and I deliver what I can and am not a jerk.Almost every disposable penny goes toward physical fitness. My spouse happens to be cut from the same cloth, which is a big plus.We don&#39;t live extravagantly unless you count the money for fitness, but we consider that to be an investment and not a frivolous expense.Satisfaction in life for me comes from every angle EXCEPT my job, and that&#39;s my secret."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Use your career/job to support your life, then get a life. Become an artist, author, clown, or build some awesome technical system because you want it to exist. GPL it.Don&#39;t ask for anything, especially not happiness, from your &#34;career&#34;. I put it in quotes because it&#39;s conceptually bankrupt.https://www.roystonguest.com/blog/why-happiness-is-not-a-des..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will just add one point regarding health and sedentarism. Going completely remote saved about 2 hours a day from commute. This is big. This is not just 2 hours, but at the end of those 2 hours you won&#39;t be in a mood to do pretty much anything. I ended up working out for 30 mins and going on a long 90 min walk everyday. People tend to think 2 hours of physical activity is a lot and &#39;too much&#39;, but given how sitting oriented our jobs are - I don&#39;t believe this is the case. I don&#39;t even walk to get a lunch, once you wear a fitbit or some such device this becomes so clear how much of a sitting oriented life we have acquired. Also when I was monitoring weight, bp and other such parameters - nothing other than 2 hours made any dent. So 2 hours it is. Just wanted to add this perspective. Hope it helps."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m going to put some of the blame on the Denver government/police for this, but not for a lack of enforcement. If your bike is impounded or stolen and recovered it is nearly impossible to retrieve it. You cannot call to see if it was picked up. You cannot look for it online. You have to show up to their sketchy office during business hours, wait in line, and ask the guy to go look through all the bikes and try to find yours. With hundreds of bikes it almost certainly will not be found.The government auctions off some of the bikes and gives or sells the rest of the bikes to charity.Two years ago my bike was locked in a location it should not have been downtown along with many other bikes. When I came back to find my bike missing the police officer said all of the bikes were impounded. I called around, went to the impound place twice.. but my bike was never found.In short, great investigation work by bike index. But their efforts are hindered by the city."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In early high school, we&#39;d ride bikes to the local coffee shop, lean them against the big windows out front and hangout. Somehow, no one noticed when mine was snatched one evening. I was pretty devastated.My grandfather drove me around the town the next day to see if I could spot it. When we were about to give up, I noticed a bike leaning along side a house near the shop. I could see it from the street. It looked exactly like mine. It had the same replacement seat and even a curly bike lock coiled around the handlebars on the same side I left it. But it had been hastily spray pained.We called the police, they arrived and a kid inside noticed the commotion and came out. They had found the bike at the shop and took it. I went to inspect it. I was very surprised when I found the small yard behind the house was packed with around fifty bikes. To the cop, I said something like, &#34;there&#39;s tons of bikes back here!&#34; I then remembered another friend had theirs stolen as well.He didn&#39;t look for himself, and said I couldn&#39;t just take the bike. There was no proof it was mine. So, I said, &#34;what if I can unlock the bike lock?&#34; I could and was allowed to take it, but it had been ruined. My prized shiny bike had been banged up and spray painted.The following week my mother read me a letter that had arrived. The town would not be prosecuting the kid. I was confused. I did nothing wrong and stayed out of trouble myself. Did their actions not warrant any consequences?My mother ended up going to the police department and insisting the town prosecute, which they ended up doing. I&#39;m not sure what happened. Did the consequences dissuade them from stealing a 51st bike? Their family had failed them, would their community? If not for religion, what hope did they have?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I looked to see if they have been sentenced, but instead found this about the fence of the group:&#34;Adrian Rocha Chairez is charged with 31 felony counts including racketeering. Police say he headed up an organized crime ring responsible for more than a million dollars in damaged property and stolen cars and bikes. He was indicted in Denver, where a judge set bond at $500,000.A Boulder judge knocked it down to $10,000. He walked out even after prosecutors noted he had weapons and ties to Mexico.&#34;[0] https://denver.cbslocal.com/2021/12/08/boulder-pr-bonds-murr..."</p>
