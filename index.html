								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think my digital life would be a mess without an RSS feed reader. Because of its existence I do not need to touch Twitter, Reddit, YouTube[1], or any Mastodon instance, for example, as I can just have the updates that interest me from these networks in the comfort of my Feedbin[2] feed.While Hacker News does not provide an interface that notifies you when someone replies to you, hnrss.org provides an RSS feed for that[3], so I know when I get a reply. I also have a separate feed for Ask HN[4] and Show HN[5], so I never miss anything that may interest me, even if other people do not care about it. Heck, I found this post because it showed up on my feed reader!As a system administrator, I can use RSS to keep up to date with security issues in Ubuntu Server[6], WordPress[7], and CVEs in general, but also to follow commits in SourceHut repositories[8] and releases for pieces of software I use daily, but do not have repositories for my Linux distribution.I sure as heck hope it never go away.[1] In the YouTube case, with RSS, mpv, and youtube-dl, I never even have to see their web interface.[2] https://feedbin.com/[3] https://hnrss.org/replies?id=${YOURUSERNAME}[4] https://hnrss.org/ask[5] https://hnrss.org/show[6] https://usn.ubuntu.com/usn/rss.xml[7] https://www.exploit-db.com/rss.xml[8] https://git.sr.ht/~${USERNAME}/${REPO}/log/rss.xml"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve mentioned this on HN before, one pattern I&#39;ve noticed is a lot of sites tend to truncate their RSS feed so you have to click through to see the full article etc. This is mostly OK but kinda frustrating, as in the before-covid times I used to ride the London Underground a lot where no celluar signal is available in the tunnels - so my offline RSS reader would be useless.So I wrote a little web service accepts an RSS feed, and then crawls each link in it, parses the HTML to extract the text using one of those text extraction libraries, and then &#34;republishes&#34; a new version of the feed (with the full article) which I then subscribe to in my RSS reader so I can read the articles offline, e.g.example.com/rss?feed=foo.net/artcles/rssI&#39;ve never open sourced it though because I guess it&#39;s a bit of a grey area - the sites want you to go to the full URL so they can show you ads etc"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I provide an RSS feed for my blog. From my access.log, I see that there is a decent number of subscribers to my feed. Here is the data I could pull from it:  Feedly           91 subscribers
  Inoreader        16 subscribers
  Feedbin           6 subscribers
  NewsBlur          4 subscribers
  The Old Reader    3 subscribers
  BazQux            2 subscribers
  WordPress         2 subscribers
  -------------------------------
  Total           124 subscribers

I get about 4000-6000 hits to my website on a normal day. It increases by 5 to 10 times if a post hits the HN front page. When I publish new post, I see from the HTTP referer information in the logs that about 30 or so hits come from users who find a link to my post in their feed reader. These are very small numbers but they are good enough to keep the feed alive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A long time ago, due to an improbable sequence of events, I found myself teaching Computer Graphics at my alma mater, a year after I took the class myself. Over the following five years or so, my approach to the subject evolved, and I really got the hang of it.
After I stopped teaching, I took my notes, handouts and slides, and made them into a series of articles that I put on my website, where they remained in relative obscurity. Hacker News managed to find it every once in a while, and it was generally well received, but nothing came out of this. Until April 2019. It made the HN front page again [0], except this time it caught the attention of an editor in No Starch Press [1].Long story short, today I’m incredibly grateful and excited to tell you that CGFS is coming out as a real book, with pages and all [2]. The folks at NSP graciously agreed to let me publish the updated contents, the product of almost two years of hard editing and proofreading work, for free on my website [3]. But if you’d like to preorder the printed or ebook version, you can use the coupon code MAKE3DMAGIC to get a 35% discount at https://nostarch.com/computer-graphics-scratch.I’m still somewhat in disbelief that my work is getting published as a book, and this genuinely wouldn’t have happened without your support. So once again, THANK YOU :)[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19584921[1] http://nostarch.com[2] https://nostarch.com/computer-graphics-scratch[3] http://gabrielgambetta.com/computer-graphics-from-scratch"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have to say this looks really cool.Maybe this is a really dumb question, but as someone who really knows nothing about computer graphics, how can you actually run these examples?I realize that I could Google and research and find a list of &#34;canvas drawing tools&#34; in a variety of languages that I could then evaluate (despite, again, knowing nothing about graphics), but it&#39;d be SUPER-SUPER-awesome to have a quick note &#34;there are lots of ways to go about making these things happen in the real world, but here&#39;s one I recommend if you have no other priors.&#34; :-)Really cool book idea, keen to have a go at it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Coincidentally, just last night I was reading an issue of Byte magazine from 1976.  It was telling people how to do just this: Computer graphics from scratch.Except, back then &#34;from scratch&#34; meant soldering together wires and transistors and such.The big prize was displaying a vector Starship Enterprise on an oscilloscope."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey HN,I’m the author, Haven has been my side project for a little while.  The core idea is that we should be able to make it easy for anyone to host their own private webpage as an alternative to centralized social media.A lot of the decentralized community seems to have chosen federated models as the solution to “self-hosting is hard”.  I’m trying something different.  With core web technologies as the foundation, my mom or my wife’s grandmother can visit my site with any web browser and I’m still able to exclude the rest of the world.  For technical people, self-hosting is made easy with a one-line AWS deployment script, and an install script for the Raspberry Pi Zero W.  I’d like less-technical people to be able to use this too so I’m exploring providing paid hosting as a service.I think of Haven as a Facebook-alternative, but probably not a Twitter alternative.  I see Facebook as selling itself more as “stay in touch with your friends and family” where Twitter is more about “see what interesting people are saying”.  The latter has discovery as a core component.  With Haven everything is private so discovery wouldn’t make any sense.There’s nothing new here in terms of technology--server-side rendered web pages using Ruby on Rails, no javascript frameworks, RSS using HTTP basic auth.  But also no analytics libraries or ad-tracking.  Pages are lightweight and load really fast.  I’ve even provided a limited ability to add custom CSS so you can really make your page your own.I would love any feedback you want to share.  Both from a technical or installation side, feedback on the public webpage, as well as thoughts on communities that might be interested to learn about Haven.Thank you!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem I have with this is that it makes people create and manage an account. My 90 year old grandmother is not gonna manage that.I made a little hack for wordpress that lets you run a wordpress blog and have a shared security question that lets people access content. A simple question like &#34;What is the name of the family dog?&#34; or &#34;What is grandpa&#39;s nickname?&#34;, something like that. Not industrial strength security, but enough to keep it sorta private and out of search.The nifty part is that with wordpress and Jetpack, people can sign up for posts by email, so every time you post, your friends/family can get an email with the updates. No need to even visit the blog. Perfect for grandma.Here&#39;s the two files that make it work, in case anyone is interested:
https://gist.github.com/justinph/f0fb937d1ee418a45bfb85e91e4..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love the idea. We&#39;ve got kids and try to keep their likenesses off the public / data-slurping internet (Google, FB/WA/Insta, etc) by sending photos to friends and family via Signal.The downside is that everything&#39;s ephemeral. I&#39;ve long thought there was room for a private network where you can pub/sub to people you care about.  Sort of a simple and private Livejournal / Blogger.FWIW I think the self-hosting bit isn&#39;t where the opportunity is.  It&#39;s in hosted private sharing. One thing I&#39;d do is create landing pages for people who want to share privately and have $$. Parents are the first group that comes to mind.I wish you success - the world needs what you&#39;re doing!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Arrow is the most important thing happening in the data ecosystem right now. It&#39;s going to allow you to run your choice of execution engine, on top of your choice of data store, as though they are designed to work together. It will mostly be invisible to users, the key thing that needs to happen is that all the producers and consumers of batch data need to adopt Arrow as the common interchange format.BigQuery recently implemented the storage API, which allows you to read BQ tables, in parallel, in Arrow format: https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/storageSnowflake has adopted Arrow as the in-memory format for their JDBC driver, though to my knowledge there is still no way to access data in parallel from Snowflake, other than to export to S3.As Arrow spreads across the ecosystem, users are going to start discovering that they can store data in one system and query it in another, at full speed, and it&#39;s going to be amazing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excited to see this release&#39;s official inclusion of the pure Julia Arrow implementation [1]!It&#39;s so cool to be able mmap Arrow memory and natively manipulate it from within Julia with virtually no performance overhead. Since the Julia compiler can specialize on the layout of Arrow-backed types at runtime (just as it can with any other type), the notion of needing to build/work with a separate &#34;compiler for fast UDFs&#34; is rendered obsolete.It feels pretty magical when two tools like this compose so well without either being designed with the other in mind - a testament to the thoughtful design of both :) mad props to Jacob Quinn for spearheading the effort to revive/restart Arrow.jl and get the package into this release.[1] https://github.com/JuliaData/Arrow.jl"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great work! It makes me wonder if a few things could be possible:1. Make the surface of the ball a multitouch trackpad surface so you could pinch zoom in and out and two finger scroll up and down, all on the ball itself. Make it only work when the ball is not pressed on hard enough to move.2. Make the ball slightly squeezable, which registers as a click. That way you could roll it around on your desk or on the base. This honestly would also be a great kids computer toy so they don&#39;t have to get their hands near the device itself.3. Add electromagnets inside on all sides and place the ball on a magnetic trackpad or base. When squeezed it would turn on the downward-facing electromagnet in the ball to make it harder to move, so you could engage in finer detail work.Probably a materials challenge to do any of these but it would be really cool to see these new input frontiers explored."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The more absurd thing is criticism of Yellen on this part is being defended - by the White House press secretary no less - as a woman&#39;s right to use her skills to make money. Yes, women should absolutely be able to rise to their talent and ambition, but it&#39;s a clear conflict of interest for government official. It&#39;s a disingenuous use of the most vacuous forms of language to defend open corruption.But then again, if we wanted finance experts to chair the Fed and be the treasury secretary without any prior monetary relationships with banks and hedge funds, we would probably have just some academics. A lot of academics in economics/finance get paid for legal testimony on behalf of companies and such, too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regulatory capture is a gigantic problem, especially in finance.It’s obvious that we don’t have the right incentive structure with the SEC, either. If you can make 20x more using the skills you’d need to investigate companies trading instead, the talent pool is reduced to those motivated by power/ideology. I’ve always thought financial regulators should have some kind of incentive structure that closes this gap but it’s not clear how to do that without skewing the enforcement priorities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Do things because you have genuine interest in them... Don’t start out with a singular goal of making money.I really hate advice like this. Have you ever seen a business before? Have you ever met a person? Pretty much no interests are monetizable and almost all companies are doing really boring work. I don’t believe anyone in the world is truly passionate about things like payroll software. If I followed my interests I would be homeless.The whole “if you want to do X, you have to not be doing it for X” attitude is useless and doesn’t give any actionable advice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;The nice thing about options is that there isn’t just one way to lose money. No, you can lose money in many different ways – far more than I can write on this page.This is the most important lesson of options. It&#39;s never just a coin flip. You have an unimaginably huge number of factors riding against your success. It&#39;s not even remotely close to a 50/50 win/lose scenario. There are a million ways to lose, and just a few narrow ways to win. You literally have better odds going to the roulette table and placing a bet on red."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Building an online course[1] has been one of the easiest ways to make money in my personal experience. Other things I&#39;ve tried building: SaaS, Trades business, Freelancing business.I&#39;ve made over $8k since I launched last month and it&#39;s been a great stepping stone into other ideas. The main problem I see going forward is getting consistent traffic. Building the course was the &#34;easy&#34; part and now I&#39;m focusing hard on SEO to keep consistent traffic going to my page. Long term I think I can make $100-$300 a day with it.I floundered trying to build SaaS and other types of business for years before making some money online. Selling a one time purchase can be a game changer for those looking to go independent. Look at the stairstep approach[2] for reasons why this works so well.Overall, if you invest a few days and put something out there, I think an online course can be a great way to build some income.[1] https://www.vim.so

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Failure with one of the engines on re-light: https://twitter.com/MurkyWanders/status/1356703469986586626&#34;I bet they needed that.&#34;As others have noted, SN10 is standing by.  Somewhat uncomfortably close by: https://i.imgur.com/F9rsBbD.pngIt&#39;s so exciting to be a spectator of these events."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is my favorite footage so far, by Cosmic Perspective: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ep8XJanoFgwThis is 4k slow motion and it is gorgeous. The giant sheets of stainless steel floating down at the end are noteworthy, among other details.Michael Bay has nothing on Cosmic Perspective + SpaceX."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love seeing these tests for two reasons:1.) Experiencing history in the making, especially knowing that the SpaceX team will eventually get it right.
2.) Realizing that even the best of the best have repeated failures and need to rely on iteration to get &#34;there.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is such a shame that nowadays even these high priced devices are contributing to the enormous e-waste we are all piling up.It used to be like this: You spend A LOT of money for really nice headphones and use them (potentially) your lifetime. Or hand it down to your kids as your hearing gets worse. Sound doesn’t change much and the plug has been around for ages.Nowadays it goes like this: You buy your expensive Apple headphones. And even though Apple is probably supporting these longer than your average earbuds, after a while the bluetooth version will be obsolete and eventually the battery will have reached its end or inflate and become a safety risk.But because this was expensive and Apple supported it longer, it will have maybe lasted 10 years and one or two (pricey) battery replacements. This is still much worse than audiophile „analog“ headphones and I feel like this change is not adequately addressed.I would really hope to see more approaches like Shure‘s „Aonic 215 True Wireless“ which is an arguably quite ugly attachment to the drivers that have been around for a long while and just adds the wireless capabilities and bluetooth. It can also be used for any other Shure driver afaik. This way you keep the good old sound producing piece while swapping out the stuff that will degrade over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a detailed, well-written review, but like most mainstream headphone reviews it makes me cringe a little. Though masked somewhat by self-deprecating remarks, there&#39;s audiophile &#34;woo&#34; peaking out from behind the corner (e.g. the comment about lossless compression). More importantly, it&#39;s missing the most important part of a headphone review: a measurement of the frequency response curve!It&#39;s fairly well known that above the ~$100 price level, headphone sound quality differences mostly disappear once equalized properly [0]. The real test is not stock AirPods versus H9i (as done in the review), it&#39;s AirPods versus H9i once they&#39;re both equalized to a common frequency target. Otherwise you&#39;re testing the manufacturer&#39;s tuning as much as the actual quality of the hardware.Certainly, there&#39;s something to be said for the manufacturer getting it right in the first place so you don&#39;t have to bother with EQ when listening on a mobile device, etc. But I think the following two points are likely true:1) People will score the AirPods highly in subjective listening tests;2) The performance in those listening tests has more to do with the frequency tuning of the AirPods than anything about its hardware, and you could get a virtually identical listening experience with a $100 to $200 pair of Sennheisers and an EQ app.[0] See e.g. http://seanolive.blogspot.com/2017/02/twirt-337-predicting-h.... Sean Olive has a bunch of papers on this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;It is, therefore, my sworn duty to be skeptical of consumer technology companies encroaching on the territory of high-end audio equipment built by companies with decades of experience.&gt; but their track record with audio hardware is inconsistent. Somehow, the company that makes the HomePod—a marvel of mono speaker engineering—is also the company that continues to make and sell Beats products.When Beats were acquired by Apple. Especially with Jimmy Iovine in charge of Apple Music ( initially ). I was extremely worried that any of the crap Beats made infect Apple&#39;s Audio. Turns out Apple has Firewalled their department pretty well. I remember reading one of the story about HomePod team asking Jimmy Iovine&#39;s opinion on its audio quality. His reply was his usual &#34; You need more Bass&#34;.Apple audio engineering teams consist of many engineers from Bowers &amp; Wilkins . One of my favourite brand in Audio Equipment. ( I think, I could be wrong, Steve Jobs likes Bowers &amp; Wilkins too ) And you should notice their taste of Audio have many similar traits.So Beats continue to make crap, they did improve somewhat since Apple&#39;s purchased them. And Apple, continues to be Apple.But that is only with Audio, the AirPods Max Hardware Design is very much modern Apple and non-Bowers &amp; Wilkins. The weight and comfort issues. Something about Apple&#39;s Design Department changed ever since Steve Jobs is not there to be the Editor to edit things. Things like Keyboard, TrackPad or Headsets. User Comfort and usage are no longer the 1st priority. Instead it is aesthetics and design goals, that could be material ( the need to use Metal ), thinner or colour.Design is how it works, not how it looks. Hopefully recent Mac changes meant they learned a thing or two."</p>
