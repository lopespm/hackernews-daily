								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Around 6 or 7 years ago, I went to a quantum computing conference and presented about a then newly developed quantum programming language that could run on a real quantum computer, showing a 1/2 decent simulation of dihydrogen energy in terms of bond length.I authored a paper about this quantum programming language but had no way to post it to the arXiv. I&#39;m not a traditional academic, but I had posted on the arXiv before, long ago, at a previous job. Problem was that my arXiv credentials were associated with that job&#39;s long lost email.I gave the presentation in a giant ballroom, and afterward, sat down at my assigned spot at one of these large circular tables. Next to me, during a brief coffee break, an old man I didn&#39;t recognize told me my talk was very interesting, and asked me if my paper was published yet. &#34;Not yet; we haven&#39;t chosen a journal. And posting to the arXiv is delayed, because my account is locked, so a colleague is planning to post on my behalf.&#34;The man responds, &#34;Oh, it should be possible to fix that.&#34; I said that I figured as much and have just procrastinated contacting the admins. &#34;They&#39;re at Cornell right?&#34;He said, &#34;No, I mean, I can fix that. You said your name was Reikon Musha right?&#34;He opens his clunky laptop and continues, &#34;I&#39;m not supposed to do this. But I&#39;m certain that if you gave an invited talk here, you&#39;re definitely not spoofing your name. Maybe you can show me your ID? No, no, just kidding.&#34;He continues clicking around. &#34;Was xyz@example.com your old address? What&#39;s your new one?&#34; I answered yes, and gave him my new address. He typed it in and said, &#34;straight into the database it goes; just go and reset your password now.&#34;I was absolutely puzzled. I said, &#34;Thanks?? Who are you?&#34;He says, as a matter of fact, &#34;I&#39;m Paul, I invented the arXiv.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many years ago (think: 1994) scientists (mainly CS folks) published papers on the web as postscript files.  Actually, they were usually on FTP sites, not the web, as almost nobody used the web at the time.  I developed a huge aversion to postscript (it was clunky and the renderers weren&#39;t great) but the idea that every bit of published science would be freely available on the web seemed completely and totally obvious to me.When I later became an academic, I learned that when you write a paper and submit it, conditions for publication typically include signing away the copyright to the journal, possibly with a license to distribute a few preprints offline.My advisor at the time pointed out that he actually modified the contract (changing the terms to retain copyright), signed it and sent it back (no journal ever complained, and all his papers are available as PDFs online).arxiv is the closest thing to what I dreamt of some decades ago and I&#39;m thrilled that Paul is receiving recognition.  Personally, I think arxiv is a better path forward than scihub, entirely due to its &#34;legitimacy&#34;.  In the future, I will always work to &#34;publish&#34; on arxiv and not put my work in journals (fortunately, I am not in a publish or perish situation).My only complaint is that I don&#39;t particularly like PDF and wish there was an HTML-zip format that could be sent around and the browser did all the rendering work, while the udnerlying data tables are stored in well-defined formats so they can be programatically extracted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Nobel Prize in Physics often goes to &#34;tooling&#34; experimental work.  Think: blue LEDs, CCDs, fiber optics, optical tweezers, things like that.  Not that anybody asks me, but I would advocate a similar tooling award split between Berners-Lee (www), Knuth (TeX), and Ginsparg (arXiv).  I can think of no people who had a more profound change in how physics is actually practiced."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a famous Pieter Bruegel painting from 1562 called &#34;The Triumph of Death&#34; that someone contrasted with a &#34;typical scene in a US department store on Black Friday&#34; here[1].It might take a few seconds to tell apart the painting from the Black Friday store. ;-)        • • •

The original painting[2] has a gem[3] in the corner of it (that&#39;s not visible in[1]): where death is wreaking havoc, and a pair of lovers, oblivious to it, are playing guitar and singing.  In that frame, you&#39;ll see death also playing guitar right behind them, in a neat visual rhyme, implying that their fate is sealed too.[1] https://www.devblog.no/sites/devblog.no/files/styles/800px_w...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Triumph_of_Death[3] You have to zoom into the lower right corner to see it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Triumph_of_Death#/media/Fi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having worked in the bowels of a major online retailers networking team during black Friday sales, I can say that a lot of the patterns you see in this UI are real. People do indeed get out of bed at ungodly hours of the morning to get two bucks knocked off a stereo."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s so interesting watching this get picked up by the news.Many aren&#39;t aware but interestingly these variants are identified and designated in the open on GitHub, here is the GitHub issue for this B.1.1.529 designation https://github.com/cov-lineages/pango-designation/issues/343. I&#39;ve recently started watching this repo as it&#39;s quite interesting reading about the different variants popping up across the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever you hear news about mutated COVID and how fast it spreads there are a few important things to remember.1. Viruses are constantly mutating, its kind of their thing.2. Most mutations do absolutely nothing or are actually harmful to the virus.3. When a new mutation is noted to be spreading fast its usually because of the nature of super spreader events and not because the new mutation is more or less transmissible.4. Scientist and health officials should absolutely be keeping an eye on these things.[0] Vincent Racaniello - SARS-CoV-2 UK variant: Does it matter 
https://youtu.be/wC8ObD2W4Rk"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really simple: If this new variant does nothing more than previous versions to increase mortality, particularly among the increasingly vaccinated population, obsessing over its spread should be considered pointless and absurd. For one thing, it wouldn&#39;t work without endless other streams or authoritarian security theater measures (that in any case themselves don&#39;t really work most of the time) And for another thing, &#34;stop the spread&#34; is an idiotic notion without heavy qualification. Stop death? Sure, Stop large quantities of hospitalizations? That too, albeit with cost/benefit calculations applied to all measures, but stopping spread itself for its own sake? Absurd paranoia that has no merit the moment the thing spreading stops being a truly widespread threat. We have lived with colds and flus for all our history without obsessing over their spread. COVID among those who are already immunized or vaccinated is comparably dangerous to common flu strains."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using PHP since 5.x. Often had to work on older 4.x web apps. I find it interesting when I read people saying &#34;PHP has come a long way. It&#39;s a proper language now, etc.&#34;If you work long enough with a language and figure out most its quirks, it&#39;s a breeze. It&#39;s nice that they are adding all these new features, but they are hardly what makes it or break it for me.Here is the one features that is taken for granted in &#34;modern stacks&#34;:Edit file -&gt; Alt+tab ctrl+R. Oops, Alt+tab fix -&gt; Alt+tab ctrl+R.When debugging I can do that 50 times a minute. With my react app, I can do it maybe 5 times a minute. With my golang app I&#39;m lucky if I can do it twice a minute."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone laughing at PHP hasn&#39;t tried it for years, I&#39;d bet.
It started clumsy, true, but it became a solid and quite elegant way of doing things.And by things I don&#39;t mean just web development.The current limitations I see in PHP is that there is not an official multi-core coroutines solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use C#, Javascript and PHP a lot.PHP always wins when it comes to deployment and productivity. In my opinion that&#39;s the power of PHP.It&#39;s also versatile. I used it for small projects, multi-million € projects, COM-port communication, API communication, prototyping and what not.The syntax is not great, but to me PHP is this multi-tool that just gets the job done and will run reliable for years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They bury the lede in the last fucking paragraph.  The reason this toaster is immensely better than the toaster you have at home is very, very simple: this toaster&#39;s 1949 price would be hundreds of dollars in 2021 terms.You can still buy really, truly excellent toasters made for industrial/commercial use, or for the homes of the very rich, and they&#39;re quite a lot better than the trash people keep in their houses.  And they cost a lot more, too.  Last time I checked, a commercial 2-slice toaster was in the $300-$400 range.This is true for lots of home appliances.  My favorite example is the Kitchenaid mixer.  The modern mixers are very thoroughly &#34;value engineered&#34; to keep the price down.   If you want to buy an original &#34;Kitchenaid,&#34; like they made in the 1930s, you can call up Hobart and buy a miniature mixer.  And it will cost you ~$2,000 in 2021, just as it did in 1935.You can have the good toaster, the good mixer, etc, but it sure looks like people don&#39;t actually want that.  The pattern of product offerings in your average store suggests people want something affordable, and it doesn&#39;t particularly matter whether it is good at its job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since everyone is mentioning Technology Connections (he deserves it, great channel), I want to bring up this video:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UiS27feX8o0To me, this really shows the sad direction smart appliances have gone in. I would love to see that smart appliances would have continued to evolve in this direction. I don&#39;t like the current state of smart appliances, but going back to the absolute basic seems like an over-reaction to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"His whole channel (called Technology Connections) is probably my favorite one on YouTube, can’t recommend it enough!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As Java is generally the fastest GC&#39;d language, what&#39;s the current state of Java gamedev?Once upon a time, this indie Java game called Minecraft became the most successful game of all time.But from the few minutes of research I just did, Java cannot be deployed to many commercially important systems  - Nintendo Switch
  - PlayStation
  - iOS

It appears Java is only still viable for Windows and Android, and the 1% Linux desktop market.There used to be the GCJ project which would in theory let you run Java anywhere you had a C/C++ compiler, but Oracle&#39;s litigiousness killed that because the Java[TM] &#34;platform&#34; must run the official Java[TM] bytecode.It appears C# via Monogame lets you deploy to all desktops (Win/Mac/Linux), mobiles (iOS/Android), and consoles (PS/Switch/Xbox). So ironically C# seems to now be the &#34;write once, run anywhere&#34; fulfillment of the original Java promise.[EDIT: grammar.]"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for the great article! I wished the section on DeFi addressed the biggest elephant in the room, overcollateralization. A DeFi borrower always needs to lock in more assets as collateral than what they are borrowing, thus defeating the whole purpose for taking a loan aside from financial speculation. And there&#39;s no real way to solve it: all mechanisms I&#39;ve heard of either try to replicate some form of background checks on borrowers (not decentralised, and uses the real world), or claim to use real-world assets as NFT collateral (once again, uses the real world). Thus I can&#39;t see a way for DeFi loans to ever be used for mortgages and other loans regular people actually need.Of course DeFi is more than just loans and borrowing, but that&#39;s an aspect that&#39;s constantly promoted by evangelists so I think it&#39;s an important point to mention."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Web3 requires retrofitting the web to use blockchain technologies to do what the web can mostly do already.In &#34;Blockchains Are a Bad Idea&#34;, James Mickens gives several arguments against blockchain-based systems like Bitcoin:See his presentation here: https://youtu.be/15RTC22Z2xI1. People have out-of-band trust relationships in real life which reduce the likelihood of malice. Bitcoin-style anonymous identities undermine trust relationships and are not needed for legitimate (not illegal) transactions.2. Real life legal systems encourage good behaviors. If you have a dispute with someone, you can sue them. Bitcoin and related systems lack these protections.3. Existing tools such as public-key cryptography and digital signatures can provide most of the functionality that applications need without the problems that blockchain-based systems have."</p>

I also use the internet for higher level things like how memory management works on some system, or how something like an ECS architecture works. I also spend a lot of time looking for the right components to put into my own systems, so if GitHub were down it would bother me.Basically I&#39;d be useless without the internet. The coding tools themselves, all the examples of how to use them, and all the actual knowledge about how everything works is on there.Perhaps the only thing that&#39;s actually my own input is the judgement about what things are important, which sources are reliable, and which people are authorities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally, I&#39;m starting to identify a lot of cases where looking things up in an external resource is a deeper mental disruption than remembering it, even if the lookup is just as fast or even faster.  (Or, it&#39;s possible that the external lookup only seems faster because the several mechanical steps compress my perception of time, like keyboard navigation can seem faster than the mouse, even when it isn&#39;t.)For example, I find that when I&#39;m working with an API enough that I am frequently looking up the same operations, investing twenty minutes in identifying and reviewing the important operations, as if I were preparing for an exam where I wouldn&#39;t be allowed to consult external resources, pays off in fluency and immersion.Another example is that when I am reading a history book, before I start, I review relevant names and contemporary dates.  Then when I find myself thinking, &#34;Wait, at this time, how long ago was X?  Has Y happened yet?&#34; I can answer from memory.  This gives me a richer reading experience than if I needed to remove myself from the context of the book to look up those dates.I know memorization is seen negatively from a pedagogical standpoint, and schoolchildren find it alienating and discouraging, but I think when you have enough experience to understand the value of it, so that the work to achieve it isn&#39;t such a negative experience in itself, judicious application of it has a lot of power to make your work easier and your learning experiences richer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started developing software in the days before the Internet. It was indeed very different. My choices about what to remember and how I remember things have changed significantly since the ubiquitous availability of searchable information. I no longer have tomes of K&amp;R, processor manuals, Inside Macintosh or Java books on my desk. The only technical book which happens to be on my desk at the moment is &#34;Anti-patterns&#34;.I have been &#34;weeding&#34; my paper books, especially technical books over the last couple of years and gotten rid of an entire bookshelf of books. I still have an entire bookshelf with Knuth TAoCP, math books, type theory, graphics, graph theory, control theory, physics and some nostalgic books like my original Motorola 68000 processor guide, Rodney Zaks Z80 book, &#34;Adventure game programming in BASIC&#34;, Commodore 64 Innerspace Compendium, etc.When a puppy chewed up my copy of &#34;Linux in a Nutshell&#34; I was tempted to buy the new edition but decided to try it online for a month with O&#39;Reilly Safari through work and have not bothered to replace the paper copy for more than 2 years.I would categorize the main change in style of memory as a shift from focus on remembering details and facts, which I can look up, to using memory for decision trees, processes and methodologies which either can&#39;t be looked up or are significantly personally customized. I consciously &#34;outsource&#34; the simpler and to me, less valuable, aspects of memory. Some of this is handled automatically by the IDE I use and the rest is done with mostly Google searches."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In that same time period, my &#34;plant light&#34; timer, a $15 mechanical item of a design unmodified since the 1970s, has worked flawlessly, requiring attention only when the clocks change or my schedule does. It has not informed Google, Amazon, or anyone else about its job or anything else in my home. It has generated no royalties nor invoked any support or ongoing maintenance costs. It has never needed a software upgrade.&#34;Smart Home&#34; stuff even since the &#34;x10&#34; standards has been a solution looking for a problem to solve. A hobby for the homeowner who wants to ride the high side of the Laffer curve in effort and expense. It could be argued that quiet, flawless functioning of these products would be exactly what the customer doesn&#39;t want in this product space.Compare it to model trains: is that hobby focused around having a lovely little table set up and watching the trains run? Or is the actual focus the torn up mess that&#39;s under construction and &#34;we can&#39;t play with it right now but i can get it assembled to show the kids by Tuesday&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did my whole house in Lutron’s smart switches (close to 50 of them), and I think it’s good? It’s been about 2 years now and I really haven’t had any issues.The switches aren’t Wi-Fi connected, because Wi-Fi would be an awful choice for 50 devices that you only communicate with a few times a day. They use their own wireless frequency and communicate in a really simple/reliable way to the bridge, which is wired to my router and doesn’t need an internet connection to work.There’s no always-running cloud service, the light switches work even when the internet is down (and I can still use the home app too in such an event, just no voice control.)Siri is finicky sometimes, but I’d wager a 97% success rate in saying things like “set the scene Evening Downstairs” and “turn off all the lights except in the bedroom.”My favorite aspect is that the pico switches can be programmed to switch whole rooms of lights on and off, which makes it so much nicer in the basement where I have 18 different lights to turn on and I can just hit one switch on my way downstairs and it’s fully illuminated (no voice command necessary) and I don’t have to visit 18 light switches to turn them off again.Home automation tech must be invisible and fall back gracefully, and must always be interact-able in a “dumb” way, or else it’s just playing games IMO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think any software engineer with some industry experience will absolutely NOT install a device in his home that receives automatic updates over the internet and is critical for performing some task or using some basic functionality of the house; especially one that has a well known, highly stable and ergonomic traditional mode of interaction - controlling the lights and water, opening the windows and shades etc.We know from experience that a nebulous interface that can change without notice and provides no clear contract is a asking for trouble and will break your house &#34;build&#34;, so to speak, or worse, it will bork at the worst possible moment, when you have &#34;clients&#34; over.In the early years of home electricity, there was a much higher chance of getting electrocuted or burning to a crisp, outlets had no grounding, insulation and conductors were of a bad quality etc. Similarly, the whole field of home automation is in its infancy, in a few decades most major mistakes will be made and early adopters will work out the kinks out of the technology (and find out why it&#39;s a bad idea to have an internet connected microphone listening in your home at all times)."</p>
