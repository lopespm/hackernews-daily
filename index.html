								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m a long-time small phone Android user. But after the Pixel 5, I have not been able to find a suitable small Android replacement. The Pixel 6 is gigantic, and the Pixel 7 looks like it is also destined to be huge. It’s gotten so bad that I’ve resorted to using an iPhone Mini, biding my time and hoping desperately that some Android OEM would step up.But it’s increasingly clear that a small premium phone is not on the roadmap. So I’ve decided to take matters into my own hands. My goal with https://smallandroidphone.com is to rally other fans of small phones together and put pressure on Google/Samsung/Anyone to consider making a small phone.I have a very specific set of skills and industry connections that I have acquired over a long career in the hardware business (my first startup was Pebble). I will put them to use in our shared quest to get the perfect small Android phone. If no one else builds one, and enough people sign up...maybe I will be forced to make it myself.If you want a small premium Android phone, this may be your last chance (ever?) to help bring back the phone category that we love."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi Eric, I&#39;m a hardware startup guy myself (our paths have crossed) with the distinction that my own &#34;very specific set of skills&#34; has been honed at smartphone megacompanies and smartphone startups.  OSOM, Essential, HTC, Samsung, Apple.  I&#39;ve designed and built a lot of phones.  I&#39;m building one now.  I think this is a noble effort, I personally prefer pocketable phones too, but I think there are nigh-insurmountable hurdles in your paths forward.- 1. Supply chain / component R&amp;D -You will be very, very hard pressed to source a pre-existing, high quality, non-exclusive 5.4&#34; display with a hole punch.  If you end up doing this as your own startup then you&#39;re going to start by trying to buy off the shelf parts to keep costs down.  But that display you want is simply not on any of the development roadmaps for the major component manufacturers.  The industry has its own momentum, and the component suppliers have also been looking at the trendlines so they are building bigger and bigger.If you can&#39;t find the screen you want in a catalogue then you have to pay someone to build it.  Convincing BOE et. al that your phone will sell enough to pay off R&amp;D costs is unlikely, so be prepared to pay several million bucks in NRE to make it worth their time (it might still not be) and the wait a year for them to spin up the fabs.  So ~$5M and 9-18 months later you have a display.- 2. Big players are uninterested, not uninformed -Big companies are drowning in market data.  They know some people really, really want small phones. But it&#39;s a long-tail opportunity they&#39;re willfully ignoring, and people who need phones will still buy something even if reluctantly.  I&#39;ve been in the meetings, small phone advocacy goes nowhere.Also I&#39;m a little surprised you&#39;re hoping an online petition will work after your prior experience trying to influence your acquirers.  I presume you saw the inside of Fitbit / Google and how decisions are made..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like a smaller phone too, but with a bigger battery.If I browse the web in the, I cannot use my phone to buy my train ticket as you have to show the QR code and 4G is killing the battery really quickly.My current phone is a one plus 5T and the new phone could have 3cm less in height and 1 in width while being 4 time thicker. Ideally I&#39;d like addon battery to come back, you remember those nokia 3310 with the added huge battery? I want that. Now I have an external battery, but I need a cable and it&#39;s not that practical.As a more general comment, I&#39;d like &#34;design&#34; to be less important. I don&#39;t care if my phone is a dumb cube like shape. I want function."</p>

You have a few minutes to kill, so you log onto Facebook and begin scrolling...First, you notice a friend&#39;s post stating that she has accepted her ideal job.Then you read a coworker&#39;s too political rant.You continue browsing and see a video of your neighbour enjoying a fantastic tropical vacation.And now your cousin has uploaded a before and after photo that makes you want to hide your thighs for the rest of your life.The next thing you know, you&#39;re second-guessing your profession, irritated by politics, wondering why you can&#39;t afford a trip, and researching your next diet.Social media is nothing but roller coaster,"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, I&#39;ve found that social media doesn&#39;t affect my level of happiness and/or anxiety directly. What it does do, is take up a lot of my time almost imperceptibly - leaving less time for other, more meaningful activities. It makes me feel like I&#39;m running out of time every day, which in turn causes a feeling of anxiety."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I fast from food for a month a year due to religious reasons (from dawn to dusk). During this time,I fast from social media (telegram, twitter mostly).After about a week, I feel anxious at a superficial level but it levels off and I feel much better about 2 weeks in. After the whole month, when I log into twitter again, I can really feel a mental shift. Almost like being dragged back into it. It&#39;s not pleasant. I&#39;m not surprised by these findings."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazing, just two days ago I was searching for a polar arrangement tool in Inkscape. FOSS tools are often worse from a UI/UX perspective, sure, but I contend that they usually provide something consumer commercial tools often don&#39;t: respect for users. I&#39;m not necessarily talking about welcoming communities here - respect can take the form of, say, not engaging in hostilities like:
- The sword of Damocles that is renting software. Can&#39;t pay? Can&#39;t access your data. Or worse, it&#39;s gone.
- Developed-country-centric pricing models/heavy focus on newer hardware.
- Locking you out of creative uses of the software - either our way or the highway
- Effectively forced TOS or pricing changes
- Unexplained bans/AI moderation/guilt by association/becoming subject to laws not relevant to your jurisdiction
- Forced upgrades breaking workflows or removing features
- Corporate bankruptcy/&#34;amazing journey&#34;/sales/pivots/mergers/etc ruining your investment
- Misfeatures such as nag screens, dark patterns, engagement boosters (time wasters), unclear data collection...
- Opaque bug submission channels, limited to no access to the engineers building the thing
- Optimizing for revenue, not usefulnessThere is a feature count/learning curve price for this, I will readily admit. Sometimes, untenably so. My claim is simply that FOSS tools are important as a backstop/foundation.I feel that any problem solved exclusively by proprietary software is only solved temporarily and for a tiny percentage of the world population. If the company goes away or the IP otherwise becomes inactive, that&#39;s it. Especially with cloud software. With FOSS, the software never really goes away. The problem mostly stays solved, and anyone can resume the work if they are willing and able. I&#39;d imagine a forked FOSS version of Win2k, VB6, or maybe the late-2000s Google indexer (bit of a stretch) would be quite successful today, for example. Guess I&#39;ll never be sure of that.Just musing after a beer and some Red Vines - I welcome any criticism or kindred spirits."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see the project moving along, but it&#39;s been a persistent feeling of mine that FOSS is starting to get left behind in the dust. The design space has been very rapidly moving towards online, live collaboration tools like Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, etc and FOSS just has no answer for this market. Even a lot of the big name proprietary tools are finding themselves becoming rapidly obsolete in a world where people want to IM a link and just have it reflect the latest version rather than attaching files back and forth.It&#39;s not even clear how FOSS would even work in this market or how it would benefit the user when it would be hosted all on someone else&#39;s server with self hosting diminishing the ease of collaboration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Inkscape documents can now hold multiple pages , which are managed by the new Page tool&gt; Layers and objects dialog merged&gt; Redesigned Export dialog with preview and ability to select objects/layers/pages and even multiple file formats to export toIs it my birthday? Holy moly, those are like three of my biggest dream changes to Inkscape. I think I might need to start donating."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you go this route, please make sure your system is robust and ready to go before meetings.We had to ask one employee to go back to his reliable built-in webcam because every other meeting started with 2 minutes of him getting his camera turned on, messing with audio inputs, getting his microphone boom in place, and fighting other quirks. He also had a tendency to drop out of long meetings when his camera overheated, at which point it was another 1-2 minutes of messing around with the camera setup.If you&#39;re going to do this, it must be reliable and ready to go before meetings. Don&#39;t be the person fighting with expensive equipment all the time just to get a marginally better image for your highly compressed Zoom video stream. This isn&#39;t a Twitch stream. We just want to talk and get down to business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Protip: if your goal is to use your smartphone as a webcam, check out this:  https://vdo.ninjaWritten by some guy named Steve, it’s an incredible piece of web software that uses WebRTC to stream phone audio and video as an OBS input. OBS then features a virtual webcam capability to take that stream and make it a webcam. I can then also use OBS to do whatever processing I want, e.g. making my webcam also contain a screen share or whatever else.It’s trivial to then load up multiple instances for multi-angle scenes in OBS, then cut between the two. For example, you could have one ‘face’ camera and one ‘page’ camera showing paper on your desk and make a 2nd scene with the ‘page’ camera as the primary and a small PIP view of your face.It goes much farther than just being an input for OBS, though. For example, it can create video chatrooms of multiple participants with URL parameter configuration and without touching OBS (indeed that’s now one of its primary use cases).I use it to stream applications/webpages with my partner when we’re apart so we can watch a movie together by creating a high res vid/stereo audio input with no noise cancelling as the movie, then have her and I connect as lower quality, mono+noise cancelling participants. Each of us receives the video and audio of the movie, but only the audio of each other.There’s heaps of parameters to control video and audio quality, buffering, etc. - just about anything you need.I stumbled across it when I was trying to get my iPhone to be a webcam early on in the pandemic. There’s multiple apps for that purpose - many paid - but this was so easy and worked so well that it blew them out of the water from a capability perspective.I know I sound like a shill but honestly I’m just a huge fanboy. It’s one of those web apps that does a job really bloody well, with heaps of flexibility and extensibility. I’m genuinely impressed with it and all the hard work Steve’s clearly put in.The docs explain a lot of its capability: https://docs.vdo.ninja/Flick through the how it works and use cases pages, they’ll explain it far better than me.Guides that show sown of the advanced capability: https://docs.vdo.ninja/guides"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t read the whole thread, so maybe I am just repeating a point someone else made.I draw as a hobby; during the pandemic, lots of people started hosting art posing sessions over Zoom (here is an example of one of my sessions, model was in Mexico - I live in Europe: https://www.instagram.com/p/Cb8WpdEAsOk/?utm_source=ig_web_c...) so I was interested in this article because it looked like something that could make a difference for some of the studios/models I worked with.Well... it is not really practical. Models do not have large budgets for a start, and are not necessarily tech savvy enough to put together something like this or make it work reliably.Some places do combined live/online sessions (artists are in the room with the model and there is also a camera for people drawing remotely). I sincerely doubt that this would be of use even for studios.I believe that online modeling could be a valid use case, but the cost/hassle ratio makes it absolutely impractical for anyone who could be even remotely interested in something like this.In other words: as the article itself mentions at the start &#34;The market for decent quality webcams seems to be non-existent&#34;. Just like &#34;build your AV&#34;.
It may be an interesting project for a blog post, but it is really improbable that anyone else would try to replicate the endeavor."</p>

It turned out great for me. Fast forward to 2022, you see how much of the GPU “shortage” was due to crypto mining especially in Russia (there are enough anecdotes of people in Siberia heating their kitchens with GPUs)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is kind of funny because the SEC is basically saying Nvidia held their share price artificially high by doing this, but Nvidia also bought back billions of their own shares, by this logic they were overpaying."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The SEC’s order also finds that NVIDIA’s omissions of material information about the growth of its gaming business were misleading given that NVIDIA did make statements about how other parts of the company’s business were driven by demand for crypto, creating the impression that the company’s gaming business was not significantly affected by cryptomining.The SEC’s order finds that NVIDIA violated Section 17(a)(2) and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 and the disclosure provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The order also finds that NVIDIA failed to maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, NVIDIA agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay a $5.5 million penalty.&#34;"</p>

I’m sure someone has already done this in some fashion, but the idea was amusing enough for me to genuinely consider it one of these weekends. I guess in that case, though, you can’t really run FreeDOS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m guessing they’re doing this because modern x86 processors can’t boot into BIOS mode anymore (edit: untrue, see reply by dmitrygr). This makes me wonder why they’re even offering FreeDOS as an option when they offer Linux for customers who don’t wish to purchase a Windows license. Maybe they have some sort of contractual obligation with a large customer?"</p>

Dialing back from the things that distract you can work with any technology. Healthy eating, excercising and sleep can do wonders. Walking away from &#34;digital&#34; world for some time can work too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Okay, I love C so of course I had to take a look. The buzzwords are impressive, with all the testing and CI and so on, really nice, modern and ambitious.I dove into the code, literally looking at the first true part of the implementation in array/sc_array.h.Two observations, from probably less than tree minutes of reading:1. The nomenclature with &#34;sc_array_term()&#34; as the destructor (the opposite of sc_array_init()) was new to me; I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s a real problem but it&#39;s at least adding friction in a way. I would have expected sc_array_free(), but that seems to be internally used as an alias for the standard function free(). Very confusing, since that name (sc_array_free()) then leaks into the source but it has the feeling of being meant for internal use.2. I wonder if this has a bug:    /**
     * Deletes items from the array without deallocating underlying memory
     * @param a array
     */
    #define sc_array_clear(a) \
    do {                                                                   \
      (a)-&gt;cap = 0;                                                  \
      (a)-&gt;size = 0;                                                 \
      (a)-&gt;oom = false;                                              \
    } while (0)

In my experience, when you want to clear a dynamic array but keep the allocated memory, the &#39;capacity&#39; (&#39;cap&#39;, here) field should not be cleared. I think this will leak memory if an array is grown, cleared, and then re-filled since the sc_array_add() function will see a zero capacity, and allocate new storage.Just my inflation-devalued SEK 0.02, and I did not run the code, I just read it very quickly. Corrections welcome."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I got more into C programming, I started looking for data structure libraries. Found a few [0]. Also evaluated sc, but it had too much pre-processor magic for my taste. It also bundles random &#34;stuff&#34; like a URI parser, a thread abstraction, etc.Eventually I rolled my own [1] more focused library. It&#39;s basic and portable.0: https://begriffs.com/posts/2020-08-31-portable-stable-softwa...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good stuff. I may make use of the .ini parser as my current one doesn&#39;t handle sections.There are a growing number of stand alone support modules in my projects that I need to publish as a collection some day.  Here&#39;s a couple links to some of them:- https://github.com/WickedSmoke/faun/tree/master/support- https://github.com/xu4-engine/u4/tree/master/src/supportThese include more exotic stuff like a grid based field-of-view calculation and a version of the sfxr synthesizer."</p>
