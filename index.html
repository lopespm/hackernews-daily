								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Raj thought that checking the &#34;principal&#34; checkbox and entering the number of a Citibank wash account would ensure that the principal payment would stay at Citibank. He was wrong. To prevent payment of the principal, Raj actually needed to set the &#34;front&#34; and &#34;fund&#34; fields to the wash account as well as &#34;principal.&#34; Raj didn&#39;t do that.I don&#39;t even have anything to add. The paragraph speaks for itself... You can&#39;t make this up"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The actual work of entering this transaction into Flexcube fell to a subcontractor in India named Arokia Raj.&gt; Citibank&#39;s procedures require that three people sign off on a transaction of this size. In this case, that was Raj, a colleague of his in India, and a senior Citibank official in Delaware named Vincent Fratta.The names of these individuals seems like an unnecessary detail, especially since the article names the software interface as the culprit.  I can&#39;t help but think about the recent NYT/SSC incident."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be sure, this is an ugly UI but this is not necessarily a pure UI issue at root.Internal applications have to be more complex that external applications - that&#39;s why you sometimes have to call a company to do something the consumer frontend doesn&#39;t support. The employees are expected to operate a more powerful/flexible system than the customer, and I think there&#39;s always a risk inherent there.In this case, it&#39;s likely that it&#39;s not just a dumb UI thing that the employee &#34;needed to set the &#34;front&#34; and &#34;fund&#34; fields to the wash account as well as &#34;principal.&#34; I suspect thank &#34;front&#34; and &#34;back&#34; are actually real business concepts in how the bank models transfers which the employee/reviewer did not understand well. Instead they expressed a different model of a transfer (an external one) which is a totally legitimate use case, just not the intended one.That&#39;s kinda one level of empathy, I suspect this really happened because these users think about these operations as &#34;I check this box, then I check that box&#34; rather than &#34;I get how transfers work and I am going to express my intention using that understanding.&#34; So it&#39;s probably much more of a training issue, because to give these people a very narrow and polished consumer-style frontend would take away the flexibility they likely need to actually execute their roles."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You can also watch an EDL visualization in your browser: https://eyes.nasa.gov/apps/mars2020/#/homeAnd read about how it will use Terrain Relative Navigation to find a safe landing spot: https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/a-neil-armstrong-for-mars-land...Perseverance is phenomenally complex, its Sample Caching System alone contains 3,000+ parts and two robotic arms.  So exited for all the sciencing this nuclear-powered, sample-drilling, laser-zapping behemoth can do when it joins its friends on the only planet (known) to be inhabited solely by robots.Edit: Percy is about to release its two 77 kg Cruise Mass Balance Devices (is this what NASA calls &#39;weights&#39;?) to setup the right lift-to-drag ratio for entry. Mars InSight will be listening for the 14,000 km/hr impacts of these weights, providing useful calibration data. We wrote about this in this week&#39;s issue of our space-related newsletter, Orbital Index - https://orbitalindex.com/archive/2021-02-17-Issue-104/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I don&#39;t understand: when they say &#34;X is 1 minute from happening&#34;, does that mean it&#39;s really 1 minute from happening or does that mean &#34;in 1 minute we&#39;ll receive the signal that X has happened&#34;?Maybe my question makes more sense in the case of &#34;X is happening right now&#34;, because then I should either understand &#34;we infer that X should have happened right about now&#34; or &#34;we have confirmed via signal that X has happened&#34;, and that&#39;s a big big difference.I know in some cases they explicitly say the latter, so I guess my real real question is, do they just keep the communication delay implied in all countdowns &amp; references in discussion, to avoid confusion?(ETA: No need to let me know about simultaneity problems in relativity — earth and mars are, relative to c and to macroscopic time scales, essentially not moving relative to each other AFAIK, so that simultaneity is essentially well-defined. My question was about a much more boring classical-universe problem.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a great achievement with some really interesting work done on the landing algorithms with terrain recognition and it seemed to have worked exceptionally well.Looking forward for the next landing in May of the Chinese rover and all the science these robots will produce. Also, the test of Ingenuity, the helicopter, will be very interesting to watch, that could really pave the way for a different exploration style in the future.And finally, maybe the next transfer window will already see some Starships, that would really change everything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been using a starlink beta terminal for 3 months now, ask me whatever you want. Day job is senior network engineer for a regional-sized (4 US states) fiber based ISP.My most important message to everyone reading this is that it&#39;s not intended to compete with properly implemented wireline based services. It&#39;s going to absolutely blow away consumer-grade highly oversubscribed, bottom of the barrel ku and ka band geostationary satellite services (hughesnet, viasat in the USA, xplornet in Canada), and any WISP that can&#39;t keep up with a 150 Mbps figure.And eventually for really hard to reach places in the developing world, and much of the same offshore/aviation/maritime industry that right now pays tons of money to Inmarsat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was able to place an actual order just last week in St. Louis, MO.I will be using it and doing some tests in an area that actually has cable Internet (though spotty, and until very recently was limited to less than 20 Mbps up, no matter how much you paid).But you have to realize, when you look at the $600 initial cost and $100 monthly fee—this will bring 100+ Mbps down and 15+ Mbps up to so many places (even in suburbs) where people couldn&#39;t get more than 10/2 or so for any price.I already know a few people who don&#39;t even live in rural parts who would happily pay triple just to get off their junk DSL or flaky Cable connection, even with Starlink in beta. They are already used to spotty Internet, so Starlink is a massive improvement even if it&#39;s spotty (which it hasn&#39;t been, according to these users)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was at PowerBI in Microsoft, all the execs hailed it as Startup within Microsoft. Come work here instead of Uber. I worked like a dog, sometimes till 2am in morning. My manager would routinely ask us to come on weekends. I was naive, I thought we are growing customer base, this is what a startup looks like.The ultimate realization was in a startup you have equity, a decent amount in a good startup. At Microsoft it was a base salary and set amount of stock. What we did moved very little of the top revenue metric. It made little difference if I worked like a dog, or slacked. The promos were very much “buddy buddy” system.In the end I realized you can’t have startups in big companies (esp as an engineer you don’t have the huge upside  if the startup is successful, your upside is capped)Startups work because you have skin in the game, when you build something people want, you get to reap rewards proportional to it. That correlation and feedback loop is very important.At big companies you don’t have the the same correlation. Some big shot exec they hired reaps far far more on the work you did.Equity is what builds wealth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean, sure, but it also misses the point a bit. &#34;Startup in a big company&#34; doesn&#39;t mean &#34;yo take some cashdollar and try build and release something to the public&#34;, but it does mean &#34;hey, take a small team and do your own thing with less oversight and process overhead from higher-ups&#34;.The team I worked in at AWS was like this and it felt a lot like startup teams I&#39;ve worked with. That didn&#39;t mean we could take &#39;brand and legal risk&#39;, and if that&#39;s what you want then definitely go and start your own thing.If you want more autonomy and higher velocity than is normal at corporates, then a &#39;startup within a big company&#39; might actually work out for you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The predominant sentiment in the comments is that equity is worthless, which very well may be a fair statement. It would also explain why relatively few people decide to start companies, let alone do it back to back several times after getting burned over and over again. But those same people will then argue that founders should not get 10x more equity than employees [0] (which, for the record, may or may not be justified, but you can&#39;t argue that founders would be better off keeping their jobs at mega corps, and also at the same time criticize their upside).My personal take on this is:- Stay at the mega corp if you&#39;re exclusively optimizing for wealth generation. I don&#39;t know if I would recommend pursuing the Skunkworks opportunities, since they are by definition not core to the business and your contributions won&#39;t produce a lot of profit for the company for a long time. It&#39;s unlikely that the company will remunerate you more than someone who&#39;s paying all the bills. After all, this career path is all about maximizing your risk-adjusted likelihood of wealth generation.- Start your own startup if the journey matters to you. Important caveat: you will get better at this over time, so if it made sense to you to start your first company, it will make even more sense to stick to this career path and do it over and over again. Don&#39;t invest your own money, and hope for the best but expect each company to fail. Be ok with earning sub-market salary, and treasure the upside of being your own boss. This approach works best if you&#39;re able to raise pre-product seed financing, which brings me to the next point...- Before you start your own company, be an early employee at a startup that&#39;s run by a serial (and ideally successful) entrepreneur. You will get the worst of both worlds - not enough salary and not enough equity - but you will dramatically improve the odds of success when you start your own company (and will also improve the chances of raising a pre-product seed round). Don&#39;t do it otherwise.What I wouldn&#39;t do: keep a job at the mega corp, and work on new ideas nights and weekends. This may seem like having your cake and eating it too, but it works far less frequently than you would expect (you end up sucking at your job and at your startup, not to mention that your work-life balance is possibly worse than in any other scenario). Again, the alternative would have been to be an early employee and learn first-hand about entrepreneurship.[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17288343"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good riddance, in my opinion. 40 million copies of a thick catalog with glossy pages means a couple shittons of not just trees but petroleum and petrochemicals for production, distribution, and disposal. Every year! And ten years ago, it was nearly 200. https://archive.is/rHAhGCan you even imagine a stack of one million catalogs?That&#39;s space, trees, plants, mammals, birds, insects, mushrooms, ... all being squeezed for a glossy catalog, most of which will get thumbed through once or twice and sent to the landfill to rot.These catalogs do not biodegrade well, by the way, because they&#39;re not just paper.I love paper books, and I enjoyed browsing this catalog just like many others in this thread, and yet I don&#39;t think I will miss this one. Hopefully, other thick glossy catalogs will follow suit.Production of catalogs like this squeezes our biome, and if we don&#39;t turn back, it will pop, and we&#39;ll be left with only enough resources for a small fraction of us to survive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am genuinely upset about this. I have such fond memories of thumbing through endlessly as a teenager and dreaming of having my own spaces that were so wonderfully busy and eclectic. My wife and I were just at IKEA last week picking up a new bed for our growing toddler, I glanced at the catalogs as we passed and decided against picking one up. I hope I can still get my hands on a couple old copies to keep on my bookshelf.Edit: Just placed an order for the specific catalog year I have so many memories of reading. One of my sillier purchases, but it feels like a piece of personal history."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat unrelated IKEA has been brought to it&#39;s knees during the pandemic and it has made their online ordering completely useless.  For a company shifting focus to online only I would think they would want to be able to ship some things purchased online.Stock is also low in the Portland store, but even the few items available can&#39;t be purchased online and shipped to me. I&#39;ve tried to order a number of things recently and they won&#39;t ship anything to my house."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would normally be appalled by such an action, but the supply issues for RTX 30x0 cards are beyond ridiculous. Mining trashes the environment and, for the majority of crypto assets/volumes, does not provide genuinely valuable economic activity besides speculation (I say that as someone who has put thousands of dollars into crypto in the past). Why should people who want to try some ML/DL at home (maybe they even need it for a class they&#39;re taking), and might also want to play the occasional game, have to pay an arm and a leg to get their (remaining) hands on a modern, efficient card?I really wish Nvidia would do this across the RTX product line.Edit: the &#34;Syrian refugee crossing into Europe&#34; trope might pop up as a counter-argument for crypto. I am Syrian and still have relatives there. Refugees&#39; assets are a drop in the ocean of speculators&#39; mining and HODLing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like it&#39;s time to crack some NVIDIA drivers. I already do it for the video encoding limitations, why not this too? Miners are willing to go to some really hacky extremes, reflashing firmwares, custom fan mods, extreme overclock configurations, etc to maximize hashrates and certainly won&#39;t care if they have to jump through some hoops to patch a specific version of the Linux driver or enable unsigned drivers on Windows, as long as they make more profit.Good luck with this one NVIDIA but you&#39;re playing a losing game. As soon as one un-restricted version of the driver exists, this is as good as useless and demand will be the same as ever for these cards unless they&#39;re able to ship CMP cards at a very high rate, but my understanding is the restriction here is silicon.Let&#39;s not forget that last time they produced &#34;mining only&#34; cards, people managed to crack the drivers to render graphics too... this is no exception.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY4s35uULg4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Gamers hate miners, they&#39;re driving the price up, make hardware impossible to get ect ... It&#39;s a really problematic situation. Almost 6 month after launching new graphic cards from AMD / NVIDIA good luck gettting an RTX 30xx or 6800.On a side note all those virtual currency are just plain wrong on the environment side, it does not make any sense in 2021 to have a currency that need heavy computation thus increasing power consumption. When people designed those currency they def did not think about that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A key part of this legislation is the requirements for tech companies to provide selected news organisations with advance notice about changes to ranking algorithms. This has been generally overlooked in the reporting and discussion but I believe it is the actually the most important part of the legislation. It will give the selected news organisations an enormous advantage over other companies not included and protect them from new competitors, basically entrenching the current media landscape for the foreseeable future.Given the current Australian government&#39;s cosy relationship with a particular media company that currently dominates the media landscape here, I don&#39;t think it is coincidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in Australia and while I&#39;m excited to see less Facebook use, I see a lot of comments saying things like, &#34;good, Facebook monetized an addiction model and this curbs that&#34;. While true, the proposed law that has pushed them to do this is incredibly dangerous. The law doesn&#39;t just apply to Facebook, it applies to whoever the Treasurer of Australia[0] says it applies to - it isn&#39;t metrics/rules based: https://i.imgur.com/7RSqXDJ.pngThis means you as a business owner may wake up one day to find that you are now classified as a designated digital platform corporation and are on the hook to now negotiate contracts with every registered news business corporation, AND provide each of them with the secret sauce behind your ranking algos. The only thing that needs to be done to do this is for the Treasurer to file a decision in the Federal Register of Legislation[1]. It&#39;s a shocking amount of overreach, lack of visibility to the process, and a single point of failure in the system.Overall I&#39;m very curious to see how this plays out. Facebook took the nuclear option here, and I highly suspect that news corporations will feel quite a sting from the loss of traffic / platform. I truly feel like Facebook &#34;winning&#34; here and having the law dropped is the lesser of two evils.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasurer_of_Australia[1] https://www.legislation.gov.au/Browse/Results/ByRegDate/Legi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t believe I&#39;m about to say this, but I think I&#39;m going to side with FB on this. The Australian government is once again showing absolute disregard when it comes to understanding technology, and its signature heavy handed approach to regulation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For what it&#39;s worth, I reached out to the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) after their press release on &#34;Securing Critical Open Source Projects&#34; [0], because my open source project is on their &#34;critical list&#34; (Python top #200) [1].After some clicking around, I was directed to the OpenSSF mailing list [2].…where my request was left to rot, without any response.Made me wonder whether this is just a PR stunt / corporate power grab.[0] https://opensource.googleblog.com/2020/12/finding-critical-o...[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25381397[2] https://groups.google.com/g/wg-securing-critical-projects"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is left out of the title is that they do not provide funding to the current authors/maintainers of these open source projects. Instead, they fund an organization that will rewrite these tools.Correct me if I’m wrong, but that’s my understanding of the rather terse article.I would rather have the original maintainers funded and still in control of the many pieces that form the basis of the major Linux distributions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone please fix the title to the original in the blog (&#39;Mitigating Memory Safety Issues in Open Source Software&#39;), because the current title is not at all representative of what the blog is actually saying."</p>
