								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of something.I used to work with a senior guy who went freelance and then bunched together with several other freelancers, also seniors, to form... &#34;an operation&#34;. The MO was that one of them would go and interview for a permanent job, impress the heck out of everyone and then say &#34;there&#39;s more like me, be happy to help you out, but on a contract basis and as a group.&#34; They were basically bait-n-switching them to outsource parts of their development and in some cases it worked, because their fees were very reasonable. And the fees were reasonable because they did very little of the actual work themselves and instead re-outsourced it to some Ukranain dudes.Looked fishy as fuck and I&#39;m not sure how it ended because I felt out of touch with the guy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of this threat model:Long term moles at a company, able to climb high and perform well due to remote work which enables:- never really meeting the mole- the “mole” is a superstar because they have a team of corporate raider-employed 10x’ers evaluating and executing everything that this mole does at work. The mole’s code is written by 3x MIT grads hot swapping on the keyboard. The mole’s biz ideas come from a few HBS grads. And so on.Productivity, business intuition, and engineering talent is off the charts for this mole. It rises far enough in the hierarchy such that it maneuvers the company towards favorable action for that corporate raider. Every idea the mole suggests, the corporate raider works in the background to enable via favorable market conditions.  Whoever is the public face of the mole’a reputation might be in flames if found out, but what’s that vs netting 3% of a corporate buyout valuation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love the implication that there&#39;s this shadow company, Fronk. Seemingly defunct, they&#39;re actually thriving secretly behind the facade of a failed startup.Every marketing manager has engaged them privately to boost their numbers. Every developer secretly works for them on the side.But no one anywhere ever talks about it until one day a former consultant notices an expired NDA."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just to throw it out there, I graduated during the pandemic, and it was so frustrating not only the amount of cheating that occurred, which meant that if you didn&#39;t cheat you fell behind; but also how professors responded. I had a few professors who made exams ridiculously hard with strict time limits, just because they expected people to cheat. So the exams were designed in a way they cheating was the only way to get through it, which just encouraged more people to cheat. Not to say every person cheated, or every professor designed tests to be harder, but both groups were larger than you&#39;d expect.The good news is I think that with classes being in person again things will go relatively back to normal. Honestly I don&#39;t think I can fault students who cheated during the pandemic, it was just so abnormal that most people did whatever they had to to cope."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We employed the method of mixing the order of questions, not giving question titles, and having a pool of subtly different questions (a negation or a different constant slipped in) in order to vastly increase the amount of necessary communication to collaborate.We had the students turn on their webcams just to discourage them sitting in the same room, which basically would negate our former efforts. Neither did we flag any behavior nor did we record anything or used some automatic software.I believe that worked quite nicely. A few cheaters were easily spotted when they had the wrong constants in their answer.I understand that not every course and exam style is suitable for that. But for our databases course, it was applicable.I think that this was not much more invasive than a traditional exam. Anything more, like watching the screen, or having audio, would make me feel uncomfortable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imagine a business that sells deliverable medical testing kits. This business is the best at what they do; they sell more kits than any other organization, they cost less, they&#39;re delivered faster, and are superior in any way, shape, KPI, or form imaginable to traditional alternatives. The only issue being that each kit is in fact a bloodletting kit, and their intended use is to inform you which of your four humours is out of balance.I&#39;m of the opinion that e-proctoring, whatever its privacy concerns, is fundamentally an exercise in &#34;doing the wrong thing faster&#34;. Our exams are a poor reflection of student ability. Our exams have no bearing on actual proficiency in the subject matter. Our exams are ineffectual at catching cheaters. Leaving aside any discussion of privacy, e-proctoring (and traditional proctoring) fails to accomplish its fundamental goals.To automate these exams, to make them ever-more scalable and easier to distribute, is not a victory. We&#39;ve merely perpetuated a flawed system.If we want a meaningful assessment of student ability then we need to use better methods. Dethrone exams from our curriculum. Leverage project-based assessments. Use oral exams where feasible. Replace the infinitely looping lecture halls with recorded videos and open-source textbooks. Use the recovered instructor time for something meaningful. This is not a Gordian knot. It can be solved with a little courage and a little pragmatism."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of course he would. He was a regular hacker. If you&#39;ve read Steve Jobs&#39; biographies they all describe Woz wanting to keep things open and hackable and Jobs pushing through for the vertical integration they have now. Woz made the altruistic decision most of us would&#39;ve &#34;preferred&#34; but Jobs made the decision to create the most valuable company in the world instead. Hard to say who was right, really."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Woz also got into hacking about computers at an ideal time. Not long before then it would have been impossible to build a sophisticated computer in your garage. Years later, miniaturization has continued to progress and many things that were once relatively simple to replace have become much harder.When most parts on a computer were through-hole components and relatively large integrated circuits that could easily be hand soldered, the skill required to participate in the repair process was much lower. Today, even relatively open hardware like a desktop PC has a ton of added complexity that would make people far less likely to ever want to attempt a repair on their own. While I&#39;ve reflowed solder on a faulty GPU in the oven before, that&#39;s not exactly a good idea. A person is usually going to replace the things that have been component-ized like the RAM, GPU, SSD, motherboard, etc. rather than try to actually repair them.Granted, when a component like that breaks on a PC you can just pop it open and replace it, rather than having to find a specialist to repair a laptop or phone where all the parts are glued in or soldered. While I can sympathize with people that do want that (there are projects out there trying to bring products in this category to market), I&#39;m personally okay with that being the niche that it is. Most people didn&#39;t hack their computers back then and to this day most people don&#39;t hack on their computers.There probably should be components available for experts like Louis Rossman who can replace these parts. There probably should be schematics available so they can more easily make these repairs and they can have businesses like his who can specialize in doing these sorts of repairs (they already do exist, clearly). Companies like Apple absolutely should not be using any sort of DRM to prevent use of third party hardware components in repairs. Going out of your way to make your devices difficult to repair is unethical. But I think we&#39;re well past the point that someone without specialized skills should be able to expect to repair any device that they purchase."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The original article presents her in a very bright light, as a smart and brave woman who is engaged in a legal battle against large greedy corporations. And I find the photo quite cool.I think she is just overly susceptible, and maybe a little bit paranoid (which is understandable for a person with enemies as powerful as hers).This reminds me of the time when a russian entomologist named a new wasp species he discovered after her in her honor, and she took offense because the wasp was a parasite species, and blocked sci-hub in Russia for a few days in retaliation !edit: sci-hub was blocked only a few days, not months, my memory failed me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having worked as a researcher all my life in academia and the industry, I can only support Sci-Hub. Publishing as it works currently is an incredibly time consuming and expensive process funneling tremendous amounts of tax money into the pocḱets of publishers.To some extent the whole situation reminds me of the video and music content piracy era in the early 2000s. I hope there will be an equivalent of Apple Music/Spotify/Netflix for scientific papers in the near future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So no new articles have been uploaded this year.While I have relatively good access options through my university, roughly half of the publications appearing in my Google Scholar alerts are unaccessible. As they are also in fields were use of preprint services isn&#39;t common, it really interferes with me being up to date with ongoing research.As the use of sci-hub is so common, I wonder about the wider implications of the newest articles being inaccessible. Could bibliometric methods be used to quantify this? Missed citations? Less citations for articles published in more obscure journals?Interesting that no new solutions have come out yet. I&#39;m seeing people getting back to use #ICanHazPDF - not the best way to conduct research when an article is often just a gateway to more finding more relevant articles to read."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think its too easy to get a patent, and that leads to a great proliferation of patents that serve little purpose but to slow innovation.I worked at a patent law firm about 15 years ago in my wild youth. I’ll never forget hearing an attorney explain that getting a patent is basically bullying the examiner, and if that doesn’t work, appealing repeatedly until it’s eventually accepted.Are there statistics of the number of patent applications rejected? Even better, I would love to see the number of patent applications filed by the Apple computer corporation, and how many were accepted, and how many were rejected.Edit: Autocorrect error."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sixteen years ago, I had the idea for headlights aimed by GPS and started to make some prototypes. Then I read a patent that was basically &#34;a plurality of inputs + processor -&gt; headlight aiming&#34; that covered everything imaginable. I knew the patent wouldn&#39;t hold up in court, but I wouldn&#39;t have the money to fight it.More recently, I&#39;ve been working on a self-driving wheelchair. It&#39;s a fairly obvious straight line from self-driving car to self-driving wheelchair, but someone&#39;s gone out and patented it.  I still don&#39;t have the money to fight it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the OP:&gt;&gt; The study particularly wants to find examples of where a patent has been denied in the US but accepted in other jurisdictions, which will be a key area for European electronics companies.The question at hand does not seem to be what the title of the OP indicates, but rather about patent applications denied in the US but approved elsewhere.  Looking briefly at [1] too is hinting that the interest may rather be to relax the patent eligibility criteria so that more of patent applications in the US are approved.  Note:  IANAL.---[1] https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2021/07/09/2021-14...Excerpts:  &#34;Last year, after a split panel decision concluding that a method for manufacturing drive shafts was patent ineligible, ... The questions presented in the petition are: (1) What is the appropriate standard for determining whether a claim is directed to a patent-ineligible concept under step one of the Alice two-step framework?; and (2) Is patent eligibility a question of law for the court or a question of fact for the jury? ... The Senators indicated a particular interest in learning how the current jurisprudence has adversely impacted investment and innovation in critical technologies like quantum computing, artificial intelligence,[6] precision medicine, diagnostic methods, and pharmaceutical treatments.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The big question here is how Senior Google executive Urs Hölzle managed to get a &#34;remote work visa&#34; from the government of New Zealand. It reminds me of the &#34;special treatment&#34; that Peter Thiel got, where he got New Zealand citizenship after spending only 12 days in New Zealand [1].It is almost non-existent in the western world to be able to get a remote-work visa (minus Croatia and Czech Republic--both countries are part of the European Union and therefore become &#34;westernized&#34; quickly after accession).Yes, you can technically get _self-employment_, non-remote work visas in many European Union countries. But, the point and intent of such visas is that you contribute to their economy, assimilate, learn the local language, and eventually become a functioning contributing citizen in their society.The hypocrisy of the situation around remote work makes me angry, as I am disabled and I require remote work as an accommodation. I have 2 rare immune-mediated neurological diseases affecting my peripheral nervous system, plus type 1 diabetes (autoimmune and insulin-dependent).I should also point out something else unfair. I am a dual US|EU (Croatian) citizen who works part-time remotely as a contractor for a US-based company in Croatia, while studying for her masters degree in electrical engineering full time. Because I am an EU citizen, I can work in 30+ countries remotely, outside of the United States, while essentially getting paid more (compared to the locals and most other European Union citizens) for just having US citizenship and related credentials. I basically live like a queen in Croatia.[1] https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jun/29/new-zealand-ga..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in this guy&#39;s org as an L5 &amp; L6.  Opposition to remote work is the primary reason I left Google in 2015.Its also one of the reasons we lost out on a number of good internal transfers.  We had one amazing guy.  World famous, luminary in his field, who lived in Livermore who had a deal to WFH 2-3 days a week who turned down a job in our org because he would have lost that deal &amp; would have had to commute from Livermore every day.EDIT: To be clear, the opposition to remote work that impacted me came from the VP immediately above me.  It is certainly possible that other forks on the org chart under different VPs were different.  I never specifically talked to this person and got his views on remote work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For some context, here&#39;s the current situation for New Zealand citizens attempting to enter New Zealand (according to newspapers -- I&#39;m not from there):&gt;&#34;The demand is so high, and the supply so scarce, that any rooms that become available disappear within seconds. Dates are released completely randomly and can appear any time of the day or night, and there&#39;s no queue.&#34;&gt;&#34;It makes it close to impossible for the average New Zealander to get home,&#34; said Chris Ruscoe, currently in Tennessee, about the high demand and the software enabling people to secure rooms so quickly.&#34;&gt;&#34;The difficulty and frustration and desperation that these folks are feeling, including me - who tried for three weeks, 18-plus hours a day and got nowhere.&#34;https://www.rnz.co.nz/news/national/446516/tech-savvy-kiwis-...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I never understood the secretive nature of these Amazon &#34;devplan&#34; / &#34;FOCUS&#34; lists. If an employee has a performance issue, they should know. Period. If they are on a formal list, they should know that too.The only &#34;positive&#34; here is that it can affect the individual&#39;s moral to know you are not meeting expectations - but that has to be communicated regardless. If it&#39;s understood it has to be communicated and there is a list specifically including the individual, it&#39;s up to the company to manage that communication in a supportive manner.And the consequences of this secretive list are a culture of fear and uncertainty and doubt. Especially with the harsh consequences such as - if you leave while on this secretive list (which you cannot even know you are on) - you are ineligible for rehire.The solution is not to maintain a secretive list of employees who have performance issues - it is to be fully transparent about those performance issues and destigmatize being included in this nebulous secretive list in the first place - through a culture of support and shared success.Honestly it boggles my mind how Amazon managers accept this status quo at the scale that Amazon operates. It is so on it&#39;s face a recipe for having a toxic culture which breeds stress, doubt, and only serves to reinforce poor performance outcomes.Out of all the things I&#39;ve heard about Amazon culture for its software organization - this single thing (secretive lists of employees with performance issues with &#34;never rehire&#34; consequences that employees can&#39;t even understand they are on) symbolizes for me all the reasons I would avoid them as an employer. There is no way to have this process without creating a toxic culture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Should I tell an employee that I entered them into Focus?” the question reads. The response: “Do not discuss Focus with employees. Instead, tell the employee that their performance is not meeting expectations, the specific areas where they need to improve, and offer feedback and support to help them improve.”The headline is editorialized. IMO whether you’re told you’re in Focus or not is irrelevant. If your manager is telling you you’re not meeting expectations, that’s plenty of signal of what’s going on.The discussion in this thread is written more as if Amazon is pushing out capable talent.There’s a more fundamental question - are we saying once you get hired, your job should be permanent, regardless of your performance?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Donald Knuth&#39;s The Art of Computer Programming has, in its first volume, a lengthy section on simulating an elevator. It is a single regular elevator (nothing &#34;special&#34; going on as in the post here), but even so, as he tries to make things precise, you realize how much detail is involved, and get some appreciation for the task of programming.It occupies about 15 pages (plus several pages of exercises and solutions). Knuth started working on TAOCP when he was a PhD student at Caltech:&gt; The program developed below simulates the elevator system in the Mathematics building of the California Institute of Technology. The results of such a simulation will perhaps be of use only to people who make reasonably frequent visits to Caltech; and even for them, it may be simpler just to try using the elevator several times instead of writing a computer program. […]&gt; The algorithm we will now study may not reflect the elevator’s true principles of operation, but it is believed to be the simplest set of rules that explain all the phenomena observed during several hours of experimentation by the author during the writing of this section. […]&gt; The elevator system described above is quite complicated by comparison with other algorithms we have seen in this book, but the choice of a real-life system is more typical of a simulation problem than any cooked-up “textbook example” would ever be.It ends with:&gt; It is hoped that some reader will learn as much about simulation from the example above as the author learned about elevators while the example was being prepared.And one of the exercises adds:&gt; It is perhaps significant to note that although the author had used the elevator system for years and thought he knew it well, it wasn’t until he attempted to write this section that he realized there were quite a few facts about the elevator’s system of choosing directions that he did not know. He went back to experiment with the elevator six separate times, each time believing he had finally achieved a complete understanding of its modus operandi. (Now he is reluctant to ride it for fear that some new facet of its operation will appear, contradicting the algorithms given.) We often fail to realize how little we know about a thing until we attempt to simulate it on a computer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Deviant Ollam &amp; Howard Payne did a great talk on Elevator Hacking at Def Con 22.You can catch it at:https://archive.org/details/Defcon22_Talk29/DEF+CON+22+Hacki...orhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oHf1vD5_b5I  [01:00:15]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found a &#34;mode&#34; in an elevator in India that I have not seen anywhere else: if a destination floor number is highlighted, and you press it twice, it gets cancelled. I have used this magic power just once, when an obnoxious man got on and insisted on having a loud conversation on his phone. Since he wasn&#39;t paying attention, I double-tapped his floor number and made him skip. I happened to get off at the floor before his, so the elevator went down to the first floor after dropping me off. Small pleasures...."</p>
