								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dabbled in web-based mapping a couple years ago and found the tech stack to be really quite polished. Starting from a database of features from e.g. OpenStreetMap hosted in a Postgres-based PostGIS map server, and geographical boundaries via special shape files, you can write XML files representing the features you wish to see on each layer of the map (using SQL queries intended for PostGIS), and CSS-like style files representing how the features should look. You then set up a tile server (Apache or nginx or whatever) that generates tiles on demand and performs caching. Finally you use a JavaScript library to provide the &#34;slippy map&#34; that users can drag around.All of these layers of the tech stack have FOSS implementations; indeed most of the most widely used ones are FOSS. And then there&#39;s QGIS (also FOSS) to do most of this in a similar fashion, but offline.As merely a dabbler having a bit of fun, it&#39;s rather excellent I must say. It would be interesting to hear from anyone working in this field professionally as to how the FOSS tools measure up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s crazy to see how much has remained the same, even if so many new things were added. Looks like pretty much all the buildings that existed in 1777 still exist today.Even crazier to think that at the time the original map was made, pretty much all cities in the US didn’t even exist yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to see how segmented Antwerpen was back in 1777, what the author describes as hedges.These were usually the result of inheritance, when the land of one owner got split into pieces and each child then got one piece. They got smaller and smaller.I didn&#39;t think that this was already so extreme in 1777, but comparing it to the other maps, only Antwerpen and Brugge seem to be affected."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had this beautiful bespoke suit which had just been hanging in the closet, due to me gaining some weight. After slimming down I wanted to wear it again, only to find a couple of large and very noticeable moth holes on one of the lapels.Welp, money down the drain I thought. Local dry-cleaner tipped me about &#34;invisible mending&#34;, so I did some research. Ended up shipping it to the UK, and paid around £120 for getting the jacket repaired - with excellent results. Some might say that&#39;s a steep price, but the alternative was binning a £4000 garment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This craft was quite popular in Poland back in the day and went by the name &#34;cerowanie artystyczne&#34;.People earned like 20 USD a month. You ripped the pair of jeans your Uncle from America (archetypal figure from that time) sent you? Cerowanie artystyczne to the rescue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always been interested in repair and have done a good bit of mending on my own clothes. I have a few black tee shirts from Target from about six or seven years ago that have just gotten a few small holes that I&#39;ve repaired and you can&#39;t notice. Takes less than 5 minutes after a while from getting the thread out all the way to cutting it at the end.For down jackets, you can get yourself a roll of repair tape for ~$5 that&#39;s as simple as cut and place. I used to work for a large outdoors retailer and we had access to damaged and returned goods at crazy discounts. I got a $200 down jacket for $2.50. Add the $5 roll of repair tape that I still have and we&#39;ve got a great jacket that I&#39;ve worn for about four years now.It&#39;s kind of fun to do as well. Having sentimental value with the things you use is kind of nice, as long as you don&#39;t go overboard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;We are releasing all of our models between
125M and 30B parameters, and will provide full
research access to OPT-175B upon request.
Access will be granted to academic researchers; those
affiliated with organizations in government, civil
society, and academia; and those in industry research laboratories.&#34;GPT-3 Davinci (&#34;the&#34; GPT-3) is 175B.The repository will be open &#34;First thing in AM&#34; (https://twitter.com/stephenroller/status/1521302841276645376):https://github.com/facebookresearch/metaseq/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A quick summary of the Limitations section:- &#34;OPT-175B does not work well with declarative instructions or point-blank interrogatives.&#34;- &#34;OPT-175B also tends to be repetitive and can easily get stuck in a loop. While sampling can reduce the incidence rate of repetitive behavior (Holtzman et al., 2020), we anecdotally found it did not eliminate it entirely when only one generation is sampled.&#34;- &#34;We also find OPT-175B has a high propensity to generate toxic language and reinforce harmful stereotypes, even when provided with a relatively innocuous prompt (Gehman et al., 2020), and adversarial prompts are trivial to find.&#34;- &#34;In summary, we still believe this technology is
premature for commercial deployment.&#34;With regard to stereotypes:- &#34;When compared with Davinci in Table 4, OPT175B appears to exhibit more stereotypical biases in almost all categories except for religion. Again, this is likely due to differences in training data; Nangia et al. (2020) showed that Pushshift.io Reddit corpus has a higher incidence rate for stereotypes and discriminatory text than other corpora (e.g. Wikipedia).&#34;- When testing with the RealToxicityPrompts data set, &#34;OPT-175B has a higher toxicity rate than either PaLM or Davinci&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I often wonder if OpenAIs decision not to open gpt-3 was because it was to expensive to train relative to its real value.They’ve hidden the model behind an api where they can filter out most of the dumb behaviors, while everyone believes they are working on something entirely different."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When you read posts like this, and also the previous, linked one [1], you can clearly see that Ron is a smart and humble guy. I really dislike the fan mob that it&#39;s starting the hate because RTMI is not going to be a throwback and retro-game.&gt; Monkey Island 1 and 2 weren&#39;t pixel art games. They were games using state-of-
the-art tech and art.This is SO true, and as much as I loved those games, as much as I stopped playing modern videogames and as much as I love the style of Thimbleweed Park, going forward for an artist like Ron is what _defines_ an artist. If you like MI1 and Mi2, just play MI1 and MI2 again as I do from time to time. Just like you would watch again a movie from the &#39;70s or listen to the Beatles. But you cannot ask an artist to stay always the same because you loved their first works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this post. I know a decent amount of indie devs, I also have done some hobby game development myself. I see this alarming trend of devs and small studios that are, what I would call, hyper engaging with their players. I get it, the players are important, you want to sell the game, you want people to play it. But, the entitlement and feedback I have seen from some players is just ridiculous. Most players don&#39;t have the fist clue as to what makes a good game, or just how hard it actually is to make games. I feel like this post was very elegant way of basically saying &#34;Shut the hell up, it&#39;s my game, I don&#39;t care what you want, I am making this game primarily for me. This is my art, and my way of expressing myself and sharing it with the world, this is not a collaboration. If you like it great, if you don&#39;t, oh well.&#34;, but in a much more palatable and acceptable manner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a bit ironic that he says he was not really a fan of Day of the Tentacle&#39;s &#34;Chuck Jones&#34; art style, when the screenshots for his upcoming Return to Monkey Island are all very specifically that 90&#39;s-infused Chuck Jones style - multiple skewed perspective lines in a scene, extreme avoidance of curves (rendered instead as polygonal outlines, so to speak).The art style for his new game is rather ironically nostalgia-laden in probably an unintentional way: it&#39;s deep nineties pop art, ala &#34;Xtreme&#34;, etc.&lt;edit&gt;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really exciting. I wish we had nuclear power here in Australia. I know I might get downvoted for this comment. But with advancement in technology and large amount nuclear fuel (Uranium deposit) available, it&#39;s a great choice.1. Vast swathes of uninhabited land can absorb some of the risks/fears associated with a nuclear accident. With technology like this, the risks are even lower.
2. It&#39;s lot cleaner than coal and natural gas, which are still the primary sources of our electricity.
3. There will be a huge demand for electric cars in the near future drawing massive amount power from the grid. Nuclear power would be a lot cheaper and enable us to truely go green.Of course the coal companies won&#39;t like that. I can&#39;t see any reason why don&#39;t have nuclear energy. Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SMRs are nuclear reactors that typically produce up to 300 megawatts (MW) of electricity, which is enough energy to power 300,000 homes for one year.I suppose anyone who has some knowledge re electricity knows what they&#39;re trying to say here, and for anyone who doesn&#39;t it won&#39;t make much difference, but reading a sentence like this still hurts me a little.MW (megawatts) are a measure of power, not energy.  This means the &#34;per year&#34; part is meaningless.  Also for what it&#39;s worth, 300MW for 300k homes is 1kW/home, which is a pretty old rule of thumb for average household power use.  I believe the current average in Canada (and the US) is considerably higher  But that&#39;s also just the average; the peak is much higher.  300MW is the peak output for the plant, so the true number of homes it could power is lower regardless, absent storage.None of that to say the prospect isn&#39;t exciting! And I suppose the source here is the weather network, so perhaps they&#39;re a bit outside their area of expertise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The background on Canada&#39;s plans for small modular reactors (of which this is just one of three projects) can be found here:https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Canadian-provinc...Supposedly this is promoting clean energy and fighting climate change, but the details don&#39;t always match this rhetoric.  In particular they&#39;re thinking they can use nuclear power to replace piped-in natural gas to mine the Alberta tar sands and make (very dirty) syncrude for export to refineries in the USA, maybe China too.  Yes, that does reduce natural gas use... but you&#39;re still burning dirty tarsand oil.  The better option is to just leave the tar in the ground.Otherwise, SMRs sound kind of interesting, but there&#39;s been a lot of failed innovation in nuclear reactors in the past.  Some of us might remember when safe and reliable and innovative pebble bed reactors were going to be the thing that made nuclear acceptable everywhere, and that ended up going nowhere:https://thebulletin.org/2009/06/the-demise-of-the-pebble-bed...&gt; &#34;For some, helium-cooled, graphite-moderated reactors such as the PBMR have always been the ultimate evolution of fission reactor design. The use of helium and graphite allows the reactor to burn the fuel efficiently and to operate at much higher temperatures than conventional light water reactors. It is hoped the temperatures would be high enough to allow for the reactor’s heat to be used directly for industrial processes such as hydrogen production and tar sands processing. High temperature reactors can also be designed to use thorium-based fuel as well as uranium and can be developed as fast neutron reactors that don’t need moderators.&#34;I was enthusiastic about nuclear 20 years ago... now, not so much, since solar/wind/storage really gives more watts per dollar invested, with less side issues (security, uranium supply, waste storage).  Nuclear has a niche, but it&#39;s going to remain small."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to have a reinsurance company as a client. For those unfamiliar, that’s an insurance company that sells insurance to insurance companies. Example: You buy a $1,000,000 automobile liability insurance policy with a $1,000 deductible.If the insurance company doesn’t sell enough of these kinds of policies to reliably offset payouts with premiums, they might turn around and buy a policy from a reinsurance company with a $10,000,000 limit and a $100,000 deductible against their entire portfolio.Thus, reinsurance companies spend a lot of time thinking about things that don’t happen very often but can be very expensive when they happen.And yes, they had a division that did propositions like hole-in-ones, and also they insured legal betting companies against wild trifectas and that sort of thing.I have a small trove of stories they told me about bizarre accidents that wound up costing enormous amounts of money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually had a chat with a friend about prize indemnity insurance, he&#39;s a Lloyd&#39;s guy.In the end it&#39;s the law of large numbers, pretty much what a casino does: take lots of small positive bets, don&#39;t let one bet dominate. If you do get something too big, syndicate it with some of your competitors to spread the risk. Of course also make sure everyone who comes for insurance is actually what you think, like the guy in the article says it&#39;s not necessarily a hugely detailed check but it is enough to stop the worst frauds.You want a model that&#39;s robust, and you only have so much data about how often some guy hits a hole in one or a half court shot, and there&#39;s only so much you can know about whether they are a pro and the distance to the hole.The big problem seemed to be competition. You only get to write the insurance if you&#39;re the best price but the best price is not necessarily one that makes sense for the business. If some guy is buying market share with a loss leader, what do you do? Every segment of the market could be affected by this at a given time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Among the weirder things he’s insured? Cow patty bingo (video here).“It’s big in the Midwest,” says Gilmartin. “You divide a big field into, say, 100 squares, give each one a number, then let a cow loose. If the cow poops on a preselected number, the person wins a prize.””I burst out laughing at this one. Can any Midwestern HNers confirm? Are people watching the cow with bated breath? Are plots closer to the gate considered better?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember about 20 years ago there was a (IIRC) Java Applet-based multiplayer clone of Zelda: A Link to the Past that was sort of a forerunner the to MMORPGs we see today. It changed names to Graal Online because of the lawyers.Thinking back to it, it was really ahead of its time, not only because it was massively multiplayer, but it had a great level editor and was doing user-created content in the late &#39;90s.--edit--Oldest I could find on the wayback machine is from 1999, but that&#39;s a later version that was a standalone exe. http://web.archive.org/web/19991012175711/http://graalonline...--edit 2--Here&#39;s a nice writeup: https://graal.in/t/graal-zelda-online-historical-thread/1420..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zelda Classic holds a special place in my heart.My older brother downloaded it thinking it was just a Zelda 1 clone. I discovered it had a quest editor. And it was a very magical moment for me.I spent hundreds of hours never completing any of my projects. It was the first online community I ever joined and actively participated in.Eventually I yearned for for power and discovered Dark Basic. Now I’m a software dev.Zelda Classic was a major spark in my life. And it’s a really cool piece of software. 100% original code, (obviously the default assets are lifted… from another project). It’s got to be a 20 year old project at this point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TIL about Zelda Classic which has apparently been around a long time https://www.zeldaclassic.com/development-history/Very cool port, I like that it tries to integrate it into the browser features instead of calling it a day after compiling. The lack of D-pad support is a bit jarring considering gamepads are supported but it was still very playable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many years ago, I used to work for Vodafone - and had some responsibility for their filtering stuff.One of the main problems was that, at the time, it was all managed by Blue Coat. As they were a US company, many of the &#34;violations&#34; that they picked up just weren&#39;t considered problematic for a UK / EU audience.Similarly, they would use blanked keyword blocking. So sex education resources would frequently get blocked. Although, again, that may have been by puritanical design.Anything which looked like it might be used to bypass their filters (VPN, proxies, etc) were also blocked.Ultimately, the customer isn&#39;t the user. It is the network who are terrified that Johnny&#39;s parent is going to go to the papers screaming about how the evil phone company corrupted their innocent child.  That&#39;s all it is there for - to protect the network."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A number of my personal sites end up blocked by corporate firewalls. It’s slightly infuriating. Even my own company. I got in a literal fight with IT needing to justify the why in why I needed access to my own website. Like I can live without it, but it’s nothing but my blog where I rant about tech. The why should be why is it blocked to begin with. The default state should not be blocked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Vodafone is a mess. I bought a 24Gb pre-paid sim which was supposed to last 2 years but they &#39;lost&#39; my plan after 6months and 2Gb of data use. Spent an hour on chat with them telling me that no such plan had ever existed until I told them I had all the receipts and evidence of how much data I had used and threatened to take them to the small claims court with expenses at £60/hr for my time. They capitulated quickly after that and restored it, then &#39;lost&#39; my plan again the next month.I&#39;ve had problems with billing glitches with four utility companies in the UK now and I am starting to suspect that overcharging people and hoping they don&#39;t notice is actually a common business strategy in the industry and if they get caught they blame bad IT but really their systems are configured to do this on purpose."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"See the issue here is that this data exists at all and it’s purchasable by any group. I feel like the CDC are the least scary people buying this data. And from the looks of it they used it for medical research, which if similar in style to other medical research is bound by boards and ethics committees.What we aren’t writing about in this article are the groups using this data Cambridge Analytica style to sway political opinion, and other less than stellar purposes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an excellent use of the data, a proof that it is worthwhile for the data to exist, and a terrifying demonstration that we need to grow the hell up with respect to data privacy.It actually sounds like the anonymization and aggregation was done pretty well for this. There&#39;s no such thing as 100% anonymity, but there are useful levels of anonymity.The fact that we don&#39;t have a standardized way of blessing data with varying known levels of privacy, checked and enforced by law, is kind of ridiculous in 2022.If you want to maximize privacy here, then let&#39;s pass laws to prevent doctors from knowing the gender, age, and weight of any of their patients.I 100% agree that privacy is handled way, way too loosely in general, and this does look like the CDC was a lot more interested in a grab bag of use cases than it was with maintaining anonymity. But surely that&#39;s an indictment of our societal failure to regulate data brokers? It shouldn&#39;t be up to the CDC to act counter to their mission."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How do these companies onboard apps, they always seem super vague about that.I understand the model, they provide a tracking sdk that app developers embed in their apps and get paid for. But I haven’t found any actual documentation on these sdk’s. Do they buy the apps themselves or reach out directly somehow?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not even about not willing to spend 1$ for a random phone number.Here&#39;s a list of things that are wrong with what Google does:- If you want to read your email, you have to use app specific password. I&#39;m ok with that.- You can&#39;t generate app specific passwords if you don&#39;t have 2FA enabled. That&#39;s some artificial limitation made to force you into adding phone number to your account.- You can&#39;t use authenticator app to enable 2FA. I have no idea why SMS which is the least secure way to send information is a primary method and authenticator app which can be set up by scanning QR from the screen without sending any information at all is «secondary» and can only be used after you give your phone number.- You can use «notification» to confirm it&#39;s you, but you can only do that on the phone. I&#39;m currently logged in in my browser, certainly I could confirm any login attempt from that same browser, wouldn&#39;t that be a second factor?- Nowhere in announcements or help pages or in the Google Account interface they tell you that you can&#39;t generate app passwords if you don&#39;t have 2FA. The button is just missing and you wouldn&#39;t even know it should be there unless you search on the internet.- Nowhere they tell you the only way to enable 2FA is to link your account to your phone number or to your android/iphone device, the options are just not there.All of this is just bizarre and ugly. I have no idea why other people are not complaining, probably most of them just accepted that and added phone numbers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every tech company is losing the war against credential stuffing. I have a friend working at a series B startup with &lt;10k MAU, you wanna know how many login attempts there are each month? 25,000 login attempts. Per user. That&#39;s 250m login attempts each month using stolen credentials.None of the service providers who claim to fix the issue are worth their weight in salt. Shape, Akamai, none of them have a grip on the problem because the attackers are constantly evolving. As you can see, even Google is capitulating despite all the fud that people on HN spread about the company being omniscient.Anyone who thinks this is about advertising/collecting personal data is out of their minds.The worst part is nobody can talk about it because anything you reveal about your problems can give the attackers a massive edge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google is no saint, but there&#39;s absolutely no reason to ascribe ill intent to collecting phone numbers of 2FA setup. The reason is simple: Google has billions of users, and at any given time, a lot of them break their devices and lose access to 2FA credentials. Phone numbers, despite all their flaws, are still the most reliable long-term and mostly-immutable attributes which can service as a proxy for identity which can and does aid account recovery at scale. If you crack your phone screen, you can walk to a brick and mortar cell shop, present your ID and get a new phone that receives security codes without a second thought. If you&#39;re using Aegis and storing MFA seeds locally, you&#39;re on the hook for backups and no one wants that responsibility.Think of it like using social security numbers to authenticate yourself to the bank. Yes, it&#39;s terrible, but it&#39;s kind of the only thing that works when done on a massive scale. Yes, you can do better at managing your 2FA credentials, but most users cannot - they struggle even having strong passwords. Phone numbers bridge that security-usability gap. To be clear, this isn&#39;t an endorsement of the system (I think the user should be allowed to choose), but rather trying to make sense from an engineering perspective."</p>
