								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in charge of sourcing components for multiple companies right now.  I believe they could double (100%) prices and companies would pay it.  There&#39;s chips that I&#39;m sourcing from obscure places in China just to get the part and paying whatever price they ask.Designers are getting overwhelmed because they&#39;re having to redesign boards for components that are available, only to realize by the time they finish the changes, the part they redesigned for is also out of stock.There&#39;s been some talk of a Chip-induced cold war, and I would say that&#39;s not crazy given the market conditions. I also love the guy who posts here all the time saying he works for the company that makes the machines that makes the chips and they can&#39;t make more machines because they don&#39;t have the chips that go in them.  XD"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Supply shortage is another way of saying demand excess. I don’t see much evidence that TSMC ever really slowed production, at least for their most advanced processes that are in high demand.This is yet another way we’re all forced to pay the price for cryptocurrency. As long as GPUs are profitable for mining, they will be purchased and put to work. The saddest part is that each additional GPU added to the mining networks only makes the overall system less efficient. Mining difficulty is automatically adjusted upward to cancel out the additional computing power. The networks processed just as many transactions last year as they do now, but countless new GPUs have been added to the mining network due to the incentive structure of mining. It’s a race to the bottom, consuming ever more GPUs and energy until equilibrium is reached.It’s frustrating to watch so much of the output of our most advanced chip manufacturing be diverted straight into making arbitrary proof-of-work systems less efficient so someone can capture incrementally more coins. And now we must all pay higher prices for everything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1. This is specifically mainstream node, or everything except leading edge 3nm / 5nm.2. Those price has been like that for sometime since the chip shortage. They just make it official now.3. The mainstream and social media will and always have been blaming it on TSMC.4. Everyone wants all the capacity they need, while not paying a cent more. This announcement will &#34;somehow&#34; made it fair for everyone in the industry.5. The current component price has very little to do with wafer pricing. As with all commodity pricing, they will only swing back once supply catches up.6. In general I think this is a good, TSMC has been leaving far too much money on the table and benefiting GF and SMIC."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We should also make caniusebutdoesitactuallyworkThis to refer to my annoyance of browser makers leaving incomplete implementations stagnant for years.As an example, the &lt;dialog&gt; element, a browser-native standardized spec as promising replacement for alert. Except that it doesn&#39;t work, it&#39;s inaccessible at its core.And nobody fixes it, it&#39;s just left in this broken state forever.&lt;section&gt;, the element that was supposed to cut up an HTML document into multiple outlines, hence making componentized SEO-optimized headings easy and better, do nothing at all.CSS columns, a simple and easy way to distribute text, were unusable for 8 years because Mozilla refused to fix their own small bug. Which pales compared to the extraordinary amount of Webkit bugs that are absolutely never ever fixed.Form controls, since the very invention of them, are terrible. It has cost the world billions, as worldwide every single developer and project has to reinvent some of them, often breaking basic accessibility in the process.I could go on, but I&#39;ll sum it up as the failure to address extremely common real world problems, and to just let broken buggy solutions linger. When you accept a standard and implement it, bloody finish the implementation. Fix bugs. Otherwise, what is the point?I&#39;d call this hardening the web. There&#39;s no reason I can see why you can&#39;t harden it whilst also making progress on new features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally, I think the web/browsers has churned far too much, and if that stopped happening, perhaps we would get more accessible sites and browser diversity as people &#34;stop looking for new dogs and start teaching new tricks to the old ones.&#34; Of course, Google would try its hardest to never let that happen, since change is its weapon of monopoly.Related: Stop Pushing the Web Forward (2015) https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9961613"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another example of this is SharedWorker.Here it is in the standard: https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/workers.html#dom-shar...Safari/Webkit removed it in 2015 (edit: maybe even earlier!) and never reintroduced it:
https://caniuse.com/sharedworkersHere is the apparent reason for cherry picking features:&gt; The implementation of Shared Web Workers was imposing undesirable constraints on the engine. It never gained any adoption.https://stackoverflow.com/a/48193804Edit: Here is the ticket for it’s reinclusion https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=149850Turns out it was removed temporarily because of internal architecture changes, and never reintroduced because of lack of adoption. Of course the biggest barrier of adoption is Safari not supporting them, so talk about a self fulfilling prophecy.&gt; This feature was originally removed temporarily during multiprocess bring-up, and actual usage on the web has been pretty low. We&#39;re willing to reconsider if there is significant demand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I manage hundreds of linux servers... from my windows desktop and mac laptop.This will be super unpopular, but Linux missed the desktop boat 20 years ago, and my feeling as someone who at the time built his gentoo OS&#39;s from source, it was the fault of a few things:1) Fragmented gui development. There were too many projects with none focusing on really making a better gui than mac/windows.2) A lack of bread and butter 1st class &#34;business&#34; apps - you know, office. OpenOffice is fine, IF you are ok with the janky ui and no one knowing how it works.3) lack of open source exchange type mail/cal/etc server and outlook-like client). Holy fudge, I tried to get this going and people just crapped on me for suggesting it.4) Until recently, installing on laptops was an absolute crap shoot.5) Just, apps, in general. Gimp is fine, but it has never been close to photoshop. GUI standards are all over the place, etc. People go to a platform because it has the tools they want. The real fallout from point 1 is no one would ever port apps to linux (a little hyperbolic - a lot of high-end post production apps and audio apps all made it over). Open source yadda yadda, thats nice (this is not a brush off, it IS nice), but the ecosystem could be light years ahead of where we are now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone new to Linux from 20 years on a Mac -- what&#39;s the deal with everything being free?Seriously, where are the &#34;take my money&#34; opportunities. I don&#39;t want free OpenOffice. I want to pay $100 for something better, whatever the heck that is, maybe a little less clunky. I don&#39;t want free open source Notes app, I want to pay for something that&#39;s polished.The Linux community is incredibly giving and passionate and it seems like it&#39;s all &#34;free&#34; but sucks up my time. I couldn&#39;t even figure out how to slow the scroll of my trackpad on Ubuntu after lots of digging.Please, coming as a Mac user, take my money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t use Linux b/c it&#39;s the best desktop.  I use it for two fundamental reasons:1. With enough time and effort I can make it do whatever I want it to do (that can be done).2. I&#39;m a Python web developer and we deploy to Linux so it means I only really need to learn one OS (time to learn is in limited supply for me as man who cares about family life).What this means practically for me is that 95% of what the OS provides works the way I want it to.  I have a handful of things I customize and I&#39;ve scripted those (Linux is great for scripting) so it&#39;s easy to apply when I refresh my OS every 1-2 years.It also means I don&#39;t have to do things the Apple way, I can make it work the way I want it to work (within reason).It also means I don&#39;t have an OS that will put advertisements in the start menu (that was the last straw for my family using Windows, everyone uses Linux now).I realize if I was a lawyer and needed Microsoft Office or a designer and needed the Adobe Suite, then I couldn&#39;t take this approach or would need to run a different OS in a VM.  I wish the Linux desktop would be an attractive target for all popular commercial apps to support it.  But I&#39;m not holding my breath, that&#39;s not why I use it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you for sharing. I read this a while back and it still hits me just as hard. My brother passed away nearly 6 years ago and left under similar circumstances to the author&#39;s father. He also left a tattered, and similarly-chaotic journal.I was really torn about reading it at first, but he was the type of person who wanted to go ahead of the pack and clear the path for others. His journal was the last way for him to do that.He was older than me and, reading it years after his death, it&#39;s shocking to see the differences between our lives at the same ages. He always seemed older and wiser, but now -- having just turned the age he was when he died -- I realize why he felt so lost and lonely. Being an adult in your mid-twenties is difficult. I have it easy, and I&#39;m having a hard time. Throw in years of battling addiction and no college education, and you can&#39;t help but feel the entire world is against you.Losing an older sibling is a strange experience. The longer you go without them, the smaller the age gap between you becomes. Eventually, you&#39;re older than they will ever be -- I haven&#39;t reached that point yet but just thinking about it puts a lump in my throat.I&#39;ve considered publishing bits and pieces of his story on a blog, or in a book, someday. Anything that could help people in his (or my) situation feel less alone. Although, I don&#39;t think it would be much help considering his story ended.Not sure why I posted this comment. There&#39;s not much substance here other than evidence of another touched soul."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for this article and hit me really hard. My mom passed away unexpectedly a few weeks ago. She was just starting to enjoy retirement and time being a grandmom. Her journals were note books and mostly documents of what she had done in two year of retirement and things to do with the boys. It&#39;s so hard to look at the plans of things to come and what she was thinking of... like the planning of my oldest son&#39;s 9 3/4 birthday in a year because he&#39;s so in to Harry Potter. It&#39;s a unique treasure to see the inner workings of her mind and something I wish everyone got to experience after a parents passing. We&#39;ve left the stack of them out at her house so the rest of my siblings can go through them as the pass through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really moved me. My dad went through brain surgery last year and his four sons converged from around the country. We all barely speak to each other. A holographic will was produced, ten loose leaf pages in impossible handwriting, the last few pages written by him right before he went into surgery while his fourth wife held the pad and guided his hand with a pen. I wish we had conducted ourselves with grace, but two of my brothers are lawyers, so we&#39;re shouting at each other in his house while he&#39;s having a full craniotomy. Luckily he survived and is back somewhat in his faculties for now, and seems cognizant that he doesn&#39;t want to leave this strife behind between his wife and his kids. But this still made me choke up because there&#39;s not much anyone can do. I think about my dad&#39;s regrets and his father&#39;s and see them repeated in myself and my brothers. None of us knows what we&#39;re really doing, do we? We&#39;re all trying our best to pretend we have some control."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Agreed on all points.Interesting to see this:&gt; You can argue that all of this has existed for a very long time, back from the days of all kinds of toolbars and extensions that created multiple levels of address bar nesting in your web browser and taskbar.What I find ironic about the whole situation is, back then it was universally known that those toolbars and extensions are distributed by assholes. The whole software category was called by various pejorative names - &#34;adware&#34;, &#34;spyware&#34;, &#34;malware&#34;. There was a whole ecosystem of tools and tricks to get rid of them, as well as preventing them from being installed in the first place.Something weird happened over the past decade. We find ourselves in times where most mainstream software from renowned companies should be, by the standards of the toolbar era, classified as malware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is globally so true, but there is a major error:It is not &#34;needs of developers&#34; the problem, but the &#34;needs of product manager,  marketing, c-level asshole&#34;.Like for telemetry, most of the time the business side &#34;can&#34;, so they do.And again, for specific app and co, most developer would complain and not like release such user-hostile software but  they are forced by business to do it.Like this stupid project manager that thinks that his product/software is the most important in the world and there is no reason why a random user would not want to install it and also that the user computer belongs to him and to the company because he is using the product, without shame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man, I just ran into this. I work on a product that has a 3rd party API so other people can write plug-ins to extend the functionality of the app. It&#39;s great for users and developers. We received a bug report related to a particular plug-in, so I went to download their demo to see if the problem was on our end or theirs before contacting them. Here&#39;s how the process went:1) Go to their website and click &#34;Download&#34;
2) Prompted to enter email address with no way to opt out. Shit. Go to mailinator.com and create a fake email address to enter. Enter it.
3) Wait for them to send the real download link to my fake email.
4) It came in almost instantly. Great! Click on the link.
5) Click to download the installer package. Wait a few minutes.
6) Run the installer package.
7) It needs the same email address and password so it knows I&#39;m a &#34;legitimate user&#34; just to install the thing.
8) After entering it, it kicks me back to the web page for some reason. No idea what it&#39;s looking for or what I&#39;m supposed to do on the web site, so I go back to the installer. Oh it&#39;s not an installer. It&#39;s an installer installer. It&#39;s going to download the installer I want from a list of dozens of possible installers. Download the real installer.
9) Run the real installer - It lists dozens of products. Find the one I want. Install it.
10) Prompted for email and password again.And keep in mind this is all before I&#39;m actually a customer. I haven&#39;t paid anything and am trying to evaluate the software to determine if it fits my needs. (Or I would be if I were an end user.) Honestly, if this weren&#39;t for my job, I would have given up on step 2. Fuck these people. I&#39;m trying to save them time by seeing whether the bug is ours or theirs, but they&#39;re actively wasting mine and everyone else&#39;s who downloads this crap."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This happens to video games also. Publishers give review copies with microtransactions not included, the reviewers review it, and then shortly after release they add their free-to-play garbage so they get reviews that don&#39;t take the microtransactions into account and then they add it later.The also do it during ESRB submission to get around having to have a label that mentions in-game purchases. I&#39;m surprised ESRB lets them get away with it, actually.Jimquisition on it: https://youtu.be/9LeZ89_u2GcArticle on it: https://www.tweaktown.com/news/66889/publishers-delaying-mic..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is this not fraud?If you as a company source a device for reviewers and then change the specs in a way that you do not communicate, that is intent to defraud.If you bought a corvette because all the car reviews said it went 0-60 in 5 seconds, and then you buy one and it takes 10 seconds to do the same thing, you’d have a pretty good argument - especially if everyone else experienced your same situation.I’d be surprised if a class action suit or FTC investigation doesn’t happens within the next year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very happy to see that Sailfish keeps shipping because more alternatives are always good.I tried to use it a while ago (Sailfish 3) but was driven off it because of the huge gap between the marketing and the actual reality.The claim that they are privacy and security focused was total bogus (and perhaps someone can comment if it still is).To use the phone features, a Jolla account is needed, so it will &#34;ping home to Jolla&#34;. Privacy policy is pretty standard, so they reserve the right to track you all they want and of course, this is tied to your license, payment method etc. So much for privacy focused...What fully drove me off was that they launched full disk &#34;encryption&#34;, but the LUKS encryption-key password they used was the user&#39;s numeric pin (4-8 digits long). So encryption keys could be bruteforced by a kid and they seemed to be fine with it (I don&#39;t know if nowadays it supports a passphrase).Then I also learned that apps in the &#34;app-store&#34; were not signed in any way so impossible to certify that what you are installing is actually coming from the app repository etc. the phone was just lacking basic security all over the place.I hope they are closer now to closing the &#34;gap&#34; between their marketing and the reality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Has anyone experience with Sailfish? Can it run apps like Signal and WhatsApp? Is it stable?
I know the website says that it can, but I&#39;m looking for actual user feedback.EDIT: What about the KDE Connect app?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m confused. Where does this say the vaccine is mRNA? The Valneva VLA15 website explicitly states &#34;VLA15 is a multivalent recombinant protein vaccine&#34; [1], and the linked press release calls it a &#34;investigational multivalent protein subunit vaccine&#34;. Does nobody actually read these things?See [2], &#34;Subunit Vaccines&#34;.[1] https://valneva.com/research-development/lyme-disease/[2] https://www.niaid.nih.gov/research/vaccine-types"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prepare to read the headline &#34;mRNA vaccine trial for &lt;...&gt;&#34; a lot in the future. My guess is that they are going to produce mRNA versions of basically any vaccine (and then some) in the future. The nice thing about the technology seems to be that you only need to exchange the mRNA payload while the surrounding delivery method can be reused. That makes it not only a fast method to create a vaccine but a very convenient way as well. Nice side effect might be that for the next pandemic, we might have doses for everyone ready at the moment the trials are done.
Take that with a giant grain of salt because I&#39;m not in the industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually had Lyme disease when i was younger. Curiously enough, i didn&#39;t get the somewhat common rash after the tick bite, but instead it was discovered later, as a part of blood testing. I was submitted to that after my relatives had concerns about how lethargic i was being, as well as because i was experiencing joint pain, which the blood test later seemed to confirm.If i recall correctly, i was given antibiotics and felt pretty bad for a month onwards, though nowadays i&#39;m not aware of any lingering long term effects, apart from maybe my short term memory being slightly worse than i&#39;d expect it to. Of course, i think that in my case i had it pretty easy, since some other folks are known to develop symptoms that are considerably more worse. Whether there will be any lingering consequences in my future because of it, only time will tell.A vaccine would definitely be welcome, especially because of how common ticks are here in Eastern Europe - any walk in the forest might end with more than one of them on your clothes. If you have dogs, you&#39;ll probably have to remove dozens of those from their fur every summer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wrote the ad. Holy cow, I didn&#39;t expect to be #1 on Hacker News. Will answer any questions.Here&#39;s one you might ask: Why? I&#39;m pushing 60 and I&#39;ve attempted to interview for developer jobs over the last year. Got nowhere despite 40 years of experience. Getting really, really tired of this industry&#39;s attitude toward people like me.Based on questions below, I&#39;ll give a bit more. Earlier this year I had a personal referral into Facebook for a developer position. They do hiring centrally. A very young person in the HR department spoke to me, put me in the central database, and apparently shopped my experience around to a number of different groups. No takers. No one wanted to interview me, so the application died. Never did a tech assessment.So now I&#39;ve started a new group, and I expect this thing is going to generate a lot more money than any work at Facebook ever would. So Facebook did me a favor. Still, it rankles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The hiring process is in the form of a paid, short-term consulting gig that will lead to a full-time offer if we like you and you like us. We&#39;ll give you some tasks, you&#39;ll get them done, and then we&#39;ll talk. No need to quit your day job to do this gig; we&#39;ll work around your schedule.Interesting. I look forward to hearing if this works out long term. I&#39;d be worried about legal implications of something like this but IANAL."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I naively moved from New York to Silicon Valley when I was 52. Not saying there isn’t age discrimination in NYC, but here it’s a nightmare.The drop in my interview track record since  my 40s is stark. 2 years ago, after 6 months during which I failed to get 6 jobs for which I interviewed, I made it to the final round for a position at a startup and was subjected to the usual all-day grilling. The CEO was an older man and the hiring manager was in her late 40s, but all the other interviewers were in their early 20s. I left convinced I had nailed the interview and feeling optimistic. On the way home, the hiring manager, bless her soul, took the unusual step of calling to tell me the team had overruled her own enthusiasm for hiring me and she felt terrible about it. Without saying it in so many words, she made it plain it was because of my age.The age discrimination here extends beyond getting hired. I’ve been subject to cruel jokes and shunning in the workplace that, were I in another disenfranchised group, would be labeled workplace harassment and likely subject to strong discouragement by management at the very least.Some people in these comments ask the source of the age discrimination as if they are skeptical and astonished, Astonished!! such a thing could be going on. They look for a rational explanation. Here’s the explanation: we are tribal animals. From young people’s perspective, they are “Us” and we olds are “Them.”Sometimes young people are conscious of their hostility toward us and sometimes not, but that’s it. It requires no explanation more than that.It’s traumatic to be subjected to treatment like this, to the point I have stopped looking for a job. Humans are not built to tolerate constant social rejection, and it’s more important for me to be alive than to be wealthy. I’ve withdrawn from the tech world and started a business that will not make me and my family wealthy, but will support us, albeit with modest means.I hate the fact that I have become a bitter old man at 57!! I hate that Silicon Valley has come to this!!I’m working through my bitterness and will get over it someday. And I will have the good fortune to leave this dystopia."</p>
