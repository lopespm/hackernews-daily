								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought this was a pretty good thread (by an ex-Wikipedia lawyer) on Twitter about the IP meaning of Copilot.https://twitter.com/luis_in_brief/status/1410242882523459585...And this is a longer article about how IP and AI interact:https://ilr.law.uiowa.edu/print/volume-101-issue-2/copyright...I am not a lawyer, but I am capable of summarizing the thoughts of lawyers, so my take is that in general, fair use allows AI to be trained on copyrighted material, and humans who use this AI are not responsible for minor copyright infringement that happens accidentally as a result. However, this has not been tested in court in detail, so the consensus could change, and if you were extremely risk-averse you might want to avoid Copilot.A key quote from the second link:Copyright has concluded that reading by robots doesn’t count. Infringement is for humans only; when computers do it, it’s fair use.Personally, I think law should allow Copilot. As a human, I am allowed to read copyrighted code and learn from it. An AI should be allowed to do the same thing. And nobody cares if my ten-line &#34;how to invert a binary tree&#34; snippet is the same as someone else&#39;s. Nobody is really being hurt when a new tool makes it easier to copy little bits of code from the internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve given thousands of hours to open source projects, I really think open source is a pillar of modern society. So you would think I am all for something like copilot, but no.At first I thought this was a great feature, because easier access to code, but after some reflection, I am also very skeptical.I am able to make my code open source, because I can make a living out of it, and I have a lot of open source code that I love to share for things like education or private stuff, but if you want to use it for something real, you need to hire me. If you can suck all the code without even I noticing it, that&#39;s not fair.The other thing is code quality. I don&#39;t want to sound rude, but there are tons of bad code around. Not necessarily because the author is unskilled, but because the code might not need to be high quality (for example I wrote a script to sort my photos, it was very hastily written and specific to my usage, I used once and was done with it). Also, there are some bad/wrong pattern that are really popular.I am surprised you are able to DMCA a twitch stream because someone whistle india jones theme but in this case it is considered fair use."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Host Here. Thanks for sharing.Richard is a great story teller and adventures that SQLite has taken him on pretty interesting.  I think he in on hn as well ( @SQLite).One interesting thing I found about how SQLite is developed is the amount of testing that is done. Between unit tests and parameterized tests and fuzzer tests they are doing billions of tests per release and spending days running them before each release. I know I don&#39;t like to wait for a long CI build before I deploy a service but something like SQLite needs whole different category of resilience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;I&#39;m going to write my own mail server. I was making notes on that even as we were setting up this call. That&#39;s a big problem, and that&#39;s at least as difficult if not more difficult than writing a database engine, but I don&#39;t want to be beholden to Gmail. I don&#39;t want them controlling my destiny. I don&#39;t want them controlling the record of all of my conversations. I want to control that myself, and so I&#39;m going to go through a lot of pain and a lot of work and a lot of effort to come up with some solution that I can control myself. I can go out and lease a virtual machine out there in the cloud and run it myself and not depend on a third party to control my email.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; he managed to segfault every single database engine he tried, including SQLite, except for Postgres. Postgres always ran and gave the correct answer. We were never able to find a fault in that. The Postgres people tell me that we just weren’t trying hard enough. It is possible to fault Postgres, but we were very impressed.This is impressive for Postgres.SQLite is incredible.  I&#39;ve used it over the years in a variety of important projects."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I first heard about this in the context of software project estimation.The author (forgotten to me) made the point that nobody has permission to think about disasters when estimating project completion time.So why not explicitly ask them to? &#34;So now we have our estimate, what would cause us to miss it?&#34;And in the course of giant monster attacks, you give people permission to talk about specific scenarios that are actually very likely to derail the schedule.It was an interesting observation, vs the &#34;just multiply the everything goes right estimate by X&#34; method.If everyone else is being positive, no one wants to be the lone (realistic) downer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The basic premise of TIPS was that one could train engineers on solving problems, pretty much like martial arts trainers do: by exercising and learning tricks.Theory of Inventive Problem Solving nicely abbreviates as TIPS. That&#39;s how it has been known in the west for decades. ТРИЗ is a Russian acronym. TRIZ just replaces Cyrillic letters with equivalents. If the author digged a bit deeper, they would have known it and a few funny stories. Like the fact that Genrich Altshuller did not want his teaching to carry on once he dies, but fan groups of engineers existed until the fall of the Soviet union when many of their members emigrated and continued the TIPS cult following, selling  courses and software to large enterprises (Dassault, Lockheed Martin and the likes)."</p>

On my way out one of the porters silently approached me and said: “Schwarze-sama, we checked the weather forecast and there will be rain this evening. So here is an umbrella to take along. Also, we took the liberty of reserving a table at that restaurant you wanted to go. Oh and last thing: here is a city plan for you where we already detailed down the way to Fushimi Inari.” It goes without saying that the guy responsible for my shoes already set out my hiking shoes and not one of my city or evening shoes.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting, I was just finishing his biography and it was repeatedly mentioned how he was inspired by his trips to Kyoto and the Japanese Zen mindset in general. Also, his daughter and his son also wanted to visit Kyoto when Jobs asked them to pick a location upon graduation for the very same reasons.Personally, I loved Kyoto when I was in Japan for a week. It carries in itself an air of calm and serenity wherever you go.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;The companies were losing money and employees trying to satisfy Amazon and their constant abusive changes,” Tom Rask, an attorney for Last Mile and Triton, told Motherboard. &#34;You have to hire numerous drivers who may or may not be working. One day Amazon dictates that you have thirty routes, the next day forty, then the day after twenty. You’re supposed to have enough drivers for back-up while Amazon is lowering pay. Amazon’s actions are unlawful.&#34;Sounds miserable. Id shut down too if I was losing money with only 1 client.If this were freelancing it’d be like having to be always available for one client 40 hrs a week, but not knowing if you’ll get to bill 5 hrs or 50… while your rates constantly decrease. There’s no point in having this business"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is more or less how it should be. If Amazon isn&#39;t going to offer a good enough deal, then companies shouldn&#39;t move packages for them. As more and more people figure it out, other delivery companies will stop working with Amazon as well, although it may be that the deals work out better in places with lower cost-of-living, easier delivery routes (due to climate, geography, etc.), or other advantages.If some other delivery company can figure out how to make it work economically, then they can do the work instead.If nobody is interested in trying to make it work, Amazon will have to either improve the deal it offers or go back to using FedEx/UPS/USPS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, I guess I never really paid attention to the details behind all the Amazon headlines I see.&#34;In April, Amazon announced it would reduce the amount it paid for drivers from $17.25 to $16.00 an hour, according to the letter...Weeks later, Amazon announced a series of raises for its drivers around the country as part of a public relations push following a union drive at an Amazon warehouse&#34;&#34;Currently, Amazon delivery drivers are expected to deliver upwards of 400 packages a day on 10-hour routes that often extend up to 12 hours.&#34;400 seems crazy, I wondered about UPS. According to Google &#34;At UPS, the average driver makes about 120 deliveries per day, says Jack Levis, the shipping giant&#39;s director of process management&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Robinhood closed my brokerage account after I did transferred out assets (via ACATS transfer, to get a signup bonus with another brokerage without realizing capital gains).A few months later I asked how to reopen the account, using the &#34;reopen account&#34; form in their app to generate a support ticket. Three weeks later they sent an email saying that my account was permanently closed and I should apply for a new account. Replies to this email yielded a response saying that their email server was failing to accepting messages.So as requested I applied for a new account; the application stayed pending for three weeks, then I got an email autoreply telling me that my application is denied because I have a preexisting account (i.e. the old closed one). Replies to this email also yielded a response saying that their email server was failing to accepting messages.I filed a new support case explaining what had happened, what they told me to do, and asking what I should do next. No reply whatsoever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand that many give Robinhood crap because it is not &#34;sophisticated enough&#34; or because of the Gamestop fiasco. Although many startups like to claim that they are &#34;democratizing [x]&#34;, I honestly believe they did it. I have many friends that never traded before, and after they got their Robinhood account they feel comfortable enough to do it often. Even myself, who used to only trade a couple of times a year, started with $300 in my Robinhood account a few years back. Now I have at least ~60k that I rotate around in my Robinhood account on a daily/weekly basis. Yes there are other services that I now use or other apps that seems better, but for all intents and purposes, Robinhood did &#34;democratize&#34; trading for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember seeing their first public demo at LA Hacks in 2014. Seemed like a couple of kids right out of college. They had the iPhone&#39;s screen hooked up to the projector and one of their friends kept sending them silly text messages the whole time that they had to dismiss. This was before the Do Not Disturb feature came out.I remember wondering how it took so long for someone to make a half decent stock trading app for the iPhone -- all the other apps at the time sucked (and they largely still do). I was on ETrade before but signed up for the Robinhood waitlist immediately -- haven&#39;t left since being allowed in early 2015."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They&#39;re all strangely intention-less on every imaginable level. That can be unsettling.I&#39;ve listened to, and made, a lot of music like that. When I want to relax or think, I like music that engages me in some way but has a sort of drift, an ambient (in the Eno sense) quality even if it&#39;s slamming Berlin techno. It&#39;s different from the prog-rock I grew up with, which was difficult and loaded with intentionality.I ended up experimenting with music that was more generative, doing pretty sophisticated things with a degree of structure but without intentionality: always a random factor, a journey to an unknown goal (typical end result: wandering around for a while)AI art is like that. We see it wandering around for a while. It&#39;s getting better at picking up the trappings of identity, but persistently lacks intentionality.Maybe the trick is to supply the intentionality instead of the identity? Instead of &#39;creepy moat&#39;, a visual identity, make it do a painting of &#34;you are not going to survive and that&#39;s good&#34; or &#34;thank you but I am not worthy&#34;.If you have to feed it words, get a poet, don&#39;t describe the picture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very interesting. There is a principle with a lot of modern, abstract art, which is that the work is not complete until the viewer sees it - that is to say, the observer brings a portion of the meaning to the work. This AI art seems to go one step further, there isn&#39;t really an artist anymore, in the traditional sense. The creator of the work is more like an observer - choosing which output they like best. The &#34;artist&#34; becomes a consumer!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am not sure how to say this best, it probably sounds negative but I don’t mean it that way. It is really interesting because using these tools abstracts away the talent/skills part of creating art - you say your idea, and get the computer to keep showing you completed pieces until you find what you meant, or at least something you found interesting. It reminds me a bit of the role of the DJ to do the searching and curating, but not actually create the music.In fact you could imagine a musical version of this where the operator is describing feelings or styles and the AI is generating music to match where the operator wants to go."</p>

Both seem to have their own pros/cons.

If you look in my notebooks (digital or physical) there are sketches and images on almost every page."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I started seeing the value of this ideology recently. I have a really strict routine before I write a single line of code on a complex issue. All of these ways of thinking ultimately came out of efficiency gains I learned on my own in the kitchen. Prepare, then work. Trying to prepare while you work is chaos (but sometimes essential).The very first thing I do after finishing a design review narrative is to type up a list of discrete tasks that I plan to execute. These don&#39;t necessarily say what to do line-by-line, but draw out a very clear picture of what code areas are edited and what the dependency graphs look like. These also highlight specific configuration or other UX points to reference during testing. These task lists are specific enough that other developers could reliably execute them without any additional guidance.Then, I take a short break and review my task list when I return. 9/10 times I find I want to tweak it a little bit.After the final confirmation, I sent notification out to my team that I intend to execute the task listing so they have a super clear idea of what functionality to expect on the other side.I have found that this reduces my anxiety/stress by orders of magnitude throughout the day. Starting with visual studio and fumbling around various parts of the code base might be a good way to get your brain warmed up in the morning, but its certainly not a rational way to go about solving a complex problem.For trivial issues, production RCAs, etc., the process is certainly a little bit more streamlined than what I note above. This is more about how to do work on big tasks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This may seem obsessive-compulsive to others but the way I work on the computer, I close everything that I’m not immediately working on. No extra tabs, no bystander applications. I keep my desktop completely plain so that the only files I see are the ones I just produced/downloaded.I would rather go through the pain of reopening apps/websites than to have it lingering when I don’t need it right then.I don’t understand how people can have multiple windows of multiple browsers with multiple tabs open about things they aren’t working on while they work. The visual clutter overwhelms me quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This analogy kind of rubs me the wrong way.The whole point of knowledge work is that you are doing things that have not been done before. If they had, they would already be scaled or automated. In a chef analogy, you should be inventing new dishes, not running a meal service.A chef running a meal service is supposed to cook a meal for every order that comes back to the kitchen. A knowledge worker is not supposed to handle every little request that comes their way. As a knowledge worker, if you’re not disappointing some people, you are probably not doing your best.If you are overwhelmed with tasks as a knowledge worker, the solution is not to seek greater efficiency in handling them. The solution is to do incredible work on the ones that actually matter, and half-ass or ignore the rest. If you’re not sure which is which, finding out is job #1.People who efficiently do everything they are asked are rewarded with more asks. People who do great high-impact work are not held back because they dropped some emails along the way.I’m not saying it’s bad to be efficient at processing email and tracking requests, I’m just saying it probably matters less than many people think, and almost certainly less than this article implies."</p>
