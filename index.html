								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d extend this even further: never use a single account for more than one purpose. Create a separate account at the same company for the other purpose. Some examples:- Every product/project you manage should be on a separate account on Google, Facebook, Amazon, etc.- Nothing tied to your consumer accounts should be used for anything business related.- Your Amazon shopping account and your AWS account should definitely not be the same account.- Don&#39;t use services where you&#39;re required to mix accounts like this.Some examples:- If the issue in this thread is actually an automatic ban, account siloing very likely would have avoided the issue. ([edit] likely, it would not have been possible to silo accounts in this case, as a child comment points out)- Facebook apparently lacks the willingness to block an account from Marketplace, but they will block an account from all Facebook properties.- Paypal has banned businesses because the account was created years ago by someone who at the time the account was created was 17.The point of this isn&#39;t that it&#39;s impossible to connect the dots that you are the same person. The point is to make it difficult for an automated system to deal too much damage to you, and make it difficult for someone looking at a single account&#39;s history from accumulating too many &#34;strikes&#34; against that account."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With the way the system is designed, it&#39;s trivial to game the system in such a way that your ad-supported competitors get purged from the play store. Just extract the AdMob ID and submit it to click farms all around the world, and within a few days your competitor should be dropped from AdSense forever.Like any Google product, partnering with them is a major risk for your business continuity. I&#39;d never combine Google Ads and Google Play, just like I wouldn&#39;t combine a Google-hosted email domain with a Play account. Hell, even a Youtube account that&#39;s shared with your personal email is a data risk.I do wonder what happened to get the app flagged. Maybe someone found a way to use the app to automate their ad fraud (it&#39;s an IDE after all), and Google determined this app to be the culprit? Maybe one of the app&#39;s dependencies had a piece of malware added? Who knows at this point. Google&#39;s lack of transparency makes it impossible to build any sort of business on their products. I don&#39;t get why people still try to do so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Four months ago a friend of mine had his Google account suspended with a vague message about a terms of service violation. He escalated and appealed it with my help. It was no use. He lost everything. Files. Photos. Email. Calendar. Even his business domain registrations. He was paying for Google services like YouTube and storage. He couldn’t even get a download of his data.This is why I never used Google Cloud. I’ve heard these stories for years. You can lose everything and have no recourse. It’s not worth it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Collins&#39; role in Apollo 11 is often minimized in the public conciseness, but I find it particularly fascinating from a human perspective.  In certain ways it seems even scarier than Armstrong&#39;s and Aldrin&#39;s jobs.  They at least had more direct control over their success in landing on the moon.  Collins was largely powerless to help if something went wrong.  If that did happen, he would have been faced with the choice of abandoning his crewmates to die on the moon and fly back to Earth himself.  Meanwhile no one had ever been as far from other life as he was on that flight.  When he was on the far side of the moon he was truly alone in a way that no other person had ever been in human history."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always thought the CSM commanders had the most incredible and challenging role of the three Apollo astronauts. They were undoubtedly the &#34;most alone&#34; humans ever — at least on a physical level.  Every other hour they&#39;d transit to the far side of the moon and would be 2200 miles (3600km) away from the nearest two humans and hundreds of thousands of miles/km away from everyone else who&#39;s ever lived.  Not only that, they lost radio contact.  The silence and solitude must have been wild.For upwards of three days.From the NYT obit:“I am alone now, truly alone, and absolutely isolated from any known life,” [Collins] wrote in recreating his thoughts for his 1974 memoir, “Carrying the Fire.”“If a count were taken, the score would be three billion plus two over on the other side of the moon, and one plus God only knows what on this side,” he added. “I like the feeling. Outside my window I can see stars — and that is all. Where I know the moon to be, there is simply a black void.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love the photo he took, where in the frame there was literally every human who was alive and has ever lived, except Michael Collins himself:https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/imgcat/html/object_page/a11_h_44..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article seems to make fantastic jumps from the believable -- mortality from overall air pollution (e.g. in Delhi) to the frankly unbelievable -- your ultrasonic humidifier supposedly reducing your life by nearly an hour each night, or that a daily commute between Newark and NYC takes half a year off your life.According to this logic, anyone who works in the subway should be dying, what, 10 years earlier? Which is obviously not happening.Similarly, it seems impossible to believe that the minerals in the air from humidifiers are equivalently dangerous to factory pollution or cigarette smoke. Different categories of particles are going to affect the body differently, no? I mean, our body requires minerals -- we&#39;re drinking them in our water all day long -- while certain factories may be belching out straight-up poison.These statistics are just not passing the smell test. They seem to be extrapolations of extrapolations of extrapolations. This article&#39;s conclusions don&#39;t seem even remotely convincing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for this extensive resource on air quality. Yes, it needs to get more attention as it is one of the main drivers of mortality of environmental risks.One thing one has to bear in mind is that often when you optmize your home for low PM (e.g. with air purifiers and fixing of air leackage) your CO2 will get very high causing headaches and reduce cognitive performance.So it always makes sense for indoor air quality monitoring to measure PM and CO2 in parallel.We have open source, open hardware build instructions for a very reliable Air quality sensor that can be used to measure PM2.5 and also CO2 [1]. It is very accurate for the fraction of the costs of commercial sensors. You can build it for less than USD 20 (or with CO2 for less than USD 50) and send the data to our cloud server or any other backend.I am more than happy to send you some free PCBs (you just paypal me the cost of the postage) and you can build your own sensor and log the data. Contact me if you are interested.[1] https://www.airgradient.com/diy/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest pitfall I see with this is we’re extrapolating from large doses of air pollution to very tiny ones.Clearly we have enough evidence to say that smoking a pack a day or living in a smog-filled city will cut years off your life. But we would need truly gigantic samples to show that blowing birthday candles or broiling fish once a week will cut weeks off your life.Instead these conclusions are being derived on linear extrapolations from large air particulate doses. Yet many things in biology follow the principal of hormesis, where a small dose or a toxin may be harmless or even helpful.Similar models have been used for years and are still the gold standard when predicting the health effects of radiation exposure. Yet mountains of evidence show that radiation workers, who are regularly exposed to small dosages of otherwise harmful regulation do not have anywhere near the cancer rates we’d expect from the linear extrapolation models."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You can have third-party Android app stores. Can you say the same about Apple? While I agree that Google has market-dominance, they are not anti-competition or anti-consumer in the same sense as Apple. Android is open source, Chrome OS is open source, etc. Google is actually providing and contributing something back to the community. Apple intentionally locks people to specific hardware and to their app store."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This report is somewhat bipolar. On one hand it&#39;s arguing that Google and Apple exert too much control over smartphone app marketplaces.On the other hand its proposed remedy asks that Google and Apple exert even more control over these app marketplaces by stamping down on anti-consumer practices like subscription traps and scams.On the other other hand it proposes that Apple and Google should allow third party payment options, making it harder for Google and Apple to thwart subscription traps and scams."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The ACCC has put forward a series of potential measures in response to its findings, including that consumers be able to rate and review all apps, that consumers have the ability to change any pre-installed default app on their device, that app developers be allowed to provide consumers with information about alternative payment options and that information collected by Apple and Google in their capacity as app marketplace operators be ring-fenced from their other operations.Does anyone know what power the ACCC has to make these more than just &#34;proposed&#34;? I&#39;m not familiar with it&#39;s role in the Australian political system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The internet is split roughly into 3. The top 100 websites get a third of the page views, the remaining top 10k get another third and millions of websites get the last third.The top 100 have dedicated engineering and policy teams teams that will disable FLoC because they&#39;re either not interested in ads (Wikipedia) or have their own first party implementation that doesn&#39;t need FLoC (Facebook). They&#39;ll ditch FLoC.The next 10k might have engineering teams that can make the change, but might be more interested in finding out about their audience so they can monetize more easily. They&#39;ll keep FLoC.As for the remaining millions, only a tiny minority of them will even know this is a thing, let alone care enough to make the change or contact a developer who can do it. These are the folks who have hosted their wordpress site with GoDaddy because it was cheap and quick when they needed a site. They&#39;ll keep FLoC.So the upshot is that github.com, instagram.com and amazon.com might opt out, but the vast majority of the web will not. Me prediction is that at least half of all web pages loaded by users won&#39;t have this header."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"alright 41 comments and everyone seems to know what FLoC is so i’ll be that guy.What is FLoC and whats the big deal?I googled https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/30/22358287/privacy-ads-goog...  and it seems like an attempt by Google to add proprietary cohort based tracking to replace third party cookies. well intentioned but could have flaws. anything else i should know?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FLoC is basically something implemented in a browser. Why website owner should be bothered by it? If client decided to use browser with FLoC than it&#39;s their decision. The only interesting thing might be to inform user that they are using shitty browser that doesn&#39;t respect their privacy and make sure that website works in other browsers.What if Google decides that they will ignore that header? Is there anything preventing them from doing that? Do we know why they decided to even implement this &#34;workaround&#34; with header?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s unlikely that prosecutors don&#39;t realize how Signal works.  It&#39;s more likely they assume that, much like the rest of the tech world, there has been an increase in data collection efforts and they want to test the waters again to confirm/deny this data is available via Signal internals.  Subpoenas are the only mechanism by which they&#39;re able to do so.  That Signal are able to pivot to the media and say &#34;yup, still court-tested, still privacy-focused&#34; is a good thing for Signal.  No need for the derisive tone I don&#39;t think."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s probably unwise to think prosecutors and federal agents are stupid. They were in the 1990s crypto wars, but not now. What we tend to perceive as &#39;stupid&#39; is in reality, &#39;powerful.&#39; They don&#39;t need to explain themselves, because they put the onus of compliance on you.Gaming out the subpoena, Signal does not have this user information because it does not exist, but it does have server locations, 3rd party service providers relationships, and staff who can all be dragged into the process and system, where they can be charged with other arbitrary process crimes to put pressure on them.It&#39;s a mistake to interpret any official action as a serial, single point transactional request. Like mice, if you think you see one, you have, and it&#39;s guaranteed there are many more behind it. Given where they have used the action to draw your attention, where in relief is the second part of the pinch or funnel they are creating?If the legal system wants to destroy you, they can and do. Signal has antagonized them, and the current political climate is all about getting rid of any resistance to official powers and their unofficial private arms. Politically, there is ample incentive to take out Signal and cause users to switch to more amenable apps from friendly platform companies. They may even be able to compel friendly app stores to patch apps before they are distributed.To me, this subpoena looks like the Cellebrite takedown was analogous to injuring a cop, where the response will likely be disproportionate and even extra-legal, because it is about maintaining public perception and belief."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The subpoena is from Homeland Security Investigations at LAX airport.They deal specifically with crimes that involve international transport. So this is human trafficking, drug smuggling, money mules, etc.To be honest the rest of it is just standard &#34;we have some phone numbers&#34; boilerplate. Same thing was probably sent to Facebook, Twitter, etc. with the hopes that someone was dumb enough to login and check their messages from a burner phone.Edit: Rereading it, this is a grand jury. They likely already know the who, what, why, and how. Signal&#39;s response will go to support other evidence that they may have recovered from cell phones or cell network. Grand juries historically result in a 95%+ chance of indictment so this isn&#39;t a fishing expedition."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/02/gop-plan-for-bro...Remember that Republicans tried to ban municipal broadband federally only two months ago! Just an absurdly, transparently corrupt move."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you are a software engineer, working on municipal broadband or starting a local ISP is a really intense way to expand your skills.For the past year, I&#39;ve been volunteering at NYC Mesh (nycmesh.net), which is a non-profit that provides fixed wireless broadband in New York. I thought I knew a thing or two about networking — hell, I&#39;ve even given a talk in the network track at LinuxCon in the past — but working on NYC Mesh really showed me the limits of that knowledge and has helped me learn a ton more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Municipal broadband really isn&#39;t the solution here. Sure, it&#39;s miles better than private infra, but we down here in NZ have a much better solution. (Not claiming we invented it, of course.)In 2011, Central government started a big infrastructure project to roll fibre out to ~80% of the population. (Called UFB - ultra fast broadband.) However instead of making this just be state owned, the money was paid as cheap loans with a competitive bid system. Companies bidding had to agree to a significant number of regulations, including a requirement to not act as an ISP and to offer wholesale access to the network for a set fee. They could also offer their own services above and beyond the regulated maximum.So to start an ISP in NZ, all you need is some national and international transit, and at least one server to do billing and core routing. As a result, we have dozens of major, actually good ISPs and many more niche ones. Most of them service the whole country - at least the UFB service area.I actually like my ISP. I have IPv6 and a static public IPv4. Peering is excellent and international bandwidth plentiful. Gigabit bandwidth with no usage call and no fair use policy (at least no policy regarding days usage).Municipal internet is great until you realize you just turned a monopoly into a duopoly. Without competition, what drive your new ISP to do better? If you&#39;re super lucky, the goodness of their hearts, I guess. Because you know the old incumbent will just match the new ISP and do not better.EDIT: Folks in other threads have pointed out how bad US government bodies have historically been at investing in infrastructure maintenance. I&#39;d like to note that the NZ model neatly deals with those concerns too. The companies which build out the networks are made the owners presumably when the loans are paid off. These companies become very profitable even though they can&#39;t become ISPs themselves, and are thus heavily incentivized to invest their profits back into their networks to keep them working well and to come up with new products to sell. Already a NZ fibre company has deployed 10gbit fibre commercially, with no extra government support."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re lucky that we can still catch some of them now. The current status of closed CPUs running proprietary firmware talking with closed chipsets running proprietary firmware blobs would make trivially easy to move the malware injection to the iron level for agencies funded by governments. Once they accomplish it, detecting their spyware using software, at any privilege level, will become impossible.
I fear the scenario in which magic packets with a signature that turns off detection in network hardware (proprietary firmware) and interfaces (again, proprietary firmware) can directly instruct a system (proprietary firmware) unbeknownst to the user; it seems impossible today, however all it takes is having enough closed software and firmware so that a covert channel can be created from the CPU to the external world. Governments have enough funds and motivation to tell most network iron manufacturers to produce hardware according to some additional specifications."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Love the idea, enjoyed the interface, but I feel my time was wasted when I only found out the US focus several clicks into the flow. Speaking as someone not from the US, I do wish more websites didn&#39;t just assume that all their traffic was coming from the US. You could alleviate this by having a flag on the home page saying &#34;This is really more for Americans only&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would suggest the first step of onboarding should not be the selection of your theme. This is already a long onboarding process and every additional step will lose you users. When you build something you&#39;re technically proud of, it makes sense you&#39;d like to show it off, but you have to evaluate its relative importance to your public."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tough crowd.  I think this looks great.  I&#39;ve been managing these sorts of calculations manually, and I think there&#39;s definitely a market for better tools in the financial planning space.  (I agree with removing the theme selector though.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In a previous role I worked, law enforcement would send over requests for information from time to time. Once my scripts became better at gathering information requests turned from providing highly specific information (ex: details about this individual, on this date and time doing this particular action) to blanket statements (we think this person is called X or Y - can we get all info covering these two years).General security/crime prevention concerns were being provided as reasons for these searches. I had voiced my concern to my managers but they said as long as we had a paper trail which clearly tied each request to the info provided, they didn&#39;t really care. I left the place shortly afterwards, but it highlights, I think, how quickly these things spiral out of control. How specific turns general, how true belief turns into mere suspicion or blanket statements (ex - everyone in THAT area is a criminal so we need all the info)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The company claimed that the patches had “been released to address a recently identified security vulnerability. The security patch strengthens the protections of the solutions.” However, Vice also reports that the company did not “specifically say whether the addressed vulnerability is one and the same as the one disclosed by Marlinspike.”IIRC Marlinspike didn&#39;t disclose one vulnerability, but a massive class of them: Cellebrite must process media in every possible format and thus relies on components from outside sources, FFmpeg being just one example. Cellebrite inherits security vulnerabilities from all those components, and doesn&#39;t appear to be diligent in keeping them patched (not that a perfect record of patching would protect them - the attack surface is enormous and probably most component developers don&#39;t provide sufficient security).Integrating insecure code is likely a necessary decision for Cellebrite: Writing, maintaining, and updating their own code to process all types of media, and keep up-to-date with all changes to all those types of the media, seems impossible and certainly uneconomical. What could they do? Maybe they could sandbox each component but then they&#39;d need a lot of horsepower in their device."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Previously, data extraction was primarily used in only certain types of cases—typically child pornography or, sometimes, drug offenses. Now, however, cops’ first move is typically to find some sort of incriminating evidence on a suspect’s cell phone, he said, regardless of what kind of case it is....What? Are cops frequently scanning people’s entire phones as a first move now? I had heard that this occasionally happened at borders or with serious crimes, but I had no idea it was this widespread."</p>
