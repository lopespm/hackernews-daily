								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Question: does anyone actually know what DDG does with user data? Like they market themselves as a &#34;privacy respecting&#34; search engine, but how much of this is truth?I&#39;d imagine there&#39;s good money in convincing people they have privacy because then they&#39;ll provide more interesting data.Has the company ever been audited? Why should they be trusted to not compromise user privacy? Imo at least Google is honest: you know when you use their products as intended you have no privacy, and they don&#39;t try to hide thisEdit: since DDG isn&#39;t open source like searx, how do we know there is ANY truth to their marketing claims?Edit: Just for accuracy, the browser extensions are open source. But as far as I know, the actual search engine isn&#39;tEdit: They made over 100 million in 2020. They clearly can (and should) get an independent audit. It&#39;s shocking that they haven&#39;t had a single audit. Even startpage has"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s amazing how much collateral damage is caused by our horrible copyright laws. Mostly just so the MPA/RIAA can protect their roles as gatekeepers of what we&#39;re allowed to see and hear.They can put enormous pressure on even the wealthiest and most powerful companies to act as copyright police on their behalf. Even Google is afraid of them. ISPs are forced to spend huge amounts of time and money working for them. Now duckduckgo is being strong armed into doing a bunch of free work for them too? Maintaining lists of websites and domains to block and removing links to even non-infringing material like youtube-dl just to keep from being sued into the ground.I don&#39;t know what it&#39;ll take to rein in these guys, but I doubt the courts will be the ones to do it. So far courts seem fine with the idea that ISPs must permanently ban users from their service over nothing but repeated unsubstantiated claims of infringements which is an insane amount of power to give any industry.Has any US politician ever run on a platform that includes copyright reform?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As for the YouTube-DL part specifically, I&#39;m pretty sure that&#39;s a side-effect of them being dependent upon Bing for the actual index: https://www.bing.com/search?q=site%3Ayoutube-dl.orgAlso, _come on_; if someone gives up after one search term, which also includes advanced site-restricting syntax, there&#39;s no way they&#39;d be able to operate youtube-dl anyway: https://duckduckgo.com/?q=youtube-dl&amp;ia=web"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is like the Framework laptop but it&#39;s a UK-based company that has been around for years, and with an explicit focus on Linux compatibility to boot. I&#39;m surprised I haven&#39;t come across them before as I&#39;ve been looking for Linux-compatible laptops for years.They do some things better than Framework such as supporting Ryzen processors, and seem a bit cheaper overall. The battery life seems like it would be better. They have a spare parts store as well and a full disassembly guide as well as an &#34;open warranty&#34;. I was never a fan of Framework&#39;s swappable ports.The biggest disadvantage seems to be that the screen is bog-standard 16:9.I&#39;m curious on the quality of the speakers, webcam, keyboard, and trackpad. I have a feeling they will not be great - in comparison to a Macbook at any rate.From reviews it looks like the trackpad is poor because it is not whole-trackpad clickable, and the keyboard is also poor due to the short key travel.Are there any other decent alternatives available in the UK?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got one of these in December 2021 and frankly love it. Got fed up with being pretty much the only person on earth who had a shitty experience with Apple Silicon, so jumped back to Linux after 17 years away. I don’t use it as a portable, or at least haven’t yet - it’s my daily driver for work and permanently plugged in to a monitor (which also is a USB hub). I opted for Manjaro and enjoy using it way more than I did the M1 macbook pro it replaced.I really like that they provide a detailed pictorial complete disassembly guide: https://support.starlabs.systems/kb/guides/starbook-mk-v-com..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangantially related, I remember reading the Asahi Linux wiki [0], and was shocked by this statement about Apple Silicon machines. It&#39;s fascinating that Apple has a reputation for being anti-libre, yet the hardware they built is arguably very libre-friendly.&gt; This puts them somewhere between x86 PCs and a libre-first system like the Talos II in terms of freedom to replace firmware and boot components; while a number of blobs are required in order to boot the system, none of those have the ability to take over the OS or compromise it post-boot (unlike, say, Intel ME and AMD PSP on recent systems, or the DMA-capable chips on the LPC bus running opaque blobs that exist on even old ThinkPads).&gt; From a security perspective, these machines may possibly qualify as the most secure general purpose computers available to the public which support third-party OSes, in terms of resistance to attack by non-owners.[0]: https://github.com/AsahiLinux/docs/wiki/Introduction-to-Appl..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After reading Wim Hof and James Nestor a couple years ago during the pandemic, I used their techniques in full while battling long Covid.I had a blood pressure monitor and pulse oximeter on my bedside table that I would experiment with doing these various techniques and seeing my heart rate go down, my blood pressure go down, my anxiety would disappear, lung/chest inflammation would settle, and even oxygen levels increase up to 5%.I did this primarily because Covid reduced my average running mile time by around 20%. I was hopeful that I could make a full recovery which I did and then some.This new tool I believe saved my life, and I’m excited to use it for the rest of it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; not necessarily meant to replace exerciseI&#39;m hoping someone can answer a question to which I&#39;ve never heard a really satisfactory answer:  Why does human health benefit from exercise whereas any kind of simple machine wears out with exercise? For example, doing a hundred stretches per day improves my health whereas stretching an elastic band 100 times per day will cause it to lose elasticity and soon destroy it. So what&#39;s the low-level mechanism by which exercise improves health in people but not in simple machines?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want to learn more about breathing I recommend checking out the book The Oxygen Advantage by Patrick Mckeown. It&#39;s got a bunch of different breathing exercises and ways to measure progress. It basically reteaches you how to breath too, which is fascinating on its own.  Worth checking out for sure.https://www.amazon.com/Oxygen-Advantage-Scientifically-Breat..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Disclosure: I own FREQ stock.The failure of the prior trial was suspected, and I believe it, due to a refractory response by overdosing the inner ear with too frequent administrations of the drug, and then testing for effect too soon. I bet even those candidates of the phase IIa trial though would, if checked on now, show some improvement.Animal research has shown that natural cochlear hair cell regeneration and resultant hearing restoration is very real, we mammals just don&#39;t have the natural cellular signaling to redifferentiate those base cells - small molecule drugs like FX322 do exactly that. I am optimistic they&#39;ll eventually find the right dosing regimen to see reliable and optimal clinical effect, and it will be a seismic advance in medicine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article says the treatment focuses on increased speech intelligibility. Speech, depending on how you define it, can occupy a fairly narrow range of the audio spectrum that humans can perceive.My hearing loss is mostly on the high end (10-12K and above) and impedes my ability to hear speech in noisy environments. More troubling has been the inability to enjoy music/sound in those upper ranges, resulting in the music lacking a certain sparkle and brilliance.I hope this therapy regenerates hair cells across the entire spectrum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anybody suffering with tinnitus I highly recommend the protocol William Shatner went through. You can train your brain so it’s not noticeable any more. Like wearing pants, it fades into the background."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some points from the All in Pod.1. The Twitter board of directors has become a status thing. It&#39;s like a country club. They don&#39;t have real skin in the game; they don&#39;t own much stock. They&#39;re not aligned with the shareholders. It&#39;s about status and cultural power.2. Why should we believe that the company will become more valuable when the stock price is where it was way back in December 2013? Compare to how the S&amp;P or Tesla did during this period. Twitter has languished for a long time.3. They should put it to shareholder vote.4. One AI engineer from Tesla could solve Twitter&#39;s bot and spam problem.5. The elites have somehow inverted history so they now believe that it is not censorship that is the favored tool of fascists and authoritarians, even though every fascist and despot in history used censorship to maintain power, but instead believe free speech, free discourse, and free thought are the instruments of repression."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even before the poison pill was adopted, the evidence is the market wasn&#39;t taking Musk&#39;s offer seriously. That&#39;s because he was offering $54.20 per share (ha ha, 420), but the stock price never closed higher than $48.36. So almost $6/share was left on the table.Part of it is that Musk doesn&#39;t have $43B in cash, he&#39;d have to raise it or borrow it. He&#39;s worth more than that but it isn&#39;t liquid; as an officer of Tesla there are some restrictions on when he can trade. Another part is that many doubt whether Musk is serious or if he is playing games again, like the last time &#34;420&#34; appeared in a financial announcement from him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, I&#39;m not very corporate savvy and this might be a very stupid question. Is there a NON-culture/political reason for all the push back against Musk buying Twitter? From the read, this just seem to be opening the door for someone else to try and take majority control and pining away for the days of Dorsey (which, if looked at objectively, weren&#39;t great... just filling an opportunity)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find sponge really useful. Have you ever wanted to process a file through a pipeline and write the output back to the file? If you do it the naive way, it won’t work, and you’ll end up losing the contents of your file:    awk &#39;{do_stuff()}&#39; myfile.txt | sort -u | column --table &gt; myfile.txt

The shell will truncate myfile.txt before awk (or whatever command) has a chance to read it. So you can use sponge instead, which waits until it reads EOF to truncate/write the file.    awk &#39;{do_stuff()}&#39; myfile.txt | sort -u | column --table | sponge myfile.txt"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The one I use the most is `vipe`.&gt; vipe: insert a text editor into a pipeIt&#39;s useful when you want to edit some input text before passing it to a different function. For example, if I want to delete many of my git branches (but not all my git branches):  $ git branch | vipe | xargs git branch -D

`vipe` will let me remove some of the branch names from the list, before they get passed to the delete command."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; errno: look up errno names and descriptionsI like this. Reminds me of a couple very useful things I&#39;ve done:1. Add a -man switch to command line programs. This causes a browser to be opened on the web page for the program. For example:    dmd -man

opens https://dlang.org/dmd-windows.html in your default browser.2. Fix my text editor to recognize URLs, and when clicking on the URL, open a browser on it. This silly little thing is amazingly useful. I used to keep bookmarks in an html file which I would bring up in a browser and then click on the bookmarks. It&#39;s so much easier to just put them in a plain text file as plain text. I also use it for source code, for example the header for code files starts with:    /*
     * Takes a token stream from the lexer, and parses it into an abstract syntax tree.
     *

I think there&#39;s some room to improve here, e.g. an AR ghost overlay of previous frames as well as ML extracted frames from pure paper without having to print a template (both of which I believe are feasible). But overall I love that people are experimenting with this stuff (and wouldn&#39;t want to react negatively here in any way to discourage this type of work).Some might argue moving from digital to pen and paper is a step down but I&#39;d argue the opposite. I&#39;d love and look forward to a possible future where we move digital advancements into the analog world in this way. As Theil says you can barely tell the difference between this world and the 80s if you remove cell phones and computers, but things like this are a cool way to hopefully get us closer to computers aiding more natural forms of interaction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi Dominic, thanks for open sourcing the library. I have quite a few questions though:1. Marijn has built an awesome open source richtext library (https://prosemirror.net/) which has a huge plugin ecosystem and bindings with a bunch of front-end frameworks (including React). Is there any specific motivation behind building one from scratch?2. How is this different from Facebook&#39;s own DraftJS lib?3. What&#39;s the story of realtime collaboration support with OT/CRDT? Prosemirror had this in mind when designing its state model and delta model, so it comes with out of the box support for realtime collaborations. Can we expect the same with Lexical?4. What&#39;s the cross platform strategy for Lexical? If I store the editor&#39;s state as JSON on the server, how will I render it on devices and native desktop apps?We&#39;ve built our own library on top of Prosemirror to power the comments and feedback sections of Zoho Writer - https://writer.zoho.comI&#39;m always looking out for better approaches/alternatives in this space and I&#39;m curious how different Lexical is. Thanks!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the big frustrations with DraftJS is that Facebook moved on (which is understandable), but the core repo wasn’t given control to the community, so patches and updates couldn’t be pulled in. Obviously it’s open source and could be hard forked, but that’s not ideal.I’d be curious if there are plans internally to make sure Lexical continues
to be supported by Facebook and doesn’t end up with the same fate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The examples shown on the site are code editing. Which puts it in direct competition with the more established Monaco from Microsoft [1].Competition is welcome, but the description sounds like this is more of a library than a finished product (which Monaco isn&#39;t), and if so, some examples showing how to take advantage of that would have been helpful.[1] https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/"</p>
