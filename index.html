								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few years ago, Bing had a bunch of tools for developers: base64/HTML/URL codec, ASCII table, QR code generator, color picker, formatters, even the ability to run code in the browser on the servers of an online judge (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11450385)One day they all just disappeared. I actually wasn&#39;t the only one who noticed (https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-bing/what-h...)I think I know why: the Bing blog implies that most of it was the passion project of a couple of summer interns in 2015. Probably it simply broke at some point, and no one was around to even notice.https://blogs.bing.com/search/2015/09/02/bing-rocks-two-new-...https://blogs.bing.com/search/2015/10/08/bing-adds-more-tool...Here&#39;s a larger list of Bing&#39;s search features in various domains from 2018. Most are now inactive. There apparently was a timer as well. https://old.reddit.com/r/bing/comments/9oct9o/psa_search_for..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is almost certainly an accident. I remember when the Search SRE team got paged because some simple math formula wasn&#39;t giving am answer box. Something like 42+7 giving 49. Turns out that this was getting classified as &#34;porn seeking&#34; and giving an empty results page if Safe Search was on. This probably would have never been noticed if there wasn&#39;t a end-to-end prober test because this particular formula was an example in the Google Home instruction pamphlet.Search is very a complex system and quite possibly there is a poor SRE looking into this right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great job!I can sort of relate. I worked on an infrastructure system, almost entirely alone, for ten years, before it was finally taken over by a capable team, and I was able to step away, and it took on a life of its own. It is now a worldwide standard, used daily, by thousands.I say “sort of,” because it was never something I planned to make money on. It filled a need. Also, and it’s a long story, I had to weather a fairly hefty level of abuse during that time. The demographics of the target user base were … challenging.It’s all good, now.One thing all that time brought me, was a really high-Quality product. Lots of time to squash bugs, and iterate the UX."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice project. I can relate in that I have my own personal hobby project that I have been working on for years and I would like to get many more users trying it out.Mine is a new kind of data management system that can manage unstructured, structured, and semi-structured data. Think of it as a file system, database, and NoSql system all rolled into one. It is currently in open beta at https://didgets.com/You say you have &#39;finished it&#39;. Software is never finished, but if you have checked off all the feature items from your design, then close enough for now. With my project, the TODO list is still extremely long. It can do many things already, but I seem to put two more items on the list every time I cross one off.It seems that every solo, multi-year project goes through the phases you describe (burn out, depression, questioning your sanity, etc.) and mine is no exception. It still feels very self-fulfilling every time I get a major piece working or I blow away the alternative in a speed test."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great project! Love the focus on speed as well compared to other web IDE competitors out there.However, that carefree plan 8 lines of code thing seems ridiculous, no? Most of the templates are already longer than 8 lines.. I think if you just removed many of the other &#34;nice-to-have&#34; features like publishing, npm packages, etc. but made it unlimited lines of code / time per day, the free plan would be much more compelling!Also i agree with the other commentors that the logos on the homepage are a bit off-putting. I&#39;d prefix it with &#34;Used by engineers at...&#34;, as others have suggested as well.All in all great job though!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been thinking it&#39;s time to start moving away from that damn site.- If I actually want to start conversations, I get a lot more comments on HN or Reddit- When I was a job searcher, the idea of just being able to apply from my profile was really cool. Except every job just re-directed you to some form that wanted you to upload a resume anyway.- Of the handful of potential clients who have found me there, none have ended up signing a contract. Better odds just talking on random slack channels.- It&#39;s getting more and more cringe. Call me a prude but it&#39;s really tacky when people post photos of stuff like their wife and their baby asleep on the couch. Do you really want to post your families intimate moments to get likes on a &#34;professional&#34; social network?- If I&#39;m honest with myself I realise that I just replaced my addiction to one blue site (FB) with another.Anyway add me on LinkedIn!! https://www.linkedin.com/in/lewisandrewcampbell/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bit of tangent, but it reminds me of a funny story:I discovered one day that I am getting recommended &#34;Long distance truck driver&#34; jobs through email and some of the re-targeted ads. First, I ignored them, but in a week or two, it became apparent that it was not just a coincidence.  After some research, I realized that I had listed &#34;Device Driver&#34; programming as a skill on my LinkedIn and personal website. I suspect it must have been crawled, and the word &#34;Driver&#34; was matched to send me those recommendations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It appears that LinkedIn is automatically importing job postings from other places on LinkedIn and other sites such as angel.co if the company name of the job posting matches your company name on LinkedIn.The irony when LinkedIn get so upset about people scraping their website."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have a car and absolutely hate the car-centric culture of American cities (I live in SF).That being said, this article is completely wrong and draws the wrong conclusions. People were anti-car early on because most people didn&#39;t have cars. Later, people stopped being anti-car because most people had cars. The article would have you believe that at no point in time did the majority of people want car-centric city streets and that it was forced on them by a small minority of people interested in selling cars. That simply isn&#39;t the case. Vocal opposition to cars faded away as more people owned them.It&#39;s important to understand the status quo correctly if we ever want to change things. The sad reality is that most people want cars, even in dense cities. As I look out my apartment window on a Sunday morning, with pleasant weather and a walkable green neighborhood, I still count far more cars going by than people on foot or bicycle. Hopefully that would change if we made it easier and safer for people to walk, but it&#39;s not productive to pretend most people secretly hate cars."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ouch, so US towns and cities didn&#39;t always be hostile towards walking.  My assumption that it&#39;s always been this way, was wrong.But in a way that&#39;s worse because it means they used to have this privilege and it has been taken away, and cars-first has become the norm.But the roads would have been used for something, at a guess, was it trams and horse carriages, and that these didn&#39;t pose much of a problem?  I&#39;ve been to towns with trams in the middle of roads and it&#39;s normal for people to just walk around it or near the tracks without problem.  But I am a stupid tourist so I kept my distance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember in Sixth Grade (in Maryland), our teacher telling us that there was still a law on the state books, that said (I can’t remember what he said, precisely, but this is the gist):If a car is going in one direction on a road, and there is a horse (I don’t think he specified whether or not it was harnessed, but I’ll bet it needed to be in harness) coming the opposite direction, the car needed to pull over, and yield to the horse.If the horse refused to pass the car, then it was incumbent upon the car owner to (in escalating order):1) Turn off the engine.2) Cover the car in a blanket.3) Dismantle the car, piece by piece, until the horse passes.I could see a cranky old farmer having fun with that law."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I say this as probably one of the most skilled rm2k3 devs (credentials: rpgmaker.net/games/5794/), don&#39;t develop using this generation anymore.I think this project is neat from a preservation perspective, but there are so many limitations to its target engine that you will quickly bump into if you try to make anything that even approaches the quality of a real SNES RPG.You&#39;re much better off using one of the later gen engines that uses JavaScript (probably whatever the very latest is)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m quite infatuated with this project. There&#39;s a rich history of beloved RPG Maker 2000/2003 games and I&#39;m glad people are putting in the effort to preserve them. Actually, people are still making them to this day!IIRC: There&#39;s a similar project for XP as wellPs. I think a lot of people are getting the wrong idea. An editor IS in progress but it isn&#39;t ready yet and most of the focus is currently on compatibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, seeing that warrior sprite on the home page filled me with memories. RPGMaker was my first introduction to game dev when I was around 10 years old (even if I never wrote any actual code). My home computer was Linux so I had to go to a friends’ house to play around with the tool, and we had a lot of fun just making dumb things that were never seen by anyone but ourselves.Also, one of my earliest computer game memories is of an RPG Maker game that retold the story of Dragon Ball Z. That was the coolest thing I had ever seen at the time, and I think this is my first time thinking about it in 15 years. Thank you for this post."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article perfectly exemplifies the arguments in discussions. Lets just concentrate on the waste discussion. The article says heavy metals in solar panels are a problem (I kind of agree, although the way it is described makes it out like we are talking about huge amounts, in reality the lead in solar panels is largely from soldering so very small amounts. Orders of magnitude more are being used for other applications (like car batteries)). They then say that recycling is currently still a problem (sort of true, although there are companies who say they can 100% recycling solar panels already). Similarly for wind they say we still don&#39;t know how to recycle the carbon blades, again sort of correct (but there are many other applications of carbon fibre which produce much more waste).Then when it comes to nuclear waste however, the argument is we can ignore pretty much all long lasting waste, because of some development in the future will make recycling of spend fuel rods feasible. So essentially he is comparing the current state of solar panel recycling to some future potential nuclear waste recycling. That&#39;s a dishonest comparison. Moreover ignoring the amount of waste from dismantling the nuclear power plant (which needs to go into nuclear storage because it is radioactive due to irradiation), while talking about the carbon fibre from wind turbines is also disingenuous.We see the same argumentive structure when talking about the economics; the current state of renewables is compared to some potential future state of nuclear. While in reality renewables are on an exponential cost reduction trajectory and all the nuclear potential is completely unproven."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is this idea that nuclear is not being deployed because people have a wrong perception of risks.However, the main reason is the economy. The costs of solar, wind and batteries are dropping exponentially but the costs of nuclear are not improving. We can blame regulation and the hypothetically wrong public perception about safety, but the reality is that costs cannot go down easily because of the innovation dynamics:1. It takes several years to build a nuclear reactor. Hence, innovations take a decade to reach the market. Learning curve has to be slow.2. A nuclear reactor cannot be shipped, it has to be build on site. This makes manufacturing automation, economies of scale and competition hard. In other words: you cannot have factories in China, or elsewhere, shipping cheap nuclear reactors all over the planet.A change in regulation might lower the costs, but it&#39;s not going to improve much the innovation dynamics.In conclusion, all this talking is mostly irrelevant: nuclear reactors are simply not going to be built because they are not competitive. And things are getting worse by the day because the alternatives have a better innovation cycle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We saw another downside of nuclear power in Ukraine: When Russian troops attacked towards Enerhodar and there was shelling in the area the safety of the  reactor could not be guaranteed. In the end, containment can be guaranteed w.r.t to internal accidents but no facility can ever be safe from outside issues like war, natural disaster or politics.Solar has less single points of failure and if it fails not much happens, like in the case of the stolen solar power plant (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tokmak_Solar_Energy)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Russian here. Roskomnadzor&#39;s capabilities for blocking TOR are quite sufficient to cripple TOR&#39;s capabilities to the point of making it unusable as a VPN service, unless you set up your own private TOR ramp, which in this case is essentially the same as personal VPN, but much more slow.The algorithm is quite simple:1. Attempt to connect to TOR2. If it connects, blacklist the IP, goto 1.3. TOR is unavailable(If an anonymous TOR user can obtain bridge address, shared by any means, email, Signal, messenger pigeons or whatever, RKN operative can obtain it as well)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been really fascinating to watch. A patch just landed in Pion DTLS[0] yesterday to make the fingerprinting harder. I don&#39;t remember all the commits, but the Tor devs are absolutely amazing to work with and submit patches that are pretty much perfect :)If you haven&#39;t had a chance to investigate WebRTC I really think it is worth it. WebRTC gives up P2P Data/Media everywhere and it is really hard to block (because so many companies depend on it). To me it really feels like the best path forward to circumventing control. It also is a great career move. You can help people build conferencing tools during the day, and Censorship Circumvention at night.[0] https://github.com/pion/dtls/commit/de299f573c3e44fece16f09c..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can help by running a Snowflake proxy (which merely functions as a gateway to the Tor Network, so you don&#39;t need to worry as no traffic exits from your IP) if you&#39;re in a country that doesn&#39;t censor Tor. You can either run the standalone Snowflake proxy:https://community.torproject.org/relay/setup/snowflake/stand...Or by installing the browser addon: https://snowflake.torproject.org"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related tweet from Russ Cox: https://twitter.com/_rsc/status/1483899960684863493&gt; Knuth is making backwards incompatible changes to fix bugs in something he wrote 54 years ago (TAOCP volume 1, 1968)!And mine:Apart from the care Knuth takes, what&#39;s remarkable is that he has basically put out a permanent invitation to a DDoS on his time and attention—everyone in the world is invited to contact him about every word he has ever written—and somehow still continues to produce new material.From Wilf&#39;s toast/roast of Knuth (https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~wilf/website/dek.pdf):
“[…]your letter will be placed on a stack that already has 5,379 letters that reached him before yours did,[…] while he completes his latest additions to 47 new manuscripts and 311 revisions of already existing books.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this man is as close to being a monk for computer science as one could ever be. I envy his daily routines and discipline that keeps him going well beyond typical retirement age.I can only hope to have a sliver of his discipline to lead my daily life."</p>
