								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lorinda helped me massively with my attempts to bring back online some hardware that had escaped early 90s Bell Labs so that, as a pre-teenager trapped in rural Illinois, I could run Plan 9 and build some software for it. She did not stop at connecting me to the right people to locate the hardware I needed to restore my computer to the living. She also went above and beyond by introducing me to individuals whom I did not deserve to talk with nor did I appreciate how lucky I was to be sharing e-mails with these people at the age of 12. These unlucky (former) Labs employees included both Rob Pike and Ken Thompson.Lorinda, thank you for taking such extensive efforts to encourage my passion and interest in obscure operating systems. I have not lost my drive to explore this area of computing. My only wish is that I had sent you more than one of the coffee cakes from Morton, IL that you loved and said made us even. Hopefully, wherever you are now, you can have as much coffee cake as possible. Thank you again, truly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The tool `eqn`, which she wrote (joined by Brian Kernighan) is an &#34;ancestor&#34; of TeX: The mathematical syntax of TeX (design started 1977) was based on eqn (1975). For example, the eqn paper (https://research.swtch.com/eqn.pdf) has the expression    sum from i=0 to infinity x sub i = pi over 2

which would have been entered as something pretty close to that in the first draft design of TeX (the second draft introduced the backslashes), and today as:    \sum_{i=0}^{\infty} x_i = {\pi \over 2}

and you can see the evolution. The Wikipedia page has more examples (https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Eqn_(software)&amp;ol... ). Knuth credits Lorinda Cherry explicitly a couple of times in the first draft design (https://www.saildart.org/TEXDR.AFT[1,DEK]):&gt; A special syntax is used in formulas, modeled on that of Kernighan and Cherry, Comm. ACM 18 (March 1975), 151-157. For example, ``sup 9&#39;&#39; in line 41 specifies a superscript 9, ``sub {n+1}&#39;&#39; in line 74 specifies a subscript n+1.and in the last page/paragraph:&gt;  To conclude this memo, I should explain how TEX is going to work on math formulas. However, I will have to sketch out the code in more detail and it is only fuzzy in my mind at the moment. […] it may be necessary to build the parse tree first as Kernighan and Cherry do.(Yes indeed TeX builds the parse tree first, as we can see from the second draft: https://www.saildart.org/TEX.ONE[1,DEK] )The eqn system was a pioneering and capable one: although Knuth did not use any of the code of troff/eqn as-is (not sure if it was available to him; in any case he was targeting &#34;book&#34; quality), clearly it influenced the design, and I imagine it inspired him about what was possible in the first place. Even after TeX became widely used, there have been some math books typeset with troff and eqn.Reading about Lorinda Cherry&#39;s other accomplishments like `typo` and the Writer&#39;s Workbench, it&#39;s clear we&#39;ve lost someone who was a pioneer in multiple respects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As one of few authors of an implementation of `dc` and `bc`, but one who never actually met Lorinda Cherry, perhaps I have a slightly different perspective of her work.I&#39;ve read the closest thing we have to the original sources of `dc` and `bc`: the source bundled with Plan 9. It didn&#39;t take me long to read the entirety of the source because they were simple and concise. That immensely impressed me.However, I hate to say that my youth (compared to Ms. Cherry, at least) caused me to look at the source with disdain, mostly from a lack of handling errors caused by user mistakes.It took several days for me to think more carefully about the context. She was writing for herself and other programmers, who would probably be able to recognize when they made a mistake and fix it.The code has a simple elegance that mine will never have. Sure, you might call mine &#34;industrial strength,&#34; but I think a quote by ** Gabriel sums up the difference between Ms. Cherry&#39;s code and mine:&#34;I&#39;m always delighted by the light touch and stillness of early programming languages. Not much text; a lot gets done. Old programs read like quiet conversations between a well-spoken research worker and a well-studied mechanical colleague, not as a debate with a compiler. Who&#39;d have guessed sophistication bought such noise?&#34; [1]And that says nothing of the design of her software.`dc` was, and in many ways still is, the simplest calculator that could ever exist. It was the simplest shell too, with the `!` command. I personally believe that it was for this reason that `dc` was the first program Bell Labs made run on the PDP-11. [2] `bc`, while more complicated, is also a great design (for the time).In short, Ms. Cherry was a master of her trade, and I only recognized that from afar.One of the items I had in my bucket list was to meet Ms. Cherry; because of her work on `dc` and `bc`, I felt a kinship to her having written my own. It is sad to know that item will never happen. Oh, well.[1]: https://people.csail.mit.edu/alinush/6.824-spring-2015/l07-g...[2]: https://youtu.be/EY6q5dv_B-o?t=1767"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; [The challenge image] has a curious bit of coloring in it. What gives? Shouldn’t it just be black and white since the text is black?&gt;  I’m actually not 100% sure why this happens (and sometimes doesn’t), but it’s an artifact of the rasterization process when text is rendered to screen.This is a brilliant technique called subpixel rendering.[0] A &#34;typical&#34; computer screen&#39;s pixels are split into three columns of red, green and blue, instead of lighting up as a solid square. Using color fringing at non-pixel-aligned edges of characters can effectively triple the perceived horizontal resolution.Wrong assumptions about the pixel layout will show up very badly, as shown in [1]. 
HiDPI displays (also mobile, not just 4K) get no real benefit from this and usually have a more complex subpixel layout anyway. I remember seeing old iPads usually showing awful fringes as subpixel rendering was enabled without considering the actual orientation of the display.[0] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subpixel_rendering[1] http://www.lagom.nl/lcd-test/subpixel.php"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think these criticisms aren&#39;t just relevant to HN, they apply to all social media and online conversation. Even (group) email can become quite toxic if people don&#39;t convey their emotion well.I have been on HN for 15 years, I have spent far too much time on this site. Eventually you learn which topics will be &#34;toxic&#34; and avoid them (if you want to). To some extent it just maturity (or lack there of) but I actually think HN is far less toxic outside of some specific topics than other sites.The topics that are liable to become flame wars change over time, currently it seems to be anything &#34;Crypto&#34; or &#34;Online Advertising&#34; as people have very strong feelings on both sides. I&#39;m certainly still guilty of getting drawn in at times, especially when I feel I have a horse in the race. There is always insightful comments in these threads too.Fortunately HN is designed to detect topics that are getting out of hand (far more comments than up votes) and they drop of the homepage quickly massively reducing the exposure. Exactly where this thread is already going.I think the best decision HN made was not breaking the site into categories or &#34;Sub-HNs&#34; where specific toxic topics can grow and mutate, everything is forced though the front page ensuring a level of self moderation.After 15 years on the site I have no intention of leaving it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;My dad told me that he wants to dabble in programming, but MySQL isn’t compatible with his laptop. My response? &#34;Yeah there’s no way that’s true. MySQL will work on anything.&#34; Instead of taking a look at this laptop and working on the problem with him, I just told him that he&#39;s wrong and he doesn&#39;t know what he&#39;s doing (basically).&#34;I catch myself doing this, without realizing it far too often. It&#39;s good to catch yourself and try to change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;These are typical, HN-esque responses that may get upvotes online, but they hurt personal relationships.&#34;As a regular, I disagree completely. Comments that point out that something is wrong and have the empathy to try to help and identify a solution are much more upvoted that cynical ones that just point out that something is wrong without much caring for the other part.If you dig up HN only paying attention to potentially toxic comments, you will find them. It doesn&#39;t make HN toxic. If you create the habit of reading yesterday&#39;s posts, giving them enough time for the best comments to be upvoted and settle at the top, you will see much much less toxicity.It seems to me that the author is trying to get away from a certain behavior and, in the process, everywhere they look they just fit what they see in that exact behavior. Like when Woody Woodpecker is hungry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Corn in the US is mostly used for harmful purposes. It&#39;s used for producing fodder for intensive cattle farming (which of course produces lots of CO2). It&#39;s used for biofuel production, which as the article observes releases more CO2 than that it saves. And it&#39;s used for producing corn syrup which is an ingredient that nobody needs in their diet.The rest, which would be usage for e.g. corn bread or other staples of North American cuisine, is of course fine. Nothing wrong with e.g. organically farmed corn. It&#39;s a crop that does well under a wide range of circumstances and popular for that reason all over the world. And as a grain, it&#39;s an important part of food production.So, why does this exist? Very simple, federal subsidies to states that have become very dependent on that. Kill the subsidies and that whole industry slowly dies. That would be a good thing. Maybe repurpose the subsidies to have those farmers do something that actually is more productive and less harmful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article misses a key point: Ethanol is used to oxygenate the fuel, which reduces carbon monoxide and soot emissions.  It replaced MTBE in that role.It was never intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.  Producing it requires more energy than it provides, and this was known long before it was introduced.  It might be possible to power the production with renewable energy, but that&#39;s just extra steps for powering cars with renewables."</p>

This LUC estimate represents the midpoint of (a) values retained after filtering the predictions of past studies based on a set of unfounded criteria; and (b) a new estimate they generate for domestic (i.e. U.S.) LUC emissions. The filter the authors apply endorses a singular means of LUC assessment which they assert as the ‘best practice’ despite a recent unacknowledged review (Malins et al 2020 J. Clean. Prod. 258 120716) that shows this method almost certainly underestimates LUC. Moreover, their domestic C intensity estimate surprisingly suggests that cropland expansion newly sequesters soil C, counter to ecological theory and empirical evidence. These issues, among others, prove to grossly underestimate the C intensity of corn-grain ethanol and mischaracterize the state of our science at the risk of perversely affecting policy outcomes.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"EDIT: Author has pointed out that the interpolation mode can be changed. Very slick!It looks like this is interpolating in HCL or HSV space— that tends to produce unexpected results, including intermediate colors with unrelated hues (pink between orange and blue?), or sharp discontinuities if one of the endpoints changes slightly (try mixing orange and blue, and then shifting the blue towards teal until suddenly the intermediate pink pops to green).This document[1] also illustrates pretty well.Interpolating in RGB space has its own issues (more so if gamma is not handled correctly) due to the human visual system&#39;s differing sensitivity to different colors— the result is often that two bright colors will have an intermediate color which is darker than either endpoint.There&#39;s a known solution, thankfully: Mix colors in a perceptual color space like Lab or Oklab[2]. The behavior is very predictable and aesthetically pleasing.[1] https://observablehq.com/@zanarmstrong/comparing-interpolati...
