								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bit off-topic, but the fact that criminals asked for help mining, instead of money or crypto-money, just gave me an epiphany:The whole internet is showing the first signs of a digital Resource Curse [1] brought by crypto mining. Crypto mining changed the economics of the digital world in such a drastic way that it is poisoning all kinds of internet interactions. It is not just about disrupting how money used to work, it is disrupting every kind of interaction, even those that had nothing to do with money. Things that were completely economically neutral before, so people did them just for fun, can now be exploited to extract value, so naturally some people do it and the previous innocent/neutral status quo is lost. For example: most free unix shell providers, a fun tradition from nerds from the 90s, had to shut down because now there is such a big economic incentive to abuse such free service.And while writing above I realized that crypto is probably the second internet curse, with Google&#39;s algorithm being the first. When Google became the near-monopoly in the early 2000s, linking to a website ceased to be an economic neutral activity, people realized they could extract value from linking, so link spam became a big problem and forever changed the web.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; So, NVIDIA, the choice is yours! Either: Officially make current and all future drivers for all cards open source, while keeping the Verilog and chipset trade secrets... well, secret OR Not make the drivers open source, making us release the entire silicon chip files so that everyone not only knows your driver&#39;s secrets, but also your most closely-guarded trade secrets for graphics and computer chipsets too!Interesting. Someone got really fed up with them. I don&#39;t think their binary blob ever made them any friends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two scenarios where carrying out their threat plausibly helps the open source community:1) A source drop demonstrates that Nvidia incorporated GPLed code into their drivers. This is, honestly, unlikely - Nvidia has sufficiently competent lawyers to ensure that everyone they employ is extremely aware of what the consequences of that would be2) The source drop includes the private keys used to sign Nvidia GPU firmware blobs. Nouveau is currently entirely hamstrung on the last few generations of Nvidia cards because they run extremely slowly unless appropriate signed firmware is loaded, and Nvidia refuse permission to distribute that firmware. I&#39;m not aware of any case law around whether private keys are copyrightable (I&#39;d assume not, given that they&#39;re supposed to be randomly generated), and whether it&#39;s a DMCA violation to make use of leaked keys if you don&#39;t violate any other technical protection mechanisms. This would potentially (given a lot of work) allow Nouveau to implement equivalent firmware and sign it, but this would presumably still just result in Nvidia switching to different keys for the next architecture.Obviously the calculation differs if Nvidia choose under duress to release the drivers under an open source license, but that doesn&#39;t seem likely - this still very much reads as an attempt to extort Nvidia into removing restrictions on crypto mining rather than an earnest attempt to improve open source support for their hardware."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in the business of building an online word processor - https://www.zoho.com/writerIt&#39;s interesting how the documents industry is moving from print oriented legacy softwares (Google Docs, Word) to block based, app-ish, smart canvases (Notion, Coda, etc).Also both Microsoft &amp; Google have adopted completely different strategies to compete in this market. Microsoft launched Loop as an entirely new app while Google is incorporating these blocks as smart chips in Google Docs itself. Both strategies have their own pros and cons.My bet is on Google Docs style, because this means a group that&#39;s already invested in traditional document making skills (legal professionals, academic professionals, etc) will be able to incrementally step up their game without their workflow being completely destroyed. Sure, this will slow down the pace with which Google Docs can innovate and evolve - but overall it helps the older generation to smoothly transition over to the new age document editing, which is great."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A &#34;pageless document that lives online&#34; is also known as... a web page.Instead of creating web pages in html, css, and js, people will now create them using familiar &#34;word processing&#34; and &#34;spreadsheet&#34; apps on Google Drive.And these web pages come with nice fine-grained access controls -- authors can specify who is able to view, comment on, and edit their documents with a few clicks.Makes perfect sense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; If your document contains elements like footnotes, headers and footers, or watermarks, and it is converted to pageless, those elements will not be visible.Headers and footers are print-oriented, but losing footnotes is not ok.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been building a Canvas diagramming library since 2010 (https://gojs.net), if anyone has any questions about 2D Canvas use in the real-world I&#39;d be happy to answer them.roundRect is great. Though you don&#39;t need 4 arcTo in order to make a rounded rect, you can use bezier instead (we do). Their example is also 1% amusing because they set the `fillStyle` but then call `stroke` (and not `fill`). I&#39;ll have to do some performance comparisons, since that&#39;s the operative thing for my use case (and any library author).text modifiers are very welcome. It&#39;s crazy how annoying measuring still is, especially if you want thinks to look perfectly consistent across browsers. Though the chrome dominance is making things easier in one way, I guess.context.reset is kinda funny. Most high-performance canvas apps will never want to use it. For that matter you want to set all properties as little as possible, especially setting things like context.font, which are slow even if you&#39;re setting it to the same value. (Or it was, I haven&#39;t tested that in several years).I&#39;m sure most users know this by now, but generally for performance the fewer calls you make to the canvas and the context, the beter. This is even true of transforms: It&#39;s faster to make your own Matrix class, do all your own matrix translation, rotation, multiplication, etc, and then make a single call to `context.setTransform`, than it is to call the other context methods.One of the greatest things to happen to 2D canvas in all these years was hardware acceleration. It used to be significantly slower. (You could switch to WebGL canvas, but at a cost of complexity and all kinds of annoyances rendering text, and if you had a lot of text it often wasn&#39;t worth it.) Thinking back, I&#39;m also a little disappointed that after the death of Flash, it felt like Canvas never really took its place. The playful web that came before it in some ways simply closed up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll add some of my thoughts about this article&#39;s take on latest Canvas2D developments.1. ctx.roundRect() - is a nice addition to the 2D stable of shapes, fitting alongside other recent additions like ctx.ellipse(). I was a little disappointed that the example of how to achieve this using existing functionality relied on a set of .moveTo, .lineTo and .arcTo instructions; the article misses a trick by not mentioning that we can also use an SVG path.d string to define a Path2D object and use that to fill/stroke the shape. Note: I can&#39;t find mention of .roundRect() in the MDN documentation.2. Canvas Conic gradients have been supported in both Firefox and Safari for a while now. Good to see it arriving in Chrome. To complete the set of gradients, it would also be nice to see support for ports of the CSS repeating-linear-gradient() and repeating-radial-gradient() into the Canvas API.3. Text modifiers - text has always been an over-simplistic mess in the Canvas2D API. In theory a user should be able to use ctx.font to load a valid CSS font string (including all the supported font size lengths, etc) and have the text rendered as expected; sadly the implementations between various browsers are all over the place. In my dreams I hope that one day we will be able to set a width/justification and have the text string broken into lines while respecting those requirements. Browsers do it already for DOM/CSS layout and rendering - I wonder how difficult it would be to tap into that functionality rather than having to reinvent it for 2D canvases?4. context.reset() - nice!5. Filters - SVG filters are massively powerful, yet also difficult to master. We can already build some really complex filters in SVG and reference them in the Canvas2D context; I also like the way we can add CSS filter strings to the context (eg for a nice, easy-to-understand and performant blur effect). The article mentions a `ctx.filter = new CanvasFilter([])` construction, but I can&#39;t find CanvasFilter in the MDN documentation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like this post was intended to inflame or shock the reader with the writers stance on password policy. But anyone who has been in security for more than 1 month knows that regular password rotation has not been a recommendation for over 5 years. Both NIST, and MS have been trying to get the world to move to long, never rotated password, so long as those passwords are dictionary checked.Every company (all 3 of them) I have worked at within the last 10 years, the IAM team has already implimented, or was working on implimenting a system that removed regular rotation, special chars and number requirements, and relied on three things: Length, a dictionary check at the time of pass creation, and routine dictionary attacks against the credential store. This started 10 years ago, for someone to make the same claims now, is not a shock.Please note that if you are unable to impliment such an IAM system, especially the inability to dictionary check the credentials against known lists (seclists&#39; github is great for this), then length plus regular rotation is still the recommendation"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One missed point, the advice is even slightly better than they argue, since they only argue that it&#39;s not necessary to change it, which is just an argument of convenience.But updating a password is itself an attack surface. More so than merely using it to log in.It&#39;s one of the times where an attacker may be tricking you into giving it to them, either by a fake page or app dialog, or in concert with maybe they have a way to receive the verification email or text.Also it&#39;s a less frequent operation, meaning it&#39;s easier to fake. You are more likely to notice any tiny discrepency and detect a fake in the way your normal login screen looks than some account management screen.Basically updating a password is a riskier action than the normal daily use of the same password.And that alone is it&#39;s own even stronger argument for avoiding doing it unnecessarily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the USA, the latest government guidance from Jan 2022 is that &#34;Password policies MUST NOT require use of special characters or regular rotation&#34;. [1] This is a strong upgrade from earlier softer language like &#34;don&#39;t have to/should not&#34;.In practice, this new rule contradicts almost every InfoSec stance out there, but all government agencies must comply with this new rule by the end of the year, so expect lots of conversations and changes.[1] https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/M-22-0...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The general resistance in this thread is something. Every day on here we all find issues with the industry as a whole, have complaints, identify negative patterns grounded in investment goals or profit. A huge majority of people on here agree: there are problems and things as a whole need to change.Its not &#34;what use is a union to me&#34;, it is that there is an ethical imperative to try and fight against the destructive force of profit seeking itself, when left unchecked. It is about giving agency to the only force that can stand opposed to those destructive forces."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised they weren&#39;t already in one.  I worked at a competitor (the Wall St. Journal) years ago and all software engineers there had to be part of the union.Unions in the news industry are extremely common and powerful.My subjective experience with it was that union membership was mostly inconsequential for developers.  The market for programmers is so strong that people would just leave if they weren&#39;t treated well or compensated fairly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I need the long German word for “however this plays out, it will be used as a spurious example either for or against some extreme position”.If it works out, great - that hardly means unions are a foolproof idea - and if it fails it’s hardly a condemnation of unions themselves. And yet, it will be interesting to see how this plays out!"</p>
