								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminded me of a tight-packed binary format we used in the trading systems domain almost 20 years ago. Instead of including metadata/field names in each message, it had a central message dictionary that every client/server would first download a copy from. Messages had only type IDs, followed by binary packed data in the correct field order. Because of microsecond latency requirements, we even avoided the serialization/deserialization process by making the memory format of the message and the wire format one and the same. The message class contained the same buffer that you would send/store. The GetInt(fieldID) method of the class simply points to the right place in the buffer and does a cast to int. Application logs contained these messages, rather than plain text. There was a special reader to read logs. Messages were exchanged over raw TCP. They contained their own application layer sequence number so that streams could resume after disconnection.In that world, lantencies were so low that the response to your order submission would land in your front-end before you&#39;ve had time to lift your finger off the enter key. I now work with web based systems. On days like this, I miss the old ways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s staggering to me that people keep making these &#34;rich&#34; data formats without sum types. At least to me, the &#34;ors&#34; are just as important as the &#34;ands&#34; in domain modeling. Apart from that, while you can always sort of fake it with a bunch of optional fields I believe that you kind of need a native encoding to a tagged union if you want to avoid bloating your messages."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “Don’t buy stocks when the P/E ratio is over 20” was a good lesson to learn from the 1970s when interest rates were 7%, the Fed hadn’t yet learned what it’s capable of, and most businesses were cyclical manufacturing companies vs. asset-light digital services. Is it relevant today? At a broad, philosophical level, yes. In practical terms, probably not. In the same sense, buying stocks at all seemed like nothing but speculation in the 1920s because corporate disclosures were so opaque. By the 1970s that had changed, and you could begin to make rational, calculated long-term decisions that put the odds in your favor.The funny thing is that exactly this kind of talk was all the rage leading up to both the 2000 and 2008 crashes. The boom makes it impossible to imagine what the bust will look like, and vice versa. Most people are utterly incapable of seeing 180 degrees through the business cycle. They simply can&#39;t do it and rather extrapolate current conditions to infinity.This is a big part of boom/bust cycles. They are spaced out by just enough to entice a new group of greenhorns who ever more loudly beat the new paradigm drum. Then this new class learns that the business cycle is in fact immortal. But for many, it&#39;s a short-lived lesson.And that part about making &#34;rational, calculated long-term decisions&#34; is amusing. Because it&#39;s during the boom that companies start to engage in accounting shenanigans. The book-cooking will all come out in the next bust, just like it always has. 100x + price-to-earnings multiples will cover a multitude of sins.As Warren Buffet allegedly said, it&#39;s only when the tide goes out that you find out who&#39;s been swimming naked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems to assume that experts&#39; advice can only be valued (or not) as an appeal to authority. But that would ignore that experts can also provide _explanations_: &#34;This won&#39;t work because this subsystem would violate the laws of physics&#34; e.g. -- and that explanation might then spur someone to find an equivalent subsystem without that flaw, or perhaps one would find a flaw in the initial reasoning, or whatever.Similarly, seeing a list of past failures may inspire variations that seek to overcome the shortcoming without having to waste time first reproducing the same failure. One can try to learn _why_ it failed and use that to guide future attempts.The advice to be wary of experts reminds me of the advice to avoid criticism while brainstorming, the idea in common being that criticism and negativity supposedly stifles creativity. However, it turns out that criticism _enhances_ the brainstorming process https://mitsloan.mit.edu/ideas-made-to-matter/should-we-allo... It seems that criticism from expertise could similarly be a boon to future advances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I found interesting is that the period for reappearance of “failed ideas” is roughly the length of a career. Coincidence or due to any real effect I don’t know. I wrote a little about it here:“Don’t be discouraged by the failure of technology or approaches of the past. If the problem is still important after all this time then it’s a problem worth solving. Don’t avoid unsuccessful solutions. Avoid insignificant problems. Success this time around could be unlocked by advances in any number of unrelated disciplines.”https://blog.eutopian.io/the-next-big-thing-go-back-to-the-f..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is truly amazing that one person can bring up a 386DX board system. It is true that there are tons of docs available, but still to bring everything together and to get it running is truly amazing.
The team size at any of the PC OEMs doing a 386DX design when it was the state of the art would be at least 25 engineers and managers, easily.Congrats to Alexandru for hitting this out of the park."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Although this seems to be a 33MHz CPU, the 386DX40 was the first &#34;decent&#34; processor I had access to when growing up so was quite memorable for me.In my teenage years the PCs my brothers and I had access to were two 386DX40s each with 8MB of RAM and several hundred MBs of hard disk space (can&#39;t remember exactly, but pretty sure less than a GB).We really loved Blizzard&#39;s Warcraft II, which despite having a minimum requirement of 486 CPU, was able to run on the 386DX40s, albeit a bit slower than intended.Since we had two PCs we wanted to play together, but only had a parallel cable. I don&#39;t know why it was so hard for us to get hold of a serial cable, but the point is we only had the parallel one and Warcraft II would only be able to run over serial cables, not parallel ones.I eventually worked out a way though. The 386DX40s were actually also capable of running Windows 95 which had a feature where you could &#34;network&#34; two PCs over a parallel cable. I then ran IPX/SPX over that network which allowed us to play Warcraft II over it.The gameplay was pretty slow, but as I recall it was very reliable and we played quite a bit on this setup. Eventually we got a couple of BNC network cards and cables for a much more conventional setup."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These things remind me of one of my first jobs as a bench engineer &#39;trying&#39; to fix PCsthe vast majority of problems back then was the power supply and the vast majority of the issues with power supplies was burned out capacitors - easily fixable.for some bizaar reason one memory that also sticks out was the painful compatibility issues of putting seagate hard disks together with conner hard disks (IDE cables) also SCSI was a pita with terminators not working (resistors at the end of the scsi cable).I built my first PC 386SX (I think it was only a 33MHz - complete with a TURBO button!! :o) ) with bits that other engineers had thrown away - literally, outside they had a skip(dumpster)  with 386 motherboards and other stuff they deemed unfixable that I had to keep going through.everyone was scared of opening monitors - using long screw drivers to ground the tube made them (mostly) safe. I also had to fix a b/w (or technically black/ orange) CGA monitor to go with it. i still managed to get windows running on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really cool. I’ve used a number of languages and dabbled in a few frameworks but nothing I’ve used brings me joy like ruby does.I approach programming creatively. I think in large systems and architecture. Ruby allows me to skip worrying about the details. Code blocks abstract away thinking about loops and just focus on data. Just about every array operation I could want is there, waiting for a code block. In other languages, things don’t flow like that.I’ve tried purely function languages and I just can’t wrap my head around them because they abstract too much.I’ve tried python, but I end up having to deal with the mess of importing modules and having to set up loops when all I want to do is map data.Node.js comes so close but anemic standard library and absolute mess of explicit async everywhere just gets in the way. I want to love JavaScript. :(Then there is Rails. Nothing even comes close. The attempts to replicate it in other languages ends up missing part of what makes it so great. I’m sad about the move to mounds of JavaScript. Nothing can match the productivity of simple_form and bootstrap.My entire career has been in Ruby on Rails. I hope improvements to Ruby can keep it relevant. If not, I suppose JavaScript will do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’d like to use this to voice my appreciation for Ruby. Its ergonomics, flexibility, elegance and power continue to bring me joy and make me smarter every day.It is incredibly malleable and yet pure. It carries a certain warmth and kindness that permeate its community.It becomes faster every couple of years :)I feel so grateful to work with a language that makes me feel like a wizard and look forward to writing code.The community is so incredibly creative, smart and generous that I feel humbled every day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly I don&#39;t get why some people want to move to static types.  Ruby is a dynamic language, that&#39;s the point of it...  Giant orgs can just use Java or something.  We need some languages to stay productive for those of us who work solo or in small groups.  If I wanted static types I&#39;d use Java, Go or something (probably Haskell)."</p>

It uses the Linux-libre kernelIt&#39;s worth pointing out that the linux-libre kernel is developed under the FSF doctrine that &#34;binary blobs are bad unless you can&#39;t see them&#34;. This has been taken to its logical extreme here, where this Linux fork actively removes security warnings informing users that they need to update their CPU microcode, because microcode in ROM is fine but dynamically loaded microcode updates are not, in this school of thought.https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/info-gnu/2018-04/msg00002...I have no interest in software that uses arbitrary religious dogma (that doesn&#39;t help users&#39; freedom, as those users&#39; CPUs have proprietary microcode whether they know about it or not) to justify censoring critical security vulnerability notifications for users. I regard this as actively evil anti-user behavior."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hello, author here, happy to answer questions and discuss! This is the first in more Guix articles coming from me, as I started when building my newest desktop [0]. Next will be more details on exactly how my system is set up, but you can find (somewhat out of date as we work on big updates in Guix) my dot files here [1].[0] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28628344[1] https://github.com/podiki/dot.me/tree/master/guix/.config"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there a reason neither Guix nor Nix have made an LTS-type repo?A rolling release seems at odds with the stability granted by reproducible builds.Maybe I have a miopic view, but what&#39;s nice with Ubuntu LTS is you know everyone and their mothers has built and tested their packages/libraries/executable against the lib versions provided by Ubuntu 18.04 or 20.04 or whatever. You also know those libs, at their given versions, will get patched as issues come up. If all your libraries are constantly churning then you have no idea of the quality of the libs you&#39;re linking to (and that lib&#39;s dependencies are also churning in turn). You can pin versions, but there is no guarantee what you&#39;re pinning to will be patched and fixed as issues come up"</p>
