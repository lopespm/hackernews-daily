								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bit of a stretch to classify this under right to repair.. if you rent a car from tesla, it’s going to be up to tesla to choose how it’s repaired. And it doesn’t seem unreasonable that they won’t accept a hack fix (however safe it may be) - that car is going to be sold to someone once the lease expires, they just can’t take the riskI would read this as a cautionary tale against renting your cars. If you can’t buy it, don’t! This holds true for any depreciating asset."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I heartily agree with the premise, and there&#39;s this compounding problem:&#34;To make matters worse, the owner&#39;s insurance policy didn&#39;t cover comprehensive claims from road debris...&#34;So when you combine these two issues, you end up with an unwritten, mob-boss-esque command of something like &#34;Buy the most expensive insurance for all of your expensive widgets so that you can (maybe) be covered in the event that something minor happens&#34;Seems anti-consumer all the way down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had this type of issue with a Macbook Pro. The rubber/plastic foot came off the bottom. Asked at the Genius Bar how much to replace it. It looks like a part that should cost $0.02 and expected an &#34;Apple&#34; markup of say $5. They wanted $350. Said they had to replace the entire bottom of the computer to put on a new rubber foot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; In the end, if Apple hadn&#39;t so vehemently condemned the piece, it would have been resigned to live as just another quick F.A.T. Lab project, and part of my ongoing curiosity exploring computer-mediated interaction. But because they had the project taken offline, and my computer confiscated, Apple managed to give it more attention than I could have ever attracted. The reporters using headlines with &#34;artist&#34; in scare quotes got the media artists mad. The censorship and search warrant got the freedom of speech people mad. The feeling of privacy invasion, or just the awareness of surveillance, took care of everyone else. Apple created an amazing discussion I never could have planned.Sounds about right"</p>

&#34;What is your day job, Kyle?&#34;&#34;This is my day job. I&#39;m a media artist, I just write a lot of code. I spend most of my time making open source tools with other people.&#34;&#34;But how do you make money?&#34;&#34;I get commissions, grants, and live off artist fees from exhibiting work. I fly to conferences and festivals and do workshops and presentations. Sometimes I&#39;ll do residencies.&#34;
&lt;&lt;&lt;This agent and I are both having a ‘Deuce Bigalow’ moment over this. But seriously, is this just bohemian speak for some other source of financial support, or is it actually realistic to make a big city living this way?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of a random, but chilling, scene in &#34;Minority Report&#34;. The protagonist confronts a man he thinks is responsible for killing his child.The man decides to reassure the protagonist by explaining how kind he was to the child, and made sure the child didn&#39;t suffer when he killed him. He&#39;s presenting it as though this is a legitimate defense for such an obvious violation. The part that sticks with me is the man&#39;s seeming sincerity in believing he&#39;s making a case for himself, &#34;yeah I did this horrible thing, but I did it in the nicest way possible so it&#39;s really kinda big of me if you think about it&#34;This post fills me with the same chills. The author&#39;s utter lack of culpability for such a viscerally gross violation and strange attempts to spin it as though he&#39;s kind of a good person for doing it in a slightly less terrible way than he could have otherwise done it...To be clear, he didn&#39;t go out and do a security research project with ethical standards in place. He made it clear how laughable he considers the concept of &#39;consent&#39; (an ethical way to do this might&#39;ve been to take people&#39;s pictures, then ask them if they were OK with sharing it right after. He doesn&#39;t consider such a process at all)Instead, he thought of an amoral and illegal way for him to use people without their consent, for his own pleasure, curiosity, and amusement and decided to call it &#39;art&#39;. There are more horrible ways he could have done the above, sure. But that argument to me sounds as hollow as the &#34;but he didn&#39;t suffer&#34; argument from the movie.Him expressing his own sense of magnanimousness and ironic sense of victimhood at the end of it... it really is a scary glimpse into the mind of such people.It&#39;s sad because it&#39;s very easy to misconstrue this as a &#34;security researcher gets feds sent on him by apple&#34; story, and I think lots of people are basically trying to frame it that way, but it&#39;s not that at all. To me, it&#39;s clearly &#34;jackass doesn&#39;t understand consent, apple calls the feds, still a jackass, still doesn&#39;t understand&#34;.[Note: yes I know the character in the movie is revealed as a bluff shortly after, the scene sticks with me because of the character&#39;s apparent sincerity at the moment][Additional Note: yes I know many of these companies also don&#39;t respect consent. Them not respecting it is not an excuse for everyone to behave the same way.]"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN! After months of private beta, Obsidian is now finally available for Android and iOS!Obsidian is a personal knowledge management app that works on top of a local folder of Markdown files [0]. Because &#34;local&#34; often means your computer, for the longest time, it has been a pain to access these notes on the go.Our original plan was to build fully native mobile apps. Instead, we decided to build hybrid web apps. Hybrid web apps gets a lot of hate, and for good reason. There&#39;s heavy performance penalty for running JavaScript. Animations are often janky. A lot of native capabilities are restricted.We know everyone&#39;s favorite argument for using the web stack. &#34;We&#39;re a small team, and it&#39;s just not possible to....&#34;. Sure, we&#39;re also just two developers, but that excuse gets old.We see it in a different way. We leverage hybrid web apps not as a shortcut, rather, we use it to put power in the hands of our users. This has always been a key principle driving Obsidian&#39;s development.Obsidian is one of the few apps out there that lets users customize every aspect of the app. Themes and CSS snippets let users completely change the interface. Plugins [1] let users augment the GUI [2], run macros [3], build databases [4], synchronize with other apps [5], and much more.It&#39;s unprecedented for users to have access to this kind of power on their mobile devices.Now, it&#39;s reality, thanks to the web stack.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obsidian is the closest thing I&#39;ve found to the Pensive from Harry Potter. It&#39;s a data recording format good enough for me to extract thoughts from my mind, represent them with enough fidelity to reconstruct later, connect them to the concepts that they are related to in my head, and then forget the thought completely so I can move on and process it later.I was only willing to try it out because I had heard it mentioned [0] on CGP Grey&#39;s cohosted podcast, Cortex, in the episode they did on productivity software subcultures. Specifically I think CGP Grey was saying he didn&#39;t &#34;get&#34; Obsidian but had observed a fanatic fanbase around it of people who thought it was god&#39;s gift to note-taking because it represented the links between knowledge in a unique way. Apparently I&#39;m one of those people because I went from installing it for the first time to writing all my new thoughts down in it in the space of 3 days.I suspect the real reason I liked Obsidian right away is that long ago I used Microsoft Onenote as a freeform notetaking app to just spew unrelated thoughts into that I could organize later. Onenote&#39;s interface was good, but there was no way to port those notes in an exportable format to a new computer when the one with a Onenote license died.[0]https://www.reddit.com/r/CGPGrey/comments/ihkqjp/cortex_105_..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a note-taking power nerd who has used all the buzzy apps on Macs. Obsidian is by far the best — it&#39;s become my personal journal, my knowledge base, a quick and dirty blog, a place to keep loose notes.The development velocity of the (TWO PERSON!) team behind this app is ridiculous. They&#39;re constantly pushing updates, and seem to handle all facets of app development with aplomb.No affiliation, just a happy user!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last year I bought I used TI for my daughter who needed it for school. I got her the oldest version, the one which takes AAA batteries and communicates with the outside world through a serial link. A project like this brings to mind the possibility of stuffing a Raspberry Pi Zero in the battery compartment, hooking it up to the school WiFi, using a terminal app on the calculator to communicate with the Pi and in that way voiding the whole reason of using these ancient beasts in the first place. I won&#39;t do this of course - she&#39;s there to learn other things besides refining the art of cheating [1] - but it would be a tempting hack. An even more elaborate hack would be to replace the guts of the thing with a Zero running a TI emulator as well as some more useful stuff like ssh. The possibilities are endless... so endless in fact that I&#39;m fairly certain this has been done already, somewhere.[1] which in my days at school consisted of writing the translated works of Homer on a 10x10cm piece of paper, a good way to a) learn to write incredibly small and b) get those words to stick inside your head long enough so you don&#39;t actually need to consult the cheat &#34;sheet&#34; during the test."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here is a summary from the Louis Rossmann YT comment:To answer some common questions:a) I have already emailed &amp; called, and I patiently await a reply...b) You can&#39;t re-renew with a 13 month old PIN if you already renewed.c) You can&#39;t show up in person without an appointment.d) Appointments are only granted by means of contact that don&#39;t reply.e) Yes I have two other licenses that AREN&#39;T expired, but those are useless, they are for selling laptops, not fixing laptops, which I don&#39;t do anymore anyway after the city was unable to give me a straight answer on how to do so without being fined: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi8_9WGk3Ok - I need this license in the video to be able to actually do repairs.f) Just listen to this. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yi8_9WGk3Ok This is what I am dealing with. After 15+ minutes and being transferred to two people, they can&#39;t answer a basic question about a rule they fined me for breaking that they can&#39;t even explain. They never emailed or called me back, which has been the behavior I have come to expect over the past nine years.I am serious, if you work for the city and have any way of applying my 13 month old payment to this license renewal, you have the gratitude of myself &amp; 14 of my employees who will get to continue paying their rents, mortgages, &amp; food bill for their kids.In spite of what people think, I am not a millionaire. If I&#39;m forced to close - I can&#39;t afford to pay these people. I do not want that to happen.I am not meming, I never get responses to DCA emails - not 3 months ago, not for NINE YEARS, and I don&#39;t expect to be able to now. Since I cannot sort this out in person due to the COVID closures, this channel is my only hope of reaching someone who can help me sort this out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve met Louis in person, he&#39;s truly a standup guy with a heart of gold.  That said, he needs to pony up and get a lawyer.  Making petty arguments on YouTube isn&#39;t going to help you with bureaucracy it&#39;s only going to make things worse.  If government employees (state or otherwise) hate one thing, it&#39;s being called out point blank for how they either a) don&#39;t do their job or b) are effectively worthless.To be frank, I don&#39;t see why Louis hasn&#39;t left new york / the east coast yet.  I was unfortunate enough to move to NYC just in time for covid.  I still enjoyed my time in New York but I really understand a lot of what Louis has been saying about the city itself.  Subsequently I left.  He clearly hates the business climate, makes weekly videos about how much NYC sucks.  Maybe for his own health it&#39;s time to move to another state?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tell anyone who will listen: stay as far away from NYC and NYS as you can when you&#39;re operating a business. The bureaucracy is insanely complex and both governments harbor a very strong anti-business sentiment.NYS charged my previous, 2-person, zero employee agency a $14K fee for not having a Workers Comp policy, even though having one isn&#39;t necessary for member-managed businesses. We sent in paperwork demonstrating our case and they didn&#39;t care. They kept asking for more proof that we didn&#39;t have employees—even though they had no evidence that we did have them. A bit hard to prove a negative!After several years of back and forth, we finally just said forget it, closed that entity, and started ignoring the monthly shakedown notices. Now I&#39;m wary of even having clients in NYS.[Edit: I&#39;ve heard CA is similar, but don&#39;t have personal experience there.]"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Montanan here:This is true. One of the regenerative crop types are pulses (lentils, chick peas), and MT produces a lot.https://www.ndsu.edu/pubweb/pulse-info/resources-pdf/Growing...The state often appears in stories about agriculture in precarious environments (See Jared Diamond&#39;s &#34;Collapse&#34; for one example.)Montana is largely a semi-arid desert, especially over the 2/3&#39;s of the state that are northern Great Plains. East of the continental divide, it gets about 10&#34; of rain per year, which is about a quarter of the US average.And with climate change, it is more precarious. Temperatures have been unusually high this summer, and it&#39;s fire season now. Weather has become more volatile. (Cherry crops on the Flathead have been destroyed two of the last three years.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the biggest problem copilot will have in practice gaining traction is that verifying correctness isn’t any faster than writing the code yourself in many cases. The Easter(y) function is a classic example - it would be way faster to write that than to try and verify that there’s no subtle bugs.Copilot is by design trying to give you something that _looks_ correct without caring whether it actually is - so it optimises for real-looking but subtly buggy code, which is the worst kind of broken code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised that so much of the discussion around Copilot has centered around licensing rather than this.You&#39;re basically asking a robot that stayed up all night reading a billion lines of questionable source code to go on a massive LSD trip and then use the resulting fever dream to fill in your for loops.Coming from a hardware background where you often spend 2-8x of your time and money on verification vs. on the actual design, it seems obvious to me that Copilot as implemented today will either not provide any value (best case), will be a net negative (middling case), or will be a net negative, but you won&#39;t realize that you&#39;ve surrounded yourself with a minefield for a few years (worst case).Having an &#34;autocomplete&#34; that can suggest more lines of code isn&#39;t better, it&#39;s worse. You still have to read the result, figure out what it&#39;s doing, and figure out why it will or will not work. Figuring out that it won&#39;t work could be relatively straightforward, as it is today with normal &#34;here&#39;s a list of methods&#34; autocomplete. Or it could be spectacularly difficult, as it would be when Copilot decides to regurgitate &#34;fast inverse square root&#34; but with different constants. Do you really think you&#39;re going to be able to decipher and debug code like that repeatedly when you&#39;re tired? When it&#39;s a subtly broken block of code rather than a famous example?That Easter example looks horrific, but I can absolutely see a tired developer saying &#34;fuck it&#34; and committing it at the end of the day, fully intending to check it later, and then either forgetting or hoping that it won&#39;t be a problem rather than ruining the next morning by attempting to look at it again.I can&#39;t imagine ever using it, but I worry about new grads and junior developers thinking that they need to use crap like this because some thought leader praises it as the newest best practice. We already have too much modern development methodology bullshit that takes endless effort to stomp out, but this has the potential to be exceptionally disastrous.I can&#39;t help but think that the product itself must be a PSYOP-like attempt to gaslight the entire industry. It seems so obvious to me that people are going to commit more broken code via Copilot than ever before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would hire copilot to write tests for me, that’s about it. Writing tests can be a drag. It’s really a low-risk proposition to have generated code attempt it. If it’s a usable test, maybe it will catch a bug. If not, then kill it and let it generate a few more.The expectation is entirely different than producing code. Code needs to be correct, secure, performant, and readable. Failure on any of those fronts can be expensive to disastrous. Nobody can reasonably expect a test suite to catch every bug, even if created by the smartest humans. If a copilot-created test does prevent a bug from shipping it provides immediate value. I could see it coming up with some whacky-but-useful test cases that a sane person might not consider. From a training perspective I would think that assertion descriptions contain more consistent lexical value than the average function signature.It seems like the ambitious data scientists, product marketers, and managers fell in love with a revolutionary idea about AI writing code, and neglected to consult the engineers they are trying to ‘augment’."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know I might be in the minority, but I just wish we could stop at semi-difficult license keys.When I was poor in college, either I would pirate a game or just not play it because there was just no way I could ever afford it.Now as a grown up I&#39;d much rather pay for the game both to support the creator as well as not roll the dice on a backdoored keygen.I HAVE to believe that the number of folks that can both afford to buy the game and would buy the game, but would try to pirate first, is a fraction of a percent of the market.Please stop punishing your fans :/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;All in-game shutters like the one from when you kill a zombie are fixed because Capcom DRM’s entry points are patched out so most of their functions are never executed anymore.Can someone knowledgeable explain why DRM functions would be called on every zombie kill? I guess I don&#39;t have a good understanding on how these DRM checks are implemented in games in general."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bet that all development and testing was done using stubs for those DRM hooks, which were probably developed by a different team closer to the shipping date, and once they were integrated it was too late to do anything about them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was an IMF video clip with BIS director Carstens commenting on CBDCs last year, https://meetings.imf.org/en/2020/Annual/Schedule/2020/10/19/...&gt; With cash, we don&#39;t know who is using the 100 dollar bill today ... a key difference with CBDC is that the central bank will have absolute control on the rules and regulations that determine the expression of that central bank liability .. also we will have the technology to enforce that ... if an advanced economy issues a CBDC, and someone in a 3rd country wants to use it, it will require the consent of the central bank of the residence of that person, therefore the degree of control will be far bigger.Video on the IMF site is not working, here&#39;s a YT copy (thanks @toomuchtodo): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVmKN4DSu3g&amp;t=1451sIn a March 2021 speech, Carstens made a similar point, https://www.bis.org/speeches/sp210331.pdf&gt; It is crucial to trace transactions, particularly large ones, to an individual or entity. For account-based CBDCs, issuing central banks would retain control over cross-border usage. Restricting non-residents’ access reduces the risk of volatile flows, and of currency substitution in recipient economies.Well-intentioned initiatives like Linux Foundation https://www.goodhealthpass.org/ or EU digital health certificate or Apple iOS 15 digital driver&#39;s license (https://www.androidpolice.com/2021/06/07/apples-ios-15-walle...) can all be drafted into the service of CBDC initiatives which require digital identity for digital currency wallets."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There’s another name for a central bank digital currency. It’s called “a bank account at the central bank”. Hardly Orwellian, but hardly innovative either.Traditional paper money is actually a zero interest bearer bond. Essentially a simple receipt for liabilities at the  central bank that can be passed around like an endorsed cheque.Since regulators have steadily been eliminating the abilities of cheques to act as promissory notes rather than bills of exchange for decades, it’s hardly surprising to see their next assault on the “bearer transfer process” of traditional paper money.The whole point is to change it from a promissory note to a bill of exchange at the very least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meanwhile, with regards to feedback on a digital Euro:&gt; In the light of the views expressed by the citizens during the public consultation, the EDPB stresses that a very high standard of privacy and data protection is crucial to reinforce the trust of end users and shall be considered as a distinctive element in the offering of digital euro, representing a key factor of success of the project.Footnote 9:&gt; A thresholded approach could be based on the monetary value of the transaction. For example, low value transaction of less than €1000 could enjoy full privacy as they are unlikely to entail AML high risks. Another possible limitation could cover use outside the Euro area.* https://edpb.europa.eu/system/files/2021-07/edpb_letter_out_...* https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27791789"</p>
