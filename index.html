								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"*Technically*, this is very cool, impressive, and generally an elegant work of art.*Pragmatically*, I see 2 flaws in their thesis (as explained on the about page):&gt;&gt; &#34;The entire network already consumes 10% of global electricity production with traffic doubling roughly every 2 years&#34;I think the implication is electricity consumption will also double roughly every 2 years, but Moore&#39;s law actually operates on approx. same timeline, so traffic can continue doubling at this rate without an increase in energy consumption. *This is why technology is brilliant.* It allows us to do much much more with the same resources. We should want more technological innovation.&gt;&gt; &#34; These black-and-white images are then coloured according to the pertaining content category via the browser’s native image manipulation capacities&#34;This essentially shifts some of the burden of computation from the server (PNG compression) to the browser (dithering interpretation). This may save some energy, or it may increase energy as most personal computer processors are much less efficient than server processors, and don&#39;t benefit from energy savings from caching. I&#39;m not sure where it nets out, but just solely focusing on reducing server compute time isn&#39;t necessarily a path toward sustainability if it shifts more computation to the client.Very happy to hear if I&#39;ve misinterpreted the thesis. Again, I commend the technical work itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Small technical nit: I love the dithered images and the retro feel, but their CSS should specify `image-rendering: pixelated` to make sure browsers don&#39;t interpolate the pixels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this also shows how inefficient modern website hosting is. The fact that this person was able to get a raspberry pi to host the #1 website on HN powered by a small 50 watt solar panel is very cool (meaning maybe 10w average power budget), but also shouldn&#39;t be as uncommon as it is today. To put this in perspective, a modern server uses 50-100 watts idle doing nothing, and many more under load. To handle the top of HN, the developer probably would use load balancing and other tech, multiplying the power usage accordingly.
Edit: fixing typos."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once used PuTTY as the base for an internal SSH tool. We needed to provide data entry teams with access to a green screen but didn’t want to expose any more servers than what they were authorised to use and a simple interface because a lot of the data entry guys were technologically illiterate.After spending hours looking for solutions that were purpose built for this kind of thing I gave up took PuTTYs source and made some tweaks to the UI.The source was so easy to work with and I was so grateful that the license allowed me to do this.The custom client only ran for a couple of years because the web replaced green screens. And being a *nix guy I don’t get much need for PuTTY in my day to day. But I’ll always be grateful for PuTTY for making that particular job possible (and secure)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone I know met Simon one day and thought I’d like his autograph, since I was working in security at the time. I had in fact introduced that team to PuTTY, though this friend didn’t know that.So I own a postcard that says words to the effect, “nobody has ever asked me for an autograph before”. It is framed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought this was such a fantastic response, particularly the sections where he talks about how he responds to companies demanding he reply as if he has a contract with them.The main point being that, with the log4j issue (and others before that), the thing that&#39;s struck me when maintainers complain about not being appreciated or that they are working as hard as they can, unpaid, is that maintainers are under no obligation to respond at all, and that you can&#39;t control how other people will react.As someone who&#39;s dealt with anxiety for a long time (and as a former opensource primary maintainer), I can most definitely commiserate with feeling burdened by the expectations of others, but one of the best things I learned from therapy is that you can&#39;t control others emotions, you can only attempt to understand why you react as you do in certain situations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. Removing senescent cells extends life by 30-40% with huge quality of life improvements in the last 25% of the life (relative to control), in mice. This isn&#39;t an elimination of all aging, but quite a valuable thing regardless. Eventually, other causes of aging would kick in and still cause death, without a single senescent cell in your body (e.g. DNA methylation).2. I believe all governments should create Warpspeed for this approach. At the depths of covid lockdowns, GDP was down 20%. Imagine the massive GDP creation from making every 65+ year old feel 40 again. They&#39;d work, consume, and generally flourish. Even if it&#39;s only 10 more years of quality life, this is the  greatest good that could be done for humanity. To avoid another 10 years of my parents death is something I&#39;d do a lot for. Economically and ethically, we should prioritize this research above most else.3. This approach is scientifically sound. Certain aspects of aging cures are approaching engineering levels of work rather than pure science. We simply know that many diseases are caused or amplified by senescent cells. And we have ample evidence that elimination of these cells reverses diseases in complex mammals, as long as you don&#39;t remove too many, too quickly. The rest, is the engineering problem of how to remove the right cells at the right cadence.4. This is the kind of thing biohackers should hack on. Find an aging part of your skin, and attempt to convince your body to kill the senescent cells. If you succeed, you will have benefited humanity, become beautiful, become wealthy, and be remembered forever (is there any other fundamental need humans have, not covered)?Let the race begin!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that these mice were fed a high fat diet (HFD), essentially toxic fat overload to generate disease phenotypes that one can demonstrate an improvement in. Mice normally eat a mainly grain based diet, so getting 45% of calories from fat is as you can imagine pretty bad for them.This is a common theme in anti-ageing research. When you administer some cariacature of poor lifestyle, it is much easier to find ways to improve things. The long running calorie restriction experiements in monkeys illustrate this well [1,2] - in monkeys being fed a bad diet, calorie restriction works great. In monkeys eating a kinda normal monkey diet, calorie restriction doesn&#39;t do much (and the unrestricted healthy eating monkeys live longer than the calorie restricted junky monkeys). Peter Attia had a good podcast with Steve Austad where they discuss this, albeit paywalled.Unfortunately the style of experiment in the OP is good for publishing papers but hardly advances knowledge or helps us to explain anything.It is much more difficult to demonstrate improvements in healthspan in animals that are living well. The ITP experiments have shown a few drugs can do this, with rapamycin being the most broadly effective.[1] Junky monkey: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2812811/
[2] Healthy monkey: https://www.nature.com/articles/nature11432"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The team, including Juntendo University professor Toru Minamino, confirmed that mice administered with the vaccine showed decreases in the zombie cells, medically known as senescent cells, and in areas affected by arterial stiffening.By now this has become a trope. &#34;Researchers develop new treatment for {UNTREATED_DISEASE}&#34; ... in mice.Mouse models of human disease are very limited in their predictive ability. There&#39;s a lot of research that needs to follow this before there&#39;s even a hope of a human trial, let alone vaccine. And the failure rate for treatments at the mouse stage is quite high.Some of the comments on this thread treat this research paper as the announcement of an an imminent anti-aging vaccine. It&#39;s not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well, it&#39;s basically malicious compliance. They&#39;re supposed to be super annoying because the people which need them do things which have been deemed unacceptable from the legislature. Instead of complying, they choose this obnoxious practice so they could continue with what they&#39;ve been doing for years, which is monitoring every action a visitor does.You don&#39;t need a cookie banner to be allowed to create Cookies. You only need them if you&#39;re using them for something like tracking.A session cookie, selected theme etc is all fine without that banner"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There already is a better solution and always has been, it&#39;s called setting cookie preferences at the browser level and then leaving it.Trying to regulate the option for cookie preferences at the individual site level was always a stupid idea. The average person visits thousands of websites every year. Of course nobody is going to take the time to do that.If the lawmakers in the EU were intelligent, they would have created a law that forced all web browsers to provide &#34;X&#34; privacy setting features for EU-domiciled users (where X is what they were aiming to achieve).In addition to not burdening the entire world with time wasting popups all day, this option would have also had the bonus of not burdening millions of small businesses around the globe with complex regulation and legal liability.Not to mention the total lack of enforceability of the current law when it comes to websites operated outside of the EU.If done at the browser-level you really only have to police &lt;10 companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Laws that require software companies to implement a user choice should really contain some wording against dark patterns. EU lawmakers could have been warned: A similar thing happened back when Microsoft was forced to give users in the EU a choice of browsers, when they created the most confusing dialog possible and hoped that users would just click OK to Internet Explorer out of desperation.For me personally, when those data protection laws where implemented, seeing the extent of the market for user tracking was a shock to me. The respect that I lost for actually quite a lot of companies as a consequence has informed some purchasing decisions. And I don’t think anybody would mind those banners if the opt-out option you want to click is reachable with a single, easily visible button.Edit: Responses suggest that the GDPR already contains something to that effect. Glad to know. If that’s true, then I guess it’s time for court cases to sort this out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The library that I first used which got me stuck to Python was Tkinter. It was a welcome relief from building GUIs using GTK in C. The documentation which I used was from effbot (which seems to be offline now) http://web.archive.org/web/20180802131839/http://effbot.org/.... That led me to making Python my &#34;primary language&#34; when it still wasn&#39;t very popular and shaped my career.I think it&#39;s hard, if not impossible, to overestimate how many lives Mr. Lundh&#39;s work has touched and improved over the course of his career. RIP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The effbot was an early mentor me.  He had a brusque style, an excellent sense of design, and a wry wit.  He thought deeply about programming problems and did not shy away from non-trivial tasks such as regular expressions.  His ElementTree library humanized XML parsing and generation in Python."</p>

Zip up the resulting folder and ta-da you have an application. Just unzip and run the .exe.If you want a single-file exe (as in completely statically compiled without self-extraction) that&#39;s a bit more advanced and requires a few properties in the csproj to configure how to handle native assemblies that expect to exist on disk.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unpopular opinion: native GUI app development on most platforms is a shitshow. Huge toolkits, copious amounts of boilerplate, and a huge amount of dev effort thrown at the platform just to get it working.Meanwhile, say what you will about the web ecosystem, I&#39;ve given interns/jr devs tickets like: see if you can get this webapp running in electron, and maybe figure out how to do push notifications and save data locally. Two days later the project is done. A week later, the app is ready to install.I think the real reason I quit doing meaningful amount of native GUI development a decade ago was velocity. The developer experience with iOS is probably about the best of the major GUI platforms, but even that is rife with tarpits of tribal knowledge and gets really complicated to release an app due to the whole App Store experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot to untangle here.Point 1 is largely true, Microsoft builds too many competing UI toolkits.Point 3: You can slim down Visual Studio&#39;s install a lot if you&#39;re more selective during installation. For example if I only wanted to do .Net desktop application development it is closer to 4 GB and under 10 GB on disk.Point 4: Is actually the end of the original synopsis on the topic and after it veers off. You successfully built the application.Now it goes a little off the rails:Point 5: &#34;The app is extremely resource heavy and way too over-featured.&#34; Ok? You didn&#39;t say which toolkit, guide, or similar you used nor what you define as resource heavy or in what way it was &#34;over-featured.&#34; This is too vague to discuss meaningfully (e.g. Win32 applications built in C++ definitely aren&#39;t resource heavy or over-featured for example, and since you didn&#39;t clarify even what tech stack was used let alone guide/template this isn&#39;t constructive at all).Point 6: I&#39;ve read this sentence several times but seemingly you opened an executable in a text editor and that somehow broke your build process? Or something? Was it write-locked by the editor?Point 7-10: You had a working build pipeline, you broke the pipeline, then decided to start again from scratch in an editor that doesn&#39;t have native desktop development support on Windows (because the old editor was &#34;bloated&#34;). You found this process problematic.So in answer to:&gt; Why is building Windows apps so complicatedYou made it complicated by using unsupported workflows and introducing arbitrary limitations on what was a successful outcome. There&#39;s a lot you can legitimately criticize Windows and even its desktop application development workflow for, but this isn&#39;t that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Readers who are interested in the actionable aspects of this topic should probably read the last instalment in this series: https://commoncog.com/blog/accelerated-expertise/The basic idea is this:1. Deliberate practice only works for skills with a history of good pedagogical development. If no such pedagogical development exists, you can’t do DP. Source: read Peak, or any of Ericsson’s original papers. Don’t read third party or popsci accounts of DP.2. Once you realise this, then the next question you should ask is how can you learn effectively in a skill domain where no good pedagogical development exists? Well, it turns out a) the US military wanted answers to exactly this question, and b) a good subsection of the expertise research community wondered exactly the same thing.3. The trick is this: use cognitive task analysis to extract tacit knowledge from the heads of existing experts. These experts built their expertise through trial and error and luck, not DP. But you can extract their knowledge as a shortcut. After this, you use the extracted tacit knowledge to create a case library of simulations. Sort the simulations according to difficulty to use as training programs. Don’t bother with DP — the pedagogical development necessary for DP to be successful simply takes too long.Broadly speaking, DP and tacit knowledge extraction represent two different takes on expertise acquisition. For an overview of this, read the Oxford Handbook of Expertise and compare against the Cambridge Handbook of Expertise. The former represents the tacit knowledge extraction approach; the latter represents the DP approach. Both are legitimate approaches, but one is more tractable when you find yourself in a domain with underdeveloped training methods (like most of the skill domains necessary for success in one’s career)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO Tacit knowledge is what we used to call judgement.Judgement is basically knowing a bunch of things but having a good idea of which things are more important than others, and especially knowing which things are worth spending time on any which aren&#39;t.It&#39;s like when I see someone talking about financial options and they put everything on the board at once: what are puts and calls, what&#39;s an iron butterfly and other strategies, do they need to know the payoff diagram, what about black scholes, what are the Greeks, when should I exercise, and so on. They are all things that a professional option trader knows, but when you&#39;re a pro you reduce your cognitive load because you know what actually matters and you are not juggling all these concepts at the same time.It&#39;s also the source of frustration when interviewing. Say you&#39;ve written CPP for many years, you&#39;re probably not prepared to answer questions on all corners of the language, even though you&#39;re an expert in some sense. Someone relatively newer might be better at that task, because they&#39;re thinking a lot about everything, including things they haven&#39;t decided are unimportant yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Tacit knowledge cannot be externalized&#34; is a cruel thing for me to hear when it comes to social skills.Ty Tashiro writes about how &#34;awkward&#34; peoplehttps://www.ted.com/talks/ty_tashiro_why_we_re_socially_awkw...need things to be spelled out and made explicit.  With that,  we can function as well as anyone.  Without that we suffer when we get advice like &#34;be yourself&#34;,  &#34;read Dale Carnegie&#34;, etc.Ty was lucky to have parents that understood that he needed this and made sure he got it.  I didn&#39;t.  Often it would take me a while to get what came naturally to the other kids and adults never seemed to recognize that,  which made me feel really lonely."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The people trying to point out that this falls short of photorealism are missing the point. This is a tech demo aiming to show off the next generation leap unreal engine 5 is making. There’s lots to be impressed about here and this was made using a ton of procedural generation using a team of just about 70 people.Here’s a great deep dive into some of the new technologies that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of some of the new engine tools: https://youtu.be/ib6_c6uliLgThis is extremely exciting this is possible on a year old console and not a 3090."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This writeup is unsubtle in being a puff piece. The demoed tech is very impressive! Individual stills taken from the video are pretty convincing.The motion version definitely still exhibits uncanny valley, though—lights that are too hard on flesh, tightness and sharpness where there should be softness. That I have to resort to hand-wavey descriptors is cool; they’re getting close! But crossing uncanny valley is HARD.What this demo convinces me of is not that we’re there; we are not. Claiming that we are is disingenuous, and makes me distrust the claimant. But it makes apparent that we will get there. And that’s impressive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Meh, these guys are still stuck in the uncanny valley.Objects are often absolutely beautiful and realistic, but interactions between objects are ridiculous. Some of this is probably just &#34;not enough processing power&#34;, but it is also due to where the rendering bumps up against the primitive controls. For example, you have a very realistic human. But then the human walks against an object, and she does this standard video game 0 mph duck-walk. Part of the problem here is that real humans don&#39;t bash into walls. So how do you realistically represent that, when in fact it&#39;s just Johnny pressing forward on his controller?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Our machine has W=UINT16_MAX words, of N=16 bits eachDid the seemingly-off-by-one-error catch anyone else? A 16-bit integer has 65536 values, so you&#39;ll be going one past the end of the virtual RAM if you attempt to access address FFFFh.With this simple trick, we can avoid writing a switch statement with 16 (+1) casesPersonally, I prefer having a switch since it&#39;s more obvious which opcode goes where. Probably makes the code a little shorter too (and is that another off-by-one, this time in the other direction?)Also, I understand the need to keep a &#34;learning architecture&#34; simple, but without byte-wide memory access, you&#39;ll quickly realise how annoying it is to work with actual bytes. For example, any string handling, unless you decide to use UTF-16 instead. I think a sweet spot is 16-bit address and 8-bit data, with register pairs for 16-bit operations, much like the popular Z80 and the 8080/8085 that preceded it.The DEC Alpha is a real architecture that made a similar mistake and later had to be extended to fix it: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DEC_Alpha#Byte-Word_Extensions..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Really cool!I&#39;ve never understood why modern software projects use names like `mw` or `mr`? What&#39;s wrong with `memory_read` / `memory_write`? Or `opcode_execute_fn opcode_executers[NOPS]` is magnitudes clearer than `op_ex_f op_ex[NOPS]`, and the only advantage of the latter is less time to write.You will spend at least twice as much time reading your code as writing it, just take the extra time. Nobody needs another `vsnprintf_s`.ETA: I have to repeat this is an insanely cool project idea, and very good execution"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of the Gigatron, a minimal retro TTL-computer, which came as a kit. See: https://gigatron.io/ The C program for the emulator can be found at
https://github.com/kervinck/gigatron-rom/blob/master/Docs/gt... which has 126 lines."</p>
