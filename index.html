								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Years back, every web browser&#39;s built-in password manager locked up the page when submitting a login form, waiting for the user to answer &#34;do you want to save this password?&#34; before proceeding.I thought that was silly: how do I know if I want to save the password before I&#39;ve seen whether it&#39;s correct? Which I can&#39;t see until the form is submitted.At the time I was using Opera, so I wrote in to their customer support suggesting that the prompt appear after the new page loaded. I never heard back, but a couple months later their next major release implemented exactly that behavior. A few months after that, every other browser followed suit.I can&#39;t have been the only one bothered by the existing behavior, but given how long browsers had worked that way before I wrote in, I like to tell myself that the timing wasn&#39;t a coincidence, and that my little suggestion rippled out into a change that made a small thing better for the whole world :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I havnt done this in many years but for a while I was making creative content that was published online. Once in a while someone would contact me saying they liked what I did. I started doing the same. If I read an article I liked a lot I would contact the person and tell them I liked it and why. About half the time they responded with Thanks.I didnt do this with NYT writers or anything. Just people who clearly dont get paid/paid much to make this content but I found it useful/interesting/helpful. I think that stuff goes a long way and it really doesnt take that long to do.I&#39;ve got a tech podcast now and about once every month or two someone contacts me to say they liked it or something nice. It&#39;s a huge reason why I keep doing it. I know that sounds silly but the internet can be such a black hole. A little feedback goes a long way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve worked in a few roughly-the-same-size (~50 engineers) web development shops. It&#39;s always the same. Doesn&#39;t matter if it&#39;s React, Angular, Class based components, Functional components with hooks, Just Some HTML, PHP, Rails views, etc.The frontend just collects the cruft of a product organization changing course very frequently. There are always a dozen half-finished fix-the-world ideas conflicting with each other, half-finished move-to-new-framework initiatives.I just mean to say that when I hear &#34;it&#39;s because React&#34; or &#34;it&#39;s because rails views&#34;, any other of the infinite variations of this, I kind of just tune out. Some part of your organizations chaos is going to reflect in code, and honestly I&#39;d rather it be in a big ball of frontend than in the data models, infrastructure, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I must be the only person in the world who likes class components in React.Sure, it&#39;s often overkill and a functional component does the same thing with less code. Use a functional component in these cases. But if you&#39;re doing something more complicated then stop treating class components like the fucking devil. They have their place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a developer who’s been working with React since the beta, I can confidently say that the author is speaking the truth. Especially so near the end of the article where they can’t seem to quit React.For all the annoyances of Hooks, they really are a godsend when it comes to composing state. And refs do indeed suck, but they sucked even more with class based components. I can’t tell you how many times I was able to solve a complex DOM state issue with custom hooks wrapped around refs.Newer tools like Svelte and Solid do look promising as far as removing boilerplate, but they personally feel a step too far off the path of “it’s just JavaScript.”Has anyone else here successfully left for greener JS pastures?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A great idea.  Now, everyone that learns this stuff, show some restraint!The drawback of a powerful type system is you can very easily get yourself into a type complexity mudhole.  Nothing worse than trying to call a method where a simple `Foo` object would do but instead you&#39;ve defined 60 character definition of `Foo` capabilities in the type system in the method signature.Less is more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Types are here to help but with this power comes great responsibility. 
The deeper you allow an input to be used in your library/method the more it makes sense to put a well defined type contract on it.
Exhaustive type definitions may show that the author doesn&#39;t have a understanding of a required interface, abstractions or pattern to use.
I use c# professionally for 20 years and I love the type system. It helps to tell the contract about the types and functions you expect yet you can overcomplicate things if you really about to. c# makes it &#34;hard&#34; to create method type definitions and you should use interfaces to achieve the contract definition. This helps to avoid the inline type definition as it&#39;s done in typescript.
My approach is to use types in typescript as I&#39;m used to in c#."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I currently have to occasionally contribute to a TypeScript codebase at work. I appreciate how much better it is than Javascript. When I write code as an outsider (Java and Go developer), I feel like I use the type system in sensible and readable ways. When I look at the code written by the native TypeScript experts in my company it is a bewildering, abstract, unreadable morass. I have no idea what&#39;s going on half the time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice work!However, a cautionary tale on AI medical image &#34;denoising&#34;:(and beyond, in science)- See the artifacts?The algorithm plugs into ambiguous areas of the image stuff it has seen before / it was trained with.
So, if such a system was to &#34;denoise&#34; (or compress, which - if you think about it - is basically the same operation) CT scans, X-rays, MRIs, etc., in ambiguous areas it could plug-in diseased tissue where the ground-truth was actually healthy.Or the opposite, which is even worse: substitute diseased areas of the scan with healthy looking imagery it had been trained on.Reading recent publications that try to do &#34;denoising&#34; or resolution &#34;enhancement&#34; in medical imaging contexts, the authors seem to be completely oblivious to this pitfall.(maybe they had a background as World Bank / IMF economists?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something interesting about the San Francisco test image is that if you start to look into the details, its clear that some real changes have been made to the city. Rather than losing texture or grain or clarity, the information lost in this is information about the particular layout of a neighborhood of streets, which has now been replaced as if some one were drawing the scene from memory. A very different kind of loss that with out the original might be imperceptible because the information that was lost isn&#39;t replaced with random or systematic noise, but rather new, structured information.."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few thoughts that aren&#39;t related to each other.1. This is a brilliant hack. Kudos.2. It would be great to see the best codecs included in the comparison - AVIF and JPEG XL. Without those it&#39;s rather incomplete. No surprise that JPEG and WEBP totally fall apart at that bitrate.3. A significant limitation of the approach seems to be that it targets extremely low bitrates where other codecs fall apart, but at these bitrates it incurs problems of its own (artifacts take the form of meaningful changes to the source image instead of blur or blocking, very high computational complexity for the decoder).When only moderate compression is needed, codecs like JPEG XL already achieve very good results. This proof of concept focuses on the extreme case, but I wonder what would happen if you targeted much higher bitrates, say 5x higher than used here. I suspect (but have no evidence) that JPEG XL would improve in fidelity faster as you gave it more bits than this SD-based technique. Transparent compression, where the eye can&#39;t tell a visual difference between source and transcode (at least without zooming in) is the optimal case for JPEG XL. I wonder what sort of bitrate you&#39;d need to provide that kind of guarantee with this technique."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One bill opposed by the App Association is the Open App Markets Act, which aimed to help app developers use alternative in-app payment systems and avoid Apple&#39;s standard cuts of 15 to 30 percent.The cut is a platform fee, and collecting it via the in-app payment system is mechanism, not policy.The core issue is Apple&#39;s rate: although it is usually comparable to rates on other game platforms (eShop, Google Play, Steam...), (some) game and app developers want it reduced so that they receive a higher percentage of an app&#39;s retail price.The largely unfounded expectation that some developers seem to have is that changing IAP payment methods will cause Apple&#39;s platform fee to drop to zero, rather than causing Apple to simply collect it by other means.Edit: for some reason people are responding to me with complaints about Apple&#39;s policies and downvoting me because they don&#39;t like Apple&#39;s platform fees. I&#39;m trying to shed some light on what is actually going on: a dispute over platform fee rates.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well into the second day of Cloudflare’s blockade of my home internet connection, Google Search also began blocking requests. It required me to resolve a CAPTCHA challenge for every other search. This luckily only lasted a day.Cloudflare shares IP reputation data with partners like Google, coordinated through a program called the Bandwidth Alliance. So, my original offense might not even have been against Cloudflare. It might have received the reputation data from a partner, and it just propagated through the Bandwidth Alliance network.That&#39;s not what Bandwidth Alliance is at all. It&#39;s about reducing or eliminating egress fees between a cloud provider and Cloudflare. Not sure where the idea that it&#39;s about sharing IP reputation data comes from.https://www.cloudflare.com/bandwidth-alliance/So, if Google Search started showing a CAPTCHA that&#39;s not Cloudflare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;d like to experience this treatment first-hand, try surfing the web using the Tor Browser.Spoiler alert: many websites simply refuse to load at all (e.g. any google service, and lots of websites &#34;protected&#34; by CF). Captchas are everywhere: in many cases, you can&#39;t even complete simple GETs of blogs without donating free labor to CF.And the most infuriating part, you get CF marketing messages right in your face while your browser is calculating hashcash (I guess?)... At this point I can recognize every single one of them: something about bots making up 40% of all internet traffic, something about their web scraper protection racket, something about small businesses (???), etc etc...To be fair, Tor exit nodes have an awful reputation for sure. Nevertheless, I have a hard time forgiving how CF makes browsing the Internet hell for those who actually need Tor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Harsh blocking/limiting/challenging is way too valuable to sites that are actually trying to make money online. It&#39;s not going away short of legislation banning it. Losing 1/10,000 legitimate customers to cut fraud attempts, spam, exploit attempts, and so on, by 90% or more, is just too good a trade-off.I have bad news about the most-likely fix for it, longer term, so we can lay off the IP-based reputation stuff and the geo-blocking: it&#39;s tying some form of personal ID to your browsing activity, so that bears the reputation instead of the address.Sorry. Said it was bad news."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PGs take on why early stage VCs gain so much experience reminds me of my opinions on why car sales is the best sales experience.I sold cars for almost a decade and was pretty good at it averaging 30 cars a month. That means every year I helped people sign for $16 million of products. In the end I probably sold 3000 cars for over $100 million.(Note, I stayed in it way too long. I think most of these benefits would come from 2 years)I made close to 50,000 phone calls, leaving probably 20,000 voicemails. I closed atleast 1000 deals purely on the phone.I&#39;ve heard excuses, stalls, lies, promises and objections over 10,000 times.I&#39;ve seen thousands of married couples discuss if they should go ahead with spending $30-100k. I&#39;ve seen how they interact while waiting. (Nothing pains me more than couples, or moreso one party, playing games on their phones ignoring each other).While there is a lot more to modern tech sales than just closing incoming leads, I think car sales is an accelerator course for interacting with, reading, and closing people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This essay is getting a surprising amount of hate, and I must confess that my first impression on reading it was that it sounded an awful lot like a Robert Kiyosaki book [1].  But then I followed the two links in the essay [2] [3] and that put it into perspective: the thing that Paul learned from his users is that they are looking for The Answer, the formula, the procedure for how to succeed, and there is no such formula.  It&#39;s like Goedel&#39;s incompleteness theorem, except that it&#39;s not a theorem.  People come to YC and buy Robert Kiyosaki&#39;s books hoping to find an Answer that simply doesn&#39;t exist.The difference between Paul and Robert is that Paul is up-front about this while Robert is cagey and deceptive and makes his money by stringing people along thinking that The Answer can be found by buying one more of his books.  But I think a lot of the hate here is driven by disappointment that Paul is honest, and that his answer is that there is no Answer.  It can be frustrating to hear that (which is also something that Paul explicitly points out).---[1] https://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680...[2] http://paulgraham.com/lesson.html[3] http://paulgraham.com/before.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prompted by the negative feedback that this essay received, ranging from being a sales pitch in disguise, to being a word salad going in all directions without answering the central question posed by the author right in the opening paragraphs, I had to go and re-examine the piece and see if these concerns are valid or not, and unexpectedly the second reading reaffirmed my initial positive reaction that this is actually a good piece, maybe not the best, but still good.In spirit of open discussion and intellectual curiosity here, I share my insights in the following order matching that of the post:1) PG opens with the best advice that he could dispense to prospective applicants which is &#34;what you&#39;ve learned from users&#34;.2) He proceeds to ask himself the same question.3) He then informs readers that his users; startup founders, usually face the same set of problems across the board.4) Since these problems are the same, he thought of automating the solution to scale his business (dogfooding in some sense).5) That blew up in his face spectacularly that he had to rework the plan and concede that his solution won&#39;t scale.6) But these same problems are not recognized uniformly by founders as they sometimes face difficulties identifying them in the first place, that&#39;s where the YC partners&#39; role come to fill this unmet need.7) Even when people are good at identifying problems, some are bad at determining the severity or urgency that these problems pose, cue again the YC partners&#39; role.8) Even when they&#39;re good at risk assessment, some are bad at risk mitigation, and won&#39;t listen to the advice given by the partners but it is not made clear what he means exactly by &#34;not listening&#34;, dismissing/not acting on solutions proposed by YC staff, or not acknowledging that there&#39;s a problem to begin with?9) Getting down to business to solve these problems warrants focus, and how this focus is tied into speed, and how YC can help with that.10) Startup colleagues are more important than YC partners when it comes to realizing success with their feedback, guidance and even practical help, and how YC is the best in class in this regard.Even though the marketing language, esp the value propositions in the piece is a bit stronger for my taste, but I can&#39;t say with honesty that it overpowered the core message of the essay nor was it incoherent or disjointed in anyway that made following or understanding impossible as some have claimed here.Verdict: 8/10"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congrats to the Wasmtime team on the 1.0 release!I&#39;m happy to see that more runtimes are maturing and getting use on production cases... I can&#39;t wait to see and show what the future entails for WebAssembly on both the server side and the browser!Keep up the good work. Also I&#39;d like to use this message to congratulate other runtimes that I&#39;m excited about (apart from Wasmer, of course!): Wizard Engine [1], Wazero [2] and Lunatic [3].The future is bright in Wasm land :)[1] https://github.com/titzer/wizard-engine[2] https://github.com/tetratelabs/wazero[3] https://github.com/lunatic-solutions/lunatic"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Instantiating a runtime in microseconds is deeply exciting!Though after skimming through the docs, I&#39;m still left wondering a few things:- JS is notably missing from the list of languages supported on the front page. But I see mentions of a Spidermonkey.wasm in the blog post. Is running JS on top of wasmtime in production a realistic prospect today? If so, where can I read more? (mainly interested in this for the instantiation time benefits, though maybe all/most of that will be negated by the embedded JS engine?)- How should I go about building a typical web service on top of wasmtime? Can wasmtime itself handle network requests/connections or would I need to build the web server in some other host language and pass request data to wasmtime modules? Haven&#39;t been able to find anything in the docs about this.- What would it take to build a multitenant web service where customer code is isolated using wasmtime, like the one like described in the post?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m sold on the future of wasm. What really still bothers me is the effort and hoops I have to jump through to actually leverage it. Networking, just fix networking so I can drop in most things and it would be great. The fact that I have to rewrite the majority of my network access to do any external IO is painful but I get that containers took more than a decade after Google&#39;s use to get there too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unfortunately this caching is still per-path. For example:    GET /v1/document/{document-id}/comments/{comment-id}

For every new document-id or comment-id, there will be a new pre-flight request.Alternative hacks: Offer a variant of your API format that either1. Moves the resource path to the request body (or to a header that is included in &#34;Vary&#34;). Though the rest of your stack (load balancing, observability, redaction) might not be ok with this, e.g. do your WAF rules support matching on the request body? You also will no longer get automatic path-based caching for GET requests.2. Conforms to the rules of a CORS &#34;simple&#34; request [1], which won&#39;t trigger a pre-flight request. This is what we did on the Dropbox API [2]. You&#39;ll need to move the auth information from the Authorization header to a query parameter or the body, which can be dangerous wrt redaction, e.g. many tools automatically redact the Authorization header but not query parameters.[1] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simpl...[2] https://www.dropbox.com/developers/documentation/http/docume... (see &#34;Browser-based JavaScript and CORS pre-flight requests&#34;)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The trick to improving YouTube recommendations is to regularly prune uninteresting videos and channels. Eventually this should start surfacing videos you&#39;re more likely to find interesting.I&#39;ve actually hit the end of my recommendation stream on the mobile app after marking dozens of videos with Not Interested. Once this happens it starts recommending videos you&#39;ve already watched or older videos from creators you&#39;ve been watching lately.Personally, I&#39;d love it if you could curate the recommendation system a bit more. I&#39;m never interested in rewatching stuff I&#39;ve already seen. And the recency bias for recommendations means you&#39;re always getting more if what you&#39;ve recently consumed. I&#39;d like it if more older interests were mixed in. Finally, I&#39;d love to be able to blacklist certain topics and games entirely.There&#39;s so much missed potential with YouTube recommendations.Some might say that you can still use search, but that has been crippled to include unrelated recommendations after one page of results. Not only that, I want YouTube to help me discover new content. When the recommendation system works and it shows me new kinds of interesting stuff, it&#39;s superb. TikTok is eating YouTube&#39;s lunch in this regard.Edit: forgot to mention this. On mobile if you do a recommendation refresh it&#39;ll show a New to You filter which you can use to explore more diverse recommendations. I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s hidden in this manner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I didn’t like when they removed the dislike counts, and I still don’t like it.When I look for videos of folks working on Subarus, I don’t want to have to manually scrub through the video to gauge the quality. Before I’d just look at the ratio and if I was feeling generous I’d preview the frames to see if they had what I wanted.Now it takes me at least 2 mins longer to get to the same judgement which begs the question of why I’m watching a video when I have a book on my lap and a car waiting outside."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of how games (coughLeagueOfLegendscough) match me up with a player that I literally just reported for harassment, griefing etc. in the previous match.  Like, there weren&#39;t any other possible players to match me with out of the many thousands?  I don&#39;t mind waiting a few more seconds to match up with someone else!I&#39;m getting a lot of responses as if I expect the player to be totally blocked from matching with me, but that&#39;s not really what I mean.  Even a basic &#34;temporary match score reduction&#34; would work.  I would also expect a cooldown system where the reduction caused by reporting no longer applies.  Arguing against the idea &#34;because it creates a prisoner&#39;s island&#34; misses the subtlety of a well-thought-out implementation where reporting simply lowers the matchup &#34;rank&#34; for a while, and serial-false-reporters have their reports basically nullified/ignored."</p>
