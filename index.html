								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When do you get a yellow square? I couldn&#39;t find this documented anywhere, so I took a look at the code.Here&#39;s what I found: For each guess, Worldle calculates a proximity score from 0 to 100 -- higher is better. Each row is basically a quantized proximity score meter, from 0 to 100 in increments of 20. If you get at least half-way to the next increment of 20 (i.e. to the next green square), you get a yellow square, too.Example: If your proximity score for a guess is 63, you&#39;ll get 3 green squares and two blank (white or black) squares, i.e. GGGBB. If your score is 71, you&#39;ll get three green squares, and since 71 is at least half-way to 80 (i.e. &gt;= 70), you&#39;ll also get a yellow square, so GGGYB.The proximity score is round(100*(MAX_DISTANCE_ON_EARTH - d)/MAX_DISTANCE_ON_EARTH). Though that max distance is defined to be 20,000,000.This is the important part: https://github.com/teuteuf/worldle/blob/67db30bdf79c0965c19a..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was extremely confused about the distance values in relation to the percentages until I read the help:&gt; The distances displayed correspond to the distances between the selected and the target territory centers.&gt; For instance, the computed distance between United States and Canada is around 2260km even if they have a common border.That&#39;s extremely deceptive and non-obvious unless you read through the documentation. One of the appeals of Wordle is that it is an extremely intuitive game which doesn&#39;t require rule reading."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on a tool at Amazon once that incorrectly calculated royalties, not because Amazon was greedily trying to steal from publishers, but just because of general incompetence (or, lack of sufficient competence maybe).Basically, of the people who wrote the tool, tested the tool, and used the tool, none of them knew exactly how royalties should be calculated and none of them could tell whether or not they were being calculated correctly. They weren&#39;t. We eventually figured out something was wrong and went through a very annoying process of learning about royalties and how they interplay with prices, discounts, and other factors and then set things right.Still, if I were paid by Amazon royalties in any capacity I would carefully double check their math and read the fine print.Maybe it&#39;s greed in this case, but in my time at Amazon I saw many teams in &#34;Keep Lights On&#34; mode where one or two people with vague memories of how services are supposed to work try to keep them running. There&#39;s also high turnover, so it&#39;s very easy to be the person on your team with the longest tenure and also be mostly in the dark about how your services should and do work.  As I say, maybe it&#39;s greed, but I would never rule out the people responsible just not understanding (or doing) what they should be doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The twitter thread and the accompanying website don&#39;t quite tell me what&#39;s going on besides &#39;not as much money as expected&#39;. But I can&#39;t quite see what the &#39;Net Sales&#39; problem is, it&#39;s just stated as &#34;less money&#34; for no reason? Although I am tired so maybe something just isn&#39;t clicking. I don&#39;t doubt that the terms of the deal are poor though.I had wondered for a while how the credit system worked, and if the increase in sales made up for the &#39;deal&#39; off audiobooks. I get $50-$60 audiobooks for $15, there&#39;s something mismatched there. Either the audiobook was priced at an extreme premium, or, it seems, Amazon just isn&#39;t paying the price I would expect.Edit: I found one response from an author that I think makes a simple point, if not perhaps what the thread describes (still can&#39;t tell). It&#39;s impossible for authors to calculate their expected royalties as there are so many varieties of discounts and price points that customers can pay for a single book: https://twitter.com/AdamEcclesBooks/status/14933236569105489...Which makes sense to me, as there&#39;s purchases and credits and various subscription tiers and audible unlimited and these are just the things I can think up off the top of my head. But again, I would buy a small fraction of the audiobooks I have purchased at full price."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s terrible for the narrator too. In many cases the narrator makes a bad decision to record the Audiobook not for a per-finished-hour rate, but as a &#34;Royalty Share&#34; where they only earn on the Royalty -- that&#39;s 20%  (50-50 royalty split with the author) on the audiobook version.In most cases a narrator will never earn even close to minimum wage for the effort to create an audiobook. And it&#39;s more effort than you might guess. A skilled narrator might produce a finished hour of audio in 5 hours, and a less skilled narrator may take 10 to 12 hours to create that same finished hour. So for a 10 hour audiobook a narrator will have between 50 and 100 hours of work, depending on the material and the production skills of the narrator.It can take literally years to earn $500 to $1000 in royalties -- thats $10/hr -- on a book. And most books never sell enough audiobook copies. And that&#39;s why any narrator who understands this should never accept and ACX / Audible exclusive Royalty share audiobook deal.Now with this Audiblegate revelation it&#39;s all to clear that we narrators are destined to never make our money back."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This F_FULLFSYNC behaviour has been like this on OSX for as long as I can remember. It is a hint to ensures that the data in the write buffer has been flushed to stable storage - this is historically a limitation of fsync that is being accounted for - are you 1000% sure it does as you expect on other OSes?POSIX spec says no: https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/functions/f...Maybe unrealistic expectation for all OSes to behave like linux.Maybe linux fsync is more like F_BARRIERFSYNC than F_FULLFSYNC. You can retry with those for your benchmarks.Also note that 3rd party drives are known to ignore F_FULLFSYNC, which is why there is an approved list of drives for mac pros. This could explain why you are seeing different figures if you are supplying F_FULLFSYNC in your benchmarks using those 3rd party drives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic thread.The history is also interesting. It&#39;s not that &#34;macOS cheats&#34;, but that it sincerely inherited the status quo of many years, then tried to go further by adding F_FULLFSYNC. However, Linux since got better, leaving macOS stuck in the past and everybody surprised. It&#39;s a big problem.Here&#39;s Dominic Giampaolo from Apple discussing this back in 2005, before Linux fixed fsync() to flush past the disk cache: https://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-dev/2005/Feb/msg0008...And here&#39;s TigerBeetle&#39;s Twitter thread with more of the history and how projects like LevelDB, SQLite and various language std libs were also affected: https://twitter.com/TigerBeetleDB/status/1422854779009654785"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a type 1 diabetic, and this was a helpful post at showing non diabetics why it is so. hard. Non diabetics typically think the difficult thing must be the shots and the finger pricks, right?Not really. The majority of diabetics get used to those things quickly (of course there are some  of course that deal with a major major needle phobia that can make it even harder). The hard part is that it never ends. Almost every moment of every day, your brain has a background process running that&#39;s evaluating every decision in context of your diabetes. There are no breaks. Your prefrontal cortex now has to take the place of a previously complex and automatic bodily process. It&#39;s the last thing you think about when you go to bed and it&#39;s the first thing you think about when you wake up. It&#39;s what you think about when you want to go on a walk, are about to enter a meeting, go into an interview, get on a plane, take a shower.It&#39;s usually little things: &#34;okay, where am I at now? which direction is it going? when did I last eat? do I have snacks ready? do I have enough insulin for the day? what if I start to go low during this meeting? should I pop some carbs and run high for this interview, so I don&#39;t risk a hypo partway through? why am I going low right now when I took the same dose I took yesterday for the same meal? why am I now skyrocketing for no discernible reason, I didn&#39;t even eat anything? shoot, I&#39;m starting to hypo out of nowhere in the middle of this great conversation, which I now have to interrupt to eat a snack and recover for 15 minutes. I fell asleep with a perfect BG, but now I&#39;m awake at 2AM half delirious because my BG fell all the way down to 50, and I&#39;m in the kitchen shoving cookies down my throat because hypoglycemia activates a survival instinct to EAT EVERYTHING that&#39;s extremely hard to control, and I know that I&#39;m gonna shoot all the way up to 250 shortly, which I&#39;ll have to treat with insulin, and I&#39;m basically not going to get any sleep tonight&#34;.And then the math often doesn&#39;t make any sense. There are so many factors that effect it. One day the same number of carbs + insulin may make you go high, and the next low, because of other environmental factors. (See the &#34;42 factors that effect blood glucose&#34; chart in the post.) You&#39;re constantly having to adjust.I&#39;m literally crying while writing this post, because it&#39;s so exhausting and it never ends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a type 1 diabetic and data scientist. Estimating the causal effect of a unit of insulin or food on blood sugar is an absolute crap shoot. Consider that there&#39;s a +/-20% margin of error on the reported carbohydrates on nutrition facts. We might consider this irreducible error that just cannot be modelled (Maybe you could get a calorimeter, estimate the distribution of errors, and reduce that error somewhat). Therefore, even if we created a model that explained all explainable variance, we still have a 20% margin of error. If a meal has enough carbohydrates, a 20% overestimate of insulin requirements would lead to an insulin overdose that would kill you if the resulting low blood sugar is not dealt with. In other words, the irreducible variance is so large that a &#34;perfect&#34; model would regularly suggest lethal insulin doses.My &#34;solution&#34; is to eat low-carb/keto as a &#34;variance reduction&#34; strategy. Still, removing carbs also introduces gluconeogenesis (the production of glucose from protein) as a factor to consider. The synthesis of protein to glucose also occurs on a much time different time horizon than the consumption of carbs themselves which has implications for insulin dosing and insulin type.I could go on! But long story short, modelling blood glucose is bloody hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, I&#39;m an artificial pancreas developer! Our device has been approved for human trials which we&#39;re going to begin shortly, probably near the end of this quarter.One thing that the article (which is very well researched, by the way, kudos!) does not quite get right is that the insulin sensitivity _changes_ hour to hour, day to day, month to month. It changes nonlinearly with exercise, stress, sleep, diet, and in a million other subtle ways that we&#39;re still trying to characterize. This dynamism is part of what makes management of blood sugar so hard, because the same dose that got you in range a couple days ago now sends you into a hypoglycemic episode, which can be really really dangerous!The good news is that, while cures for diabetes have been Five Years Out (TM) since the 1980s, artificial pancreas technology (like Loop, OpenAPS, and recently approved Omnipof 5) is here _today_ and already giving people a real solution, not to mention peace of mind, but we still have a long way to go! Access issues, trust relating to years of anxiety induced trauma, cost etc are all barriers to making these solutions widely available, but I feel hopeful that in 20 years, a T1D diagnosis will be as manageable as an eczema one.If anyone has any questions about APs, I&#39;d be happy to field them!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the 90s-00s, when I was a younger, (even) more arrogant nerd, I looked down on Microsoft and their stupid technologies: Visual Basic, Access, Word, and more. Simple, limited tools that I only saw ugly, half-broken systems built with.Until I saw a something by Steve Ballmer (I think), explaining that their strategy was to provide tools for those &#34;99% developers&#34;. The ones who don&#39;t read HN, the ones who don&#39;t code for fun. Everyone for whom coding is something that gets in the way of their real objective.No wonder they produced bad code! But that&#39;s not the point: they&#39;re solving something else. They&#39;re not spending effort making bug-free maintainable code, they&#39;ve got more important things to do. They&#39;re doing the accounting for their small company, point of sale for the shops in their city, all the kind of things that may not be glamorous but that&#39;s all around us (for better or for worse)So while I puttered around in my self-congratulatory ivory tower of unix, Microsoft understood what the real world needed, for the 99% of developers..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Too many people believe that aiming for good software quality means you need to fully adopt that new technology, whether it’s microservices, GraphQL, or distributed tracing. You’re not done until you’ve switched fully over to the ideal technology.This. We are constantly presented with new and shiny things. And then, barely a year later, there is the next ideal technology. And the next, and the next, and the next.We have seen this with everyhing: Languages, coding standards, paradigms, editors, organisational methodology, interview methodology, frameworks, databases, security, design basics,...the list is endless.But here is some truth:C is still written. As is pure JS. Imperative/Prodecural code never went away. Websites on servers we can physically touch are still deployed. People still write working implementations for almost everything under the sun from scratch. Information-Dense, slim, efficient interfaces that get jobs done are still there. As are monolithic architectures. Good &#39;ol RDBMS still work great. bash is still the dominant shell. grep/cut/awk are still great for analysing logs. Water still flows downhill.&#34;new&#34; and &#34;better&#34; are 2 different words, with different meanings. Something that&#39;s new could be better. But he fact that it&#39;s new, in itself, doesn&#39;t automagically make it better. And even if its better in one scenario, its doesn&#39;t have to be better in all scenarios."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You&#39;d be surprised at how fast you can create something with an SQL database, a well used backend framework (eg. Rails) and a well used frontend framework.The things big tech companies do are usually to avoid scaling problems. In particular scaling on the engineering side. The above can scale to billions on the user side if needed but 10k engineers constantly updating and messing with a traditional SQL schema doesn&#39;t work.You&#39;d be crazy to try to replicate something like the big tech companies database storage systems when you&#39;re just starting out. You don&#39;t have 10k engineers. You may think &#34;but i want to scale to a billion users&#34;. Well you still don&#39;t have those problems. The scaling problems big tech companies have are scaling to 10k engineers."</p>

MonoLisa advertises that it&#39;s wider than other monospace fonts, and you can really see that in the comparison. One of the things I appreciate about Victor Mono is that it is narrower than many other monospace fonts (while still being very readable), allowing you to fit more code side-by-side."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Please stop it with the &#34;coding ligatures&#34; already.  They are not helpful and only serve to obscure the code being written.This has got to be one of my least favourite trends in programming aesthetics these days.  For a font claiming to &#34;follow function&#34; to devote so much effort to sacrificing function for the _vogue du jour_ is especially rich."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am the only one who finds fonts a bit expensive for personal use? It is not a rant, I am not saying it isn&#39;t worth it, that font designers can&#39;t make money, etc... But that puts it on the same level as tools like Sublime Text or Beyond Compare. For me, it is enough of a turn off not to use a commercial font, especially considering that the free offering is quite good.I totally understand the higher price for commercial use, here, it is cheap compared to the costs of hiring a designer, and it may have a real impact on your sales and ultimately earn you money.But why is the price for personal use around $60? Is it some kind of a sweet spot because most people won&#39;t buy fonts anyways, even for $1, but those who do expect to pay that kind of money. Does it account for piracy, which I guess is easy and goes unnoticed if you only use it personally?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Newegg doesn&#39;t limit their fraud to selling broken open-box items.I personally saw them try to pass off an expensive mouse that was crusty and scratched as &#34;new&#34; (I double checked and it was NOT marked as an &#34;open box&#34; on the product page or order page).Newegg support refused to process the return, so I had to contest it with the credit card company. Pro tip: the CC support rep told me to process it as &#34;product never received.&#34; He said if you pay for a new item and you get a used item, then you never received the item you paid for. Hopefully I never have to use that again, but now I know (and now you do too)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a theory on what happened at NewEgg with this motherboard:1. GN gets motherboard from NewEgg, never opens the shipping box.2. GN sends motherboard back to NewEgg, as allowed by NewEgg’s policy.3. NewEgg decides to decline the RMA just because they can, claiming whatever excuse they are forced to make up when anyone asks.  (NewEgg went back and forth regarding whether it was thermal paste on the motherboard or damaged pins on the CPU socket.)4. GN knows they didn’t damage the motherboard, since they didn’t even open the shipping box, so they relate the story to their surprisingly large audience, and the whole story blows up.5. NewEgg goes “Oops, bad publicity, we’d better refund them.”6. GN wants the motherboard returned, too.7. NewEgg goes “Oh crap.  We said the motherboard was damaged, so if we actually send the real motherboard back, GN will see that it’s fine and know we lied.  But GN said that they never opened the shipping box, so GN has never seen the motherboard.  We can just send back any old motherboard which is actually damaged.  Genius!”, and NewEgg picks a motherboard which is marked as damaged in their inventory system, and ships it to GN.8. GN opens the newly-received motherboard box, and finds it indeed has damaged CPU socket pins, but also finds an RMA sticker from Gigabyte, with an RMA number on it.  GN investigates, and finds out the whole history of that board, painting a very ugly picture of NewEgg if that was the motherboard which they were originally sold.NewEgg is now in a bind.  They can’t admit to lying about blatantly refusing legitimate RMAs, nor can they admit to knowingly shipping back a fake damaged motherboard to GN.  So what they will probably try to claim is that the damaged board was the one sold to GN, but that it was a mistake in inventory management.  However, this story still would not explain why NewEgg’s returns department missed seeing the huge RMA sticker from Gigabyte, and why they sometimes claimed thermal paste on the motherboard, and sometimes damaged CPU socket pins.  Unless, of course, NewEgg lied and shipped a fake damaged motherboard back to GN."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Newegg had a broken motherboard, already tried to RMA it themselves, then (likely accidentally) sold it as open box.I see no big problem with that first part at all. Seems like a honest accident - stuff like that can happen. No big deal, imho.But investigating the returned board - not seeing the RMA sticker on it, mis-classifying the damage, not checking their own records on the board - and claiming it was &#34;customer damage&#34; without any hard evidence... and not ever double-checking anything at all, after the customer repeatedly insisted they didn&#39;t even open the box...That&#39;s the real problem. It&#39;s almost impossibly sloppy to miss all that during any damage investigation, it&#39;s outright offensive to claim &#34;customer damage&#34; without having done any investigation to substantiate that claim, and it&#39;s complete madness, to spend a lot of time insisting on &#34;customer damage&#34; in discussions with the customer, without ever double-checking the board, the damage or the records.That&#39;s the reason why it&#39;s hard to believe this was a honest accident. Because if it was a honest accident... how could they have never noticed their accident, while &#34;investigating&#34; and refusing a refund multiple times over? With an RMA-sticker right on the board, dated to before the date of sale?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A huge problematic deficiency of 1Password is that it lacks literal multi-line text field types.The items in its database let you define custom fields for them, but there is no literal multi line text field. There&#39;s a &#34;File&#34; type, but you can&#39;t simply define fields with multi-line text values. However, every item has exactly one built-in &#34;notes&#34; field, but that&#39;s actually styled markdown text. And you only get one. And its name is always &#34;notes&#34;.It would obviously be extremely useful to be able to define an arbitrary number of arbitrarily labeled multi line text fields that are not interpreted as markdown text.It boggles my mind that 1Password doesn&#39;t support this. What were they thinking??? It makes it a real pain in the butt to store ssh keys and certificates and a lot of other types of information in 1Password.A single markdown &#34;notes&#34; field just doesn&#39;t cut it. It&#39;s not as if it&#39;s technically challenging or a security risk. It already has a &#34;notes&#34; field, so just turn off the &#34;rich text&#34; feature and allow me to make my own! I would have thought it was a pretty obvious and often requested feature, but as far as I can tell, it&#39;s impossible!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah neat, the app exposes an ssh agent socket:    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/.1password/agent.sock

So you would essentially replace Keychain, Gnome-keyring, or the vanilla SSH-agent with 1password. Very nice solution."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is a bad idea for users. I don&#39;t think SSH keys are things you should share across machines in a password manager. If you have two devices, then you should have two keys (though this is the subject of some debate; see [0]). Using the 1Password SSH agent encourages people to have &#34;one&#34; SSH key across devices, which means that any leaks will disproportionately impact them.It&#39;s unfortunate, because there is some real innovation around the per-application usage permissions:&gt; 1Password will ask for your consent before an SSH client can use your SSH key. Because of this, there&#39;s no concept of adding or removing keys like with the OpenSSH agent.If an organization wishes to solve the SSH pubkey distribution problem (the main reason one would copy a private key across machines), then they should use SSH certificate authorities like [1]. In fact, I think that would be a far more interesting 1Password product—HashiCorp Vault could use some competition for this kind of use-case.[0]: https://security.stackexchange.com/a/40061[1]: https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/ssh/signed-ssh-cert..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; lost access to paid services that I had set up with social loginI signed up to Quora with my Facebook account, back in the day. Deleted Facebook in 2013 and lost access to my Quora account, with no possible way to recover it.I haven&#39;t used a social login since. In my case, it was fairly harmless, but it made me realise how dangerous social login is. Every time there&#39;s a signup, I look for &#34;signup with email&#34;. It&#39;s the safer option. And if you can, use your own domain for email (Google&#39;s paid email offering supports this, as does Fastmail and countless other email providers). That way if your email provider decides to flip you off, you switch DNS records and you&#39;re up and running somewhere else, and everything keeps on running.But: If you don&#39;t have a copy of emails then you lose all saved emails, so make sure you have a backup strategy in place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google is simply not a very reliable business partner for tech. I have a decade worth of experience in the Danish public sector, where I’ve had plenty of great experiences with both Amazon and Microsoft. I know that a lot of people would prefer things to be open source, but part of what you pay for in an Enterprise Organisation is availability of support. When AWS first entered the European market, most of what they sold in the support side was rather automated. Which just couldn’t compete with what Microsoft sells, where Seattle will call you with updates every hour on the hour if you’re a big enough customer. This is a big part of why Azure managed to capture the market share it did under the nose of AWS, the other part being that once you buy Office365 well… Anyway, I’ve never seen a huge tech company change their ways as quick as Amazon did, and today they’re actually ahead of Microsoft in terms of compliance with EU legislation and Enterprise support.Google mean while has the same business-to-business support that it does for private customers like the author here. For some services it’s because Google doesn’t care, but they do care about Education and they still can’t figure out how to readjust to be a valuable business partner even when they actually want to sell you something.So my best advice to anyone using Google services would be to find a better vendor as quick as possible. It’s completely ridiculous that you can lose your business account over someone replying to a spam mail.Just imagine if Microsoft kicked the Danish government out of Office365 every time one of our employees did something silly in their emails. I know there is a difference between us as individuals and the Danish governed, but the point in trying to make is that there isn’t, not to Google at least. So maybe they are just a terrible vendor?This is all anecdotal by the way. I haven’t seen anyone complain about getting locked out of their azure essential subscription, so in my eyes that is simply a safer way to pay for g-suite type services than g-suite. That being said, I do personally host my domain and DNS stuff on their own separate accounts at their own separate vendors, both privately and professionally, exactly because you want that stuff to remain unaffected by everything else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When you put it this way, it&#39;s really quite remarkable how tenuous our hold is on even paid for digital services.There is really nothing you could do with a car to prompt the car maker to take it from you. And the state will only take it if you break the law in particularly dangerous ways.When it comes to other possessions it&#39;s even harder for anyone to take them away from you. If I take a kitchen knife and stab someone with it I will go to prison for sure, but I don&#39;t think they will take the knife away. They definitely won&#39;t ban me from buying knives.But when it&#39;s a digital service, even something as crucial as a banking service, it&#39;s seen as normal that you can lose them for posting offensive things on twitter. Perhaps it&#39;s because we haven&#39;t had these digital services for long enough to consider them as really belonging to us, so we accept that they can be taken away at the slightest provocation."</p>
