								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This ban seems to heavily take advantage of the current moment, as it&#39;s obvious that he has tweeted worse things in the past.It&#39;s strange that they picked such a poor way to justify the ban when they could have made a significantly stronger case, and in doing so could have convinced millions more people that they are trying their best to apply policies evenly. For example, I have a hard time imagining why they chose to specifically quote &#34;American Patriots&#34;, as if that somehow contributes to the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. Perhaps they have a strategic reason for going about this how they did, but I think it will have some negative 2nd/3rd order effects. that they haven&#39;t yet realized.I imagine we are still only in the early days of the conflicts that are to come in this sphere (and I&#39;d include just about every company and political faction in them, unfortunately).(Also because apparently I have to state this explicitly in every comment related to Trump: I do not support Trump, his supporters, the recent events that occurred at the capitol, etc etc)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it just my perception, or is their actual justification using the 2 quoted tweets kinda weak? Interpreting his boycott of an event as a call to violence seems like a huge stretch. It seems like they wanted to shoehorn a justification using his 2 latest tweets when the actual reason goes back further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anybody have a solution to the bigger underlying question of de-platforming and censorship on online platforms?As far as I can tell, there are two general viewpoints:a) Censorship is bad, free speech is good. You should counter bad arguments with better arguments.b) There are types of speech, which are proven to lead to violence in the long-run. Also, some things can be proven as untrue. Lies are bad.I have to say, I agree with both of those points. I think group A is missing the point, that there are echo chambers and people radicalizing within their filter-bubbles up to the point of literal terrorism, while group B is missing that the power to censor can be misused by bad actors in the future and  that silenced people will not just change their mind.Is there a proper answer for someone like me? Where should I stand on this? I am leaning towards group A, while acknowledging that radicalization does happen and dearly worrying about perversion of words like &#34;truth&#34; or &#34;fact&#34; (&#34;your/my truth&#34;, &#34;alternate facts&#34;)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been using Signal for two years now and I love it.However I really, really hope they can work on a good backup and restore process as losing my message history because I have to reinstall the app on my desktop[1] or have to reset my phone is a horrible experience.Just build an encrypted blob and zip it up and pop it on my iCloud or Google Drive or leave it local and let me deal with it but I need something. As my Signal use moves from just messages with friends and family to business contacts I need a reliable way to backup my messages![1] I should state I mean losing the desktop copy as it starts &#34;fresh&#34; and does not import any messages from the phone.Edit: I should probably clarify I am talking about the iOS/macOS applications as these are what I use. iOS does have a migration feature but that doesn&#39;t help if your phone is lost/damaged. I need a proper backup and restore process as well as the ability to import messages from the phone to the desktop app."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue with Signal that annoys me most is the complete lack of any meaningful backup/export on iOS. I lost my entire chat history when I got a new phone because their bizarre &#34;proximity based&#34; solution failed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Signal is not an open alternative.It&#39;s not federated, but most importantly, they don&#39;t allow 3rd party clients:https://github.com/LibreSignal/LibreSignal/issues/37#issueco...So you are stuck with their Electron junk without any options.Matrix should be promoted as an open alternative instead."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apologies in advance for side tracking the discussion. I came across this post on r/india looking for a volunteer Russian Interpreter for a talk by Alexandra Elbakyan, the founder of Sci-Hub. If anyone is interested, please reach out to the OP of https://www.reddit.com/r/india/comments/kpl5l4/looking_for_a..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At some point we need to stop the hypocrisy, recognize that SciHub is too valuable to the community to be shut down, and fix laws so that it becomes either legal or useless. That&#39;s no easy task, but it&#39;s much better than having scientists from all over the world rely on it while simultaneously pretending they are dangerous criminals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rights holders have been trying to get rid of sites like the pirate bay for more than a decade, and if anything PB is easier to find and more reliable to use than ever before.If they really want change, it&#39;s time for them to dispassionately consider their situation. The way to &#34;beat&#34; piracy is to consider it as a competitor, which it is. When I was a kid, everyone downloaded raw mp3s and now that number is a fraction of a fraction because there&#39;s 1) YouTube and 2) Spotify et al. You can listen to music all day with ads and not pay a cent, or you can pay a reasonable fee and get all the HQ music you can eat without ads. Publishers continue to screw content makers, but that&#39;s another conversation.Just trying to ban pirate sources is a wonderful dream for publishers for sure, but there&#39;s no way it can work. Scientific papers are just too easy to share, the need for them high, and the current pricing too insane for it to be otherwise."</p>

IT departments are notorious for over-granting privileges to these shared machines due to the mixed use they typically recieve.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s really hard to tell with Facebook if they understand that their massive data collection is at least morally questionable, and they business plan is simply a calculated risk. Given that most people seem to care more about free services, than they do about privacy, Facebook may see privacy labelling is a pointless exercise that won&#39;t change anything anyway.Or perhaps we are back at Upton Sinclair: &#34;It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.&#34; and Facebook as an organisation is simply unable to acknowledge the problem, because doing so would ruin them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"iMessage seems to be a bit dishonest, because Apple, the owner, has way more information about you through iCloud and Apple ID - contacts, location, payment data, phone number, etc.Forcing Facebook to clearly list all of this for the facebook account is great, but then failing to disclose this for their own account seems like double standard.Just like having their own separate Ad Tracking switch which is on by default.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the village of Lia, Georgia, on December 2, 2001, Three lumberjacks discovered two 90Sr cores from Soviet radioisotope thermoelectric generators. These were of the Beta-M type, built in the 80s, with an activity of 1295 TBq each. The lumberjacks were scavenging the forest for firewood, when they came across two metal cylinders melting snow within a one meter radius laying in the road. They picked up these objects to use as personal heaters, sleeping with their backs to them. All lumberjacks sought medical attention individually, and were treated for radiation injuries. One patient, DN-1, was seriously injured and required multiple skin grafts. After 893 days in the hospital, he was declared dead after a fever caused by complications and infections of a radiation ulcer on the subject&#39;s back. The disposal team consisted of 25 men who were restricted to a maximum of 2 minutes worth of exposure (max. 20mSv) each while transferring the canisters to lead-lined drums.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_civilian_radiation_acc..."</p>
