This is a &#34;necessity is the mother of invention&#34; tale that I always find fascinating starting with &#34;Andrew Booth, whom Kathleen would eventually marry, had previously done X-ray crystallography research at the University of Birmingham and that included doing a lot of computations. This started him down the path of building computing machines to make the work easier.&#34;:https://hackaday.com/2018/08/21/kathleen-booth-assembling-ea..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, coding in Assembly language during the C64 and Amiga Demo-scene in the 80s is the major reason that I went on to study Computer Science and ended up working as a system developer for the past 30+ years. One of my fondest memories from my developer experience is writing the first Amiga Demo Creator entirely in Assembly language back in May 1987:https://coding-and-computers.blogspot.com/2022/05/first-amig..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dr. Booth (her late husband) was one of my engineering professors back at the University of Victoria back in the early ‘90s. It’s amazing that modern CPUs still use the multiplication circuits he created (along with his wife). Also one of several people that can claim to have created the first spinning magnetic storage!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to see some people are making it work living off these types of projects.&gt; I created a Patreon back in April of 2019. I felt a bit silly at the time, with thoughts like “who do I think I am” and “what am I even doing” echoing in my head. I still did it though. I was too curious to see what would happen, even though I expected nothing. Amazingly, a couple of people actually signed up!I&#39;m definitely relating to this experience. Feels hella pretentious and weird to set up donations. Was likewise surprised to actually get people sending me money. I guess the moral of the story is if you build cool things, people are willing to chip in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for sharing Andreas! It&#39;s absolutely phenomenal how far along SerenityOS has come and it&#39;s also a peek at how FOSS is supposed to be - a way to learn, hack on something fun, share it with others but without any huge expectations.Building the next unicorn is awesome and all but in my opinion, this has it&#39;s own place. I am glad some people out there get to work on their dream projects and actually can make a living out it. Kudos to all the supporters, obviously.I also love how focused SerenityOS is and what kind of audience it caters to. Some people might say, &#34;make it for everyone&#34; but that doesn&#39;t work most of the time. Having a focused audience allows a lot of freedom in the way of UX/DX, docs, communication etc. So I am glad Andreas set that down upfront."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah, Andreas YT programming sessions. The length, the sincerity, the mood. The way he is able to communicate with us while being alone in a room. His very conscious effort to not get side tracked. And, of course, him just being a really effective programmer, while not being flashy or pretentious about tech or tooling in the least (and also probably because of it).Sometimes I watch and listen intently, and learn a lot. Sometimes I zone a little. It&#39;s perfect. If you are interested in programming in general I can just highly recommend checking it out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In this particular case, I suspect a trademark complaint against Google would make sense.Google misrepresented the ad as the product of the Gimp project, and were paid as a result.  They usually use an &#34;obeying the law would not scale&#34; type argument in court, but that would clearly be bullshit in this case.  They have a business relationship with the ad buyer, and should have verified their affiliation with gimp.org.  Also, a simple string match on the URL would expose the attempted fraud on Google&#39;s end.I&#39;m not sure how to check if Gimp is a registered trademark in the US.  This page kind of implies it might be (or that the author of the page does not understand trademarks):https://www.gimp.org/about/selling.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is also a huge issue with Blender and pops up on /r/blender from time to time.(Here&#39;s a few random recent examples: https://redd.it/xxkx5s https://redd.it/vvrxko https://redd.it/xwkky8 https://redd.it/vuqu1r)Ad networks and content providers get up in arms over widespread ad blocking but then allow stuff like this through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think people are missing the actual issue here. Google used to have a clear distinction between what&#39;s an ad and what is organic.In these screenshots you have to pay good attention to see the top result is an ad.To keep their conversion numbers up they had to constantly reduce the difference between the ads and everything else. The fact that they can do this and we are so used to it that we don&#39;t first identify that as the culprit is quite interesting.I have ran a few Google ads in the recent years and the people who come through them, some of them, clearly have no idea that they have clicked on an ad. This might be good for business but I think it does more harm overall."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have said this countless times, and I will say it again - it is just marvelous how Lichess provides so much value being completely free (both libre and gratis).I would love to see more publicity of Lichess though - and seems like this move will help in that regard.I don&#39;t know for sure, but is there any other chess organization in the world of this scope that is truly non-profit? Sure, FIDE itself is non-profit, but profit-motives of its commercial counterparts and allies are controversial, to say the least."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I think a US non-profit makes a lot of sense, I would exercise caution with the non-profit board.The board’s job is to provide oversight and to appoint a director [1]. In this case it would clearly be Thibault, but what happens in a few years when Thibault is ready to go? Does he have say in his replacement? Does the French organization take precedent over the US nonprofit when it comes to leadership and governance?I say this because Lichess is extremely valuable (even as a non-profit) and that will attract the wrong kind of people. Thibault should take every precaution to make sure he retains control of the org, with good people around him. I’m not sure if there is a non-profit equivalent of retaining voting rights, but I’d want to be sure he retains control until it’s well established as a non-profit and a succession plan is in place.The wrong board could evaluate his performance (which right now he says he works at his leisure and loves what he does) and say “we need more fundraising and appearances in the US at tournaments” and he could balk / want to focus on the product. They could then look to appoint a US director of the nonprofit and things could get awkward and extremely costly.It’s incredible what has been built and maintained with a small team. I think they will see extreme diminishing returns after they hit a certain level of governance. Whether that’s going international with a nonprofit status in the US or at another point is beyond my level of expertise.If someone more knowledgeable that I am can correct what I’ve written above and point out that my concerns are overblown, I’d be happy. I’d also ask that person to volunteer and help Lichess establish a presence in the US.[1] https://www.councilofnonprofits.org/tools-resources/board-ro..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Therefore, in 2016, Lichess was formally registered under French law as an association loi 1901. This type of association applies to groups with clearly defined purposes that benefit the public, similar to charities. However, it’s quite easy to form one - the total number in France is over 1.5 million!It is surprising that Lichess is a French charity, much like VLC. France also has a very low entry barrier for forming an LLC, so it seems to be a rather good approach all things considered.&gt; once we become an association of general interest, our French donors will be able to make tax-deductible donations, meaning they can reduce their individual tax burden through supporting us. In theory, this should also apply to donors who are citizens of other EU countries, but the last bit of legislation supporting EU-wide application was passed in 2009 and we’re still waiting for it to be cleanly implemented. Classic EU.It really is a running theme that EU member state governments have to be dragged kicking and screaming to implement beneficial EU directives as local laws while they at the same time blame the EU for everything unpopular they do themselves. If that&#39;s not a clear indicator that the Parliament should have more authority to assert itself I don&#39;t know what is. At least we get the &#34;project funded by the EU&#34; signs on random buildings to not make the good stuff completely invisible on the local level."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A great attempt to dodge vesting schedules and escape doling out severance. Even if they convince many engineers to quit willingly, one presumes that the next step is rounds of layoffs with cause.California is at-will, but notoriously anal regarding mass-layoffs. My serious question is, regardless of with or without cause, surely some employment attorneys are licking their lips at the stack of prospective cases they&#39;re about to have, right?If I was a Twitter engineer, I&#39;d be trying to figure out how to maximize my severance package right about now."</p>

especially Part 2, detailing the lives of Jim Slater, Tiny Rowland and
James Goldsmith who pioneered the hostile takeover, and the effect of
acquisitions and mergers on the overall global economy. Hard to
imagine that only 50 years ago this wasn&#39;t a &#34;done thing&#34;. Today I see
these same patterns play out in development and artistic communities
oblivious to 51 percent and Sybil attacks, unaware of who is holding
what key assets, and then being surprised by takeovers and defectors.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mayfair_Set"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I&#39;ve mentioned elsewhere in this thread, I&#39;m a contributor to gitea and have no ownership in the new organization. I genuinely would like some clarification to the points in the letter, as I&#39;m trying to advise the owners and understand my future with the project.It seems like the demands are:&gt; Implementing an intuitive and fair election process.I think we do that now: https://github.com/go-gitea/gitea/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#...
Anyone who has contributed to the gitea project more than 2x PRs is invited to be a maintainer. Every maintainer gets 3 votes.
Maybe there are some suggestions for improving - please open a PR.&gt; Describing the ways in which democratic decisions are to be made.Again, I&#39;m just confused what&#39;s being requested. Moving on.&gt; Providing accessible places where all relevant information can be found.This seems like the same request as above. Or maybe a request for better documentation. I agree. Open a PR, don&#39;t fork gitea.&gt; Establishing a DoOcracy that works and continue to improve it.I agree with this and I suspect that was the intention with the original reference to DAOs, but needs to be clarified.&gt; A non-profit organisation owned by the Gitea community is created.
&gt; The Gitea trademark and domains are transferred to the non-profit.
&gt; The name of the company is changed to avoid any confusion with the non-profit.Does anyone have experience with how this is typically handled? It seems like this is the only actionable request. What are some examples of non-profit open-source companies? Is that typical?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the story from the announcement[1].&gt; We have a long history of trying to bring Factorio to other platforms, including consoles and mobile phones (not including April Fools). We even worked with some external companies, but the projects never even got to the point where they would run technically, let alone the complicated part of making the game playable using controllers or touch screen.&gt; We had some history of starting Factorio-related sub-projects that ended up in development hell for yearsThis reminds me of their post on good foundations[2].It sounds like they discovered the pain of growing tech debt and paralysis due to an aging stack, and the lack of results when you throw money at the problem (in other words, contract work to some external entity).What&#39;s also interesting is that this work ended up being a one-person project. It&#39;s just too hard to make progress fast when you add people to a project: people don&#39;t agree, they need to communicate not to overlap or to understand the changes added by others, this all slow things down. And if the stack is complicated, this can really put a stop to productivity.I think there&#39;s a real case for having one-person teams for the first X months on a new project. As long as the one person understands how they can later scale themselves. (This usually requires documentation, good architecture, good delegation, etc.)[1]: https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-370[2]: https://www.factorio.com/blog/post/fff-366"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not sure why this pops up now, nothing new afaik, but I&#39;ll take this as a chance to leave a quick review ;)I bought one during the kickstarter, mostly for note taking; but also as a ereader &amp; perhaps drawing tool.
- For note taking: I prefer a simple paper notebook, as my notes are more procedural. I don&#39;t really look back often. It&#39;s fine. Just not better then paper for note taking imo. 
- As a e-reader, it is absolute dog shit. period.
- If you are not artistic, this will not change that
- The subscription model is terrible, I&#39;ve cancelled my &#39;grandfathered&#39; account and tried to sell my rm2 over it.
- Currently using it as exceedingly expensive notepad, no cloud crap etc.
- Battery life is kinda meh, either you have it go to standby and have to wait a few second to use it. Or it is constantly empty when you want to use it. Not the eInk experience I had expected.You can install custom software, as it is not locked down, that might solve some of these issues. I haven&#39;t tried. For me, this is just a notepad. And not a great one at that. I use it mainly because I paid for it tbh.I have several friend that have one too and enjoy it much more, but this how I experienced it, ymmv obviously."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am one of the original kickstarter backers and got mine at a very favorable price compared to what they are selling it for now. As a original kickstarter backer they also provided me with a free tier for their subscription service so I am not paying anything extra to have full functionality, this is very important to me because I am not very excited of subscription based software features - remarkable please take note of this!The remarkable unit is still a thing of beauty. It excels at what it does, and I bring it with me everywhere. I use the cloud features to pick up documents and use it to hold my PDFs and eBooks and it is an important device for my note taking. I have modded the unit a little bit by replacing the original back-ground pictures. To be able to access this device as root appeals very much to me, I very much feel in control of my device.From a security point of view, they still have some work to do. It is embarrassing when the unit goes into sleep mode and private notes are kept visible to everyone. I created a ticket in they support system, but they don&#39;t seem to take it seriously. There is also the issue with only having a 4-code pin to unlock the device. This means that you must be very careful with what you write and store on the unit. Sensitive notes should not be stored on the unit.There is also no way to deprecate the unit and the content if it is lost or it hasn&#39;t check in against the cloud.The software that is installed on your PC/Mac has very basic functionality.Overall, would still strongly recommend, 8/10."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought a rm2 a while back but abandoned it when I discovered it had extremely weak security: no fde, a weak remotely-resettable 4 digit pin, no local file syncing (doesn&#39;t appear as a mass storage device when plugged in as a usb, doesnt support standard file transfer protocols), non-e2ee (!!) cloud syncing (their company can see my notes unencrypted).Now I use an android tablet that I locked down + synching and i couldn&#39;t be happier. The only thing I&#39;m missing now is a good note taking app that writes my notes to a directory that can be synced with synching. Recent versions of android broke this for all apps except Google&#39;s Files app unfortunately."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; To make this possible, we ported the following to WebAssembly: the Tailscale client, WireGuard®, a complete userspace network stack (from gVisor), and an SSH client.Would it be possible to bundle the same into a portable application allowing you to use Tailscale without installing it? My understanding is that currently if you can&#39;t install Tailscale on a client you need to use Subnet Router.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Could the Tailscale client be packaged as an extension so I can visit sites on my Tailnet without having to install a client? Sometimes I want to visit a &#34;internal&#34; site without having to install the client, if I&#39;m using a temporary box for something. I&#39;m not sure how much more work would have to be done, might have to dig into the open source pieces of this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Going off on a tangent, but the scale of production is very hard to grasp.  I&#39;m probably not the first person to observe this, but I once did some napkin math about steel production, and what I realized kind of blew me away.  About 1.9 billion tonnes in 2020.  Like with billions of dollars, I have no intuition for such numbers.  Context is needed.Global steel production just before WW I was about 70 million tonnes.  So production has increased about thirty-fold in one century.  That wasn&#39;t so shocking to me, at first.  But 1910 was not the beginning of the industrial era; things had been under way for more than a century then.  Railroads.  Ocean liners.  Factories.  Knives and rivets for fabric owned by hundreds of millions of people.  Dozens of skyscrapers in New York by then; the Brooklyn Bridge hung on thousands of tonnes of cable.  All made out of steel.Then it struck me.  A few million tonnes a year in 1850.  70 million tonnes in 1910.  All of it adds up to less than 1900 million tonnes.  Every single tonne of steel manufactured by humans from prehistory until about a century ago -- the entire output of the industrial revolution -- amounts to less than one year at current production."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The sad thing is that 100 years ago humans and livestock accounted for around 5% of the biomass (all zoomass, not land mammals only), 95% being the wildlife. Now the numbers are reversed.We&#39;ve stolen the land from the wildlife and dedicated it to a few species we consider edible (agriland is more than forests now, and 75% of it for animal agriculture).Is anybody surprised that we&#39;re living in the anthropocene, defined by massive die off of wild species?We have to (as a species) return the land to wildlife and let it repopulate the earth, otherwise we&#39;ll lose them. We don&#39;t even know what gems we&#39;re losing. I&#39;m not talking about some bugs, but about dna - those are millions of years of (computer) code generated by nature, code so precious we don&#39;t even have an idea how to simulate it, let alone understand it (at this point in our evolution).If we lose it, goodbye new medicines, new regenerative dna techniques, new technologies, and who knows what. We simply cannot know what we&#39;re stealing from future humans (this point was made for the selfish humans we are, better arguments could be made)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lets take in mind that there is a problem to compare two groups when one group is much easier to measure than the other. The error interval in the mammal biomass should be much higher. The actual real values are probably not so extreme.... I see, is just megafauna. The most competitive groups (rodents and bats) are deliberately excluded. The title is incorrect then."</p>
