								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m only part way through the paper, but what struck me as interesting so far is this:In other text-to-image algorithms I&#39;m familiar with (the ones you&#39;ll typically see passed around as colab notebooks that people post outputs from on Twitter), the basic idea is to encode the text, and then try to make an image that maximally matches that text encoding.  But this maximization often leads to artifacts - if you ask for an image of a sunset, you&#39;ll often get multiple suns, because that&#39;s even more sunset-like.   There&#39;s a lot of tricks and hacks to regularize the process so that it&#39;s not so aggressive, but it&#39;s always an uphill battle.Here, they instead take the text embedding, use a trained model (what they call the &#39;prior&#39;) to predict the corresponding image embedding - this removes the dangerous maximization.  Then, another trained model (the &#39;decoder&#39;) produces images from the predicted embedding.This feels like a much more sensible approach, but one that is only really possible with access to the giant CLIP dataset and computational resources that OpenAI has."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;We’ve limited the ability for DALL·E 2 to generate ... adult images.I think that using something like this for porn could potentially offer the biggest benefit to society. So much has been said about how this industry exploits young and vulnerable models. Cheap autogenerated images (and in the future videos) would pretty much remove the demand for human models and eliminate the related suffering, no?EDIT: typo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few comments by someone who&#39;s spent way too much time in the AI-generated space:* I recommend reading the Risks and Limitations section that came with it because it&#39;s very through: https://github.com/openai/dalle-2-preview/blob/main/system-c...* Unlike GPT-3, my read of this announcement is that OpenAI does not intend to commercialize it, and that access to the waitlist is indeed more for testing its limits (and as noted, commercializing it would make it much more likely lead to interesting legal precedent). Per the docs, access is very explicitly limited: (https://github.com/openai/dalle-2-preview/blob/main/system-c... )* A few months ago, OpenAI released GLIDE ( https://github.com/openai/glide-text2im ) which uses a similar approach to AI image generation, but suspiciously never received a fun blog post like this one. The reason for that in retrospect may be &#34;because we made it obsolete.&#34;* The images in the announcement are still cherry-picked, which is therefore a good reason why they tested DALL-E 1 vs. DALL-E 2 presumably on non-cherrypicked images.* Cherry-picking is relevant because AI image generation is still slow unless you do real shenanigans that likely compromise image quality, although OpenAI has likely a better infra to handle large models as they have demonstrated with GPT-3.* It appears DALL-E 2 has a fun endpoint that links back to the site for examples with attribution: https://labs.openai.com/s/Zq9SB6vyUid9FGcoJ8slucTu"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m very similar and would just give you two pieces of advice: (1) buy books compulsively and don&#39;t do your research predominantly online, and (2) make sure you write often, whether or not you publish your work or keep it to yourself. I think the latter is the most important advice for those trying to pursue an intellectual path outside of academia -- if you don&#39;t develop a habit of writing, you aren&#39;t really synthesizing what you&#39;ve learned and developing your thought. Don&#39;t worry if the quality is not great to begin with (and certainly don&#39;t worry that it seems cliched).The other thing I would suggest, if your career and family would manage, is spending time working in the UK. It&#39;s very easy to get a visa if you&#39;re involved in the tech industry and their higher education system for MA/MS degrees and PhDs is very different than the US, both more affordable and better suited towards working life. In the US, the thought is that if you&#39;re doing a PhD, say, it&#39;s a full-time professionalized pursuit under the assumption you will be a professor; in the rest of the world, a PhD is essentially an apprenticeship in writing under a mentor for however long it takes you, often with no aim (i.e. career) other than that writing itself.Personally, I&#39;ve alternated between highly-paid years working in the tech industry and years studying or writing without employment to great personal satisfaction (and managed to help publish a few scholarly anthologies that wouldn&#39;t have happened without someone who didn&#39;t need to rely on academic grants etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t quit your day job - ya gotta pay the rent. And in the meantime, if you gain satisfaction from satisfying your curiosity about myriad things, go with that. It doesn&#39;t have to have an end or a greater purpose. Everybody you know has a head filled with things they&#39;ll never &#34;usefully apply&#34; to the greater world around them: it&#39;s a fact of life. So if you end up on your deathbed with nothing having really clicked for you - no celebrity, no fortune - then that&#39;s how it goes. There is always your family - don&#39;t screw that up. 
The world&#39;s a mess and so are most of the people in it so don&#39;t sweat it. Sturgeon&#39;s Law applies.
But by all means gather friends around you with whom you can have civilized, intelligent conversation - it&#39;s important."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Investing might be an area where you can profit from being the way you are.I am very similar, having read way over 1k books in the last ten years or so, on a perversely wide array of subjects. I’ve also done everything from tinkering with Arduinos all the way to marriage counseling. But I quickly get bored and move on to the next field.An early disciple of CG Jung, Marie Louise von Franz, wrote that the life of our personality type looks like a never ending track of fields sown but never reaped.But while you may never stay long enough on a field to reap its fruit, what you do reap is a very interconnected, multidisciplinary way of understanding the world, which comes to you not so much in the form of explicit knowledge but in the form of a very special “intuition”.That isn’t to say that you are infallible. In fact, you should always be careful to question that intuition and to try to make as much of it as possible explicit, even just to yourself. But if you do that, you have a good chance of being quite successful with a Peter Thiel style of investing.Just always keep in mind your three biggest enemies: The mimetic reflex of wanting to follow the herd and get approval from others. The seductive illusion of superiority or infallibility. And the general tendency of wanting to be right, and of fooling yourself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You don&#39;t need to use Twitter&#39;s JS to show Tweets. If you choose to use their system, you&#39;re subject to their rules. If you don&#39;t like their rules, don&#39;t use their stuff.Calling it &#34;altering the public record&#34; is a little hyperbolic imo. If you want to act as a repository for the public record, you better use your own system. Twitter is under no obligation to retain this kind of stuff on your behalf.I&#39;m not trying to say that this is right or wrong, just that these are the facts of the matter when you engage with a company&#39;s code and terms of service."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see so many people here arguing that by embedding javascript directly from Twitter, you are accepting whatever they choose to make that javascript do. While that is true to an extent, Twitter has provided documentation for this javascript that says that if the Tweet gets deleted, the javascript will simply stop styling your quote of the tweet that you have on your website.By changing the behavior of the javascript, without even updating the documentation, Twitter has broken every rule of being a good distributor of third-party code. In a similar vein, any third party code could at any time do any number of malicious things. Just because I didn&#39;t pay Twitter for the privilege of running their code and just because I embedded their code in my website does not make it okay for them to start distributing malware to modify my website to their liking.There are lots of other malicious things Twitter could have the javascript do. Twitter could start showing ads before and after all quoted tweets. This would also conflict with the documentation and would be malicious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Functionality aside embedding random scripts from twitter seems like a big risk for security and privacy.At a minimum, it should probably be embedded in a sandboxed iframe.Just taking a screenshot, and linking to the tweet, seems like a more robust solution, that won&#39;t randomly stop working, and doesn&#39;t have the same privacy issues."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A couple things about the content of this post, that people aren&#39;t talking about. Mastering Emacs by Mickey Petersen is a solid book on Emacs and a good companion to the official manual. Mickey usually has an update to Mastering Emacs not long after a new version is released, which is great. I&#39;m thankful for his many contributions to the Emacs community, and I really enjoyed reading his thoughts on the new features and additions to Emacs 28.Secondly, the breadth of the changes in Emacs 28.1 is staggering, especially considering that Emacs 27.1 was released some 19 months ago. I think it&#39;s safe to say that despite all the hand-wringing about the antiquated email-centric way that Emacs is developed, an impressive amount of work is getting done. Emacs  development is alive and well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wayland support didn&#39;t make it...

Oh and my config is an org file with clear comments...https://github.com/pimeys/nixos/tree/main/desktop/emacsAll reproducible...Btw. I recommend SystemCrafters video series Emacs from scratch.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been testing Emacs 28 for a few weeks now, as it was reported to improve performance on LSP integration (which was sometimes sluggish for me with rust).I have to say I wasn&#39;t disappointed. It&#39;s now comparatively blazingly fast. I hugely recommend to give it a try if you work in emacs with LSP.Since my distro had not packaged it yet, I installed it from guix instead (package `emacs-next`). It worked like a charm."</p>

When the patent was reviewed, the examiner found the user doc on the internet and rejected the application due to prior art.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Identifying the connection between one-way functions and Kolmogorov complexity is truly impressive. But the article oversimplified a few things that may be misleading for someone.1. One-way functions are not all cryptography. Some constructions may need stronger assumptions than one-way functions (we don&#39;t know yet if they do). So this problem is a “Master Problem” only for a subset of cryptography (symmetric encryption, pseudorandom generators, etc.).2. This is not the first “Master Problem” to base one-way functions on. There&#39;s Levin&#39;s complete one way function [1; Section 4.3]. Breaking it is proven to be as hard as any other one-way function, in other words if there exist one-way functions then this is one of them. But Levin&#39;s construction is somewhat artificial (it combines many one-way function candidates to create the “master one-way function”) and is not as surprising since its techniques and formulation are similar to how the usual one-way functions are defined. The connection from the linked article, on the other hand, is very surprising and unusual; it connects one-way functions to a more distant field which (to me) seems to be operating with quite different concepts.It&#39;s also fun to know that similar “Master Problems” exist for other primitives too. For example, for public-key encryption there&#39;s a Complete Public Key cryptosystem [2]. Albeit this one is similar in spirit to Levin&#39;s construction (not as surprising IMO as the linked article), the complete cryptosystem is obtained by combining many other cryptosystems.[1]: https://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0012023[2]: https://eccc.weizmann.ac.il//eccc-reports/2006/TR06-046/inde..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An even more tantalizing result by the prolific Rafael and Yanyi is the following paper [1] which discusses how to relate the existence of one-way functions to the assumption that BPP \neq EXP (two classes).If you spend the time understanding just the statement of their result in that paper, you get to an eerily small gap between &#34;heuristic algorithms&#34; for a version of the time-bounded K-complexity, and &#34;errorless&#34; versions of it.Their line of research has been even more inspiring than this very well-written quanta article suggests.[1] https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/535.pdf"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;If they do not, cryptographers have shown, then secure cryptography is impossible.&#34;It seems like they&#39;re using &#34;secure cryptography&#34; kind of narrowly, as AFAIK a one-time pad could still be secure without any kind of one-way function."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; First off, there’s Lumen—a fully dynamic global illumination solution that enables you to create believable scenes where indirect lighting adapts on the fly to changes to direct lighting or geometry—for example, changing the sun’s angle with the time of day, turning on a flashlight, or opening an exterior door. With Lumen, you no longer have to author lightmap UVs, wait for lightmaps to bake, or place reflection captures; you can simply create and edit lights inside the Unreal Editor and see the same final lighting your players will see when the game or experience is run on the target platform.Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but isn&#39;t this basically a software-based implementation of NVIDIA&#39;s hardware-based RTX?"</p>

Now those reports just go to google-abuse-bounces-reports@devnull[0].I suppose relative to their market size one could make an argument that they are doing a good job of “only” being the source of ~1.8% of all spam[1], and who knows what they did with these reports to begin with, but the intentional deterioration of reporting capability isn’t a great look, and there’s no effective recourse since they are too big to block outright.[0] https://www.spamcop.net/w3m?action=inprogress[1] https://www.spamcop.net/hoshame.shtml"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don’t see how this could ever be legitimate. Giving out an unlaunched shitcoin and a t shirt in exchange for the biometric data of people who very clearly don’t understand crypto or biometric data (read: random person in a mall, regardless of country). This is pretty clearly taking advantage of people.My question is, couldn’t you do this fairly without even spending that much money? Say you need 5MM scans to build your database (that you’re going to delete the data from anyway). With shitcoins it’s close to free, but you had to pay a bunch of engineers and marketers. Why not give each person $5 USD converted to their local currency? For $25MM you are actually having a positive impact, don’t get dragged through the mud in articles like this, and it didn’t even cost that much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Worldcoin talks about UBI which based on what Sam has said in the past I would take them at their word on. But beyond UBI what WorldCoin is going for is identity.In the nonblockchain world your identity is your Country ID, Passport, etc.In the blockchain world none of that stuff exists and people get uncomfortable when you start asking for it.This leaves a situation where a person is often just represented by a wallet. Well as you may know a person can make dozens or hundreds of wallets.This problem leads to all kinds of weird tricks that crypto projects get up to when trying to verify 1 wallet 1 person. For example in the idea of 1 person 1 vote on a project or for something like an airdrop early in a project where people on a discord get free crypto for being early adopters but you don&#39;t want one person registering with many wallets.Today that might look verification based on a phone number associated with discord or something. Real flimsy stuff.Worldcoin bases it on retina, which I admit creeps me out as well even if it&#39;s just a hash. But I can see what they&#39;re getting at. The need is there, maybe there is a better way.I used to work at crypto startup and we ran into this exact problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a few interactions with employees at Worldcoin. At a high level they&#39;re trying to solve a worthy problem: proof of personhood for crypto.HN is very anti-crypto so I expect any conversation on this topic is an uphill battle. If you&#39;re generally sceptical of crypto, Worldcoin will seem outright useless to you. I tend to believe there are some great ideas embedded in the cryptocurrency world alongside a lot of noise and speculation. Eventually the &#34;signal&#34; and core ideas will rise through, perhaps after a long period of pain.There are a whole class of ideas in crypto that require one wallet/address to correspond to one single person. Like all powerful ideas, there are ways that this could bring great value to the world and unfortunately also ways that this could be horrifically abused. Proof of personhood for crypto could enable verifiable UBI for the world. It could also enable mass surveillance if widely adopted.Given the interesting potential of the idea, someone was going to eventually work on it. Worldcoin should have approached the problem slightly differently. First, testing the concept in lower-income countries has a &#34;colonial experimentation&#34; look to it. Since the idea is controversial, they would have gained more goodwill by initially launching in the EU/North America under the more strict legal frameworks. Second, make the orb look less dystopian. Third, launch with a non-economic use case. Worldcoin won&#39;t solve UBI or inequality in one shot, so why not launch with a lower stakes use case such as an online forum or community that requires proof of personhood to post?Sadly I think because of all the missteps, I can&#39;t see Worldcoin tackling the proof of personhood problem in the longterm. I hope another project comes along and makes an attempt more &#34;sensitively&#34;."</p>
