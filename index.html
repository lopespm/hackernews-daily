								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was at IBM 15 years ago, IBM was far from being a monopoly, since there were plenty of competitors in the hardware space (HP, Sun, Dell, etc) and in the software space (Oracle, SAP, etc.) and in the Services space (Accenture, PwC, KPMG, etc.) employees still had to complete annual legal training that was very similar to what was described in the post.Any large company with half-way competent legal counsel is going to tell their employees not to say, &#34;our goal is to crush our competitors, dominate the market, and hear the lamentation of their women.&#34;  Instead they will tell their employees to focus on making life better for their customers.   It&#39;s a much healthier way for product managers to focus, and what you might do if the goal is &#34;crush/dominate the competition&#34; is *not* the same than if the goal is delight the customer.   So it&#39;s not just a messaging strategy to prevent embarassing e-mails from coming out at trial; it&#39;s a business strategy, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such an uncharitable interpretation of the training materials. The material there is not saying &#34;if you want to speak about things that raise antitrust concerns, use this coded language&#34;, it&#39;s saying &#34;don&#39;t do these things, and just focus on building a good product&#34;.Like, the thing here that really boggles my mind: if the training materials had said literally the exact opposite of what they do: &#34;crush the competition, find ways to prevent competitors from competing fairly with us&#34; etc. — someone like the author would write an article vilifying them. (And rightly so.) So the company instead says &#34;focus on our product; competition is good and okay&#34; and … they&#39;re vilified for it. Damned if they do, damned if they don&#39;t.By this article&#39;s twisted logic, any company focused on their product is just engaging in newspeak for thinly veiled anti-competitive behavior. Or is it just if Google does it?(It kills me to argue this, since I think normally these threads/articles spawn good debate about the size and scope of FAANG. But… this one is ridiculous.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is about being careful what you put in writing, because the discovery process for lawsuits will find your carelessly written email and opposing lawyers will take it out of context, and do you want to end up in court years later explaining what you meant?Google has so many employees that they need training to limit the damage from random chatter and speculation.It’s more cumbersome to have to talk about some things via video chat, but it’s not about limiting thought."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“All rides in the program will have an autonomous specialist on board for now”This tells me that we’re still a long way from full level 4 (and certainly level 5) autonomy in a busy city like San Francisco. The edge cases requiring immediate human attention are still too frequent for the human safety driver to be remote, as is the case in Phoenix.Also, just a reminder that Waymo in Phoenix is nowhere close to being level 5, since it is still heavily geofences and requires those remote safety monitors. I still think that true level 5 (i.e. ability to drive autonomously everywhere with zero human oversight with a safety record equivalent to the median human driver) requires AGI. Would love to be proven wrong!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Waymo is currently the only SAE Level 4[0] self-driving car in use, right? The wheel must not be used. Even though it is limited to two cities.Their technology seems an order of magnitude above the rest, although factoring in its cost could make it look worse. (Can it turn a profit, when including the development costs?)Tesla FSD is at best SAE level 3 (can need human fallback), and at worst level 2 (needs constant human monitoring).[0]: https://blog.waymo.com/2020/10/revealing-our-approach-to-saf..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s fantastic to see Waymo&#39;s progress. SF is a real nightmare to drive. If they can nail it there, that&#39;s 2/2 for busy, urban street driving (SF) and &#34;boring&#34; suburban driving (Chandler, AZ). They&#39;ve been quietly very confident of their tech, but this is a real test.Tangentially, I&#39;ve also noticed that Waymo has picked up pace ever since the recent leadership changes. They are publishing more blog posts, offering more insights into their tech and generally seem to have increased their PR game. I wonder if that was a mandate from Alphabet leadership to show some urgency."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Actually this makes sense. Already since recent iOS versions have started popping up an alert to grant access to local network resources per app, I&#39;ve noticed this popping up on several apps that have no business mapping and fingerprinting my LAN. Including the Facebook app.It&#39;s weird how a company can be so internally disconnected. This entitlement is a good privacy-preserving hurdle to prevent scummy apps from interfering with your local network and fingerprinting you. On the other hand, the on-device scanning of nudes in imessage and csam in iphoto is a total snitchware swatting-as-a-service piece of software which only serves to incriminate and harass the owner of the device. Such a shame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, this is about Bonjour, which is pretty cool. David Abramson and I released a multiplayer Horse Racing game, called PocketJockey on iOS 2.1. During game play each device would play its local copy of the William Tell Overture. We used packet latency to synchronize tracks. You would then bounce up and down as though you were a jockey. If you bounced in time to the music your horse would go faster. There was an announcer that would announce the status of your horse, which was also in synch. Up to 4 players could be playing in the same room with the exact same music and announcer emanating from their pocket. All on the original iPhone. To use an overused term, the experience was &#34;magical&#34; That&#39;s what you can do with Bonjour.So, what&#39;s the attack vector? A back door, perhaps? Bonjour requires a user approval dialog. A misleading title of the dialog may allow someone to connect. Maybe extract private data.Imagine a peer-to-peer chat app. Say, in Hong Kong --  during a protest. Or in Kabul -- during an evacuation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; you have to explain yourself to humans at AppleThis is such an honor. I was starting to suspect no actual humans other than the developers and the managers work at FFANG at all given how hard it is to contact them. Perhaps in this case it is not a human either but a neural network of a sort.Anyway, I believe everything should be done this way, through communicating with humans. Humans should study every ad and every app before it gets published (but I support side-loading for users willing to opt-out), humans should review every video before it gets de-monetized or removed, humans should communicate on every appeal. I would vote for a law mandating this.PS: The more news of this kind the more I feel like buying an iPhone perhaps. I don&#39;t like how they restrict the users but I bloody adore how they restrict the apps (with exception of some cases like iDOS, terminal apps, alternative-engine web browsers etc - I certainly don&#39;t like Apple banning them)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well... we have 3 node MongoDB cluster and are processing up to a million trades... per second. And a trade is way more complex than a chat message. Has tens to hundreds of fields, may require enriching with data from multiple external services and then requires to be stored, be searchable with unknown, arbitrary bitemporal queries and may need multiple downstream systems to be notified depending on a lot of factors when it is modified.All this happens on the aforementioned MongoDB cluster and just two server nodes. And the two server nodes are really only for redundancy, a single node easily fits the load.What I want to say is:-- processing a hundred million simple transactions per day is nothing difficult on modern hardware.-- modern servers have stupendous potential to process transactions which is 99.99% wasted by &#34;modern&#34; application stacks,-- if you are willing to spend a little bit of learning effort, it is easily possible to run millions of non trivial transactions per second on a single server,-- most databases (even as bad as MongoDB is) have a potential to handle much more load than people think they can. You just need to kind of understand how it works and what its strengths are and play into rather than against them.And if you think we are running Rust on bare metal and some super large servers -- you would be wrong. It is a normal Java reactive application running on OpenJDK on an 8 core server with couple hundred GB of memory. And the last time I needed to look at the profiler was about a year ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used cassandra quite a bit and even I had to go back and figure out what this primary key means:    ((channel_id, bucket), message_id)

The primary key consists of partition key + clustering columns, so this says that channel_id &amp; bucket are the partition key, and message_id is the one and only clustering column (you can have more).They also cite the most common cassandra mistake, which is not understanding that your partition key has to limit partition size to less than 300MB, and no surprise: They had to craft the &#34;bucket&#34; column as a function of message date-time because that&#39;s usually the only way to prevent a partition from eventually growing too large. Anyhow, this is incredibly important if you don&#39;t want to suffer a catastrophic failure months/years after you thought everything was good to go.They didn&#39;t mention this part: Oh, I have to include all partition key columns in every query&#39;s &#34;where&#34; clause, so... I have to run as many queries as are needed for the time period of data I want to see, and stitch the results together... ugh... Yeah it&#39;s a little messy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Security and convenience are usually in direct competition with each other.  Customer service people have to listen to people yell at them when convenience is sacrificed and aren&#39;t held accountable for security problems.  They therefore optimize for customer convenience.  I don&#39;t completely fault them for it. If anyone has had the frustration of sitting on the phone with a customer service rep trying to remember a PIN code that was setup 5 years ago when signing up with an ISP and was never thought about since, you can probably understand it.It is easy to blame a single person or a single company for poor practices, but I have yet to encounter any real solution to this problem that allows someone to prove they are who they say they are which is able to hit the sweet spot between too many false positives (hijacked accounts) and too many false negatives (valid customers locked out).If I was a security-minded person looking for startup ideas, this is the problem I would be looking to solve."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can almost guarantee this is due to licensing issues with the camera firmware. Modern cameras aren&#39;t just hardware any more. They&#39;re a mix of hardware and advanced processing algorithms that really do make a huge difference in the final output. Those algorithms are often licensed from 3rd parties with specific licensing requirements.Sony has been reasonably good about enabling open-source and fixing these things in the past, so I&#39;d give them the benefit of the doubt that they&#39;ll try to find a way to enable the cameras on unlocked phones in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AFAIK similar thing happens with Sony smartphones. They claim to officially support AOSP. But:&#34;If you unlock the bootloader, you may void the warranty of your device and/or any warranty from your operator. See your device’s warranty statement for details. Additionally, due to the modified device software, Sony’s repair network will likely have to replace key components before it can properly test, repair and verify your device using our repair tools and software. Consequently, if Sony performs a warranty repair, Sony will likely charge you a significant service fee for the additional costs caused by your modification of the software.&#34;And regarding camera:&#34;Certain pre-loaded content on your device may also be inaccessible due to the removal of DRM security keys. For devices running recent software versions, for instance Xperia Z3, the removal of DRM security keys may affect advanced camera functionality. For example, noise reduction algorithms might be removed, and performance when taking photos in low-light conditions might be affected. The secure user data partition may also become inaccessible, and you will not be able to get any more official software upgrades if you unlock the bootloader.&#34;I was very enthusiastic about Sony smartphones when I first read about them officially supporting AOSP, but after reading those terms I just bought cheap Android One Xiaomi instead, who supports unlocking bootloader with a single click, does not void your warranty or break your camera and you can easily re-flash original firmware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the surface this seems blatantly illegal: after the sale is made the no-longer-owner removes functionality.Can someone please explain how this is legally not some sort of theft, or bait-and-switch, or ... something?I read comments about firmware licensing, or Japan&#39;s camera noise thing.  Those sound like Samsung problems, while disabling a camera sounds like an actionable user problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like you could make a Stephen King esq horror movie from this. Got caught buying a stolen horse trailer, no record of drug abuse. Get sent to the gulag “rehab,” center. Hand pulled into the machinery. Block you from getting medical treatment. Force you to keep working. Steal your workers comp. Meanwhile the warden is walking up and down the halls singing hymns and menacingly dragging a chain.Sit through the whole 1h30min movie and it turns out it’s just a Tyson nuggets commercial."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They should change the name from &#34;Christian Alcoholics &amp; Addicts in Recovery&#34; to &#34;Biblical Alcoholics &amp; Addicts in Recovery&#34; because there is nothing Christian about what they are doing. Not an expert on Jesus but from what I&#39;ve read he was a pretty forgiving guy.  I did read the old testament and most of the stories are about cruelty, punishment and obedience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of other stuff in there, but the forced Christianity thing caught my eye.&#34;Weekly Bible study is mandatory. For the first four months, so is church.&#34;So you can be sentenced into being a practicing &#34;Christian&#34;."</p>
