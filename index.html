								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(my day job is developer on Proof-of-Stake Algorand block chain, I&#39;m a developer, this may not be polished official PR)
Article&#39;s theory about malicious old blocks doesn&#39;t hold up. Let&#39;s say I start a new node and verify history since the beginning. Somewhere along the line I&#39;m connected to a malicious node which hands me a fictionalized block. It would need to have been signed by not just one but about 30-45 accounts _which had stake at that time_. Proof-of-Stake attacks aren&#39;t about having 51% of the CPU that overwhelms a Proof-of-Work system, but about having 60-70% of the _value_ in the network. So, if Warren Buffet comes along and wants to spam our network, I guess he could, but that would destroy the network and destroy his value that he sunk into the network. _That_ is a guardrail for PoS systems as much as any crypto or consensus-protocol element (and the algorithms are right, original article misunderstands them)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PoW systems rely on the &#34;phone a friend method&#34; as well. When you download a Bitcoin client from a &#34;friend&#34;, you are trusting them to honestly introduce you to the network. If you fall asleep for a period of years, you have to trust your friends to honestly inform you of all of the PoW forks and policy changes that have occurred over that interval. The only difference is that PoS blockchain clients must be bundled with a modestly-recent block hash along with the thousands of lines of code that you have no practical way to audit.The problem eventually reduces to Ken Thompson&#39;s &#34;Trusting Trust&#34; [1] problem. There&#39;s no way to externally validate the honesty of any system (cryptocurrency, or otherwise).[1] https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rdriley/487/papers/Thompson_1984_Ref..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Proof of work has always had an economic flaw that you could theoretically temporarily rent enough mining power to perform double spends of more value than the cost of renting those devices.But this attack has never been performed because the reality of all these cryptocurrencies is that the security depends only relatively weakly on proof of work. Instead it relies on trust between the main stakeholders: miners, big nodes and developers. This is just like any other human organisation. That trust is only reinforced by proof of work, making it easier for new parties to become trusted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The one thing that I find is not helpful, is the “litmus test” approach.i.e. “You are a bad programmer/engineer/scientist/person, because you did not read this book, or know this technique.” Thing.I see this frequently. As a [mostly] self-taught software developer, I’ve been on the receiving end of a lot of this behavior.In my case, I have a real “Oh yeah? I’ll show you!” streak. I became expert at stuff, simply because some e-bully told me I was bad at it (because they were the only ones fit to judge others).Not everyone has that kind of stubbornness. I suspect that a hell of a lot of truly gifted folks never realized their passions, and that our industry has been robbed of significant talent, as a result.Maybe I’m looking at the past with rose-colored glasses, or I was fortunate to run into the people I did, but I don’t recall encountering a lot of this behavior, when I was getting started. I needed a lot of help and nurturing, when I was younger, until I reached the confidence level required to have an “Oh yeah?” response. I’m grateful that I got it.&#34;A new idea is delicate. It can be killed by a sneer or a yawn; it can be stabbed to death by a joke or worried to death by a frown on the right person&#39;s brow.&#34; 
-Charles Browder"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it just me or do other people struggle to read these kinds of very technical books?It&#39;s not that I don&#39;t comprehend, it&#39;s that my brain finds it boring and hard to focus. I think I have trained my brain so much on rapid skimming of websites for useful info, while throwing away most of the content, that I tend to do the same with books, which really doesn&#39;t work well.Has anyone found alternative ways to consume this information for brains that work like mine?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing that changed my career as a software engineer, in terms of seniority &amp; remuneration by time and effort, was by changing my efforts from learning arbitrary tech to learning the domain I worked in. Asking useful domain-related questions gets you noticed in stand ups and helps you write the right code. I work in fintech so the best bang for my buck I’ve had was reading an entry level cert in investment finance.I think the generic bit of this advice is to excel as an engineer is to focus on the business, not the tech."</p>

But it&#39;s a major in modern public discourse, and one for once that I&#39;m quite willing to lay heavily at the feet of the public education system. Easily one of the most valuable classes I took in my entire time K-12 was AP Probability &amp; Stats as a sophomore, but that was an entirely optional class with restricted openings anyway (a single teacher in a school of 1200+) which the vast majority never took even where it was offered. Yet interpreting the deluge of data in the modern world requires some level of being able to reason about things probabilisticly and have a sense of what actually goes into a measure of &#34;significance&#34;, null hypothesis and the danger of result-driven analysis finding links that don&#39;t exist and/or cannot possibly be causitive, how sampling a population works and what the error bars look like at different sizes, random vs biased distributions, the underlying distributions, confounding factors etc. I really wish in general kids got started on some light probability thinking as early as possible, in elementary school even, without any real math (let alone calc and such) yet, but just some initial stuff to start to illustrate the mindset. Lots of very fun games and hands-on exercises with dice and so on use or could be made to use important aspects of probability and its misuse.At any rate, I&#39;m certainly not an expert. But there seems to be some missing BS filter where people can recognize something as silly if the example is silly enough but not in the exact same logic fail for something that seems &#34;more reasonable somehow&#34;.----0: https://www.spaghettimonster.org/wp-content/uploads/2007/10/..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well I definitely prefer the new strict mode, I&#39;ll enable that right away. I&#39;ve long fantasized about a mode that would make SQLite behave like a normal SQL database, but this is not that. You still can&#39;t store a float in the database and get it back out unmodified. SQLite will expand it to a double, and it can&#39;t store NaNs. And probably more overhead to be able to support storing strings in my REAL column. Oh well.I tried out DuckDB which is more my style but the .NET libs are poor and I can&#39;t shave that yak right now."</p>

An alert lawyer will make that moment his own, possessing the treasure for a magic microsecond, taking a little of it, passing it on. If the man who is to receive the treasure is unused to wealth, has an inferiority complex and shapeless feelings of guilt, as most people do, the lawyer can often take as much as half the bundle, and still receive the recipient’s blubbering thanks.”- Kurt Vonnegut, God Bless You Mr. Rosewater"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My guess - DocuSign has a hard to penetrate moat: It&#39;s known and accepted in courts. Everything else doesn&#39;t really matter.Imagine you&#39;re a legal department. You have to choose between DocuSign, which you know the court will accept, or a competitor. DocuSign costs 10x as much as the competitor. But that&#39;s nothing compared to the cost of litigation, or worse, the cost of losing litigation. So you will likely choose DocuSign anyways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; legally binding way to put signatures and timestamps on a PDF.IANAL, but the idea that a signature is what makes a contract legally binding is not exactly true. It is a symbol of the acceptance of the contract, but legal acceptance can take many forms - so whether you use a service to signify acceptance, or just sign it using acrobat or Adobe&#39;s site, or even just a verbal agreement... those are all valid acceptance, legally speaking.DocuSign&#39;s use case is not the signing, but the management of those documents and signatures - tracking which documents are sent, which have been read (yes, the doc owner can get notified when you even look at a Docusign document), which have been signed, and being able to store copies of signed docs. It is mostly for the companies sending you contracts, not for you as the signer."</p>

I&#39;ve been working up the courage to quit a cushy but unfulfilling job to study CS full-time (also math and physics, but that&#39;s just for fun).I fell in love with programming after I started working, and have spent the last 7 years automating everything I can in my job. I&#39;m confident in my ability to solve problems, but I&#39;m missing a solid understanding of the fundamentals.I already have a BS in Materials Engineering, and I have mixed feelings about returning to university. Tuition has doubled since I graduated, and I&#39;m perfectly capable of teaching myself. The authors of teachyourselfcs.com have some strong opinions on CS masters degrees, though I would consider it if I found a topic that really called out to me AFTER I had built those fundamentals.I have plenty of savings, but I&#39;m worried that my effort will be wasted if it doesn&#39;t come with an exclusive piece of paper at the end. Will it be an obstacle, or am I worried over nothing?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Twitter thread from a vaccine developer: https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1464222680731820043.htmlA lot of speculation still, but it&#39;s not all bad so far."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In recent weeks, infections have increased steeply, coinciding with the detection of B.1.1.529 variant. The first known confirmed B.1.1.529 infection was from a specimen collected on 9 November 2021.This variant has a large number of mutations, some of which are concerning. Preliminary evidence suggests an increased risk of reinfection with this variant, as compared to other VOCs. The number of cases of this variant appears to be increasing in almost all provinces in South Africa&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My current take (not a virologist, doctor):At this point, if you are not immunocompromised and you have the first vaccination and a booster. You should be able to easily recover regardless of the mutation(s). The virus would need to completely diverge from SARS-CoV-2 in order to fully defeat the countermeasures of the current vaccinations."</p>
