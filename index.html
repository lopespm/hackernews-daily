								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The chart is interesting because it misses the important part - it covers time, but not adoption.For example, adoption of GIMP has not likely materially increased over time (as a relative percent of total addressable market)IMHO, what the author gets wrong what so many people who claim this (they are not the first, or the last) get wrong - open source as a whole sucks at building products, but is great at building infrastructure.
(and pretty good at infrastructure products).If you go look at areas where an open source thing is a de-facto market-leader, they are mostly infrastructure.  Not all, but the ones that aren&#39;t have clear product management of some sort.That is - the good open source products are often built/driven either by extremely product focused people (This is rare), or by companies driving them with PMs.Not that the engineering doesn&#39;t matter - of course it does, but if you want a good and successful product, engineering is just a part of what is needed.  Sometimes not even the main part!Open source focuses mainly on the engineering part, often creating technical meritocracies that focus on making &#34;The technically best software&#34;.This is totally cool, but also totally orthogonal to building &#34;a good product that people want to use&#34;.Secondarily, you have the issue of survival in marketplace (IE There are a rash of OSS companies achieving near 100% of total addressable market share, and still going bankrupt due to inability to monetize).  This, however, is not as big an issue as the first (as people can always still pick it all up when that happens)Open source could always get better at products, but its historical development models were geared towards exactly the above (IE it does what it says on the tin)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;All software will be open source, and no one will make money with software.I&#39;m really not convinced. The chart shows Photoshop having an alternative in with GIMP in 1998. And 24 years later, people are still paying lots of money for Photoshop. Pretty much all of these examples are similar. Yes open source has replaced some categories of paid software like VCS, but in a way it just opened up more paid software in the form of hosts and surrounding tooling like Github and paid git guis.If anything I think we have moved backwards. We are no longer looking at making copies of grep and dd. If you want to make an actual alternative to Photoshop you&#39;ll need thousands of workers spread over a lot of skill sets. You need cloud technology specialists, AI/ML experts, R&amp;D, design experts to do real studies and interviews with users, etc. You need teams of people working on out there new and untested ideas pushing the state of the art for image editing. While the alternatives are still trying to catch up to 2015 UI design patterns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; all software will be open sourceThere&#39;s a heck of a lot of &#34;boring business software&#34; out there, often quite niche, solving problems various businesses have. Anything that survives, just by virtue it has survived, has a positive ROI for everyone involved, including the customer.Where is the supposed alternative going to come from?Are people being paid to write that software suddenly going to stop and go build it for free? Are there random people that will suddenly develop an interest in figuring out how to automate filling out a bunch of Mississippi state government permit request forms, or how to convert an obsolete file format that&#39;s only used in the gas industry to another obsolete file format and FTP it somewhere, or how to convert customer orders to a cut lists used by a multi-million dollar industrial machine of which less than 100 exist in the world?Are the customers (businesses) going to suddenly decide to hire up an engineering team and build this themselves, at probably higher cost than they pay today and definitely at way higher risk? Maybe they&#39;ll get together with a bunch of businesses with similar needs -- aka their competitors -- and pool their resources to build something?I think none of this will happen -- or will happen in such exceedingly rare circumstances it&#39;s not worth considering.Which means I&#39;m pretty confident to say there will always be proprietary software."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something I learned not long ago on this site: low quality/too long HDMI cables can make some monitors go black when the user stands or sits on a certain kind of office chair. [1] [2]Apparently it&#39;s a known issue at Dell: [3]&gt;Surprisingly, we have also seen this issue connected to gas lift office chairs. When people stand or sit on gas lift chairs, they can generate an EMI spike which is picked up on the video cables, causing a loss of sync. If you have users complaining about displays randomly flickering it could actually be connected to people sitting on gas lift chairs. Again swapping video cables, especially for ones with magnetic ferrite ring on the cable, can eliminate this problem. There is even a white paper about this issue.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=voW5kEI7JKE[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D6pY4t0k1hk[3] https://support.displaylink.com/knowledgebase/articles/73861..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a lot of respect for this developer’s patience. Back when I was a solo developer, these types of issues were death by a thousand paper cuts. I didn’t have the skills to deal with the amount of support and debugging these kinds of problems entail. And it’s especially frustrating when the answer ends up being “It’s due to how the manufacturer of this monitor just didn’t properly implement the spec and there’s nothing I can do to fix it.” I can’t imagine writing software where this is the norm! So kudos to the developer!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Saw this really amazing video[0] the other day about American Chestnut Foundation&#39;s breeding program in Virginia to revive the American chestnutBasically they hybridized it with Chinese/Japanese chestnuts (which are blight resistant). Then they take the offspring, test for blight resistance and rebreed those back with purebred American chestnuts. Then they repeat the process. Take those offspring, select for blight resistance, rebreed with American species, etcAfter a few generations they created an American chestnut tree that looks almost exactly like the purebred versions but retains the blight resistance of the Japanese and Chinese speciesReally amazing work[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DbrY-J0bpto"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool to see this here and people talking about it. I volunteered with the American Chestnut Foundation during my summers in high school. Usually spent a few weeks on the Meadowview research farm collecting catkins off trees, “processing” the catkins to bottle the pollen, bagging trees to prevent uncontrolled cross pollination, and pollinating trees by hand.My uncle and I also usually took hikes in NC to try and find remaining trees with pollen in the wild. From what I understand, the pollen from these few remaining living trees is used to help re-introduce regional biodiversity into the backcrossed American/Chinese hybrids.Highly recommend going and helping out on the farm if you can spare a week or two, or joining your state chapter if you’ve got one - or sending your kids!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article misstates&gt; There used to be about 4 million American chestnut trees in eastern U.S. forests, until chestnut blight (Cryphonectria parasitica) arrived […]The number is closer to 4 billion with a B[1]Their range was across 
eastern North America and I’ve read estimates that they may have been a quarter to a third of the trees in those forests before the blight arrived.1 https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_chestnut"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The paradox is that you can&#39;t create a theory of music whose notes are both (a) evenly spaced and (b) contain the integer ratios.You want (a) because it you gives you nice algebraic properties (the music structure is invariant under frequency shifts). You want (b) because small-integer ratios are pleasant sounding -- partly culturally-acquired taste, partly because physics gives musical instruments acoustic spectra in integral multiples of a fundamental frequency: f, 2f, 3f ... nf. Small-integer ratios are naturally occurring and very recognizable.Modern tuning (C-f &#34;12-TET&#34; in the article) almost, approximately satisfies (a) and (b) simultaneously. &#34;12&#34; means there&#39;s twelve tones between f and 2f; the ratio between adjacent tones is defined to be 2^{1/12}. This tuning can&#39;t contain both f and 3f (so it fails (b)), but it *can* contain f and 2^{19/12}f ~ 2.9966f, which is actually close enough to 3f to be indistinguishable. (Almost works!) But as you build ratios out of larger integers, it audibly falls apart. The closest you can get to (5/3)f is 2^{9/12}f = ~1.6818f, which is already 10% of the way to the next note. And it rapidly gets worse.This is why two on-paper-identical notes can end up audibly different, depending on what key you&#39;re starting with (and hence how they are approached). There&#39;s tension internal to music theory itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My thought is, if you peel back the first layer of music theory, you discover a chaotic, lawless world. The main thing I&#39;ve noticed is that this is extremely unnerving to engineers, who want to learn it as a precise hierarchical structure. Regular people are more focused on the fact that somebody is somehow making it all sound good, and want to learn how to do that.On the other hand, most musicians are completely ambivalent to it, or even thrive in the chaos. Yet the &#34;rules&#34; are useful because they provide a common ground for forming ensembles, or connecting composer and performer. We&#39;ve watched musicians go down the rabbit hole of nonstandard scales, innovative notation systems, etc., only to discover that nobody can play their material.I&#39;m a double bassist. I&#39;m happy just to be able to coordinate my ears, brain, and hands, well enough to play the same note the same way twice if I want to. Claiming that I have conscious control over temperament would be laughable. I&#39;ve got too much other stuff to think about: The notes on the page, the non-notated passages (many jazz bass parts are expected to be improvised), tempo and rhythm, connecting with the rest of the band and the audience, who&#39;s coming in the front door, and so forth. This stuff is all happening in real time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The explanation of enharmonic equivalent (though the author didn&#39;t use this term) is right, but I do take problem with this sentence:&gt; but what musical difference does it make? In the present day, the answer is, none whatsoever.This is not quite right. On all fretless instruments, including most bowed strings and the human voice, enharmonic equivalent notes still have different pitches. The subtle differences in intonation is incredibly important and noticeable on the violin, for example."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the great fear of many come to pass - censorship by algorithm. Facebook didn&#39;t outright ban sharing of the Hunter Biden laptop stories like Twitter did, they instead tweaked their algorithm to prevent the story from spreading. We found out about it this time because Zuckerberg owned up to it, but what about next time? For all we know, Facebook, Google and Twitter are doing this right now on a range of other subjects.It&#39;s scary to think that just 2 to 3 corporations have the power to construct a false reality around us, in a way that&#39;s virtually impossible for us to detect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So let me get this straight.Facebook has absolute control to limit the spread of a story or news on their platform.Facebook has absolute control to outright block specific content based on an algorithm they control.Facebook can and will editorialize content posted on their platform.Facebook has absolute control over the content that users see.Can someone, anyone, please explain to me why Facebook is not a publisher? Why should Facebook continue to receive Section 230 protections? They are gatekeeper, publisher, and editor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found interesting how during the podcast, Zuckerberg compared the suppression of the story to due process in the justice system. A snippet from the podcast (with minor edits, starting from 7:25 of this video clip [1]):&gt; Joe Rogan: is there regret for not having it evenly distributed and for throttling the distribution of that story?&gt; [...]&gt; Zuckerberg: yeah yeah I mean it sucks because I mean it turned out after the fact...I mean the fact directors looked into it no one was able to say it was false right. So basically it had this period where it was getting less distribution&gt; it sucks though I think in the same way that probably having to go through like a criminal trial but being proven innocent in the end sucks. Like it still sucks that you had to go through a criminal trial but at the end you&#39;re free&gt; I don&#39;t know if the answer would have been don&#39;t do anything or don&#39;t have any process. I think the process was pretty reasonable you know. We still let people share it. But obviously you don&#39;t want situations like that[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN3PIGLDscQ"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Banning Delta altogether seems disproportionate. Banning all 767s would be silly. Telling Delta they can’t fly this one particular plane to Accra seems to me like a perfectly reasonable response to a run of incidents involving that plane within a short period of time.Honestly, the only thing that  surprises me about this is that other aviation authorities haven’t followed suit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Between 2010 and 2013, I used to fly to Ghana most summers. Delta would use old aircraft on this route. Inflight entertainment was the screen hanging in the middle of the aisle. Watching a movie on the flight was a challenge. You had to bring your own entertainment to pass the time.Eventually I stopped using that route and took KLM instead. KLM to Schiphol and to Accra. KLM was in a world of it&#39;s own. Similar planes irrespective of whether I was in the US or flying to Ghana. Personal inflight entertainment. The service was way better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I kind of agree with Ghana here. Gotta maintain your planes. It&#39;s sad that a foreign country has to be the one making Delta do routine pmc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not exactly connected but the same crowd interested in this topic may also be interested in this tool to store SSH private keys in the Secure Enclave, kind of like what can be done with a YubiKey:https://github.com/maxgoedjen/secretiveI&#39;ve been looking for something like this for 3-4 years but only found it six months ago (in an HN thread).  I use separate keys for every use case, and now know every time a key is used for any purpose, whether it&#39;s connecting to source control or my text editor is connecting to a remote VM.Only thing I haven&#39;t figured out is how to do git signatures with these sorts of keys, but I haven&#39;t debugged it at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know PAM gets criticized here and there, sometimes heavily, but it&#39;s actually a super flexible system.  The thing that really stands out is that no application actually needs to know about all the various authentication methods possible.  That file in /etc/pam.d/ just corresponds to the app&#39;s &#34;service name&#34;, and you (as the machine administrator) can put in it whatever you want.  The app just needs to go &#34;Hey PAM, I want to start authentication using service &#39;sudo&#39;&#34;, and then PAM will send instructions to the app, like &#34;Display the text &#39;Place your finger on the fingerprint scanner&#39;&#34;, or &#34;Display the text &#39;Password:&#39; and then prompt for masked input&#34;.It&#39;s really quite flexible, and despite its age, still works pretty well with current programming paradigms, whether your UI is text or graphical or whatever.  The one oddity is that when it asks you to prompt for some kind of user input, it will actually expect you to return the resulting input from the same callback function.  So if you&#39;re using a modern-ish GUI toolkit, you&#39;ll need to run the PAM stuff off on a different thread that&#39;s allowed to block while your UI thread is free to do what it needs to do.  But overall that&#39;s just... fine?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve also done this on my Framework laptop running Linux, it&#39;s really convenient. Have it set up for sudo, user login, etc. Just added this to various files in /etc/pam.d  auth sufficient pam_fprintd.so"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;We hope to publish guides about more complex use cases (lending, insurance, etc.) in the future.&#34;That would be appreciated.  It&#39;d be nice to see the minimal complexity needed for something like a local credit union that managed customer savings and checking accounts, as well as home and car loans.More ambitious would be a central banking app, in particular how does double-entry accounting work when a central bank (i.e. the Fed) is doing &#39;quantitative easing&#39; and using their helicopter money to buy up Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities in order to keep major banks and government solvent?  What&#39;s the private bank&#39;s balance sheet look like when they use the central bank money for stock buy-backs instead of for increasing commercial lending?For example, the Fed says it&#39;s unloading the mortgage-backed securities it bought up in 2008-2009.  That&#39;s got to be some convoluted accounting:https://www.marketplace.org/2022/06/02/why-the-federal-reser..."</p>
