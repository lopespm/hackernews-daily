								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My one and only Google interview went this way years ago.  Each round they&#39;d send me more books to study, which frankly I couldn&#39;t be bothered to read given the circumstances.My experience ended when an interviewer in round 3 or 4 asked me an obviously scripted question.  I answered sarcastically, he got peeved, and I never heard from them again.I&#39;m not claiming I&#39;m Google caliber, whatever that means.  Obviously I&#39;m not because I don&#39;t have the patience for their interview questions.To be clear, the entire question was:
What&#39;s not in a Linux inode?My answer was:
Lots of things...dinosaurs, the moon...The interviewer told me very matter of factly that it was in fact, the filename.I honestly lost all respect for the process, sorry Googlers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah Amazon... 14 interviews, an additional 5 hour technical test, spanning a total of 3+ months. Only to be informed at the end that I was too technical for the role they had in mind but they were offering me a Senior Principal SDE role instead.By the time we got to the end of the process I&#39;d already concluded that the hiring process was a reflection of their internal decision making and that this was not a company (or department) I wanted to work for.Then I was hired elsewhere and I saw something similar happen to a candidate and realised that this was truly an indication of the indecision. We had lots of roles, just none shaped in a way that fitted the person, and what we should&#39;ve done is reject the person but on that occasion we hired and it was a terrible decision. They were a good person and very capable, but not a fit for the role finally offered. I had the sense that if I had accepted the Amazon role that would&#39;ve been true for me too.An interview process of more than 3-4 defined steps that takes longer than a month to schedule, is a bad sign.Top tip for candidates: Ask what the process is, if they cannot conclusively tell you then double down on interviewing at a company that can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On my team, I inherited an interview process with 7 steps. It&#39;s a long one for sure, and it&#39;s not a process I can change. But as a hiring manager I mitigate issues brought up in this article by doing a few really easy things:1. On my first chat with a candidate, I layout the entire interview process. I acknowledge that it is long and I preemptively thank them for going through the process and say that we value their time. I make sure our recruiters can reiterate the process as clearly as I can.2. I let the candidate know that at any time if they want to pull out, that is a-ok, and that they are welcome to apply again in the future in good standing. I also tell them that during our coding assignment, we really mean it when we say it&#39;s ok to ask for more time, and that we don&#39;t judge them negatively.3. I tell the candidate that if at any point we decide to decline, that I will send them a written letter of feedback so as to make the process worth their time. This isn&#39;t always easy, but it&#39;s always been appreciated. Sometimes it is hard to write these letters, how do you tell someone multiple interviewers didn&#39;t like them? I do it by pressing our interviewers to state clearly what didn&#39;t come across well, and then I relay those things to the candidate. Sometimes even still the letters probably aren&#39;t super satisfying to the declined candidates, but I do my best and hope everyone realizes that job hunting in general is rarely satisfying.Basically, transparency, honesty and specifically thanking them have gone a long way for me. I fully understand that an underfunded/understaffed startup might balk at the feedback part, especially when lawyers can get involved. But offering up items #1 and #2 to candidates should just be table stakes of your hiring process."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For reference, I&#39;ve never seen the built-in Windows VPN protocols exceed ~70 Mbps in any scenario. Maybe it&#39;s possible with a crossover cable between two Mellanox 100 Gbps NICs, using water-cooled and overclocked CPUs, but not over ordinary networks with ordinary servers.I have gigabit wired Internet to a site with gigabit Internet. Typical performance of SSTP or IKEv2 is 15-30 Mbps. That&#39;s 1.5% to 3% max utilisation of the available bandwidth, which is just... sad.It&#39;s not the specific site either, other vendor VPNs can easily achieve &gt; 300 Mbps over the same path.It&#39;s a year and a half into the pandemic, there are record numbers of people working from home, and Microsoft is the world&#39;s second biggest company right now.Meanwhile, volunteers put together a protocol in their spare time that is not only more secure but can also easily do 7.5 Gbps!That needs to be repeated: At least ONE HUNDRED TIMES faster than the &#34;best&#34; Microsoft can offer to their hundreds of millions of enterprise customers that are working from home.Someone from Microsoft&#39;s networking team needs to read this, and then watch Casey Muratori&#39;s rant about Microsoft&#39;s poor track record with performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99dKzubvpKE"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very impressive performance:&gt; While performance is quite good right now (~7.5Gbps TX on my small test box),
not a lot of effort has yet been spent on optimizing it&gt; Jonathan Tooker reported to me that, on his system with an Intel AC9560 WiFi card, he gets
~600Mbps without WireGuard, ~600Mbps with wireguard-go/Wintun over Ethernet,
~95Mbps with wireguard-go/Wintun over WiFi, and ~600Mbps with WireGuardNT over
WiFi.Congratulations to Simon and Jason!  Very happy WireGuard user here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Wireguard team are simply brilliant. It&#39;s incredible how they have developed low-level, cross-platform solutions across Linux, OpenBSD, FreeBSD and now Windows.I think they are truly exceptional programmers. It&#39;s hard to think of people who have come anywhere close to such an achievement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Now I feel old. I remember vividly running around with my first camera, looking for objects worthy of being photographed. The film cost money, so did developing it into pictures. I really had to weigh the pros and cons of taking a particular picture. And in a class of ~25 kids, I was one of three who owned a camera. Not that it was such a luxury item, but most people weren&#39;t into that.These days, (nearly) everyone carries a camera around all the time, and one that is quite probably much better than the one I had in 1992. They can take dozens, even hundreds of pictures without breaking a sweat, and it does not cost anything.Nostalgia is a very warped mirror. Back then, I did not miss the ability to take dozens of pictures at no cost, because the option did not exist. Was it better? Worse? Neither, I think. But this is the first time I feel old and appreciate it for the history I have lived through. Getting old is weird, but it sure is interesting. (For reference, I&#39;m 40. &#34;That&#39;s not old&#34;, I hear someone say, but I have never been this old before, so for me it&#39;s all new.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I miss more than anything else is having an attention span. Years of abusing social media has left my brain pinballing all over the place. I am a collection of unfinished thoughts. Even as I write this, I can feel my mind needing to latch onto something new."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My teenager doesn’t have use of his phone right now. He was complaining that he had no way to contact his friends. I pointed to the landline and he said that wouldn’t work since all their numbers were on his phone. Plus they would never actually answer a phone call - who answers phone calls? I suggested email. None of them check email. I suggested riding his bike to their house and talking to them in person. He was aghast at the thought. If smartphones went away, I think there is an entire generation or two that really wouldn’t know how to go on living."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you look at the history of the Public Broadcasting Act [1] that established the CPB and eventually PBS, it seems clear that it was passed in response to poorly-funded educational programming not being able to compete with high-budget commercial network TV. Its authors wanted to make it easier for smaller, non-commercial entities to produce and distribute high-quality educational content.In that regard, the Internet (aided by inexpensive video gear and editing software) has succeeded far beyond their wildest dreams. The breadth and depth of educational content available just on YouTube is incredible.The same forces that make it easy to produce and distribute educational content also make it easy to produce and distribute misinformation. This is a problem, but&#39;s unclear how a &#34;PBS for the internet&#34; would solve it.For example, if you look at the one concrete piece of legislation mentioned in the article:&gt; The Local Journalism Sustainability Act takes a different approach to the government grant model. The bill would, for example, give a tax credit to people who donate to nonprofit newsrooms, or to small businesses who buy advertising at a nonprofit outlet.It&#39;s not clear to me why people wouldn&#39;t just choose to donate to or buy advertising in outlets that promote whatever form of misinformation or partisan information that suits their tastes.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Act_of_196..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well there is:https://www.pbs.org/video/Also PBS has a great kids games app(s) that are free with games that are fun / no ads.And PBS kids video app is again free, great content, no ads.If you&#39;re in the US and care about that content, I suggest contributing to your local station.  The quality of the content from kids to adult is outstanding.   It&#39;s not usual for me to browse a few streaming services and just end up watching PBS&#39;s content in the end.Maybe when it comes to the article they mean more accessible?  But I&#39;m not sure as they seem to ignore the PBS content available."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would like to note that PBS does actually publish Youtube videos via PBS Digital Studios[0][1]. They have great creators making PBS quality content but in &#34;Youtube&#34; style formats with a wide range of topics (science, popular culture, art, food, news, and music).[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS_Digital_Studios

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m not surprised that all statements from the Israeli government are filled with nothing. “We need to understand what happened” means “sorry not sorry”.This spyware is invaluable for the Israeli government because they have something that repressive Arab regimes want. These regimes can’t be bought with money, because some of them like Saudi Arabia and UAE have plenty of money. Israel needs friends and this is a great way to start and maintain friendships - provide a way for these tinpot dictators to cement their power. Sure, some people might be annoyed they were spied on but the news cycle will move on soon, while Saudi and UAE will remain staunch allies. MBS still loves them because Khashoggi remains dead.Israel would have gotten away with it too, if it hadn’t been for the meddling kids at Amnesty International."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A headline in Linux gaming circles that hasn&#39;t hit the wider circuit yet (probably because it hasn&#39;t actually been delivered yet) is that Valve are working with Battleye and EAC to get anti-cheat working on Proton for the release of the steam deck.If this happens it will be, without exaggeration, the greatest thing to ever happen to Linux gaming.I&#39;m not expecting a massive increase overnight, but it should mean that the marketshare will increase more likely than it will decrease."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"i’ve been using linux as my daily driver for just over a year. steam on linux has been great, and proton (wine) has been indispensable. big title games i’ve played with _no_ issues at all:* Cyberpunk 2077 (ok that has issues, but it has the same issues for windows users..)* Dying Light* Titanfall* The Divisionalong with _many_ other indie/small games.honestly the only thing left is titles that include invasive anti-cheat. when that day comes, i don’t know if most of my friends will have any reason to remain on windows.and who could blame them? finally, they won’t need to deal with a company that collects data from them without their knowledge, runs ads in their taskbar, demands they have a useless microsoft account, restarts their machine on a whim for updates, etc.i hate that i’m going to say this out loud, but could 2022 really be the year of linux on the des- why does it feel so wrong to say that? :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just to be fair and balanced I&#39;m a hardcore linux user and gamer and I&#39;ve tried gaming on linux and I&#39;ve hit many issues. 365 games on steam and while some windows games work I&#39;ve hit probably just about every possible issue you can hit with other games. Graphical artifacts, freezing, stuttering, and even full OS reboots.Sometimes I read this thread and scratch my head. I get enthusiasm for FOSS, but enthusiasm to the point of delusion? Honestly, Linux is not up to par with windows in terms of running games that are basically designed for windows. Thus the experience compared to windows for these things is definitively inferior."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Concrete is responsible for 8% of global CO2 emissions. Cement is usually made from mined limestone. [Snip] We make synthetic limestone using atmospheric CO2, [snip] when [snip] used to make cement, [snip] (it) is carbon neutral.You should put that (slightly edited) paragraph on your home page. I looked at your home page first and didn&#39;t understand what you did until I came back here.Best of luck!(Btw: Try to avoid using the passive voice.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From my limited understanding this seems really impressive!I immediately associated this to possible disruption in the cement supply chain that&#39;s about to hit Sweden. Cementa, which produces about 75% of Sweden&#39;s cement, will no longer be allow to mine limestone on Gotland. Their permit was due to be renewed but due to the low quality of their environmental impact study the court was unable to determine if the mining might impact the local residents groundwater. So just a week or so ago a Swedish court decided Cementa muts cease mining operations some time in October. And as I said this mine/factory produces 75% of Sweden&#39;s cement. So there are more problems with the current way of producing cement than just CO2.Most probably there will be a limestone/cement void in Sweden that needs to be filled, and I&#39;d rather have you doing it than some new limestone mine. Best of luck to you!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I noticed all the recent printers from HP required a setup which...- Required me to install an app- Required me to enable gps on my device (and allow app to access)- Printer phoned home after / during setup (as did the app)They really don’t need the dots any more when they know the gps coordinates and have the ability to send anything they want to and from the device.I personally spoofed the gps, ran a vpn and blocked the device from phoning home (after setup). Had me saying “what the f**!?” a couple of times."</p>
