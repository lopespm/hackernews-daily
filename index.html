								<p class="story__comment_others">"We did a similar kind of experiment some time back and found both FB ads and Google ads were doing jack shit for us. Google was better. FB ads were absolutely useless. So we stopped our ad spend. We observed no change in our customer acquisition.Another way these ad engines extract money out of you is by allowing competitors to bid for your brand name keyword. Try searching for Ozonetel on Google. There will be six competitor ads and then our website will show up :)In our early days we used to be scared and bid for it.Lost a lot of money doing that. Then we talked about it and stopped. Again, no change in customer acquisition. Turns out, customers scroll down the ads and still click on our website.Are our competitors getting some of our traffic?Of course.But my business is not built on the assumption that people will not find my competitors. Its built on the fact that people will explore options and try to find the best fit for them. So its ok."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I still remember Craig Silverstein being asked what his biggest mistake at Google was and him answering &#34;Not pushing for ECC memory.&#34;Google&#39;s initial strategy (c. 2000) around this was to save a few bucks on hardware, get non-ECC memory, and then compensate for it in software.  It turns out this is a terrible idea, because if you can&#39;t count on memory being robust against cosmic rays, you also can&#39;t count on the software being stored in that memory being robust against cosmic rays.  And when you have thousands of machines with petabytes of RAM, those bitflips do happen.  Google wasted many man-years tracking down corrupted GFS files and index shards before they finally bit the bullet and just paid for ECC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I beg this, every time this conversation comes up it’s the same answer “I don’t see a problem”.It’s so easy to chalk these kind of errors to other issues, a little corruption here, a running program goes bezerk there- could be a buggy program or a little accidental memory overwrite. Reboot will fix it.But I ran many thousands of physical machines, petabytes of RAM, I tracked memory flip errors and they were _common_; common even in: less dense memory, in thick metal enclosures surrounded by mesh. Where density and shielding impacts bitflips a lot.My own experience tracking bitflips across my fleet led me to buy a Xeon laptop with ECC memory (precision 5520) and it has (anecdotally) been significantly more reliable than my desktop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has had to read thousands of random game crash reports from all over the interwebs (you know when Windows says you might want to send that crash log?  like that), I totally agree.Of all the things to be worried about, like OS bugs, bad hardware configuration, etc. bad memory is one of those really troubling things.  You look at the code and say &#34;it&#39;s can&#39;t make it here, because this was set&#34; but when you can&#39;t trust your memory you can&#39;t trust anything.And as the timeline goes to infinity, you may also get one of these reports and be asked to fix it... good luck."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apart from those benchmark games a lot of real world C is a lot less performant than people think it might be. I spent a fair amount of time reviewing C code in the last 5 years - and things that pop up in nearly every review are costly string operations. Linear counts due to the use of null terminated strings and extra allocations for substrings to attach null terminators, or just deep copies because ownership can’t be determined are far more common than exceptional. This happens because null terminated strings feel like idiomatic C to most people.Rust avoids those from the start by making slices idiomatic.Another thing I commonly see is the usage of suboptimal containers (like arrays with linear search) - just because it’s there’s no better alternative at hand (standard library doesn’t offer ones and dependency management is messy). Which also makes it less surprising that code in higher level languages might perform better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Once LLVM fixes some bugs with `noalias`, at which point Rust will begin using it again in more circumstances [1], I&#39;d expect to see Rust get even faster in these benchmarks, given that the Rust compiler knows much more about which pointers do/do-not alias than most other programming languages [2] and the myriad optimizations this knowledge allows.[1] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54878#issuecomment-...[2] https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/aliasing.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looking at the reverse-complement code, it appears that the Rust and C implementations are using different algorithms:https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/...https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/...On a quick inspection:- The Rust code is about twice as long.- The Rust code has CPU feature detection and SSE intrinsics, while the C code is more idiomatic.- The lookup table is larger in the Rust code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have many fond memories of my first real job as sysadmin/render wrangler for a small animation company about fifteen years ago.Cores and memory were indeed what mattered, and as long as frames could be fitted into memory then the machine was left to render the frame and then save it back out to shared disk. There was no virtualization, just raw compute hardware running at full capacity 24/7. The scene was already split into different layers and rendered as sequences of frames that were then composited into final products.First job, first mini-datacenter in a new building, and there I am asking contractors to knock a hole in the building to fit air handlers due to the heat we were expecting to generate. Was great fun.It taught me a lot about automated systems management."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man, I wanted this to contain much more details :(Whats the hardware? How much electric energy goes into rendering a frame or a whole movie? How do they provision it (as they keep #cores fixed)? They only talk about cores, do they even use GPUs? What&#39;s running on the machines? What did they optimize lately?So many questions! Maybe someone from Pixar&#39;s systems department is reading this :)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am one of the few people that inspects the source-code of extensions. It&#39;s easy to do, for Firefox for example, just right-click and save-as in the extensions site, then rename your extension to a .zip file and extract e.g:    addon.xpi --&gt; addon.zip

Then manually sift through the code looking for obvious malicious intent (or not so obvious malicious intent if the author is doing obfuscation). Note: obfuscation is a red flag! A simple scan for `https://` / &#39;http://&#39;  would usually yield interesting URLs where data is sent. I have actually spotted malicious addons in the wild this way and reported them to Mozilla. They were thankfully removed.Note: Obfuscation is NOT the same as minification, and I don&#39;t mean minification when using the word obfuscation!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been telling everyone who will listen[1][2][3] that as an extension developer, I&#39;d love to be able to guarantee through the Chrome App Store that an extension matches a git commit (or auditable build pipeline artifact) exactly.It wouldn&#39;t fix everything (for example, you could still put a payload in an innocent-looking dependency), but it would at least fix the blatant problem that a maintainer can add code when uploading an extension even if the extension itself is open source and therefore (appears to be) auditable.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23265699

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We need to talk about how difficult it is to monetize browser extensions. Most of these problems occur when a reputable extension gets sold to a less reputable owner, frequently for a relatively small amount of money (4-5 figures). Even very popular extensions have a hard time monetizing. Unfortunately, Chrome has recently made the situation worse by deprecating Chrome Web Store payments, and Firefox eliminated their paid extension store several years ago.If the only way to monetize an extension is to exploit its users for data, this kind of thing is going to keep happening. It&#39;s perfectly understandable how someone who is doing a lot of work for no pay will eventually get tired of it or have other priorities in life, which is what happened in this case. Perhaps we all need to stop taking it for granted that browser extensions ought to be free? Or maybe the browser vendors themselves can find ways of financially supporting extension authors. I feel that money is essential to both the problem and the solution.Of course, paid upfront software gets sold to new owners too. But if the software is paid upfront, the expectation is that the new owner will perhaps do a better job of maintaining and marketing the software, and that&#39;s why the new owner buys it. When the software is paid, the new owner has an opportunity to make money legitimately, without secretly exploiting the existing user base."</p>

I have used Petri nets to build my own workflow engine previously.  Building a workflow engine is one of those things... nearly every enterprise app has one, and normally you shouldn’t need to build one if you can source one... but it is an exercise that makes you a stronger engineer/developer too, deepening understanding of the patterns that lie beneath most systems.Back when I was building, openly available workflow engines, BPML, BPEL etc. were not really a thing yet, so it made a little more sense to be building one.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net"</p>

I program professionally since about 6 years ago but have only recently appreciated generators and coroutines.I’m working through learn.unity.com for fun and because, in my estimation, there is an upcoming boom in real time interfaces for real work. All the people playing video games have mastered skills that aren’t being taken full advantage of. Anyways, coroutines in Unity can be used to do interesting things over time while attached to the game loop.My point, despite my digression, is just how there are still basic/intermediate topics I have only been able to appreciate recently.

If these are not helpful, the participant will be invited to sit up, take off the eyeshades and make visual contact with the therapists and the room.  The therapists may offer reassurance that such states are to be expected and are likely to be short lived.&gt; Responding to marked agitation&gt; If the subject displays significant or marked agitation and previously mentioned interventions fail, the therapist will consult with the physician regarding the possible administration of benzodiazepine or antipsychotic medication.

We do not set any cookies on redirects but do use cookies for authentication for users.T.LY: https://t.ly/Link Unshortener: https://linkunshorten.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow! https://preview.tinyurl.com/examplezoom really shows https://zoom.us/j/123456789 link whereas Chrome network inspector confirms the viglink.com redirect. uBlock origin blocks the latter via Dan Pollock’s hosts file and Peter Lowe’s Ad and tracking server list."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I currently host https://femto.pw/ - A URL shortener I&#39;ve kept up for ~4 years and intend to indefinitely.  It doesn&#39;t do anything with regards to tracking cookies or other dark patterns.  It just redirects you using a 302 redirect."</p>
