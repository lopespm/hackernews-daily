								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This project is terrific.  People are critical of what it doesn&#39;t do, I&#39;m in awe of what it does do.You&#39;re going to have little two man shops in Africa and Asia cranking these out and changing agriculture in their part of the world.This demonstrates the power of open source.  These engineers are to be commended."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man I remember reading about this in 2011 or so. I&#39;m glad they&#39;re still doing well. It&#39;s an interesting project at the intersection of philanthropic eco-hippies and mechanical engineers which doesn&#39;t seem very common to me.Of course, being older and wiser now I&#39;m less excited about the fantasy of using my brains and grit to rebuild society after the coming apocalypse. And if you are a villager of some description trying to use machinery to improve your prospects you&#39;re probably better off buying something old and used, or cheap and Chinese. Over the last 10 years the number of (mostly Chinese) companies making okay-quality cheap industrial equipment of all types has grown massively, and I&#39;ve seen this equipment being used more and more in the developing world. Cheap is relative, of course, and many places do not make it easy to buy anything due to payment infrastructure, shipping, and customs costs.So on the one hand it&#39;s a bit silly for some guy in Missouri to even consider designing his own bakery oven when you can get them on Alibaba for $500. On the other, it&#39;s very cool and interesting, there&#39;s a lot to learn from the attempt, and there&#39;s a lot of actually useful designs already for certain situations. I wonder how much success they&#39;ve had getting this information out to people who it could actually help?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"i work on heavy equipment such as tractors, diesel trucks and excavators in the USA.  this is an excellent start, but its a long way from a tractor.some of the pitfalls that need to be addressed:&#34;Modular Power Unit&#34; is undefined.  can i run it on white gas? diesel? kerosene? what is the engine displacement? air cooled or liquid? If we mean to say this tractor is all-electric, keep in mind most small farms arent equipped to charge anything more advanced than a cordless drill or flashlight.Cab frame has no safety glass or panels, so the operator enjoys every rock and every tree branch :(.  a shade canopy is a nice add as well.no lights.  this is a nonstarter for every farmer that wakes up at 4 am.quick hoses are nice, but I cant find a PTO knuckle so its restricted to things like lifting and towing (and maybe ripping).  this is okay, but for an un-weatherized vehicle ill need to use barn real-estate to store, its certainly lacking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The sheer simplicity of this idea - a 1-bit grid, which you can interact with in real-time - echoes that of Pico-8 [1], a fantasy console with strict limits such that you&#39;re not overwhelmed with ideas, but instead given bounds to play with. Its limits keep it realistic: you can do immensely wondrous things with the console, but its graphic and music style are limited, and as such it provides much more of an incentive to make a game - it&#39;s far less overwhelming, and you can concentrate on fun. But also, it offers a challenge! As you begin to hit the limits, you come up with clever tricks to save space, and because the computer isn&#39;t blisteringly fast, you&#39;re pushing yourself as much as you are the computer.[1]: https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.phpBut this checkbox playground would be, in my eyes, an even better virtual console - reduced to the bare minimum of what you could make into a game that can be enjoyed. Provide a nice interface such that the user only has to write the game code, provide events to hook into - start(), frame() and click(x, y) - and this would be an immensely satisfying console to immediately get to work on, as rather than worry about graphics and audio, you&#39;re free to get right into making it fun....also, it&#39;d be an excellent framework for teaching kids how to code! :D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a bit tangential, but I&#39;ve been completely impressed by a ton of the Bad Apple &#34;ports&#34; to various platforms (particularly the Sega Genesis and the Atari 2600).  It&#39;s amazing how the simple choice of making a mostly-binary music video has made a song popular in hacker culture."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, on reading this I imagine that this is purely for &#34;mature&#34; process nodes, and not definitely for cutting-edge nodes, plus the fact that some of the semiconductor infrastructure is already there, so 7 billion US dollars might be in the correct ballpark.Well, at least Japanese manufacturers (probably more of automobile suppliers like Denso rather than Sony&#39;s mobile division) will have a domestic source."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me know when they actually break ground and start building one :-).I fully support TSMC&#39;s efforts to diversify the jurisdictions that have semi-conductor fabs though. That is a huge win for them and makes the Chinese mainland threat to assimilate Taiwan less? More fab capacity is a win."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recognise his name as something that flitted by on copyright pages, for tools that made my life easier, better, and for free.And sad though his passing is, it marks something else for me - that a person committed to &#34;improving the world a little&#34; is recognised without having made billions in an IPO or become a media celebrity.  Maybe we can all aim a little lower (or higher depending on how you see it) now.Thank you Jorg.Our condolences to your loved ones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First of all, compassion and condolences for Schilling’s family.Second of all, I had a very recent positive interaction with him.  I recently was in contact with Mr. Schilling to report a bug in CDR tools.  Even though he was (looking back) dying, he was very prompt in replying to me and discussing the bug with me over email.  However, even though I gave him a fix, he was unable to apply it, probably because of his poor health.Thirdly, there is a really serious bug in CDR tools: It will start creating bad timestamps in 2028.  That’s not a typo: 2028 (not 2038).  Because of how ISO 9660 filesystems store timestamps (8-bit number, 0 is 1900), on 2038 (1900 + 128), unless the 8-bit number is explicitly made an unsigned number (assumed with other ISO 9660 implementations), there will be issues with timestamps. [1]A full bug report, complete with a bugfix is here: https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=990468A fork of cdrtools with this bug fixed is on GitHub: https://github.com/samboy/iso9660Again, prayers for Schilling’s family, and he was very professional in his interactions with me, even in his final days.[1] The issue is with how Schilling’s CDR tools calculates timezones; the time zone becomes an invalid number starting in 2028."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"RIP Jörg, many probably don&#39;t know him, however his work was at the basis of k3b, Brasero and many other software programs that allowed burning CDs in early 2000s. At least that&#39;s what I know him for.Linux expanded and thrived thanks to CD copies and the support of CD recorders was often poor. His work surely affected many and he did his part in bringing Linux to where it is today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I quit Amazon 3 weeks ago after nearly a decade. Work from home was one of the biggest reasons.In my view, the personality traits that are conducive to promotion up the Amazon leadership ladder are strongly aligned with loving work-from-office. Most people L10 and higher not only don&#39;t understand the desire for permanent work from home, I think maybe they cannot understand it. It&#39;s just too foreign to many of them.The first announcement was &#34;We can&#39;t wait to be back in the office, and we know you can&#39;t either&#34;. Senior engineers started quitting. Then it was &#34;Okay, okay, you can work from home 2-3 days per week, but only with your L10&#39;s approval&#34;. The exodus continued.Now it&#39;s &#34;Fine, you can work from home with your L8&#39;s approval, but you better be ready to show up on 24 hour notice if we say so!&#34;. The biggest benefit of work from home is not needing to commute, and lower cost of living by leaving the HCOL cities.They don&#39;t get it. Other companies do. And anyone who has spent 5 or more years working for Amazon is well-trained enough to get a better paying job with a company that understands the cultural shift that just happened to the developer world.Edit: I know not all developers are anti-office. But for those of us who are, working for people who don&#39;t understand us, who make policies based on what works best for them, is a problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in Seattle and thus a notable percentage of my social circle works at Amazon.The folks I know who work there were almost entirely all prepared to quit if the company forced their initial &#34;everyone back in the office&#34; requirement, especially in this current job market.It feels rare to see Amazon ever make a change to such a publicly stated policy like this, I can only imagine that the groundswell of feedback from employees was quite startling in how much of a problem their retention would be with such a hard rule."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone on the inside: the title is mostly BS.They are pushing the decision from the L10+ level to the L7/L8 level. But we all know behind the scenes, L7/L8 will be pushed to behave a certain way. If it was truly their choice, those with a strict policy would bleed engineers to the directors with more lax policies, Amazon would not accidentally create a free market within their own company.This is a deflection of blame, and nothing else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Comment from the Southwest Pilots Union...&gt;SWA has claimed that the immediate causes of this weekend’s meltdown were staffing at Jacksonville Center and weather in the southeast U.S., but what was a minor temporary event for other carriers devastated Southwest Airlines because our operation has become brittle and subject to massive failures under the slightest pressure. Our operation and our frontline employees have endured continuous and unending disruptions since the first time our airline made headlines in early June due to widespread IT failures. Our Pilots are tired and frustrated because our operation is running on empty due to a lack of support from the Company.https://www.swapa.org/news/2021/swa-in-the-news/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is currently a major outage at a major part of the infrastructure of our nation, and nobody believes anybody about why.The airline is saying it&#39;s something to do with weather, but somehow they&#39;re the only airline effected.Everybody online seems to the think it&#39;s some sort of labor strike, but the union denies this and nobody can find anywhere where people are planning this.And yet thousands of people are stuck in airports all over the country right now.It just seems like something is going on, and that everybody is lying about it.  Can&#39;t say I&#39;ve ever really seen anything like this, and it genuinely freaks me out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seeing stories like this makes me wonder if we&#39;ll ever see a company actually go bust based purely on the instability of its decades-old, duct-taped architecture.I have a relative who works for a large credit card processor running on mainframe systems and I hear over and over again that they&#39;re all retiring and unable to fill the newly opened roles. This problem is compounded by the fact that their offshore contracting firms are cutting back on providing COBOL resources because there&#39;s a lot more money in supplying java/.net/etc. devs. The work culture there sounds so unsustainable and yet they&#39;re one of the largest payment processors in the country. If they were have widespread stability issues like this, things could get interesting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Each time I teach neural nets to an engineer, there&#39;s only a 50% chance they can write down the chain rule. Colah&#39;s blog on backprop used to be my favorite resource to leave them with (https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Backprop).The explanation of the calculus in this tool is equally fantastic. And the art is very cute.There are many ways to skin a cat, of course, but this is as good a tutorial as I&#39;ve seen for getting you through backprop as fast as possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think it is a good idea to describe neural networks as a large graph of neurons interacting with each other. It is not really helpful to understand what is going on inside.It is more useful to understand them as a series of transforms that bend and fold the input space, in order to place pairs of similar items close to each other. I would like to see people trying to illustrate that instead.It also has the benefit of making the connection with linear algebra much easier to understand."</p>

It&#39;s written with fairly decent though not always portable Common Lisp, just like most Common Lisp books of the era.It can be read here, in mobi or zipped HTML format: https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp/releases/tag/1.1Or here, in PDF: https://github.com/norvig/paip-lisp/releases/tag/v1.0For a native web copy, abuse Safari Online&#39;s free trial. It&#39;s what I assume everyone else does when they want to read a niche technical book that O&#39;Reilly put out but doesn&#39;t print another run of.Depending on the day, the book ranges anywhere from $2 to $60 on Amazon, used, if you want a hard copy.(Edited to fix the very butchered title that I wrote in error initially.)"</p>
