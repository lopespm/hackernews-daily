								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Been extremely happy with mine the past couple months. The little modular port attachments seemed like a novelty at first, but now it feels absurd that you&#39;d buy a laptop with a bunch of &#34;hardcoded&#34; ports that you can&#39;t ever change.The only real Linux related quirk I&#39;ve run into so far is that you have to disable panel self refresh (it&#39;s on by default and causes stuttering). Other than that tiny thing I pretty much just installed my stuff and started using it.One little anecdote: I got a card in the mail from Framework saying that there was a problem with the cable for the touchpad, and it had instructions on how to fix it. Contrast that to my experience with Apple where they would delete forum threads for laptop problems and spend years denying issues until legal action forced them to acknowledge it.Anyway, I&#39;m a fan. I&#39;m really looking forward to when the marketplace opens up with some new parts. I really want my blank keyboard. I&#39;m hoping 2021 will be the year I can own a laptop without a god damn windows logo emblazoned on the keys."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The baseline, preassembled model starts at $1000. Windows 10 Home, quad-core i5, 8 GB RAM, 256 GB storage, a nice 2256x1504 display, thin and light (1.3kg, 11.7&#34; x 9&#34; x 0.6&#34;). Compare that to your other thin and light options at this pricepoint.XPS 13, $1020* i5* 8 GB RAM* 256 GB storage* 1920 x 1200 display* 1.2 kg, 11.6&#34; x 7.8&#34; x 0.6&#34;MacBook Pro: $1300* M1* 8 GB RAM* 256 GB storage* 2560 x 1600 display* 1.4kg, 12&#34; x 8.7&#34; x 0.6&#34;It&#39;s almost a no-brainer, even without considering the repairability, unless you like macOS. Unfortunately, not many people see repairability as a feature yet due to the toxic status quo, but this could change. I think that after brand recognition is established, this laptop could legitimately be competitive in the laptop market, and not just appeal to hardcore techies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just got one of these last weekend(I ordered it in early August) and so far it’s really great. The modular I/O and general mission of the company was what initially sold me on it, but now actually being hands on with it, I definitely feel secure in my decision to get one. I can’t overstate how good these modular ports are.I also really like that you can bring your own hardware in a lot of cases. For example I had an extra M.2 SSD laying around, so I ordered mine without one and installed it. You can also do this with the RAM, and even the wifi card.The only thing I’ve disliked about it so far is the arrow keys on the keyboard. Having full size keys for left and right but split keys for up and down feels weird, I would have preferred all full size arrow keys and a small right shift(because let’s be honest, when was the last time you used the right shift key?).For anyone curious about Linux on it, I’m running Arch and had basically 0 problems specific to the device. It’s my understanding there were some incompatibilities with certain kernel versions before so maybe some of these problems exist in distros like Debian with an older kernel, but I have had no issues.All in all, it’s just an exciting project and nice to see innovation in the space that isn’t just rounded corners or a sleeker edge or something where they take modularity or performance away for the sake of aesthetics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My impression is that every SaaS that is successful on ProductHunt (PH) or HN gets copied dozens of times within a few months. That&#39;s especially true for technically simple products. A good example is maybe privacy-friendly web analytics: I think products like Fathom and Simple Analytics were the first to really go after this angle (undoubedtly there were others before them though), and in less than 6 months dozens (hundreds?) of copycats turned up with exactly the same USP and the exact same look &amp; feel. And interestingly it isn&#39;t the first mover who seems to win that market but rather the company with the most agressive (and sometimes outright misleading) marketing. So being the first doesn&#39;t guarantee your success anymore, at least if you don&#39;t have enough time to grow undisturbed.Personally I&#39;d avoid posting products on PH or HN for that reason and instead focus on growing organically in a niche market where you&#39;re not immediately discoverable by copycat founders. In general PH feels more and more phony to me and I think there&#39;s a lot of astroturfing going on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ironically, the increase of SaaS businesses have made me more vary of actually using them.It seems like so many wants to have a successful semi-solo SaaS that pay their bills. They aren&#39;t longer a way to sell a product and a startup idea, but an attempt at a lifestyle. Some people throw up smooth landing pages for barely working products, and quickly move on to the next idea if it doesn&#39;t stick.How can I invest time and money in using a product if I&#39;m afraid the founder will bail after a few months?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a founder at heart; I&#39;ve loved creating - and have a software background. I really resonate with the paraphrased vibe of way, way more SaaS companies. I&#39;ve been looking outside of SaaS to potentially harder science companies rather than SaaS for future endeavors.It is too easy to: splash page, Wordpress, &#34;rails new saas&#34; for a product and then try to sell via SEO / outbound, etc that the field is quite saturated - and un-discovered niches are a lot harder than say 2013."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Based on the distribution of human bones on the upper and lower tall, we propose that the force of a high-temperature, debris-laden, high-velocity blast wave from an airburst/impact (i) incinerated and flayed their exposed flesh, (ii) decapitated and dismembered some individuals, (iii) shattered many bones into mostly cm-sized fragments, (iv) scattered their bones across several meters, (v) buried the bones in the destruction layer, and (vi) charred or disintegrated any bones that were still exposed.What a way to go"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the theory that this event is what inspired the biblical story of Sodom. It reminds me of how paleontologists use the ancient art and stories of Native Australians to figure out what Pleistocene animals looked like and how they may have behaved.In the story, Lot and his family were one of the few people to escape the city before its destruction. God told his family to not look back at the city as it was being destroyed. Lot&#39;s wife looked back and turned into &#34;a pillar of salt&#34;. Maybe this is a metaphor for the people who went back to the site and couldn&#39;t grow food there due to the hypersaline that was spread across the region by the airburst."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another major explosion theorized to be caused by bolides is the 1626 Wanggongchang Explosion[1] in Beijing which is considered one of the major causes of the fall of the Chinese Ming dynasty.Although having its epicenter in the middle of a gunpowder factory would of course also heavily imply a gunpowder explosion (or maybe both).[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wanggongchang_Explosion"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been wearing a Casio F-91W for a number of years now and it really is a joy. It&#39;s always there, and it always works.I&#39;ve gone down the rabbit hole with expensive time pieces but they become a burden / obligation rather than a tool - especially as the prices of certain pieces in the secondary market have gone so high - so over time I&#39;ve reverted back to much cheaper watches and find myself getting more joy out of the cheaper &amp; much better value for money brands.Very occasionally I&#39;ll take it off in favour of a dress watch for a special event but otherwise I just wear it all the time, knowing that if it finally fails I&#39;m looking at $10 to replace."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got a Casio watch from Amazon about five years ago, there was a deal on and it was about CAD$20. A budgetary driven decision, for sure!But it&#39;s been fascinating to see, over the years, how many times I&#39;ve been approached (in a coffee shop or some other public place) by serious Casio enthusiasts, keen to ask about my watch and to show theirs. There&#39;s so many variations, colours, limited-runs editions... I seem to have accidentally stumbled into a niche with lots of passionate hobbyists - I&#39;m sort of glad I had to replace the awful strap, which snapped, so I actually have something to contribute to the conversation. I had no idea Casio watches were such a big thing, but now I&#39;m not at all surprised there are modding projects like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also a Casio fan, having picked up a GWM5600BC Radio Controlled/Solar model in 2010. I&#39;m wearing it to this day, having never changed the battery, taken out through all manner of wet and cold situations. I did sometimes have the problem of the battery running low in winter but switched off the wrist-flick light feature which constantly misfired under-sleeve and haven&#39;t had it since. Atomic clock updates daily are the cherry on top. Here&#39;s to the next decade!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apple continues to support OS updates on the iPhone 6s, a device released almost 6 years ago. Nor is it reserved for their flagship models - the 2016 iPhone SE also gets the latest and greatest.Meanwhile, my flagship android phone from 2018, the Samsung Galaxy S9, is stuck on the last version of Android.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple Maps is so close to being a fantastic app, but is sorely missing “search along route” that Google has. Right now, you can press the “coffee” or “gas” button but there’s no way to say, search for a CVS on the way back home from work. I really wish Apple added this instead of just suggesting searches that might be useful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s funny how every society has its own way of mistreating children, yet never considers it a problem at the time. We look at the ways children were harmed and exploited throughout history and shake our heads at how our morally underdeveloped forebears could be so cruel and misguided. Then we turn around and declare that our children have no right whatsoever to privacy, and that everything they read and write should be surveilled 24/7 by teams of strangers, for their &#34;own good&#34;.I firmly believe that a hundred years, people will look back on practices like this and shake their heads at the appalling attitudes their primitive ancestors had towards children. But I imagine that&#39;s little comfort to the kids subject to this kind of abuse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how much harm the constant surveillance does.We are training kids that someone is always watching. That they have to censor their thoughts and hold in their feelings rather than talk about them with others for fear of it being determined to be &#39;wrong&#39;. How many of these kids will be suspended, expelled, medicated, etc for things that were harmless? I think this surveillance will cause these kids to be less independent and delay their maturation because it&#39;s safer to do what you&#39;re told, not explore questions you have, and suppress your opinions.The number of conversations I had in school that would have gotten me I&#39;m trouble today would be a lot. I would guess they would have expelled me for some of it, even though it was totally harmless.Where is the cost benefit analysis? Or is this just another &#39;common sense&#39; solution because &#39;think of the children&#39;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is pretty outrageous. This constant need to fully control and monitor everything your kids are doing is getting out of hand and will by itself lead to severe problems and mental issues for the future generations.I mean, who didnt share or look at some porn when they were 10 years old? Would it be worth it for a whole army of teachers and consultants to descend on you and file an “incident report” and a “follow up” and “de brief” for this? What a colossal waste of resources and money. The $300k for the software could be better spent elsewhere.And yes, one suicide was apparently prevented, but then here we are again at the same argument, its like the one in the current apple/child porn case.Should we all get monitored just because of one positive but disproportionately small outcome?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is unlikely to work because of the timing delay. Suppose a member of Congress has access to inside information and trades on it. They have 45 days to disclose the trade. By the time the trade is disclosed, the market has already moved: if Pelosi or McConnell or whoever bought low so they could sell high, a month later the increase is probably already baked in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://www.cnbc.com/id/218.htmlThis reminds me of a study which showed that even if you bought the same stocks a month after Buffett and his holding company Berkshire Hathaway disclosed their own purchases, you&#39;d still be way ahead of the game.&#34;The market ... appears to under-react to the news of a Berkshire stock investment since a hypothetical portfolio that mimics Berkshire&#39;s investments created the month after they are publicly disclosed earns positive abnormal returns of 14.26% per year.&#34;But Buffett is a long term investor. 
I am not sure how long the Pelosis hold their stocks...But yes, insider trades :("</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a bit like a popular hedge fund strategy known as alpha capture. In the alpha capture strategy, funds look at the buy/sell recommendations made by analysts (for example those at the major banks). Applying a systematic approach means that they can measure the accuracy of each individual analyst and choose whether or not to follow along by trading the advice from that person. The best analysts eventually get hired into funds for their picks to be exclusive.I built something (DueDilly) that works in a similar way by monitoring the performance of Reddit user&#39;s stock recommendation and tracking how each idea performs and which users do well. You can choose to trade alongside them based on their track records.My site:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The social proof that a couch surfing reference brought was second to none. Each one boils down to this &#34;I, a stranger, stayed for a few nights in this other strangers home for free, and they were good human beings&#34;. That social proof carried to any part of the globe you visited.I cannot think of an internet app that brought people together in a more meaningful and wholesome way at scale.It was great while it lasted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Airbnb ruined Couchsurfing because it changed social expectations around hosting strangers at your house. Before Airbnb, no one really even thought people would pay for the privilege to sleep on your couch or your spare bedroom. But once Airbnb started getting popular, I think a lot of hosts on CS were thinking well, this is neat, but I could get paid doing this. And a lot of CS guests became refugees from Airbnb thinking &#34;well, if Airbnb wants me to pay for this, why do I go to CS and get it for free?&#34;I CS&#39;d only once, in Ghana in 2011. It was great, but I was too late for the trend, it died pretty shortly after."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"True story: One day, Windows wouldn&#39;t let me type the letter p.I was trying to log back in from the Windows lock screen. Typed my password, got it wrong. Typed it again, got it wrong. Eventually got locked out of my account, despite being extremely careful to type my password correctly. Went to IT and had them unlock my account...Went back to my PC and tried to log in again. Typed my password very carefully, letter by letter, watching each letter come up on screen as I went. When I went to type the letter p, nothing happened. I hit p repeatedly, nothing.I figured the switch for the p key on my keyboard had died or something, so I went to IT and got a new keyboard. Unplugged the old, plugged in the new. Still no p. OK, this is getting ridiculous. Clicked on accessibility tools and tried to use the on-screen keyboard to type in my password. _Still couldn&#39;t type the letter p, even with the on-screen keyboard._Ended up having to hard reset the machine, and then everything was fine and dandy. Still have no idea what could have happened. It ended up being the last straw that pushed me to Ubuntu, and I&#39;ve never looked back."</p>

Argh!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This could be the last time we see these funny videos. In this elections they “defeated” all opposition candidates with electronic ballot. Before electronic ballot results, even with all election fraud you see on camera, 90% of opposition candidates were winning in Moscow and Saint-Petersburg. Electronic ballot results were delayed by a few hours and when they released it turned out that opposition lost everywhere. This means next time they won’t even bother with a fraud in camera, they just put the numbers they need in a computer and declare a victory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a discussion with some friends about how impressive it is that Putin can do so many outrageous things and the world doesn’t stop him. Clear election fraud, assassinating foreigners, invading Crimea, etc. there are very few other countries that get free passes like Putin does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the high score but low placement on the HN page, I’m guessing this is being heavily flagged."</p>
