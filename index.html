								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This CSAM Prevention initiative by Apple is a 180 degress change of their general message around privacy. Imagine investing hundreds of millions of dollars in pro-privacy programs, privacy features, privacy marketing, etc... just to pull this reverse card.Of course this is going to spark concern within their own ranks. It&#39;s like working for a food company that claims to use organic, non-processed, fair-trade ingredients and in just a day deciding that you&#39;re going to switch to industrial farming sourcing and ultra-processed ingredients.It&#39;s a complete change of narrative and there&#39;s no easy way to explain it and still defend Apple&#39;s Privacy narrative, wihout doing extreme mental gymnastics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In their attempt to make this extra private by scanning &#39;on device&#39;, I think they&#39;ve managed to make it feel worse.If they scan my iCloud photos in iCloud, well lots of companies scan stuff when you upload it. It&#39;s on their servers, they&#39;re responsible for it. They don&#39;t want to be hosting CSAM.It feels much worse them turning your own, trusty iPhone against you.I know that isn&#39;t how you should look at it, but that&#39;s still how it feels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just do not want Apple scanning my phone for the purpose of finding something they can send to the police.I’m not even talking about any “slippery slope” scenarios and I’ll never have any of the material they are looking for. And right or wrong, I don’t really fear a false identification, so this isn’t about a worry that they will actually turn me in. I just don’t want them scanning my phone for the purpose of turning me in. I definitely do not want to take an OS update or new phone that does this.(False positives are the huge flaw in this system, though. There are human judgements by anonymous people using opaque processes without appeal throughout this. A lot of damage can be done before anything goes to court, not to mention courts themselves are susceptible to the illusion of infallible technology. Others have well laid out the scenarios that will result in serious consequences for innocent people.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is funny and sad to me. We had SQLite in the browser[0]. I only did a little bit of work with it but it seemed actually pretty nice.It was torpedoed because it was SQL-based (and not trendy &#34;key value&#34; and &#34;web scale&#34;).There was the whole excuse that the specification was &#34;whatever SQLite does&#34; and, therefore, not suitable for being a standard. There would be worse things than SQLite upon which to base a standard, all things considered. I still believe it was torpedoed because of lack of trendiness and &#34;not invented here&#34;.[0] https://www.w3.org/TR/webdatabase/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"James is one of the world&#39;s great techno-adventurers, &amp; getting to para-socially share in wild adventures like this makes living on Spaceship Earth more lovely &amp; lively! James has also done cool projects like sweet.js macros, helped kick off Firefox devtool&#39;s transition to react (iirc), oh and lead the basically industry standard JS formatter Priettier project. I&#39;m forgetting a dozen other things over the years but it&#39;s always been fun.Just a heads-up, the File System Access API[1] is underway in Chrome, which potentially removes nearly all of the absurdity here. It has other benefits too. A web page using this could write a .sql file on to your drive, that other programs could then access. One of the other bright stars in my world is Karli Koss, who has an extensive personal data-extraction setup for a ridiculously colossal variety of services &amp; devices[2]. A vast amount of this massive massive data-gathering framework is just reading sqlite databases of the various devices and apps. If the web can help participate more actively, can let apps write sql files to store state: so much the better I say. Help externalize your state beyond the browser, please![1] https://wicg.github.io/file-system-access/#api-filesystemwri... https://caniuse.com/native-filesystem-api[2] https://beepb00p.xyz/myinfra.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SQLite, even though it’s implemented on top of IndexedDB, easily beats out IndexedDB in every single performance metric. The absurdity!This really is quite incredible. Same idea extends to your filesystem too. Tracking millions of 1KB objects on disk? You could load the whole set into memory substantially faster from SQLite using the same disk. If WAL is enabled with reasonable sync flags, the same applies going back out to disk as well.SQLite is the most powerful dependency that our product uses today.  We have been using it in production as the sole persistence mechanism for 100% of our data for the last 5-6 years now. Recently, we have started leveraging the actual SQL engine to process all of our business logic as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My opinion about:
1. Every pedophile know about the existence of this system, so I don&#39;t think it will be useful to fight those monster, maybe only marginally;2. Anyway, is that legal ? Even if some crazy store material on his Apple hardware isn&#39;t that illegal search non usable in law courts ?3. Child abuse is often used as Trojan horse to introduce questionable practice. What if:- the system is used to looking for dissidents: I look for people that have a photo of Tiananmen Square protests on their pc, for example;- for espionage: I have the hash of some documents of interest, so all the PCs with that kind of documents could be a valuable target;- profiling people: you have computer virus sample on your PC -&gt; security researcher/hacker;I think that the system is prone to all kind of privacy abuse.4. this could be part of the previous point, but, because I think it&#39;s the final and real reason for the existence of that system, I give to this point its own section: piracy fight. I think that the one of the real reason is to discourage the exchange of illigal multimedia material to enforce copyrighs.For the listed reasons, I think that is a bad idea. Let me know what are you thinking about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An Apple recruiter recently reached out to me. I am in a fortunate position to turn down opportunities, so I made sure to explain that I am not interested in working for a company that is at the forefront of enabling further infringement on people&#39;s privacy. If you are able to push back, do it in any small way that you can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am beginning to wonder if this was the plan all along. Back in 2013 via the Snowden leaks, it was revealed Apple was associated with the NSA domestic surveillance program, PRISM. It appears they (NSA and Apple, et al) pulled out due to the level of negative PR.After 8 years, the intelligence community and tech companies figured out they could sell their surveillance through a thinly veiled effort to “protect X group” (in this case it was children)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having worked at a place with 11+ years of a project in  ZeroVer, I would caution against ZeroVer as it can mentally wear on software developers. The 0. is not something embraced, but a taunting God who takes pleasure in suffering. The followers of ZeroVer all believe that with some combination of magic and hard work a 0. will turn to a 1., but the mighty 0. never rolls over. To topple the 0.,  they will try tricks like a full rewrite of core code, new scrum patterns, new directors of software development, more code reviews, iron clad  specifications, testing specialists, and more. They’ll  try to do things they see 1.0 software doing: sell the code, use it in production, make billion dollar decision based on its output, have entire livelihoods wrapped up in its existence, and still the 0. is unchanged. The myths of a roadmap to 1.0 will build over time, some say it’s always existed, but there’s no sign of a road or even civilization when you look around. The ZeroVer faith says that everyone is always on the road to 1.0 if they believe, but outsiders continually taunt them for not knowing when 1.0 will reveal itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is sarcastic/satire, pretty sure? Not sure all the comments are catching that.When I have to use a 0.x-versioned package because it&#39;s a (hard or soft) dependency of some popular framework/platform/tool that &#34;everyone&#34; is using... I feel personally insulted. Like they&#39;re saying &#34;no, we&#39;re not willing to say this is production-ready, we&#39;re not willing to say that we&#39;re not going to break backwards compatibility every month or so in a way you can&#39;t predict from the version number so can&#39;t do automated dependency updates ever, but, hey, everyone else is using it, what&#39;s your problem?&#34;It&#39;s like the ultimate embrace of the typical HN &#34;open source maintainers owe you nothing and you should expect nothing of them&#34; argument. Which is true, but if all packages literally made no effort to meet user needs and we had learned to expect nothing from them, we would never be using open source...."</p>

Right now it is effectively impossible for a consumer to buy a TV that doesn&#39;t include a computer capable of this.CSAM is one thing, and from reports it sounds like checking hashes isn&#39;t really that effective. However, this paves the way for hash checks for a variety of scary things.What happens when governments start distributing lists of hashes belonging to &#34;subversive&#34; material (this isn&#39;t pipe dream, numerous large countries already block subversive material on the internet)."</p>

I have yet to see any convincing argument for how we get “back” (if we were ever there) to a time when technology was on our sides.Vote with your wallet, they say, but when hostile technology is far cheaper than friendly technology, and the vast majority of the population couldn’t care less, how could we possibly make a dent? And this is before even considering that governments around the world are on the side of hostile technology.Write to your representative, they say, but when our “democratic” representatives couldn’t care less about the needs of their constituents, yet term after term get re-elected regardless, who will hear us? And again, before considering that a) they’re voted in by the same careless majority, and b) that they are empowered by the very hostile technology we want them to combat?I just don’t see a future that isn’t plagued by the overbearing influence of soulless tech companies and the corrupt scumbags that enable them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good old fashioned police-work is needed instead of back-doors into our favorite apps.The Internet and app ecosystems can&#39;t work properly if they&#39;re weakened by LEAs. People would just not use them if they know they&#39;re being watched. I&#39;m not saying the majority would switch to Linux phones either (like Librem 5 &amp; Pinephone), simply that the two dominating app-stores (Play &amp; Apple Store) would be phased out and people would probably fund independent FLOSS app stores to replace them.In the end, the people will speak out and respond to back-doors. In-fact we need FLOSS app stores right now (Similar to F-Droid[0], but baked in as the default store), and they need to be funded properly &amp; they need sound economic incentives to continue. No more &#39;free&#39; apps where you pay for them with your data. It&#39;s possible to have FLOSS apps that are not gratis where people pay for them with money, not their data.(The reason I suggest we switch to FLOSS app stores is that the apps can easily be checked for back-doors or malicious code since the code is open source. It makes the apps readily available for audits too)[0] https://f-droid.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a few qualms with this app:1. For a Linux user, you can already build such a system yourself quite trivially by getting an FTP account, mounting it locally with curlftpfs, and then using SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem. From Windows or Mac, this FTP account could be accessed through built-in software.2. It doesn&#39;t actually replace a USB drive. Most people I know e-mail files to themselves or host them somewhere online to be able to perform presentations, but they still carry a USB drive in case there are connectivity problems. This does not solve the connectivity issue.3. It does not seem very &#34;viral&#34; or income-generating. I know this is premature at this point, but without charging users for the service, is it reasonable to expect to make money off of this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was a very early Dropbox adopter but eventually switched to OneDrive a few years back because they bundled Office 365 with 1 TB of storage. I just went and looked at the official Dropbox plans to see if there was a family plan similar to the 5 users I get with Office 365/OneDrive...and found their plan/pricing page overwhelming. There&#39;s rows upon rows of features to compare across versions like &#34;Traffic and Insights&#34; and the &#34;Plus button&#34; forcing me to keep scrolling just to see that a family plan costs $16.99 a month for 2 TB. No option for a cheaper plan with less storage. I feel like they are missing the mark when it comes to marketing to consumers here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dropbox is still the bestOneDrive (I use it at work): if one file fails, all files stop syncing. It sometimes tries to sync some files from teams and just never finishes. It also has very strange file name restrictions. if the file name is bad (eg whitespace at the end) it will just stop syncing anything. Still better than Google Drive as it is a standard folder. if it crashes your data is HERE.google drive (I used that at work): on MacOS is it is utter crap as it is not a folder but a mounted thing. So it is not &#34;there&#34; when you login. So every application that tries to open a file on google drive just fails. Because it is not an apple FS a lot of apple apps will complain. MySQL Workbench will often fail to save and often destroy files. If not running it is not mounted and none of your files are here. you also can&#39;t copy out google files (writer, spreadsheet, etc). For whatever reason.iCloud: some strange folder nested hundred levels deep. I only use it because of some ios stuff.So yeah, Dropbox might be pricey but through all the years it really worked very well for me. (And I really don&#39;t care about any of the other services they have)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of a golden age blog post, when lists turned out to be an understudied literary device. I&#39;m a fan of &#34;dumps.&#34; Some interestingly debatable ones here:&#34;Intellectual Property Maximalism rollback: copyright terms have not and probably will not be indefinitely extended again to eternity to protect Mickey Mouse, and in 2019, for the first time since 1998, works entered the public domain&#34;I think the easy indicator may be the wrong one here. Defined more broadly, the public domain is not being enriched. For example, the web was a lot smaller in 1999, but it was a much more public domain. Today&#39;s web and post web internet is more centralised, controlled and therefore private property. Google could crawl pages, links, forums, because they were public, and use that access to create a search engine. Content, connections and signal are, today, proprietary. You can&#39;t order the world&#39;s information if that information is facebook&#39;s, only facebook can.Or patents, more stuff of the last generation is patented than the previous&#39;. Does that mean we invented more or we patented more? What happens to stuff that doesn&#39;t get patented? It&#39;s public.Old copyright expiry deadlines might be a symbolic lead indicator, but they&#39;re determining the location of a fence post in county scale land dispute. A tiny, legible, part of the whole. In real terms, Disney&#39;s copyright portfolio is worth more, not less."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think he kind of missed the elephant that is modern communication technology has reduced the marginal cost of skilled services enabling pretty much every object designed in an office and manufactured in a factory to benefit from a broader array of engineering and design professionals and methodologies.  The average product and service that the average actor in the economy interacts with is designed and optimized to a far greater degree today than they were historically.Look at the bottle of Elmers glue on the table.  Today the glue probably works better (barring regulation that forces compromises to product efficacy) and comes in a bottle that uses half as much plastic.  Something like a bottle revision that would have formerly required expensive salaried employees to come up with multiple options, send them to the supplier, supplier has to respond to each with details and quotes, etc, can now be accomplished in a fraction of the man hours thanks to email and CAD being ubiquitous in the entire supply chain from marketing, to engineering, to the vendor&#39;s contractor who will actually design the tooling.  Sign off might take days instead of weeks.  This sort of efficiency improvement allows more engineering, design work, or other optimization to be done to every good and service in our economy allowing it to penetrate into even the most thin margin use cases.  From farming to high finance products and services are substantially more influenced and optimized by specialist professionals than they were in 1990. Increase efficiency like this throughout the national and global economy is how lawnmowers and A/C units can be sold on sale for $100 and still make a profit. (yes I know that example isn&#39;t perfect but you get the point)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, the article seems panglossian (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candide).Some of the &#34;upsides&#34; (e.g. improvements in patent regime) just aren&#39;t there. Some aren&#39;t as wonderful as they are described.I&#39;m in my mid-sixties; I&#39;m very much a candidate for the &#34;things were better in the old days&#34; brigade.But I do think many (most?) things have improved. Housing is better; healthcare is immeasurably better (unless you can&#39;t afford it); and mobile telephony has improved the lives of at least a billion people worldwide.Because I&#39;m not  miserable old git, I&#39;m not going to list downsides.[Edit] OK, I&#39;ll list one: permanent war."</p>
