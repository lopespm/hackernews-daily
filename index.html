								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nobody hates Facebook users more than Facebook, I guess. :-/I&#39;ve tried to type out several pithy comments, but the bottom line (to me) is that Facebook just doesn&#39;t respect its users or care about their needs.Can you imagine if brick-and-mortar businesses tried to do this? You go out for a Big Mac, but it&#39;s not on the menu anymore because Taco Bell had a few really good quarters, so McDonald&#39;s decided to pivot to tacos. Maybe you can still order the Big Mac if you know to ask for it, but most people won&#39;t, and they&#39;ll leave disappointed instead of getting what they wanted.Edit: To clarify, this example is contrived and the details are not the point. The point is that Facebook offered something to their users, spent years and billions of dollars making sure that as many people as possible got it from Facebook, and then decided to just yank the rug out from under all those people to chase the fairy tale of endless growth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s crazy to think the social media era may finally be ending. There’s really no viable platform anymore where you can just go passively keep up with what friends and acquaintances are doing. Everything is about feeding you content you didn’t ask for but may be targeted enough to catch your attention.And for what? To show you some ads here and there? To collect data that can be used to… sell more ads and products?Instagram was once my favorite app. There was a golden age before stories came a long where people just posted random pictures of what they were up to or what they were seeing. Things weren’t too memefied or political, unlike Facebook. Then photos got more and more glamorized and more about flexing and showing how much cooler and more awesome your life was. People started following themes and niches for their profile content rather than just posting random unorganized series of photos. Businesses and brands started getting built on the platform.Building an Instagram clone the way it used to be is fairly trivial these days. I could probably throw one together in a few months, but growing its popularity is practically impossible these days with such entrenched incumbents and no niches left to start a user base with.…unless perhaps… we build a social network on the blockchain"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it sounds dumb but its hard to say we haven&#39;t moved closer to what only ~10 years ago we considered a &#34;playful exaggeration&#34; on the worst of humans and social media.In WallE, everyone is floating around in chairs having their content spoon-fed to them with a generous amount of ads mixed in.  If you&#39;ve ever scrolled or seen someone scroll, its kinda close.  Just mindlessly moving their thumb up and down, taking in content that will be forgotten within minutes.  Ask a tik tok user to tell you even 10% of the videos they saw within the last hour.  I&#39;d be surprised if they could.I hope its not too &#34;old man yelling at cloud&#34; because I do my 15 minutes of mindless instagram scrolling but I have a timer that locks the app and I usually only need 15 minutes, more just feels bleh.  Some of my family/friends &#34;brag&#34; about having 7+ hrs of &#34;tik tok time&#34; on their iphone stats.  Just crazy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love this.I have been a fan of SQLite for years, and it makes me genuinely happy to see other people have the same enthusiasm for the software.A couple of years ago, during a job search, I came across a couple of companies that I thought were a good match. I went through the interview process with all of them and, due to similarities in the interview process, we ended up talking about the same thing: databases. Oh the horror in the interviewers’ eyes whenever I mentioned SQLite. Experienced software engineers from The New York Times, for example, went as far as to mock my engineering choices in 3 out of 5 interviews, despite the success of the products my team built on top of SQLite.The experience made me feel awful and I stopped talking about SQLite for a couple of years. Instead, whenever someone asked a question about databases, I would answer with the PostgreSQL equivalent, knowing that the basic features are all the same.That is why, whenever I see projects like Litestream [1][2] used by excellent products like Tailscale [3], it brings me joy.A friend of SQLite is a friend of mine :-)[1] https://litestream.io[2] https://fly.io/blog/all-in-on-sqlite-litestream/[3] https://tailscale.com/blog/database-for-2022/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For people who enjoy this article I recommend reading the two-parter “How does SQLite work?” [1] [2] by Julia Evans. It too is an exploration into the inner workings but diving deeper into code. 
And for those interested in more details on b-trees, there’s “The Ubiquitous B-Tree” by Douglas Cramer which I enjoyed a lot.[1] https://jvns.ca/blog/2014/09/27/how-does-sqlite-work-part-1-...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dream of a SQLite-like embeddable database engine based on Datomic’s data model and queryable with Datalog. Written in something like C, Rust, or Zig. I’m toying around with the idea of hacking something up, but it’ll likely stay in the dream realm until I have Heaps of Free Time on My Hands (tm).Looking into SQLite’s innards is a great source of inspiration. Thanks for this post."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I run marketing email databases. This is cute, but it doesn&#39;t actually do anything in most systems - either the employees all already get the marketing emails or there is a system-wide rule to suppress against the email domain.If you actually want to (potentially) break something, try submitting some obscure characters or malformed html into some fields. Blank spaces in emails can particularly be a nuisance.And if you want some real fun, some systems only enforce validation rules via client-side javascript. If you block them, you might be able to submit some real chaotic entries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to get spam from a Chinese exporter who conveniently included their actual address in the emails. One day I happened to be visiting their city and went to their office and asked them to unsubscribe me in person. The lady was very confused and first thought I wanted to buy something. I showed her the spam on my phone and she agreed but didn&#39;t bother actually removing me. Just seemed to think I was a bit stupid for travelling so far (I was also a foreigner) to complain about a spam. It was interesting to see what those companies look like in real life though - an office filled with piles of widgets and cartons of deliveries everywhere. These Chinese exporter spammers do tend to be legitimate businesses and they can actually provide good cheap access to manufacturers but they harvest emails from everywhere if there&#39;s any hint you might work in a related industry."</p>

We absolutely need to fund more semiconductor manufacturing. Losing that ability to China/Taiwan was just a terrible strategic mistake.The US hasn’t lost this battle (over semiconductors) just yet. While current manufacturing is indeed dominated by East Asian countries, the vast majority of research still happens in US universities. This legislation allocates more funding for that research, fantastic.Theres some political gamesmanship over some silly stock options of congresspeople… my response is, who gives a single shit. The country needs this bill."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It should be noted that the US decided not to extend the universal free school meals program, because it was &#34;too expensive&#34; at $11B. They also stopped the expanded and early payment of family tax credits, causing a double-whammy hit to poor families (then pile on inflation/food prices, and gas prices). But $50B to large monopolistic companies isn&#39;t &#34;too expensive,&#34; and we can afford that.Unfortunately 52 senators get to control the agenda, and they get to decide what is &#34;affordable&#34; and &#34;too expensive.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Signal brought e2e encryption to the masses in a form that was and is usable. From signal having it came whatsapp asking the signal devs to &#34;do that for whatsapp&#34; and a billion more got it.That is no small thing. Bitch all you want but make sure when you do you compare it to the success of literally ever other attempt to bring e2e to the masses and then if I&#39;m gonna be snarky maybe compare it to your own achievements.It would have been fantastic if signal also achieved other things on top of what they did. Maybe. Knocking what they did? Forget it. Signal is an outstanding achievement and nothing else comes close. I will cheer you so, so hard if you beat it."</p>

It Knows Better what you&#39;re allowed to do with your messages, what kind of client you&#39;re allowed to use, what kind of multidevice experience you need and when it should destroy messages you care about.The arrogance of the owner directly transfers to the arrogance and lack of control in the software which is fundamentally limiting its usefulness for everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author notes:
&#34;Finally, we need to talk federation. Does it make moving fast and breaking things more difficult? Yes, yes it does, and that can be a good thing.&#34;The other, super-underrated feature of federated systems is that antagonistic parties are willing to use them together. For example, the US military, Russian government, major international banks, Google, Facebook, etc ALL use email and happily exchange messages over SMTP. There&#39;s no centralized service you could get all these parties to agree to use (not even Signal).The result of this is that everyone has an email address, and that makes it the universal standard for business-to-business communication. I can loop in any number of parties on a single thread from all over the world and it just works.My startup Shortwave is trying to build a messaging future that is email. We&#39;re trying to evolve and upgrade email to have the look and feel and features of a product like Signal, but with all the universal, federated goodness of the global SMTP network. It&#39;s a long project -- federated systems evolve slowly! -- but it&#39;s the bright open future I think we need. I go into some detail here: https://www.shortwave.com/blog/future-of-messaging/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context, for non-Nethack players:Nethack is one of the original &#34;roguelikes,&#34; back when that meant a text-console game based on `rogue`. It&#39;s an RPG where your character kills monsters, picks up loot, and descends into the dungeon. If you die, that&#39;s it -- you can&#39;t just load a save; you have to start all over. It&#39;s legendarily unforgiving.In Nethack, most (all?) roles start with a pet, e.g. a puppy or a kitten. In the early game, your pet is often stronger than you; it follows you, fights monsters, etc. It&#39;s useful in many ways beyond fighting: it won&#39;t walk over a cursed item, it can &#34;fetch&#34; items from stores without angering the proprietor, and so on. Your pet gains experience and levels up (puppy -&gt; dog -&gt; large dog), and after a certain point you&#39;re prompted to give your pet a name.The message &#34;You have a sad feeling for a moment, then it passes&#34; is displayed when your pet dies while out of sight. It&#39;s pretty difficult to keep your pet alive all through the endgame, so much like any real-life pet owner, there will come a time where you have to say goodbye, one way or the other."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hidden gems like this were one of the great things about Everything2. For those who aren&#39;t familiar with it, E2 is structured vaguely like an encyclopedia, only instead of being a shared Wiki any user can write a whole separate article. Sometimes this was helpful for learning -- having three different explanations of what a tensor[1] is, for example. Sometimes it gave a mix of informational and personal content, such as the page on Mother&#39;s Day[2], which has one article on the history of the holiday and two about the authors&#39; attempts to cope with it despite losing or never having had a good relationship with their mothers. (Plus a summary of a Futurama episode by that name, because E2 was like that.)It also had an accidentally-fun feature in its hyperlinking system. Hyperlinks were intended to be used to be used for words that had their own articles, but you could link to any article, and when you hovered your mouse over the link the name of the target article would pop up. This could be used to make the closest thing I&#39;ve seen to an English equivalent of Japanese furigana puns. I&#39;m having trouble finding a good example right now, sadly.[1] https://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node=tensor[2] https://everything2.com/title/Mother%2527s+day"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; My own death, of course, which I learnt will come when I least expect it, when everything is going right for once - that when no threats are apparent and I feel I can relax a little, it will be then that I choke over a tin of spinach, or mistake a blue e for a blue o, or a pink h for a pink h.Just recently my wife developed a sudden and very aggressive infection. She&#39;s healthy and it totally came out of left field. Then it spread to me. It was definitely humbling. I don&#39;t believe in living in fear, but it&#39;s funny how everything can change in an instant.I have to commend the title though:&gt; You have a sad feeling for a moment, then it passesComing to understand the ephemeral nature of emotions is what finally allowed me deal with them. They&#39;re still real, but they always pass, no matter how strong they seem in the moment."</p>

Persephone, indeed.He may have walked back his prediction of earth being largely uninhabitable by 2050,  but I have a feeling he was only slightly off.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can provide both anecdotal and academic data:Because companies have imperfect reading on worker productivity, and are also trying to balance other priorities when determining pay, high output workers are consistently underpaid, called Wage Compression (https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_compression)After getting a 2% raise in the last cycle, and knowing that my granted options were going to be worthless (a factor which is under-discussed in popular news articles), I decided that it was a particularly opportune time to jump. Like many, I was not particularly unhappy, so I had not been motivated to go through the effort for search process before.When I got an offer, my employer quickly matched it (suggesting that I really was worth that much to them) but burning a bridge with the contact you got me the new job was not worth  simply reaching parity in my current one, so they lost me. If they had preemptively gotten a few percentage points closer before I sunk effort into interviewing, I probably would not have started looking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve had several chances to switch positions for considerably more than I make now (40-50% on my current six figures), each time I&#39;ve turned them down.I am happy and content where I am at, the job has good work life balance, it is for a good cause, and I make enough to provide comfortably for me and my family, this employer is also very stable so I don&#39;t have to worry about economic uncertainty.All in all I could make more money but I have found a level of contment and peace and it has allowed me to persue other hobbies outside of tech and serve in my local community.So maybe I am stupid and leaving money on the table, but I have found peace for now. For those who feel they need to make more I tell them congratulations that is awesome for you. But for now I am happy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like reading about linguistic origins like that one. Makes me reflect on my irrational hatred towards reading &#34;could of&#34;, &#34;would of&#34; and the likes. I mean, I still get a seizure reading it, but I can only imagine some old dude yelling at the youngsters in the late 1800&#39;s like &#34;it&#39;s called &#39;and per se, and&#39;! Not ampersand! Jeez you all are the reason the english language is degrading!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The letter I, for example, would be referred to with the phrase I per se, I, which means in Latin &#34;I by itself (is the word) I.&#34; When the 27th quasi-letter &amp; was referred to it was called &amp; per se, and, meaning &#34;&amp; by itself (is the word) and.&#34; That read as &#34;and per se and.&#34;This explanation is mixed up and confusing. It isn&#39;t &#34;I per se, I&#34; that is somehow &#34;by itself I&#34;, it is merely &#34;per se I&#34;. The reason you get another &#34;and&#34; in front was because it was at the end of the alphabet song: &#34;[and] [per se &amp;]&#34;.https://en.m.wiktionary.org/wiki/ampersand&gt; Thus the end of the recitation would be: “X, Y, Z and per se and”. This last phrase eventually became ampersand, and the term was in common English usage by around 1837."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One summer I had a job in the Penn library improving the catalog data for their medieval Latin manuscripts. The abbreviations were wild. Here is a handbook of them (which includes &amp; = et and &amp;-bar = etiam): https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/213385262.pdf (pdf). I can see how being &#34;literate&#34; was tougher then than now.There were different handwriting styles, depending on the writing speed (inversely proportional to the quality and thus expense). For example the Codex Sinaiticus is gorgeous: https://www.codexsinaiticus.org/en/manuscript.aspx?book=26&amp;c... (That&#39;s a Greek example, not Latin---sorry, I&#39;m not much of a Latinist anymore.) I guess if you don&#39;t have mechanical type, you are very motivated to speed up writing. The books I looked at were pretty hasty.Almost everything I saw was a treatise on medicine and biology. They were all &#34;commentaries on Aristotle&#34;. I guess that&#39;s what you had to do to publish in those days.Besides the paleography, I had to trace the origin &amp; date of the paper used, which was possible from watermarks. We had two huge reference volumes giving known watermarks so you could narrow things down a lot---but often you didn&#39;t get an exact match. There was a whole symbology there too."</p>
