								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The discussion on race conditions at the end is an important one, and IMO the bugfix is a bandage at best: the notion of anything accessing the “current” object after any kind of delay, especially in an event handler, when there is any chance the thing is not a singleton, is a recipe for disaster. In this case, dismissing the “current” security code screen was a supported API surface and that should set off all the red flags.Of course it’s annoying to have to track the identity of “our screen” and bind that identity to event handlers, or make it accessible with context etc. But it’s necessary in anything remotely security-adjacent.(And never assume anything is a singleton unless you add a breadcrumb comment for someone who might change that assumption on a different team!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have an obsession with classifying software bugs into general categories, looking for the &#34;root cause&#34;, or more constructively, for a way to avoid entire classes of bugs altogether. I&#39;ve been doing that for more than 20 years now.This bug, if you look into the fix, falls into my &#34;state transition&#34; category. You can (and should) model large parts of your software as a state machine, with explicit transitions and invariant checks. If you do not, you still end up with states, just implemented haphazardly, and sooner or later someone will forget to perform a task or set a variable when transitioning from state to state.This category is my strong contender for #1 problem area in all devices that have a user interface."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s say you run a company and you want to reduce staff.  Let&#39;s also say you want to make an unpopular decision (or multiple unpopular decisions) that you know will drive a certain percentage of your staff to leave the company.  Wouldn&#39;t it make the most sense to announce those decisions before making layoffs?  Let people self select whether they want to stay and work for you and then make your layoffs after to ensure all teams are properly staffed.  Instead, Musk has already laid people off to the point that they are trying to hire back people previously laid off and current employees are sleeping in the office. Now he is pushing even more people out the door with no control over what teams will be hurt the hardest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am split on the remote work thing from a productivity / creativity perspective.I do think there are times when I&#39;m less productivity working from home compared to the office. I also think as a team we&#39;re less creative. Some of the best stuff I&#39;ve done in my career has come out of casual conversations with my team about the stuff we&#39;re building. I&#39;ve noticed I don&#39;t think about what I&#39;m building as much when working remote, I&#39;m just building it.That said, I don&#39;t think 100% office is good either. That tends to just burn me out and I know other people I work with say the same thing. I think I&#39;m at my best when it&#39;s 2-3 days in the office and the rest working from home.40 hours in the office is really extreme these days. And any potential benefit of having employees working together in an office 24/7 is going to be negated by their dissatisfaction. Were I working at Twitter I&#39;d probably be looking for a new job after this announcement. Not so much for the remote work decision either, but just the general lack of respect for how the employees prefer to work. This lack of flexibility probably means Musk won&#39;t just stop at remote work but he&#39;ll want keep track of your productivity, when you arriving in the morning, how long you take for lunch, etc. Working for these kinds of people in my experience is a living hell."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article: &#34;FTX Chief Executive Sam Bankman-Fried said in investor meetings this week that Alameda owes FTX about $10 billion, people familiar with the matter said. FTX extended loans to Alameda using money that customers had deposited on the exchange for trading purposes, a decision that Mr. Bankman-Fried described as a poor judgment call, one of the people said.&#34;In the FTX International terms of service ( https://help.ftx.com/hc/article_attachments/9719619779348/FT... ) they say that users have full title, ownership and control of digital assets. They say that the assets are the property of the user, and shall not be loaned to FTX trading, shall not be treated as they belong to FTX trading, and that users control the assets in the account.So if they did indeed loan out customer deposits, that is just straight up criminal fraud, open and shut. This isn&#39;t like some DeFi scheme where they are working around some legal loophole or in the fine print tell you that they will probably lose your money. This is just straight up illegal under the plain vanilla theft and fraud laws of any country. This isn&#39;t even a bank run (banks at least tell you they are loaning your deposits out) -- it&#39;s a run on a U-Haul self-storage where you find out that they actually sold all the furniture in your storage unit to a pawn shop."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"MD and I work in the field. The technology is called CAR-T, as the article mentioned. It’s been used pretty widely for “liquid” tumors for a while (eg leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma),but solid tumors are particularly difficult to target using current CAR-T therapy. If this CRISPR  tech can be applied widespread to solid tumors that opens up a huge swath of patients that can be treated.However cost and logistics are a huge factor. CAR-T therapy currently cost about $300,000-$500,000 to treat a patient. Beyond the cost of the immunotherapy you require a huge institutional investment because there are characteristic side effects that occur within the first 30 days of treatment which necessitates patients to be either admitted to the hospital for 30 days or stay in close proximity with daily check-ins (yes the cancer is getting treated BUT now your immune system is hyperactive which can be very dangerous in the short term).Very few academic hospitals, let alone community hospitals, have this bandwidth which will lead to cancer care being concentrated in a handful of a few very large cancer specific institutions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Following the links, here&#39;s the actual meat of what &#34;unfair methods of competition&#34; means [1, pg 9]:&gt; There are two key criteria to consider when evaluating whether conduct goes beyond competition on the merits. First, the conduct may be coercive, exploitative, collusive, abusive, deceptive, predatory, or involve the use of economic power of a similar nature. It may also be otherwise restrictive or exclusionary, depending on the circumstances, as discussed below. Second, the conduct must tend to negatively affect competitive conditions. This may include,
for example, conduct that tends to foreclose or impair the opportunities of market participants, reduce competition between rivals, limit choice, or otherwise harm consumers.&gt; ...the second part of the principle examines whether the respondent’s conduct has a tendency to generate negative consequences; for instance, raising prices, reducing output, limiting choice, lowering quality, reducing innovation, impairing other market participants, or reducing the likelihood of potential or nascent competition.And selecting from some given examples [taken from pg 13-15]:&gt; loyalty rebates, tying, bundling, and exclusive dealing arrangements that have the tendency to ripen into violations of the antitrust laws by virtue of industry conditions and the respondent’s position within the industry&gt; de facto tying, bundling, exclusive dealing, or loyalty rebates that use market power in one market to entrench that power or impede competition in the same or a related market&gt; using market power in one market to gain a competitive advantage in an adjacent market by, for example, utilizing technological incompatibilities to negatively impact competition in adjacent markets[1] https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/P221202Section5..."</p>

The result is a system that is paid enough to be excellent, excellent enough for most users not to need support, and non-bogged enough for paying users to get excellent support.The best part is when corporations get involved.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It bears repeating because this is a common mistake in inflation discussions: a decrease in inflation metrics means price increases are slowing down, it doesn’t mean that prices are going down （that would require a negative CPI print).Also, this number is year over year, so the decrease just means the price increases between Oct 21 and Oct 22 are not as steep as between Sept 21 to Sept 22, which is not hard to achieve because Sept 21 to Oct 21 had a bigger month over month jump.The right way to interpret this number is that high prices have plateaued a bit.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"OP struggles with XPaths in complex DOMs. This is a solved problem. Use Helium [1] to write test code that acts on what the user sees:  start_chrome(&#39;github.com/login&#39;)
  write(&#39;user&#39;, into=&#39;Username&#39;)
  write(&#39;pw&#39;, into=&#39;Password&#39;)
  click(&#39;Sign in&#39;)

I am the author of Helium. It&#39;s a wrapper around Selenium. It&#39;s fully open source. Under the hood, it uses Selenium 3, which is old. But boy does it work beautifully.1: https://github.com/mherrmann/selenium-python-helium"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Selenium just couldn&#39;t parse the over-engineered Javascript framework we had, and I had to pile on hacks on hacks.Excuse me, but isn&#39;t selenium actually a browser robot and not a javascript parser? I assume this is just that DOM is mutating so much that they could or could not find that element or always have to wait for it and comes with unreliability and such.I haven&#39;t used alternatives, but using selenium feels like solid &#34;Engine&#34; to make abstractions on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You&#39;re going to get a lot of responses that say record-replay testing doesn&#39;t scale, is unmaintainable, etc. They&#39;re totally right.But the thing is, early on when your app is in flux, neither does writing Selenium code. There&#39;s a pretty big truism in UI automation that writing UI tests before a UI freeze is a recipe for a shit-ton of pain. Coding to ids or xpaths only gets you yay far if the UI flow itself fundamentally changes.But re-recording might be easy.Don&#39;t use stuff like this for long-standing tests. Unless you architect your app just right so that IDs are always stable, and you never change the interface, it&#39;ll break and break in ways that you can only fix by a complete re-record. Plus the tests tend to be extremely timing-fragile because recording uses delays instead of synchronization points, so they just won&#39;t work in CI.But do use stuff like this at your desk during bring-up, when the cost of a re-record is lower than the cost of a test rewrite and it&#39;s ok to re-run the thing if the first try craps out due to a timing glitch.And from there, keep an open mind.I went to a GTAC (Google testing conference) where a presentation made a very good argument--with numbers and everything--that for smaller projects with simple and more or less static UIs, and where the tests were all fundamentally scripted, there was almost no advantage to coding the tests later. Record-replay was the best way to go.But I definitely don&#39;t think a system like PlayWright fully replaces remote stubs like WebDriver and coding tests in the languages that can talk to it.At some point you hit the issue that the login screen changed and now every single test is invalid. It&#39;s awfully nice if you used Page Object Model and you have a single-point-of-truth to fix it.More to the point, test automation can do more than just execute a script repeatably. Randomized monkey testing is something you can really only do in code, ditto scenarios that need to talk to testing interfaces exposed from the app itself.Glad you found a tool that resonates with you!"</p>
