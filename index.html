								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nat was a great CEO. The best that could have happened to Github after the acquisition IMO.The one time that I won&#39;t forget about Github under Nat, was when they stood up for Iranian developers [1]. They went the extra distance to get a permission/license from the US government specially to offer full Github to developers from Iran. Many other companies didn&#39;t do something similar.[1]: https://github.blog/2021-01-05-advancing-developer-freedom-g..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most people probably say this just to be like “I know Nat, look at me.” I don’t know how to phrase this to avoid that:Nat is an incredible person. I’ve been lucky to get to know him over the past couple months. Not only is he super chill, but he’s also not afraid to ask basic questions. Many of you might roll your eyes at that, but it’s a real problem: when you’re organizing something, you feel pressured to know everything, or else you’ll lose people’s confidence. So all the people who try to act confident also rarely ask basic questions.Hackers are the opposite. We’re always focused on breaking down problems into the most basic components, and then building up complexity once we understand the system.When Nat reached out to me, I didn’t know what to expect. But I certainly didn’t expect him to be a fellow hacker that happened to be famous. I think it’s incredible that someone can go so long without losing that spirit — imagine suddenly having a boatload of money. Most of us would probably take things easier.Another surprise is how incredibly chill he is. When things go seriously wrong, he’s totally cool about it, in a way that’s hard to put into words. I learned the phrase “No stress, friend” from him, and I’ve used it a few times to soothe other people. As cliche as it sounds, sometimes it’s the one thing in the world you need to hear.I wish I could tell a certain story to underscore the point, but Nat’s stories are his to tell. I hope he writes a book someday — nothing fancy, just a raw thought stream of all his experiences.And I wish I could share his future ambition. It’s so exciting that I can hardly contain myself. It might not work out, but that’s true of everything.I don’t know if anyone will see this. But I just wanted to write a little note to say how rare Nat is. He actually cares — deeply — and also cares about you. Most leaders don’t.If someone reading this has the opportunity to work with him on his new project, I encourage you to leave your cushy job on that basis alone. It’ll be fun in a way you won’t experience elsewhere."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(Aware of the fact that I&#39;m taking time out of my day to read HN)I really wonder how many adults &gt; 25yrs and &lt; 60yrs have the time to immerse themselves in any type of digital world / metaverse experience. If I was a teenager or in college, then yeah I can see it... but there are so many things to do in the 16hrs we have each day, and I already kick myself for not finishing that book, or getting an extra workout in, and just sitting in the backyard and resting my eyes. And I don&#39;t even have children..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No, it is not. Neither is Roblox or Fortnite, or VRchat. A single game or world is NOT the metaverse, what is so hard to understand about that for journalists and companies?The metaverse is the immersive internet, as a successor to our current one that is more 2D oriented around photos/videos/text today. It&#39;s a paradigm shift in how we interact, but most importantly there will be many of these virtual worlds/spaces interconnected together to form an actual network that nobody outright owns. To get to this future, we need protocols/standards to allow virtual worlds to talk to one another and agree that users can hop back in forth between them seamlessly, across all platforms.More specifically, the way we use the web today to navigate from webpage to another is how we we traverse the metaverse. The core problem that needs to get solved right now is interoperability, to enable the &#34;web of 3D&#34;.Look to WebGPU, WebAssembly, and WebXR as cornerstone technologies here. Our startup is building the &#34;3D/VR web&#34; in this way, and our current focus is getting proper HTML5 exporting from the native game engines, currently Unreal Engine. We&#39;re also building out a suite of tooling to empower developers and creators along with our hosting/discovery platform that includes advanced texture compression + asynchronous asset fetching to enable 3D/VR websites that load as quickly as a regular 2D page. If you&#39;re a developer and are interested in our work, you can join our Discord here:https://discord.gg/zUSZ3T8"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“What is so hard for people to understand” says HN commenter: “the metaverse clearly means [my definition of the metaverse] why can’t people see this?!!”Well, Zuckerberg didn’t give a clear definition, the term itself is made up, and it doesn’t currently exist (otherwise, what would we be building?).So no you don’t know what it means or how it will turn out, and neither does Zuckerberg. He might have a vision of what he’d like it to be and how he’s going to make money out of it, but he’s very probably very wrong.It’s obvious a deeply immersive experience will eventually arrive but it seems far from obvious how it will be used, much like predicting the rise of Tik Tok in 1990 based on email and usenet.The best way to predict the future is to make it. Hackers built much of the early internet, so let’s go build the early metaverse and at least make something insanely experimental and magical and beautiful before the next Zuckerberg comes alone and devalues it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apropos of nothing, I&#39;ll share one of the reasons why I&#39;ve been a loyal customer since 2010. In 2013 I booted up a dormant 2006 Macbook to prep for lending to a friend. Shortly thereafter I received the following email:===Hi Robbie (first name guessed from email address)-This is NOT an automated email, I&#39;m typing this live.
You have the very very last computer on earth running
an ancient version of Backblaze (version 1.5.2.390) that
NO LONGER WORKS (too old, needs updating).You are paying for a service you are not using.
You have two choices:1) Upgrade your Mac OS X 10.5 computer called &#34;rlmmbp&#34;
    to the latest Backblaze.  Just visit our homepage
    and download it and install right over the top of
    what you have already, here is a URL:
    https://secure.backblaze.com/update.htm
    (Will take less than 5 seconds, totally free,
    you are already paying!)2) Do nothing -&gt; in 7 more days I will delete that
     machine&#39;s backup and all of the files in the backup,
     and you will be paying for an unused license.
     (I can provide instructions on how to cancel your
     billing if you need them.)If you have any questions, feel free to contact me
at the email address below:- Brian Wilson
  CTO, Backblaze

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an interesting moment to reflect on the wacky nature of IPO vs ICO valuations.  Backblaze and Filecoin are, roughly speaking, in the same business (providing bulk file storage).  Backblaze is looking to raise ~$100 million at a valuation of about $0.7 billion.  Filecoin raised $250 million in their ICO, and the coin has a current &#34;market cap&#34; of about $7 billion.  Backblaze owns about 1.8 EiB of storage, Filecoin has about 13 EiB &#34;pledged&#34;, so if you consider those measurements comparable the $ of valuation per EiB is similar.  Businesses generally get valued more on what they bring in than what they own however, and Backblaze takes in ~$65 million/year revenue (~$175K/day).   I&#39;m not entirely clear what would be analogous to revenue for Filecoin, but they &#34;mine&#34; ~330K coins per day, which at current prices is about $21 million (or $7.8 billion per year?).  Now here&#39;s where it gets crazy... based on the current average reward if Backblaze dedicated all of their storage to Filecoin mining they could (theoretically) generate about $2.5 million a day (or $900 million/year, about 13x what they bring in now).Backblaze did look into farming Chia at some point[1], don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve done similar experiments with Filecoin, but it definitely seems like there is a profound disconnect between these two worlds (which could be the result of some other factor, like the USD value of Bitcoin).[1] https://www.backblaze.com/blog/chia-analysis-to-farm-or-not-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Overrides allow you to store local copies of remote scripts and override them when the page loads. This is great if you have, for example, a slow build process for your whole application and you want to try something out. It is also a great tool to replace annoying scripts from third party web sites without having to use a browser extension.&#34;Overrides are useful not just for &#34;developers&#34;.  Why is this option hidden away in &#34;Developer Tools&#34;.The biggest &#34;secret&#34; not mentioned here is keyboard navigation.  It is incredibly cumbersome to operate &#34;Developer Tools&#34; on a small form factor computer without a mouse.Here is one solution: In Chrome&#39;s, F12 to open Developer Tools, then Ctrl-P then type &#34;&gt;&#34;.Then can scroll all available commands using Up/Down or start typing and use autocomplete to search for commands.  Whether this is faster and more effective than pointing+clicking/tapping on tiny screen areas, ticking/unticking tiny check boxes and scrolling around in tiny menus is a question for the reader.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I loved every minute of my time working at Netflix.  Great, talented coworkers who I could constantly learn from, management chain from bottom to top of former engineers, so they understood when you would say, &#34;I worked on this for a week but have no results because it didn&#39;t work&#34;.  Plenty of resources to do what you needed to do, and lots of autonomy to do what you thought was right.  Very little process and upper management actively moved to eliminate what little process there was.  Unlimited vacation time that was real -- management took long vacations to set an example and would actively encourage everyone to do the same.  And of course a great paycheck which included 10%+ raises because they made sure that new people didn&#39;t make more than veterans.I&#39;ll be the first to admit it&#39;s not for everyone.  As they say, they are a sports team, not a family.  Perform well and be rewarded handsomely, perform poorly and get cut with a big check.  I personally thrived in that kind of environment, where you always have to keep proving your value.  But not everyone wants to work that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve never worked for a big famous tech firm, but I will absolutely tell you how I&#39;ve managed to avoid hating work for 30 years:Find a relatively small firm, still owner-run and controlled. Avoid public firms. A corporation cannot show loyalty, but a HUMAN can. A manager has no real control -- their manager can reverse them. When you work for the owner, you can trust things a bit more IF you&#39;re working for a trustworthy person.This means small. But it doesn&#39;t mean cheap. ;)That said, I&#39;ve probably left money on the table working this way, and I&#39;ll never get IPO stock or similar, but stability and ethical behavior in a workplace go a LONG way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work for a small financial SaaS in Boston. 30-50 people. Nobody offshore. I&#39;ve worked here for 18 years and 11 months and a couple of days. Yes, we&#39;re hiring.The best thing about the company are the people who are already here. The basic hiring criteria are &#34;clever, competent and kind&#34;. That doesn&#39;t mean we never have disagreements, but they tend to be technical disagreements about the best approach to reach the same goal. Before the pandemic, and hopefully after it, the kitchen was the center of the company: casual questions turned into great discussions, explanations... there&#39;s a big whiteboard wall in the kitchen, and it got used a lot.That goal, incidentally, is to drive down the cost of good portfolio analysis until it&#39;s within everyone&#39;s reach. We&#39;re succeeding: there are clients who have programs where people start their investments with $50/week.Our folks are reasonably diverse in terms of background and talents. There&#39;s a robust co-op program. The benefits are pretty good -- fully paid health care premiums -- but it&#39;s definitely the people that make it great."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just finished my latest project, building a CNC-machine from scratch using an Arduino Uno, GRBL and 40x 3d-printed parts. It’s able to mill wood and aluminium, up to ~20mm thick.As with all my other projects, I think they should be executed in the open where other people can learn from my mistakes and get inspired to build their own things! Therefore I’ve spend a lot of time writing a free complete tutorial of the build, documenting every step with text and detailed images, creating a complete bill of materials (including STL-files for the 3d-printed parts) etc. I don’t want any dependencies on DIY-websites, so I’ve hosted it on GitHub, where anyone can clone it locally.I built this machine to gain more knowledge about mechanical engineering, electrical wiring, stepper motors, GRBL, CAD, CAM etc. Also, I guess I can build new fun things with the machine? Overly-engineered birdhouses maybe?Setup:* It’s running on an Arduino Uno, CNC-shield and GRBL.* 40 parts are 3d-printed (all the red parts in the video)* It’s based on Ivan Miranda’s blueprints, but I’ve adjusted some parts and structured the bill of materials.* It uses 2x 19:1 geared NEMA17 stepper motors for the Y-axis and 1x for the X-axis. The Z-axis is using a standard NEMA17 motor.* HTD5M belts and pulleys are used for X-axis and Y-axis. GT2 belt and pulleys are used for the Z-axis.If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone have suggestions for making a CNC mill that&#39;s quiet enough to run in my apartment?  I&#39;m thinking about getting one of the cheap $250 Aliexpress specials (I only want to mill PCBs), but I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s going to be too loud to run in a building where other people live.  If I can make some performance tradeoff for relative quietness, I&#39;d love to do it.(Maybe it&#39;s as simple as putting it in a foam enclosure or something?  That sounds bad for spindle cooling, though.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d love to have an open source CNC machine to design joinery with http://ma-la.com/tsugite.html
Ideally a whole house and most of the furniture...If anyone has any ideas on how to accelerate build times of open hardware, that&#39;s something I&#39;m trying to solve. Creating high quality instructionals is a huge amount of work and I think instructionals should be automatically generated by computer vision and have interactable elements, ideally AR, but even just highlighting wiring diagrams on hovering would be hugely helpful. Even if things are well documented, replication is still insanely pyrrhic without economy of scale or universal fabrication. It&#39;s time consuming because it&#39;s hard to replicate knowledge/tool environments quickly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This bit really caught my attention:&gt; In contrast, this website runs on an off-the-grid solar power system with its own energy storage, and will go off-line during longer periods of cloudy weather. Less than 100% reliability is essential for the sustainability of an off-the-grid solar system, because above a certain threshold the fossil fuel energy used for producing and replacing the batteries is higher than the fossil fuel energy saved by the solar panels.This, in particular, is an amazing take:&gt; Less than 100% reliability is essential for the sustainability of an off-the-grid solar systemSaying that sacrificing uptime is a good thing for achieving a particular goal is a take that&#39;s so wildly out of line with what most of the industry believes is refreshing, because it really makes you think. What would the world look like, if instead of being obsessed with SRE we simply assumed or accepted that there will be downtime, and treated it like something perfectly normal. Maybe a nice message at ingress/load balancer level, telling everyone that the site will be back in a bit.I have no illusions that any company would want something like that, or that it&#39;s even feasible for many industries, e.g. healthcare, though the Latvian &#34;e-health&#34; system is an accidental experiment of this at the cost of around 15 million euros of taxpayer money: https://www-lsm-lv.translate.goog/raksts/zinas/latvija/par-e... .However, if companies have working hours, why couldn&#39;t websites? What a funny thought.Edit: on an unrelated note, it&#39;s wild how different setups can be.For example:&gt; The web server uses between 1 and 2.5 watts of power...While at the same time, i have two servers with 200GEs (essentially consumer hardware) running in my homelab, with a TDP of 35W each, though with the UPS and its inefficiencies, as well as the 4G router, the total energy consumption that i have to deal with is around 100W. Granted, i also use them for backups and as CI nodes, but there&#39;s still a difference of 20 - 50 times more power usage between one of my servers and one of theirs. I guess one can definitely talk about the differences between x86 and ARM there as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As they describe being open to ideas and feedback: maybe using static compression could help. The concept is to pre-compress files (have foo.html.gz available next to foo.html) so that the web server does not have to compress on-the-fly. nginx supports it[0] and gzip_static does not appear in their nginx config[1].It might not make a difference if nginx has a in-RAM cache of the compressed files. Otherwise, it has the potential to be pretty significant assuming most requests are made using &#34;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#34; and assuming the web server does not prefer other compression algorithms (eg. Brotli).[0]: https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_static_module.h...[1]: https://homebrewserver.club/low-tech-website-howto.html#full..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The amount of energy wasted due to poor caching strategies alone could power small countries. Made far worse by the current trend to maximize code readability and organization by using as many dependencies as humanly possible for even the simplest of tasks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The way the last administration rolled this out was certainly with a political narrative, but my guess is it originated with people that weren&#39;t thinking at all about politics.The simple story is that core infrastructure is of strategic national importance, and an elevated risk that infrastructure is compromised can never be worth whatever the benefits are of using a particular supplier&#39;s equipment.  There is no practical way to 100% ensure that every piece of software, and every chip, in every piece of equipment is clean.  Chips are especially scary (the push to have domestic chip fab by the US and other countries is about more than just supply chain).This is true when it comes from what are considered trustworthy suppliers as well, but you&#39;re dealing with probabilities.  I think that regardless of whether this move fits into a political narrative about China, or &#34;economic warfare&#34;, the practical basis is that for some types of equipment, the risk is just too large and the ability to mitigate too limited, in general.Unfortunately this was figured out with Huawei/ZTE after the fact, but tbh I don&#39;t think the specific company matters at all, it just happened to be they were in this business at the time &amp; based in the wrong country."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ANSSI, the French agency for information systems security, has severely tightened authorizations for vital infrastructure. Though Huawei is still kosher in many network functions, French telcos have had to remove a few thousand nodes they had already deployed, especially in network cores. All authorizations are temporary - between three and eight years.This is not just about security in a narrow definition, but in a large part about ensuring that mastery of strategic functions remains with European firms.Like armaments, telecommunication infrastructures are not a normal market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I could put on my conspiracy hat... Perhaps this is related to Canada&#39;s detention of he Huawei executive. Someone put their foot down and said Chinese hardware is spying on us, and perhaps they forced China to give up how.At it&#39;s core, the world absolutely cannot trust China. Because Huawei is a de facto company owned by the Chinese government, it stands to reason that the distrust must be extended to Huawei. The product may be good, but China has very little credibility anymore, and should absolutely not be trusted."</p>
