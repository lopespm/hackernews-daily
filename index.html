								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, there&#39;s a lot to be said about Hitler and fascism and propaganda and all the other fascinating topics Orwell brings up here, but I&#39;d just like to point out how routinely excellent Orwell&#39;s analysis is.  Of course I mostly see the best bits brought out and dusted off, no doubt he did mediocre stuff as well, but it is worth noticing how often it turns out that Orwell, nearly a century on, still has plenty in his writing worth revisiting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Probably, in Hitler&#39;s own mind, the Russo-German Pact represents no more than an alteration of time-table. The plan laid down in Mein Kampf was to smash Russia first, with the implied intention of smashing England afterwards. Now, as it has turned out, England has got to be dealt with first, because Russia was the more easily bribed of the two. But Russia&#39;s turn will come when England is out of the picture—that, no doubt, is how Hitler sees it.Unsurprisingly, Orwell here was wonderfully prescient, even as many contemporaries failed to see that this exact plan was the case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Haha, I don&#39;t know how folks found this, but I actually did make it for a real-world use case. While doing large-scale builds of debian packages [1], occasionally I&#39;d have parts of the build process hang (usually some test that I didn&#39;t care about). I didn&#39;t want the whole build to fail, so I needed some way to kill the process but have it return 0 so that make and friends wouldn&#39;t think anything was amiss.Also, credit where credit is due -- the original idea was suggested to me by Kyle Huey: https://twitter.com/moyix/status/1484342467205816325[1] https://moyix.blogspot.com/2022/02/on-building-30k-debian-pa..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Markdown is severely limiting for prose and blogging though and leads to unsemantic element abuse or having to do a lot of manual HTML markup (which with no controls over styles means you’re limited further). There aren’t good conventions for a lot of ‘normal’ concepts like admonitions, figures, definition lists, citing blockquotes, footnotes, table of contents, etc.Another red flag to me is supporting GitHub-flavored Markdown over CommonMark which actually tries to follow good standards practice for everyone. Instead projects like Pandoc have to work hard on alternative parsers because GitHub does whatever it wants with little regard for CommonMark&#39;s RFC, and in some cases, even basic semantic HMTL."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangent but I was always annoyed at how poorly google products work offline. One time I was using google maps to navigate to a remote address. Once I got close to the address google maps crashed and I re-opened the app. I had no cellular service. The app remembered the actual map data but did not remember the address I had just typed in to the program 15 minutes earlier. I had to guess what street address I was heading to! Why they designed the app to store all search history exclusively in the cloud and not keep a local copy is beyond me, but I presume when working at google they always have an excellent connection and hadn’t thought of what would happen if a user lost service. Being able to at least see the search history would have saved me some grief!"</p>

Very short and concise book- extremely well-written with a personality. Requires basic CS math.3. Algorithm Design Manual by Skeina. Extremely approachable as well. Has &#39;battle stories&#39; of algorithm usage. Good for self-learners. Links to problems in Leetcode is given.4. CLRS is of course nice for a mathematically rigorous study."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One practice that&#39;s helped me is to always cancel immediately, which translates to only paying for one month. Ie. for spotify, netflix pay for the subscription, immediately jump through the hoops to cancel.Forgetfulness turns into money savings, and as a bonus I get to review whether I am getting much out of it. Especially for tv like disney/netflix/apple tv, I often run though everything interesting and don&#39;t have much else to watch with them.Also psychologically there&#39;s resistance to a boring to do that involves loss. I will put off &#34;go to netflix and figure out how to cancel.&#34; So do that work when you are excited to see the new show."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it typical to spend so much on software subscriptions? I pay for Spotify and a cheap VPS if that counts but that&#39;s it. I figured the average person probably has one or two media subscriptions (Netflix, Disney, Spotify, etc) and nothing else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I think may be underrated by many:We cancelled Amazon Prime, and besides the annual fee, we noticed that our household retail spending went down significantly. It turns out that when it takes more than 1-click to buy stuff… we buy less stuff.As far as convenience, one of the reasons we felt it was time to cancel is that we can just as easily get almost anything we wanted from Amazon direct from the seller or via Target/Best Buy/B&amp;N/B&amp;H. Surprisingly, this is often cheaper than Amazon (and almost never more expensive). While there’s a bit of added friction to think for two seconds which store to check, the benefit of fewer impulse buys seems worth it. Plus, we haven’t ended up with any crappy knockoffs since we bailed on Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The censoring is so horrible that Chinese are using other country&#39;s name to substitute China. For example, there is a question in Zhihu, &#34;Will China become the next technological powerhouse?&#34;. The answer is talking about Russia literally, but it&#39;s about China. (Below is the answer translated by deepl).I don&#39;t want to talk about China, I want to talk about Russia.Can Russia become the next technological powerhouse? Of course not.Because the ceiling of Russian intelligence or wisdom is Putin. There is no one in Russia who can claim to be more intelligent than Putin. Russia can do without anyone, but not without Putin. Although we do not know whether Putin has any relevant qualifications or experience in the industry, all Russian businesses and professions depend on Putin&#39;s guidance and must hold up Putin&#39;s ideas and banners, otherwise they will not be able to move forward. Putin is the ceiling of Russia. How can a country with a ceiling become a technological powerhouse?Look at the United States. Who dares to direct the work of Musk, whether Trump or Biden? Who dares to direct the business strategies of Apple and Google? I find that in the US, it seems that anyone can say they are smarter than the president, it seems that anyone can say they are smarter than the president. The technology companies in the US seem to be able to run smoothly without the guidance of Biden&#39;s ideas, and they seem to be able to develop technology without raising the banner of Biden&#39;s ideas, and they seem to be doing quite well. I find that the US is a country that has no ceiling in terms of intelligence or ingenuity, and that is always improving. Only such a country can become a technological powerhouse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The linked story kind of buries the context info:&gt; Nomura said the refusal to pay mortgages stems from the widespread practice in China of selling homes before they’re built. Funds from presales are kept in escrow accounts to use for construction. But confidence that projects will be completed has weakened as developers’ cash woes intensified.&gt; “Inappropriate usage of presale proceeds and the lack of adequate supervision of escrow accounts by local regulators and banks are likely associated with these mortgage suspension cases,” Zerlina Zeng, a senior analyst at CreditSights, wrote in a note."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The background for this is that most existing UI toolkits are a poor fit for Rust.Rust doesn&#39;t like having shared mutable state, but event-based UIs have a global event loop and can mutate anything at any time.Rust works best with strictly tree-shaped data structures, but event handlers turn trees of widgets into arbitrary webs with possibility of circular references.Rust prefers everything thread-safe, but many UI toolkits can&#39;t even be touched from a &#34;non-main&#34; thread.Rust&#39;s object-oriented programming features are pretty shallow, and Rust doesn&#39;t have inheritance. That makes it awkward to model most toolkits that have deep hierarchies with a base View type and a dozen of Button subclasses.So instead of retrofitting mutable single-threaded OOP to a functional multi-threaded language, there&#39;s a quest to find another approach for UIs. This change of approach has worked for games. Rust wasn&#39;t nice for &#34;class Player extends Entity&#34; design, but turned out to be a great fit the ECS pattern."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the web really killed the idea of &#34;native&#34; widgets. I think the rise of web apps just got everyone used to the idea that controls are just going to look different everywhere. Even on macOS, practically every app I use has a very distinct look and set of widgets (vscode, photoshop, blender, spotify -- two of those are electron, but even the non-electron stuff doesn&#39;t look very much like a &#34;mac&#34; app anymore). And in windows, microsoft really killed it themselves by constantly updating their own apps with non-standard widgets that everyone else wanted to clone (I remember the longest time it seemed like the only new things of note in every new version of ms office was how the toolbars looked). I suppose it&#39;s not a terrible thing, but I do kinda miss the days of windows 2000 and classic macos where the platform had a (somewhat) uniform look and feel."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On macOS ... going forward, it’s likely that new capabilities and evolutions of the design language will be provided for the latter [SwiftUI] but not the former [AppKit].I think this is vastly over-stating the technical churn of UI development on macOS.While we&#39;re definitely seeing new UI toolkits introduced that are Swift-only (like the new Charts.framework[0]), nearly every Mac app Apple ships is written using AppKit.  For example, I just verified (`otool -l PATH_TO_APP_BINARY`) that Mail, App Store, Notes, Music, Xcode[1], and Photos all link against AppKit, and none link against SwiftUI (on macOS 12.4 21F79, which I&#39;m running).There is, in my opinion, approximately zero chance that Apple either:(A) rewrites all of the UI in all of their apps, replacing AppKit with SwiftUI, in even the medium-term, or(B) starts treating AppKit apps as second-class citizens by introducing a new design language only available from SwiftUI.Yes, we&#39;re going to keep seeing cool new widgets and features which are only available from Swift.  No, the platform&#39;s design language is not going change in a way that makes AppKit apps obsolete.[0]https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Charts[1]I bet Xcode links SwiftUI somewhere for IDE integration, but I&#39;m specifically referring to the UI implementation, parts of which have been in development since, like, NeXTSTEP and are certainly built using Objective-C &amp; AppKit."</p>

How is it Amazon&#39;s business what their grown-ass employees can or cannot sign?&gt; By signing a card or filling out an online authorization form, you are providing the ALU your personal information.Like Amazon monitoring my spending habits?&gt; By signing a card or filling out an online authorization form, you are authorizing the ALU to speak on your behalf.And thats terrible how?&gt; The ALU is not part of Amazon and does not represent AmazonThats the whole point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Realistically an Amazon-wide union is the only way Amazon workers are going to get decent wage increases.  If the USA is going to allow manufacturers to outsource the majority of well-paid (~$30/hr avg) manufacturing jobs to Mexico and China, without having any cross-border capital flow penalities (neoliberal globalism in a nutshell), then the major employers like Amazon and Walmart are going to have to double their wages.Yes, that means less for the executives and shareholders.  They may have to sell some of their properties, oh dear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People nowadays have no memory of the decades of struggle, sacrifice to win the rights we currently have. Unions are the most effective tool the working class has to affect change where they spend a majority of their waking life. No wonder why its demonized at every possible instance."</p>
