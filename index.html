Things people on the internet inclusive but not limited to HN said they will never come back because the future is USB-C.Now I just want to know if the new keyboard has more key travel distance back to the like of MacBook Pro 2015.In case anyone wants to know the thickness difference.MacBook Pro 13&#34; 2015  - 1.8 cmMacBook Pro 13&#34; 2016  - 1.49 / 1.55 cmMacBook Pro 14&#34; / 16&#34;  2021  - 1.55 / 1.66cmSo basically even the new 16&#34; is still thinner than the MacBook 2015 era. Which I think vast majority of people were happy with.Edit: Both 14&#34; and 16&#34; have 254 PPI, up from ~220. Apple tends to stick with same PPI for a very long time. So this is interesting. 3456-by-2234 or 3024-by-1964 is 14:9 Ratio. So somewhere in between the old 16:10 and 3:2 which is current trend of Lenovo and Surface Laptop."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These look positively insane. 120Hz HDR displays. Can be specced with up to 64 GB of RAM and a GPU that (apparently) matches a 3070. All the ports you could ever want and magsafe. I can&#39;t wait to get my hands on one.The notch doesn&#39;t bother me because it&#39;s literally more room on the screen. Laptops with the camera below the screen tend to have an uncomfortable angle that look sup your nose, and the design suggests that they may be adding Face ID in a future iteration."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is about the processors, not the laptops, so commenting on the chips instead. They look great, but they look like they&#39;re the M1 design, just more of it. Which is plenty for a laptop! But it&#39;ll be interesting to see what they&#39;ll do for their desktops.Most of the additional chip area went into more GPUs and special-purpose video codec hardware. It&#39;s &#34;just&#34; two more cores than the vanilla M1, and some of the efficiency cores on the M1 became performance cores. So CPU-bound things like compiling code will be &#34;only&#34; 20-50% faster than on the M1 MacBook. The big wins are for GPU-heavy and codec-heavy workloads.That makes sense since that&#39;s where most users will need their performance. I&#39;m still a bit sad that the era of &#34;general purpose computing&#34; where CPU can do all workloads is coming to an end.Nevertheless, impressive chips, I&#39;m very curious where they&#39;ll take it for the Mac Pro, and (hopefully) the iMac Pro."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Apple’s Commitment to the Environment&#34;&gt; Today, Apple is carbon neutral for global corporate operations, and by 2030, plans to have net-zero climate impact across the entire business, which includes manufacturing supply chains and all product life cycles. This also means that every chip Apple creates, from design to manufacturing, will be 100 percent carbon neutral.But what they won&#39;t do is put the chip in an expandable and repairable system so that you don&#39;t have to discard and replace it every few years.  This renders the carbon-neutrality of the chips meaningless.  It&#39;s not the chip, it&#39;s the packaging that is massively unfriendly to the environment, stupid."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good article, thanks for submiting!The challenge for AWS is one lots of incumbents have experienced: they created a market and it&#39;s economics 
and now they&#39;re being attacked by the next generation of market entrants who&#39;ve structured their businesses to _specifically_ attack those economics.What&#39;s interesting is that challenge can be a really big problem for incumbents, as those economics can form a core (very rigid) part of their operating model; it can make it VERY hard to address without fundamental (read: risky) change to a business. There aren&#39;t many examples of incumbent businesses doing it successfully, as it needs a kind of &#39;self-inflicted disruption&#39; that&#39;s very hard to do in large organisations where politics and empire building can make it difficult.If someone could do Managed NAT Gateway next I&#39;d appreciate it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; So while AWS has 17 ways to run containers and 7 ways to do async message processing, all overlapping and reinforcing and supporting each other, Cloudflare will tend toward introducing singular primitives, stuff them in a box, and try to ship those boxes to as many places as will possibly take them. If they could install Cloudflare on your mobile phone, they would (this gets them dangerously close to being a real life Pied Piper).I think this statement resonates with me the most - it feels a lot like how I prefer to design systems (ahem, thanks Unix!): simple pieces or types, chained together into systems that are easy to understand, maintain, and scale.We&#39;re still only using Cloudflare&#39;s workers and it&#39;s integration with caching, but it&#39;s getting close to the point where I&#39;d have enough primitives to ship some of the functionality of our system architecture to Cloudflare and gain a net-win for latency and simplicity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Minor quibbles about game remarks:Contrary to what the article claims, draws in chess are very common (on the other hand, they&#39;re exceedingly rare in Go, and often impossible due to fractional komi).Sente in Go does correspond to having the initiative, but a move that compels a player into a particular follow-up move should be called a &#34;kikashi&#34; (forcing move)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Shame what happened to Terrahash (previous owner of L0phtCrack). As someone who has purchased several Brutalis cracking rigs, those things were the most badass machines on the market.Looks like they sold and committed to a bunch of cracking rigs before sourcing enough GPUs right before prices skyrocketed, and were suddenly on the hook for a lot more than they could realistically pay for. Hopefully Jeremi manages to pull through. It&#39;s a fantastic company that makes a fantastic product. I&#39;d love to buy some new rigs when they get their supply chain issues figured out.https://terahash.com/letter-from-ceo"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I haven&#39;t thought about Mudge in a long time. If you&#39;ve ever worked cybersecurity for the government, or in general, you owe him, Brian Oblivion, Space Rogue and the other members of L0pht for opening the door. They were pioneers of responsible disclosure, and brought the problem to light when they testified to Congress in 98 that in 30 minutes they could shut down the Internet. He and the others had uncovered DoS, specifically a BGP DoS that would automatically cascade across the Internet.Mudge was a musical prodigy and an alum of BBN, one of the key players in creating ARPAnet. His bio is fascinating, and you can find a good treatment of it here: https://www.cybersecurityeducationguides.org/peiter-zatko/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;From now on I will stay 100% with Vimeo but, as we know, they have a fraction of the viewership of You Tube – primarily because so few people know they even exist.Websurfer awareness is not the primary reason Vimeo has less viewership.The cause &amp; effect before the buildup of awareness is the incentives that prevent content creators to upload videos to Vimeo in the first place:- platform membership fees:  Youtube is $0 to upload and host, Vimeo used to be $240 and now has some new pricing plans[1] with a low-use free tier (too limited for high-res 4k uploads)- no advertising partners : Youtube enables monetization without content creators asking audiences to pay for subscriptions.  This financial model covers a wide variety of videos especially for unknown creators.The financial model of Vimeo is fine but its inherent costs will keep it smaller than Youtube because both the uploaders and the viewers don&#39;t want to pay.[1] https://vimeo.com/upgrade"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"YouTube seems to have three main priorities with their copyright system:1) Eliminate legal liability and risk of lawsuits. Technically all they need to do is comply with DMCA requests, but YouTube would rather not be sued by a major record company or film studio, even if they could win the case.2) Become friendly with major content creators (record and film labels, television studios). YouTube wants a good working relationship with these companies, to ensure that these companies post their content on YouTube. YouTube really wants the views they get by hosting SNL clips and Beyonce music videos.3) Actually help the independent content creators deal with copyright claims. This is a very, very distant third.Because of these priorities, YouTube has decided their best course of action is to offload all of the work on copyright claims onto the independent content creators, in order to keep the big media giants happy. After all, NBC doesn&#39;t need YouTube, but a solo channel with 50k subscribers absolutely does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Guilty until proven innocent&#34; is exactly how &#34;DMCA safe harbor&#34; is designed.Basically, YouTube as a content host, would actively, promptly and sometimes aggressively, respond to the &#34;potential&#34; copyright owner&#39;s requests, in exchange of keeping themselves away from lawsuit.This way, they don&#39;t need to pre-screen the content upon the uploading, because it&#39;s up to the copyright owner to find the illegal content and report (YouTube still do that in some degree with content-ID, though).There will be false-positives, there will be false claims, but they choose to play it safe.Just to make it clear: this whole system is fucked up, and how &#34;aggressive&#34; the host needs to be is a nuance that all parties involved will have dramatically different views. I just feel like lots of people don&#39;t understand the principle of DMCA safe harbor concept. It is the consequence of current copyright law; without it, user-generated content hosts can&#39;t survive the legal trouble (or they can, but would need significant more legal resources)."</p>

They are worthless.It compares a recent Stanford grad from a wealthy family to a 55-year-old who was scraping through the first 35-40 years of life, but now makes $190k/yr as a successful tradesman during boom time. The former will count as &#34;poor&#34; and the latter will count as &#34;top 10%&#34;.In other words, no, it&#39;s not comparing Americans of different classes. It&#39;s comparing Americans at different stages of life. Or just the ebb and flow of income over and individual&#39;s life (selling a house even in a modest area can easily put you into the top 10% for a year).You need to follow individuals over their lives to get a better picture of who is struggling and who is thriving."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"MuJoCo is the standard in much of robotics, and recently in the Deep RL space.When I was learning Deep RL, I edged on what could be done through OpenAI gym, or self-made environments, I decided to begin working with MuJoCo.But for an undergrad student from a developing country, the fees were extremely high.So, I just didn&#39;t go forward with Deep RL much. I dabbled for a while and tried using PyBullet. Did not go that well.Also thought about creating custom environments in Unity and then apply Deep RL in there. But it took too much effort.Creating a complex enough environment and getting used to it were, in themselves- full projects that took long term commitment.As a result, I did not learn much Deep RL to be able to apply it to complex, real-world-like scenarios.I think that it is going to change.I am excited about books, blogs, and videos that are going to be created as MuJoCo is open-sourced and available for free.I, personally, will get back into Deep RL the next opportunity I get."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tend to be more than a little skeptical of organizations like DeepMind and (especially) OpenAI lately, when it comes to their pledges to democratize their advances in AI/ML/robotics. This, however, is 100% a great move by DeepMind in the support of the community as a whole. Kudos to the team, and a big thanks as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The demo object that turns itself over is nice.I used to use a rattleback as a test back when I was working on accurate but slow physics engines in the 1990s.  That&#39;s an ellipsoid cut by a plane that isn&#39;t axis-aligned. You spin it, and it spins, stops, rocks, and spins a bit in the other direction.  Very similar to what they&#39;re doing.The key to this is a multi-point contact model. If your contacts are single points, the frictional effects are wrong. It&#39;s not that hard to do this. I held a patent on that (#6,067,096), and there was a product called Falling Bodies, the first ragdoll system that really worked.It was just too early in the 1990s. 100 MIPS was not enough."</p>
