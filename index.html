I mean...Joking aside, the text is amazingly blunt and honest, in a rather refreshing way.  &#34;The French don&#39;t bathe.&#34;


  The French don&#39;t bathe often enough. They can&#39;t. They don&#39;t have real soap. (...) The Germans took the soap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic read!Via the French Wikipedia page about this booklet [0], I learned that the probable author is Leo Rosten, author of “The Joys of Yiddish” [1]..!That makes sense as “Joys” is an incredibly funny and witty read on the interplays between Yiddish and English in the US. Much recommendedFrom Rosten’s Wikipedia page [2]:—In his book, The Joys of Yiddish, he defines the word chutzpah as &#34;that quality enshrined in a man who, having killed his mother and father, throws himself on the mercy of the court because he is an orphan.&#34;—-[0] https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nos_amis_les_Français(Funnily, the booklet’s title was translated to “Our friends the French”)[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Joys_of_Yiddish[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leo_Rosten"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fakespot is one of the more atrocious extensions when it comes to data collection. It sends everything you look at, everything you add to cart, while you are logged out of everything it will also persistently track your viewed items with a unique identifier. I understand that the below may be in PP/ToS but come on, a normal user will not.It does a lot of things completely opaque to the normal end user that are well above a &#34;please tell me if item X&#39;s reviews are good or bad&#34; - it practically sends Fakespot almost every single page interaction or click that you do on an Amazon property.It does the same on every other site it supports - whether or not you want your item inspected, it will notify Fakespot about what products you viewed, what browser, what you clicked on, Add to Cart or Buy Now clicks, Sort clicks, every product visible on page (by ID and seller).They also use the same unique session identifier across sites, so items you look at on eBay/Walmart/etc can be tied to the same person as items viewed on Amazon. If you choose to try to opt out of automatic item detection, that choice is also sent back to their servers (where it then returns a 4xx and tells you to sign up or sign in to fakespot with an account to save settings).The extension itself is many megabytes of heavily packed and obfuscated JS. If you have it installed, I would recommend not doing so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is everyone here just blaming Amazon? Of course they&#39;re going to ask Apple to do this. It&#39;s in their own self-interest.The more interesting questions is, why is Apple complying? Are they afraid that Amazon will retaliate by pulling their apps out of the App Store? If so, are they really just going to keep prioritizing big tech connections in favor of it&#39;s own customers?The rule cited is so vague that even a basic paid browser app would break it. All the app does is augment data available from any web browser with other data.&gt; 5.2.2 Third-Party Sites/Services: If your app uses, accesses, monetizes access to, or displays content from a third-party service, ensure that you are specifically permitted to do so under the service’s terms of use. Authorization must be provided upon request."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is so depressing. Fakespot is an amazing app, I never buy anything off of Amazon without using it. Actions like this caused me to trust Amazon significantly less."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"EIP 1559 is a substantial change to the handling of gas fees on the network. In addition to making gas fees be 2 parts (base and &#34;priority&#34; fees), this includes a provision for &#34;burning&#34; the base fee, reducing the overall ETH supply. From the code itself:  # miner only receives the priority fee; note that the base fee is not given to anyone (it is burned)

Models i have seen suggest this will not make ETH deflationary, as the expected burn rates are outpaced by expected mining rates, but the proposal does specifically make note of this[1].1: https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1559#eth-burn-precludes-f..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Will the miners accept 1559? It’s an optional space, miners are free to maintain the old chain and split. Of course this would be catastrophic. I know my history, this isn’t anything like the other times."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand some of the upgrades going into the London fork, including EIP-1559, but I don&#39;t understand &#34;the merge&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite book for learning SQL is “The Art of PostgreSQL”. https://theartofpostgresql.com/I found the combination of real-world problems, general SQL advice, and the broad range of topics to be a really good book. It took my SQL from “the database is not much more than a place to persist application data” to “the application is not much more than a way to match commands to the database”. It’s amazing how much bespoke code is doing a job the database can do for you in a couple of lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SQL is both slightly ugly (which I attribute to the historical decision to use natural language words instead of the mathematical symbols of the relational algebra notation - the symbols make the expressions more readable once you learn them) and very beautiful. I&#39;m sad most of the people have forgotten it and prefer to use ORMs today. Most often (except when coding a stupid low-feature phonebook/todolist tutorial) it seems to me writing SQL queries manually is a way more efficient (not only in terms of execution speed but also for  developing) solution than using an ORM, except you have to have some fluency in SQL which the most of the today coders seem to lack. Designing a normalized entity-relation model as well as writing the queries for it also feels great, very satisfying."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised, no one mentioned https://www.sql-ex.ru/
It has few hundred graded SQL exercises (some of them are very hard) + there is a book http://www.sql-tutorial.ru/ that goes over most common errors from submissions. On top of that, there are competition problems with the leaderboard.
On top of that, I highly advise everyone to read T-SQL Fundamentals, by Itzik Ben-Gan (and few other books by same author) and do the all exercises in the book."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love that there&#39;s a &#34;technology will fix things&#34; model. This assumes we&#39;ll discover some magical bullet, that we haven&#39;t thought of, that will counteract erosion of topsoil, water shortages, and climate change. Another implicit assumption is that we&#39;ll be able to move forward unilaterally with such a solution, instead of it becoming a political football until it&#39;s too late to do anything, like climate change. A lot of modern democratic republics are about 200 years old, or less, but we keep thinking to ourselves, &#34;this civilization will be different&#34;.I&#39;d put money on BAU2 over CT any day of the week."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was an undergrad I discovered blogs about peak oil, the limits to the growth, and Turchin’s cliometrics. As an adolescent I really enjoyed Asimov’s Foundation and all of this knowledge resonated with me.I had a fried who read Von Mises’ Human Action and he labeled me as a neo-Malthusian . And, according to his “school of thought”, my understanding of the world and economics incorrect. We had many interesting discussions about what we thought we knew.Now I’m in my 30s and my thought has changed drastically. I believe that reductionist (materialistic) approaches to analyze human endeavor are misguided. There is a bit of hubris in thinking that a computer simulation can predict the entirety of human action. I am definitely not suscribed to the Austrian school of thought, however."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting. My stack ranking of unethical tech companies would have Twitter at the very top. None of the others have caused as much societal harm as Twitter. I saw research recently that as much as half of all trending topics in Turkey were manufactured by malicious actors to spread propaganda. Also, it&#39;s just an endless pit of addictive negativity. I once had a girlfriend who would browser Twitter for hours on end and was perpetually angry. Not a good way to live.Google, on the other hand, has a bunch of products like Maps, Drive, Docs, and Meet that are legitimately helpful and useful. I would have no ethical qualms about helping to make Docs better. This is not to say Google is an ethical company in the aggregate, but there are certainly a lot of roles you could take there that would not require you to question your morality every time you start a new task."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;Maybe we were just a bit naive,&#34; Cornet said.They likely were, and think of me what you like but I&#39;ve noticed the same with most Americans I&#39;ve known. Not sure why that is but apparently there&#39;s some good amount of propaganda going on in the USA and people apparently believe it. Meanwhile people have to pay $5000 after an ambulance picks them up. Or $90000 for semi-trivial medical procedures.I believe asking yourself &#34;is my country really like I believe it is?&#34; is a good food for thought even it&#39;s a bit sideways to this here topic at hand.--On topic:I can sympathize with the author. I know what it is to have been a long time in a company; it becomes much more than a workplace. You have friends, you even have people you invite to your Sunday barbecues. It&#39;s also very likely that a number of internal processes are going smoother for you because you know whom to ping and what exactly to write in a form so your stuff gets done quicker. You have job stability and unless you are rocking the boat too much your seat is likely 99% safe.All of those become true stoppers when you start pondering leaving. They pull you back and make you doubt yourself and your idea of switching company.But unlike a number of commenters here I find nothing hypocritical about the decision to go to Twitter. We don&#39;t know how Twitter operates internally; maybe it&#39;s still better than Google. Or maybe they are still after FAANG level of wages so are ready to make some ethical compromises for them?In any case, immediately discounting somebody&#39;s opinion on a corporation because they joined another corporation misses a lot of context, is flamey and non-constructive and almost smells like a paid troll, and is something I don&#39;t expect HN to condone. But sadly, here we go, it&#39;s the top comment here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems to me the author&#39;s divergence of views may be due to his increasing focus on politics, with a particular orientation that explicitly shows through the comics. It may just be a reflection of what&#39;s happening at scale in Silicon Valley&#39;s tech world, a movement which Twitter, which the author joined most likely not coincidentally, is at the forefront of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had trouble finding a good FI planning and simulation tool that could model things in enough detail to finally ditch my spreadsheets... so I decided to build one: ProjectiFihttps://projectifi.io/A while back I posted a very early version here (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26969173), and just released a major overhaul with loads of new features and enhancements, many inspired by the initial HN commentary:- Monte Carlo mode with customizable simulations, variables, probability distributions- Backtesting on historical data- Multiple data persistence options for subscribers: cloud synchronization, localStorage only, or manual import/export- Stock/bond allocation curve over time- Improved support for international use cases (currency + locale selector, custom options and contribution limits for financial goals)- Ability to quickly switch between deterministic and probabilistic modes- Many new event types to model a broader range of scenarios- Better support for married filing jointly / couples planning (perhaps still not perfect, but definitely better)- Redesigned landing page, additional UI improvements- And more!If you feel like checking it out, I would love to hear what you think. Most of the functionality is free, but for anyone interested in upgrading to Premium, you can use coupon code &#34;HN-15&#34; for 15% off all plans :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually have a draft open in gmail that i was meaning to send to you, so ill post it here instead :)I saw your initial release of this many months ago, tried it out, was like, ok thats kinda cool, put it down.But then recently i needed to do some serious life financial planning, remembered your tool, searched for the HN post and gave it a real go.... and WOW.  Im so impressed. It does exactly what i need; give me a semi-realistic long term plan of finances, retirement, how much house i can afford, effect of jobs, stocks, etc. Being able to play around with scenarios like &#34;what if one of us didnt work for a few years?&#34; really easily. I probably could do all this stuff on a spreadsheet, but the fiddly details of things like inflation, raises, tax, etc are incredibly tedious to model. theres a lot of near term budgeting type apps etc out there, but there was no other product i found that works so well for long term macro stuff. So its well worth the premium subscription fee to me, on a time saved basis alone.The UI/X is mostly great(ill email you some minor suggestions :) ), and your development velocity is really impressive.Perhaps the total market for a tool like this is niche, but hopefully it turns into a profitable enough endeavor for you so you can keep working on it forever :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI, this appears to be a startup launching an e-mail signup for a product that isn&#39;t available yet. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but it&#39;s worth noting up front. There is no download link and the GitHub link goes to an issues-only repo with no code.There are several fast Rust-based, GPU-accelerated terminal projects that are open source and under active development:Alacritty: https://github.com/alacritty/alacrittyWezterm: https://github.com/wez/weztermFig ( https://fig.io/ ) isn&#39;t Rust, but it&#39;s worth noting as a YC-backed competitor terminal product that has autocomplete similar to Warp.dev.

Even if they do it terribly, I doubt they&#39;ll make anything worse.  It&#39;s also a region with no economic future, so hopefully this brings some jobs.  This will be interesting to watch, I&#39;m hopeful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing to note - the headline of the article itself is incorrect. It says &#34;GM Will Suck Lithium From the Salton Sea&#34; In fact the lithium is being extracted from brine thousands of feet below the Salton Sea, as is stated in the article itself. Also GM is not doing the work, they signed an agreement with another company that is actually doing it. HN reworded headline is better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find that area geologically fascinating.  It&#39;s one of the few above-water rift zones in the world.  According to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salton_Trough the sediment fills it in as quickly as it sinks, so you have sediment in some areas going down 20,000 feet.The earthquakes seem to come in swarms out there, which I think is a result of the pulling apart.  In a thrust fault or strike-slip fault, you have a release of energy and while the stress is transferred somewhere else, that seems to be the end of the movement.  When you pull two plates apart, you create a gap and the stuff above it sort of settles down into the gap, probably causing the successive earthquakes as it all settles into the new position.I really wish we had a canal to the Salton Sea.  Having a new inland port and a source of fresher water would dramatically change the area."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Part of my job is to help the executives that I report to understand why things went wrong from the security perspective in our business unit. These are purely internal discussions, not even investigations. There are no penalties, but really, for things as egregious as hard coded passwords. As will become clear in a moment, the fact that my executives care is quite unusual.Culturally the result is coverups and lies.Engineers lie, managers lie, test people lie, directors lie, senior directors lie, vice president lie, external interesting teams are negotiated into minimizing certain critical failures, and so on. Managers don’t want to hear it so that they can’t be accused of lying, vice presidents don’t wanna know, SVP’s just want green squares on the cross-BU PowerPoint.This is internal discussion of revenue impacting incidents. Do you know what executives do care about? Revenue. Lost deals. If the people who care about money, including the account teams, don’t care about security and severe quality issues enough to be honest enough to get to improvement, how could an external board accomplish anything for those very few incidents that actually become publicly visible?This isn’t like the NTSB; I spent my life reading NTSB accident reports. They have actual real authority, there are potentially issues that might impact someone more than being caught distorting things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In washington state, the state superior court ruled the police department was not liable for the impound fee paid by somebody who had their car impounded for 90* days for driving on what the computer reported was a suspended license, because they are exempt from mistakes from trusting their own computer system.This was the second time the department had wrongfully impounded his car and they made no attempt to fix the mistake from the first time, this didn&#39;t impact the ruling.Its gonna get much worse before it get any better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Washington State we have a system to track cannabis, the enforcement officers are supposed to be able to get reports from this system.  The system is super buggy and also doesn&#39;t have meaningful reports.  So there is a secondary system for officers to export to Excel documents.  In one of the trainings they&#39;ve been instructed to look for anomalies -- not real analisys, not even a pivot table.  One thing they find is &#34;negative quantities&#34; -- but how can that be? (hint: it&#39;s bugs in the tracking software).  Then enforcement shows up at the cannabis business to audit these negative numbers (or demand the business try to correct the data (which they cannot due to bugs)).So, crappy software gets law enforcement officers to basically review data &#34;anomalies&#34; created by bugs by visiting a business. The second most expensive method for data sanatization I can imagine.  It&#39;s a poor use of their time and disruptive to the business.The system in WA is so buggy that the agency has opted to freeze the software rather than try to fix the issues.  The future of government software is bleak -- so long as they keep using closed source packages from low-cost bidders."</p>
