								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I went to college, having already done full-time software work and countless hours of programming in my spare time, I went to a departmental advisor confidently requesting to test out of the introductory CS classes aimed at first-time programmers. I nearly got laughed out of the room. I pushed the department on this, but it was clear: they simply did not do this. Everyone takes intro to CS. Everyone.It sucks, but there are people out there no smarter than you yet more powerful, and sometimes they impose a speed limit.If you get the opportunity though, I&#39;d still suggest doing what the author did. No harm in learning something twice, particularly from two different perspectives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is good advice to be taken sparingly. I went through the US Navy Nuclear program in which &#34;no speed limit&#34; was taken for granted. I never stopped operating that way until, one day, I had a mental health breakdown (I lasted about ten years). It took two years of therapy to deprogram that mentality from my mind.So yes, it can get you far, but there is a cost to be considered if you don&#39;t keep it under control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read this article a while ago and recently re-listened to his interview on Tim Ferriss&#39; podcast: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gnk4sgOFjBQ He talks about how maniacal he was at practicing music at a young age. His friends gave him a hard time because all he wanted to do was practice scales over and over. The dude was exceptionally motivated from a very early age.The gist of this blog post is that the average pace is for chumps and that he was able to finish Berkelee school of music in much less time than the average person takes thanks to studying ahead of time with a mentor and reading the books and testing out. He wasn&#39;t a &#39;chump&#39; and the lesson is that you shouldn&#39;t be either.I remember reading this advice 10 years ago and really taking it to heart. I didn&#39;t want to be a chump afterall and became convinced I could do everything faster than the chumps. But the problem with this is that it can make you beat yourself up and/or always feel rushed if it does take you a normal amount of time to do something. Like I&#39;ve had to admit that I&#39;m a really slow programmer. It took me forever to learn it. And I beat myself up a lot in the process.But now I&#39;ve taken to listening to more Alain de botton and Oliver Burkeman for my self-help/self-development. These British authors advocate for a much gentler version of self help. In one Alain de botton interview, he mentioned how we&#39;ve come to worship exceptionalism and see being average as being bad. Oliver Burkeman&#39;s 4000 weeks book plainly states that you can&#39;t do it all. This has been super refreshing for someone like me who took Sivers&#39; stuff seriously in my early 20s and then beat myself up for merely being average at many things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried teaching high school CS for the best part of two years in a private school.  Everything to do with the pupils was amazing and I loved every moment.  I am a natural with behaviour management and although it was stressful, every time the bad kids acted up it presented a teachable moment.  You could really feel the impact on their lives and behaviour, well behind the Python and the TCP/IP and while loops.But everything to do with working with other teachers was utter misery.  Never have I met such a cantankerous downtrodden passive aggressive bunch of backstabbing political jobsworths.  Actually, it was probably only one third of the staff that were the hyper negative old timers, but they had such a dismal impact on me it felt like everyone was cut from the same cliquey snobby cloth.  Imagine the worst, most power hungry, little-napoleon office manager you’ve ever had and then imagine one in three of the staff have that mindset.It drove me mad and I’m now a SWE again but also volunteering at a youth center in our most deprived part of town and loving it.  I can have impact with the kids, and as a volunteer I seem to command much more respect from parents than a lowly teacher.So now I am tainted too — if I hear you are a teacher then I will see before me someone who at best tolerates that level of crappiness in their workplace, and at worst actively takes part in it.  Neither leave me with much respect for you, but I know why you do it: the kids."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Former HS math teacher here. It was the hardest job I’ve ever had. I still have nightmares about being back in the classroom 18 years later. I was easily working 12+ hours a day doing class planning, grading, etc. not to mention the actual teaching. Returning to programming my pay doubled and my stress level dropped profoundly. Teacher pay should easily be double what it is.(And about that summers off—with the exception of teachers who had non-teaching spouses or those in the back third of their career, everyone worked summer jobs to make ends meet.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am an early-retired EE and I thought that I could have a second career in teaching HS physics.  I got the MA Teaching in Maryland, and did my one year student teaching assignment.  My thoughts:1. The degree program was decent, although a certificate program would be better for prior professionals if the law allowed it (lower cost, too much wasted time in redundant classes).2. Teachers are sad.  Very sad.  They are underpaid and overworked, even at the better suburban high schools.  Parents treat them poorly, even when they are veteran teachers with lots of experience.3. In general, the public resents that teachers get “3 months off” in the summer.  I believe that this is the justification for lower pay.  It is silly, because teachers work more in 9 months than most professionals and they also pay for things out of their own pockets.  They also counsel and tutor students after school.  It’s a difficult job.4. In my job interviews, the first and most important qualification was “classroom control.”  Math, science, engineering, life experience were all distant seconds.  Teachers—-even in advanced math and science classes—-are first and foremost caretakers.  Think about that for a second…5. What is the current model for education based on?  There are several competing historical arguments, but the salient factors like student-teacher ratio, subjects, grades, facilities, etc. are based on economics and legal requirements.  The quality of either a student’s experience or a teacher’s experience is not very high on the list.  Education is about checking a box on a list of requirements that was developed 150+ years ago.Ultimately, I decided to tutor rather than to teach in a classroom.  I consider this a personal disappointment, although I learned a lot from the educational experience.  I wish there could be a “town hall” type of discussion to consider ways to improve the situation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has a lot of good insight, but I was struck by how differently I experience&gt; “What’s up?” is one of the most dreadful texts to get; it’s short for “Hello, I’d like you to entertain me now.”The typical response to &#34;What&#39;s up?&#34; from myself and, uh, nearly everyone I know, is some variation on&#34;Not much!  What&#39;s up with you?&#34; or&#34;[trivial recent happening, quickly related] So, what&#39;s been going on with you?&#34;...and that&#39;s because &#34;What&#39;s up?&#34; is nearly universally a way to prompt someone to ask you that question back, so you can tell them about the thing you really want to say without it seeming sudden or forced."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A good read, thanks. I like the description of take/give sides and it&#39;s well portrayed.  I wondered if there&#39;s any take home message here for salvaging a give-take conversation.I&#39;d crudely deduct that being takers/givers in a conversation may be a function of cultural, linguistic, social, and intellectual dimensions coupled with personal, emotional, and ambient states a person is in.As such there&#39;s really very little just one party can do to have a better conversation flowing on their own. So apart from affordance, I think participation seems to also be a key factor and can be seen as &#34;push or pull or slide&#34; aspect of that doorknob."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Only using the official API is quite cumbersome, as fetching a story with comments requires one network request per each comment.Instead, try considering the (more unknown) Algolia API[0]. It supports fetching the entire tree in one request. Unfortunately the comments aren’t sorted, so you’ll still have to use the official one (or parse the HN HTML) if you need that.For my HN client[1], I parse the HN HTML (as it’s required for voting), and sort the comments from the Algolia API. It’s much faster than recursively requesting the official API.[0]: https://hn.algolia.com/api[1]: https://github.com/goranmoomin/HackerNews"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In response to people&#39;s complaints about the usability of the HN Firebase API: yes. We&#39;re going to eventually have a new API that returns a simple JSON version of any HN URL. At that point we&#39;ll phase out the Firebase API, with a generous deprecation period. I&#39;d be curious to hear people&#39;s thoughts about what a generous deprecation period might be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wish API would show comment votes instead of only showing them up until 8 years ago when displaying them was turned off on the main site. Aside from allowing users to enable them via their on interface, do analysis, etc — it broke HN’s comment search based on comment popularity.Related:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32535637"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To clarify what this means, since things can get confusing with subtle differences in wordings:* stage1 is when zig is built from C++ code[1] (the &#34;bootstrap&#34; compiler) using system C/C++ compiler toolchain.* stage2 is when zig is built from Zig code[2] using stage1.* stage3 is when zig is rebuilt from the same Zig code[2] using stage2.Before today, zig would give you stage1 by default, and you could opt in to stage2 using `-fno-stage1`.
After today, zig gives you stage3 by default, and you can opt in to stage1 using `-fstage1`.In all three cases, LLVM is being used. Although Zig has started to fully self-host by providing backends that have no dependency on LLVM, none of these fully self-hosted backends are complete.Why bother self-hosting? Because:* Zig produces smaller, faster binaries than C++ that use less memory[4]. Case in point: the new self-hosted compiler is 1.5x faster than the C++ implementation and uses 3x less peak RAM.* Development velocity in Zig is much faster than C++, and debugging is a breeze in comparison due to Zig being much safer than C++ and having better debug tooling. Similarly, comptime features let us add more assertions and debug checks that are not possible in C++.* Zig compiles much faster than C++.* Zig cross compiles better than C++ making it easier to create builds of the compiler for every target.* The self-hosted compiler does not need a softfloat library dependency to support f16 or f128 operations.* Zig&#39;s std lib data structures are incredibly useful, especially compared to the C++ STL.There are still many known bugs; not every project will be able to upgrade immediately. See the full upgrade guide [3] for help deciding when and how to upgrade.[1]: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/src/stage1[2]: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/tree/master/src[3]: https://github.com/ziglang/zig/wiki/Self-Hosted-Compiler-Upg...[4]: https://media.handmade-seattle.com/practical-data-oriented-d..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Memory usage is improved by a factor of about 3x. For Zig, building itself went from using 9.1 GiB to 2.7 GiB.Pretty impressive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very exciting. Are there plans to maintain the bootstrap path over the longer term? It always makes me sad when I hear about compilers which must bootstrap from magic binary blobs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I understand the problem here and I sympathize with professors in these circumstances. Learning the fundamentals will remain important. But as others have pointed out: if students are unwilling to learn, or are taking shortcuts, it will ultimately hurt them in the long run.One thing tho is that things like Copilot put the lie to the hypothesis (propagated mostly by the Google-style job interview) that intensely coding clever for-loops to perform algorithmic magic (for things usually already in the standard library) is the best measure of the competence of a software developer. If it can literally be done by a machine, maybe we should be measuring based on something else. Especially since this kind of thing is best done on the job by looking in a good textbook or using the standard library. Probably grading at the university level needs to consider this also.I haven&#39;t used Copilot. I doubt I&#39;m its intended audience. After 30 years, actually writing code is perhaps the easiest part of my job. The mechanics is the easy part. The big picture thinking and figuring how to get it all together into a system is the hard part (and honestly there are plenty of people far better at it than I am). Now, if we get a Copilot for that ... then our profession is in trouble."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it is true code pilot is quite amazing and can produce some very decent snippets, if the exercice you give is specific enought (using a special database schema, file format, or API), with objectives that are not common (ask the user specific questions, and draw conclusions out of it or react to events), then it cannot produce a fully working program. I use code pilot regularly now, and it does speed up my work, but I can&#39;t do anything with it without understanding the problem at hand.There is nothing wrong with the student assemblings and fixing parts of code that exist. Doing that requires understanding those parts, how they interacts and what you can do with them. It&#39;s not killing tests. Plus as professionals, we all do that anyway. Heck, I learned doing that. I&#39;m paid doing that.However, there is something wrong with academic exercices that I see in the wild. Things that are very abstracts, requiring way more than programming knowledge, or stuff that are asked out of context completely. Students are both understimulated, and given too hard bites to chew. It&#39;s a terrible way to learn, and to be tested IMO.Tests nowaday don&#39;t tests for knowledge, they test either for compliance, or act as a filter instead of a feedback loop. This is not education.In fact, I&#39;ve yet to see school IT course that I didn&#39;t find deeply flawed, and I completely understand the students for cheating at them to that they can suffer as little as possible. They are not given a chance to prove themself or progress, they are not respected. They are forced fed junk and asked to spit it back all shiny.I remember when I was a student, and I went to 11 different schools because of my twisted life. They all sucked. And I say that as I spent half my student life at the top of my class grade ladder.I regret having cheated so rarely now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems like a problem for educational institutions, not for industry.  We&#39;re already inundated with mediocre programmers, many of whom have CS degrees, which is precisely why the industry looks at job experience more than credentials [0]. I don&#39;t see how this is going to further reduce the supply of competent candidates.What it will do, however, is make it difficult for CS departments to evaluate students based on homework, and it&#39;s not clear to me that this is such a bad thing.  My experience with university CS courses has been that assignments are largely auto-graded, with systems akin to unit tests.  In the common case, an overworked TA quickly spot-checks the source code to look for obvious signs of academic dishonesty, but that&#39;s it.  So, universities are left with the following choice:  give everyone an A, or grade differently.  In the optimistic case, this might even produce a grading strategy that improves the value of a CS degree as a predictor of programming competence.  It likely won&#39;t, in which case we have a status quo.[0] This is a problem in its own right.  I recently referred a grad student as a job candidate in my current company.  I&#39;m the most senior backend engineer, and this grad student was a highly competent contributor to my open-source project, which currently plays a strategic role in our backend.  Said grad student is unusually bright and productive in a complex specialty (distributed systems), and I had to push our VP Eng very hard to hire him.  His initial reaction was along the lines of &#34;he doesn&#39;t have any industry experience, so we don&#39;t know if he&#39;s good&#34;.  It gives me nausea to think about how many outstanding, 2-sigma engineers are rejected because companies don&#39;t know how to evaluate their talents.  In the end, we ended up hiring him, but only because I stated that I would take full responsibility for his productivity.  I regret nothing. &lt;/rant&gt;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The trouble with TDD is that quite often we don&#39;t really know how our programs are going to work when we start writing them, and often make design choices iteratively as we start to realize how our software should behave.This ultimately means, what most programmers intuitively know, that it&#39;s impossible to write adequate test coverage up front (since we don&#39;t even really know how we want the program to behave) or worse, test coverage gets in the way of the iterative design process. In theory TDD should work as part of that iterative design, but in practice it means a growing collection of broken tests and tests for parts of the program that end up being completely irrelevant.The obvious exception to this, where I still use TDD, is when implementing a well defined spec. Anytime you need to build a library to match an existing protocol, well documented api, or even an non-trivial mathematical function, TDD is a tremendous boon. But this is only because the program behavior is well defined.The times where I&#39;ve used TDD and it makes sense it&#39;s be a tremendous productivity increase. If you&#39;re implementing some standard you can basically write the tests to confirm you understand how the protocol/api/function works.Unfortunately most software is just not well defined up front."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TDD use would be a lot different if people actually bothered to read the entirety of Kent Beck&#39;s _Test Driven Development: By Example_. It&#39;s a lot to ask, because it is such a terribly written book, but there is one particular sentence where Beck gives it away:&gt; This has happened to me several times while writing this book. I would get the code a bit twisted. “But I have to finish the book. The children are starving, and the bill collectors are pounding on the door.”Instead of realizing that Kent Beck stretched out an article-sized idea into an entire book, because he makes his money writing vague books on vague &#34;methodology&#34; that are really advertising brochures for his corporate training seminars, people actually took the thing seriously and legitimately believed that you (yes, you) should write all code that way.So a technique that is sometimes useful for refactoring and sometimes useful for writing new code got cargo-culted into a no-exceptions-this-is-how-you-must-do-all-your-work Law by people that don&#39;t really understand what they are doing anymore or why. Don&#39;t let the TDD zealots ruin TDD."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The main reason TDD hasn&#39;t caught on is there&#39;s no evidence it makes a big difference in the grand scheme of things. You can&#39;t operationalize it at scale either. There is no metric or objective test that you can run code through that will give you a number in [0, 1] that tells you the TDDness of the code. So if you decide to use TDD in your business, you can&#39;t tell the degree of compliance with the initiative or correlation with any business metrics you care about. The customers can&#39;t tell if the product was developed with TDD.Short of looking over every developer&#39;s shoulder, how do you actually know the extent to which TDD is being practiced as prescribed? (red, green, refactor) Code review? How do you validate your code reviewer&#39;s ability to identify TDD code? What if someone submits working tested code; but, you smell it&#39;s not TDD, what then? Tell them to pretend they didn&#39;t write it and start over with the correct process? What part of the development process to you start to practice it? Do you make the R&amp;D people do it? Do you make the prototypers do it? What if the prototype got shipped into production?Because of all this, even if the programmers really do write good TDD code, the business people still can&#39;t trust you, they still have to QA test all your stuff. Because they can&#39;t measure TDD, they have no idea when you are doing it. Maybe you did TDD for the last release; but, are starting to slip? Who knows, just QA the product anyways.I like his characterization of TDD as a technique. That&#39;s exactly what it is, a tool you use when the situation calls for it. It&#39;s a fantastic technique when you need it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s extremely interesting, but it has a to be noted that, even though the main page claims 100% compatibility with Clojure, the status page lowers the claim down to 42%, while the GitHub page states you can&#39;t even build it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been dreaming of something like this for a long time. While you can also make native executables with Clojure, using GraalVM, they tend to weigh at minimum around 10MB, and setting up the whole build system is also something I never want to deal with, so this is very awesome."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love this. As a Lisper I’m always intrigued by Clojure but as someone with no knowLedge of or desire to learn to JVM I stayed away since I figured eventually I’d hit JVM questions/issues I frankly didn’t feel like dealing with.Is it really 100 percent compatible with Clojure or is that just aspirational.Also, is it the case that lots of libraries/workflows outside the core language in Clojure assume Java integration?  I always thought a big Clojure selling point was the awesomeness of Lisp while having full access to the libraries of Java."</p>
