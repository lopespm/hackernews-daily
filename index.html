								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back in the 90s I bought a book that came with some floppy disks.  The book was about 500 pages of clip art, and the disks were the actual images.  At the time, people said such things would put graphic artists out of business.What actually happened is that it put mediocre graphic artists out of business and highlighted the difference between one that was mediocre and one that was good.I feel like this will happen again here with digital artists.  The mediocre ones will be indistinguishable from AI, but the good ones will still stand out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Gorbachev secured his place in history by what he didn&#39;t do. While never endorsing the end of the eastern bloc, he made it clear beginning in the late 1980&#39;s that unlike his predecessors, he would not oppose democratic reforms in Eastern Europe by force. To general astonishment, he kept this promise, and with the regrettable exception of Lithuania this commitment to not repeating the crimes of his predecessors is Gorbachev&#39;s greatest legacy. In 1988 you would have been hard pressed to find anyone who could imagine the mostly peaceful collapse of the Eastern Bloc, but Gorbachev had the moral courage to accept this once unimaginable consequence of his policy and to see it through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"RIP Gorbachev, one of the few genuinely good people in politics.After he retired from politics, he was featured in several advertisements:- In 1994 for Apple Computer: https://www.upi.com/Archives/1994/10/07/The-first-advertisem...- In 1998 for Pizza Hut: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gorbachev_Pizza_Hut_commercial- In 2000 for the ÖBB, the Austrian railways: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bLscz8kEg6c- In 2007 for Louis Vuitton: https://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/05/business/media/05vuitton...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hard to know the man behind the image, but Gorbachev seemed like a fundamentally decent man, who was perhaps over his head at a moment no one could be reasonably be expected to prepare for. Still, with him at the helm of the sinking ship, chaos and conflict was at least avoided, or at least deferred, and for that we should be thankful. RIP"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would say: Writing is a test. It tests if you understand the subject well enough, and the &#34;other person&#34; well enough, to communicate it to that other person. Most likely you don&#39;t so then you need to think and/or learn more so that you can redraft it so it works. Write something technical and it reveals how little you know!---It is a trope but it works: Write your problem to the most senior developer in an email/slack but don&#39;t press send. Then there is a probably 50% chance you will solve it, or reduce the scope of the problem to {more focuesed question} that you can ask about."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think most are vastly underestimating the impact of Synthetic AI media - this is at least as big as the invention of film/photography (century-level shift) and maybe as big as the invention of writing (millenia-level shift). Once you really think through the consequences of the collapse of idea and execution, you likely to tend think the latter...What we&#39;re seeing now are toy-era seeds for what&#39;s possible - e.g. I&#39;ve been making a completely Midjourney-generated &#34;interactive&#34; film called SALT:
https://twitter.com/SALT_VERSE/status/1536799731774537733That would have been completely impossible just a few months ago. Incredibly exciting to think what we&#39;ll be able to do just one year from now.."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s impressive how all of this is quickly picking up steam thanks to the Stable Diffusion model being open source with pertained weights available. It&#39;s like every week there&#39;s another breakthrough or two.I think the main issue here is the computational cost, as - if I understand correctly - you basically have to do training for each concept you want to learn. Are pretrained embeddings available anywhere for common words?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a tech lead, when you&#39;re asked to deliver more, the first impulse tends to be asking your team &#34;how can we do more work?&#34;The correct question should be &#34;What can we NOT do?&#34; - and usually there&#39;s a long list of things that don&#39;t generate business value - from processes, meetings, reporting and overly detailed planning sessions to technical hurdles including slow builds, pre-check in hooks, sign off requirements etc.I know that most feel that they absolutely HAVE to do these things, since there are part of the business process/ definition of done/company guidelines etc... but here&#39;s the thing: If your team delivers value, people stop asking questions. It might take some forceful pushback and even some fights initially, but even if your team is absent from meetings or doesn&#39;t jump through every hoop, as long as you churn out value, you make yourself, your superiors and the business as a whole look good and in turn will be cut some slack."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A while back I took a couple years off from working. Sometimes I&#39;d still find myself saying &#34;I&#39;ve just been too busy&#34; when asking myself why I didn&#39;t get something done. Didn&#39;t take long to realize that &#34;I&#39;m too busy&#34; had been an excuse I had been using to justify poorly thought out priorities. I still haven&#39;t fully broken the &#34;I&#39;m too busy&#34; pattern but at least now I know there&#39;s a decent chance that I haven&#39;t actually been too busy and I need to look more at what it is that I have been doing and whether or not those things are truly more important than whatever I was &#34;too busy&#34; to do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In a team of specialists, it can kill the whole nice plan if one leaves for annoyance about productivity. People get offers all the time on linked in, don&#39;t give them a reason to listen.One time I left because I could rarely do my actual job. Meetings, wasting time with bad internal tools, having useless complex processes, nobody wanting to take responsibility for final decisions.I totally work (paid or flex) overtime, if I have the feeling of productivity in the normal time. But not if the company or project structure is a time wasting machine where you learn nothing but how to be annoyed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You did this? Nice job!&gt; Please also check out Keysharp, a WIP fork of IronAHK, another complete rewrite of AutoHotkey in C# that tries to be compatible with multiple OSes and support modern, v2-like AHK syntax with much more features than this one. In comparison, AHK_X11 is a lot less ambitious and more compact, and Linux only.Fascinating, lots to check out here. Thank you.BTW this kind of work falls into poweruser tools IMO, which is an important area for cultivation of Linux Desktop focus. Traditionally in the Linux community this has been more of a distro-maintainer&#39;s support choice (offer poweruser tweaks and tools, or not) so it&#39;s always nice to see new distro-independent, non-dev-poweruser options coming into being."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see the benefit in this, having one script that works everywhere.It&#39;s also good to know linux has autokey (https://github.com/autokey/autokey) for the same result. The name is close, but it&#39;s a different project.It&#39;s not compatible with autohotkey, but you can script using python. I used it to enter dates, emails and automatize dynalist.io actions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the stated goal of MV3 by Google[1] was to avoid extensions with broad permissions:&gt; our new declarativeNetRequest API is designed to be a privacy-preserving method for extensions to block network requests without needing access to sensitive dataThis MV3-based AdGuard extension still requires a broad permission to &#34;read or modify host data&#34; on all sites[2]:    &#34;host_permissions&#34;: [
      &#34;&lt;all_urls&gt;&#34;
    ],

So what you have now is the same required permission to &#34;read or modify host data&#34; as with MV2, but with a network filtering engine capabilities gated by Google (an advertising company).We can&#39;t innovate anymore the filtering capabilities of our content blocker engines as we have been constantly doing over the years.For a recent example, there has been discussions lately with filter list maintainers of whether uBO should support AdGuard&#39;s proposed capability of being able to support pattern-matching for `domain=` filtering option[3] (uBO supports AdGuard lists).That sort of proposition is not possible to entertain with MV3 since only Google get to decide how the filtering engine will evolve, if at all. All content blocking issues will have to be resolved with the Google-controlled filtering engine, and left unaddressed if the solution can&#39;t be shoehorned in the declarativeNetRequest API.* * *[1] https://blog.chromium.org/2020/12/manifest-v3-now-available-...[2] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Add-ons/Web...[3] https://github.com/AdguardTeam/CoreLibs/issues/1550* * *Edit: removed stray `[` character."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Manifest v3 is going to be a slaughter. Extension developers have known the slaughter was coming, but Chrome users are going to be taken by surprise. Many free Chrome extensions aren&#39;t going to get updated at all for v3, because it&#39;s too much work. Many aren&#39;t going to work right anymore because of the new restrictions. And ad blocking aside, v3 seems like a nightmare in general, and still quite buggy. The service workers vs. background script issue discussed by AdGuard will affect many or most extensions.I&#39;ve been postponing the migration of my extensions to v3 for as long as possible. One extension should be fine, but the other one... I&#39;m afraid of what that&#39;s going to be like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Correction:Analytics &amp; Ad Blocker by Globemallow.io https://globemallow.io/ was the first Manifest v3 Ad Block extension.I first published on 06/22/2022.Last night actually I asked if AdGuard would want to license the software, and sent them a link to my extension. They are aware they weren&#39;t the first, and made this post after knowing it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You don&#39;t say where you are located, but unless you are in one of the few places where Dell doesn&#39;t offer on-site next business day support then XPS 13 is a great laptop.Their support is amazing: &#34;We&#39;re not sure what is causing it, but we&#39;ll send someone to replace the whole motherboard tomorrow.&#34; &#34;OH, your currently halfway across the world on a island? No problem, we&#39;ll be there tomorrow&#34;I really don&#39;t understand how it&#39;s done. Clearly they must have parts distributed ahead of time.I&#39;m just amazed that it&#39;s included in the price considering the cost of sending a technician out to a customer. The fact that even here on HN a lot of people think Apple&#39;s support is good suggests that Dell might be able to save a ton of money by lowering their support level, so I don&#39;t really get why they offer it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I absolutely love my Framework laptop for dev. I feel the software support is also quite good, at least for Fedora which is explicitly supported. I got the DIY edition and put everything together, including installing Fedora, in under 1 hour. And I&#39;m a really slow guy, haven&#39;t build a computer in 10 years - its too easy with framework.This laptop is really build to be repairable and modular and it does not suck at all. I think it will last a long time.The ability to choose your own edition also means I got a reasonably affordable laptop with loads of RAM, which I find is quite useful for development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Please excuse the long-winded answer...I have also given up on Apple, but mostly because I can&#39;t see the value in it anymore, otherwise my experience with them has been satisfactory (Intel CPU models).For the past few years I used a Microsoft Surface Pro because it seemed to have good build quality and high screen resolution, but despite this I have had to replace it as part of a recall due to a graphics hardware issue, so it was not without its flaws. On a side note, I found the Windows OS to be OK for non-dev work, but would always &#34;work&#34; on the Linux subsystem... so even though Windows supports it quite well, I would just suggest 100% Linux.For 2022 I decided to buy a &#34;gaming&#34; laptop and switch to 100% Linux. The build quality is a little lower than Apple, and the screen resolution is not as good as Apple or Surface Pro, but it is still good, and when using my external monitor there is no difference.The benefits are clear, however, for less than 50% of the cost I am getting superior performance, discrete GPU, excellent cooling, and NO LOCK-IN. There is also the added benefit of being able to play the occasional video game with great performance.So far I don&#39;t regret it."</p>
