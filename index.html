								<p class="story__comment_others">"The choice to use UTF-32 (ie Unicode code points as integers, which might as well be 32-bit since your CPU definitely doesn&#39;t have a suitably sized integer type) is unexpected, as I had seen so many other systems just choose to work entirely in UTF-8 for this problem.Now, Brian obviously has much better instincts about performance than I do and may even have tried some things and benchmarked them, but my guess would have been that you should stay in UTF-8 because it&#39;s always faster for the typical cases."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a balance between compression ratio and CPU utilisation. Zstd is several times faster at compressing than gzip to produce a file of similar size (it&#39;s good, give it a try if you haven&#39;t already). I guess he means by using zstd they were able to crank up the compression ratio and maintain the same CPU usage maybe?I don&#39;t think AWS routinely compress customer data that I&#39;ve noticed. I guess he must mean for their internal products that use S3 perhaps?"</p>

FSE encoding/decoding involves a state that is carried over between symbols, so decoding must be done in the opposite direction as encoding. Therefore, all FSE bitstreams are read from end to beginning. Note that the order of the bits in the stream is not reversed, we just read the elements in the reverse order they are written.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asymmetric_numeral_systems"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone&#39;s interpreting this as AWS is zipping every customer&#39;s S3 data and improved storage of their data with ztsd.
That&#39;s now what Adrian said, and this is not an announcement - this was a &#34;by-the-way&#34; from a retired Amazonian.AWS switched our own service&#39;s log storage (in S3) from gzip to ztsd a bunch of years ago -and reduced storage costs by 30%.This is AWS&#39;s service data (which is still exabytes) and AWS realized the efficiency.So all the comments of &#34;where is my 30% discount&#34; are offbase.Source: I&#39;ve worked on AWS for a bunch of years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the most interesting applications of ODEs (in my opinion) is the field of control theory, which empowers autonomous systems/robots/vehicles to guide themselves. Brian Douglas has some fantastic introductory videos on the subject [1].I don&#39;t think I agree completely with section 5 (Forget About Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions). For an ODE in the form xdot = f(t,x), existence and uniqueness on an interval follows if f is continuous in t and Lipschitz continuous in x [2]. This often isn&#39;t too difficult to demonstrate for a given system. In addition, if you can&#39;t prove uniqueness of solutions then you likely have to treat the system as a differential inclusion [3]. I personally find differential inclusions fascinating, but the math can be much more dense.[1]: https://engineeringmedia.com/videos[2]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picard%E2%80%93Lindel%C3%B6f...[3]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_inclusion"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; 7. stay away from differentialsI always had issues with this. My undergraduate math classes were very formal and well thought, every object was defined, almost all theorems were proved in class.In particular, we were taught differential equations theories, some general theories like systems of differential equations with constant coefficients, Cauchy&#39;s theorem, and a bunch of recipes.In a separate class, we were also taught differential forms (e.g. a.dx + b.dy being a linear combination of base elements dx and dy - if I remember well).But then came the physics class, why we could go from dy/dx = f(x) to dy = f(x).dx and integrate both sides remain a mystery. &#34;dx&#34; suddenly became an infinitely small things, when it used to be a notation for a linear form OR a notation for f&#39;(x) === df/dx.Generally speaking, I had a lot of issues in physics because the maths used in that context were not formally defined and seemed to obey to some unwritten set of rules that you were supposed to find out by yourself during your final exam..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the following remark by Rota interesting:Insofar as the Laplace transform goes, two radically different uses of the word “function”
are dangerously confused with each other. The first is the ordinary notion of function as a
something that has a graph. The second is the radically different notion of function as density, whether mass density or probability density. For the sake of the argument, let us agree
to call this second kind of function “density function.” Professional mathematicians have
avoided facing up to density functions by a variety of escapes, such as Stieltjes integrals,
measures, etc. But the fact is that the current notation for density functions in physics and
engineering is provably superior, and we had better face up to it squarelyI&#39;ve suggested to mathematicians that the notation  ⌠             
  | f(x) dμ(x)
  ⌡             

in measure theory where μ is a measure should be replaced with  ⌠             
  | f(x)⋅μ(x) dx
  ⌡             

where the measure μ is treated as a density function. What I&#39;ve found is a mixture of either not understanding the logic, or the response &#34;What&#39;s the point?&#34; So it&#39;s interesting seeing Gian-Carlo Rota suggest the same idea AFAICT.As a bonus, the Radon-Nikodym &#34;derivative&#34; would be written as μ/λ instead of dμ/dλ. The RN derivative then doesn&#39;t appear like a derivative - it looks simply like division."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Shazam is one of the very few apps in the past 20 years that STILL &#34;wows&#34; me. I have no idea how the tech works, and I even sort of like not knowing, to be honest. It&#39;s one of the very few apps out there that still in exist in a &#34;magical&#34; way to me. I am constantly impressed with how fast/easy it works, even with very obscure music. What an amazing app.Fun quick related story, about 10 or more years ago there was a back tracking song on a TV show (Scrubs) that I really liked that was only in the Netflix version. It was just an instrumental song with some French sounding words speaking in it so there was no easy way to search for it. However, it was distinct enough that it didn&#39;t seem like something made just for the show. It was also pretty quiet and under some talking in the tv show scene. I had posted on reddit asking if anyone knew it, and never got any responses. I searched all over the web, but no source had the track details. It drove me crazy every time I would hear the song in re-watching the show, and I still could not track it down every few years when I tried again. Back then, Shazam had no cataloging of it so it wasn&#39;t in there either yet. However, when re-watching it a few years back again, I tried Shazam again and to my surprise it finally worked. I was blown away that Shazam was finally able to solve this 10+ year mystery. It was one of the coolest feelings every to scratch that itch finding this rare French song and hearing it in full. It was truly magical.EDIT: Oh sorry, I didn&#39;t think anyone would actually care about the song itself lol It was called &#34;Sans Hésitation&#34; by the French-Canadian band &#34;Chapeaumelon&#34;. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ju4d3YQhByU - It&#39;s also interesting cause now the song does in the episode in tv music database sites. Very cool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a relevant story here. The inventor of the Shazam algorithm, Avery Wang, gave me a demo of it within a couple weeks of it being created. Here is the backstory (partly from personal knowledge, partly relayed by Avery).Avery had gotten his PhD from CCRMA at Stanford under Julius O Smith. His PhD had been on the topic of automatically (&#34;blind&#34;) recovery of individual vocal/instrument tracks from a final mix. From there he joined a startup, Chromatic Research, where I was also at. He created lots of code and patented some algorithms related to resampling and MIDI synthesis, stuff like that. Avery was (and is) a super nice guy, humble but incredibly smart -- he could work not only with the high level mathematics but was also equally excited to fine tune assembly code.After Chromatic folded, Avery had been struggling to get his own startup off the ground. About the same time, the Shazam guys had the idea for the product but didn&#39;t know how to create the algorithm. They approached Smith at CCRMA looking for someone capable of creating something that worked. Smith suggested they try Avery Wang.At first Avery said, &#34;Hmm, that seems difficult, but let me think about it.&#34; Within a week he had a demo running on a few thousand songs he had gathered from CDs. I&#39;m sure a lot of refinements went into it after that, but the core idea took him a weekend.[ All factual mistakes above are due to me and 20 year old memories -- if I misrepresented something it certainly wasn&#39;t due to Avery telling me something that wasn&#39;t true ]EDIT: A blurb about Avery

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; August 2002: Shazam launches as a text message service based in the UK. At the time, users could identify songs by dialing “2580” on their phone and holding it up as a song played. They were then sent an SMS message telling them the song title and the name of the artist.Incredible! Curious to know what exactly happened backend after it listened to the audio, and what hardware it ran on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I prefer the minimalism of a &#34;vertical rack&#34; which, for some reason, I tend to never see. If you don&#39;t have more than 6U or so of equipment, it&#39;s really the way to go because of its minimal profile and amazing load-bearing ability: it is load-bearing parallel to the direction of gravitational pull (vs regular rack cabinets where the load is perpendicular to the posts), and then that weight is all redirected towards the wall, so even the heaviest servers or whatnot that would normally sag unless it comes with rear-mountable rails for 4-post racks (which, for some reason, very few do) work amazingly well. I&#39;ve bought a few of this StarTech one [0] over the years, but I&#39;ve also seen people weld together a couple of metal struts to accomplish the same.[0]: https://amzn.to/3QTmVee"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just opened one 2 weekends ago. I bought a kit (because of the really nice bottles), but then ignored the instructions and found significantly better recipes online. First time I&#39;ve fermented one, and it came out gloriously.I&#39;m proud of the result because it tastes nothing like other hot sauces I&#39;ve had (and there have been very many!), but also doesn&#39;t taste the least bit strange or out-of-place. I expected it to taste like Tabasco, but it came out more like Hunan because of a much darker flavour.I also make regular hot sauces with fruits and herbs that I forage from the neighbourhood. My current dipper is a slightly smokey medium heat made with morita, cascabel and guajira peppers, plum-like damson fruit and some wild mint that I lovingly call &#34;ditch-mint&#34; because that&#39;s where I found it. It would probably work fermented, but I&#39;ve only tried fermenting once so far.Once you get the connection with how certain ingredients alter the taste and texture when combined, you can pretty much wing it as you go. The more complex, the better. There is a balance, and you quickly learn flavourful vinegars / citrus, and sweeteners (brown sugar/honey/maple) will balance out just about any amount of spices and herbs. It&#39;s very rewarding if you like hot sauces, dips, marinades, etc, and the results will pretty much always make you feel like an old pro."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started making fermented hot sauce during COVID in 2020. There&#39;s a fancy grocery store near me that sells scorpions, ghosts, and reapers, as well as burdock, tamarind, mango, etc. I usually fermented for a week, and I&#39;ve tried longer with little difference. I made an entire spreadsheet full of recipes that I tried, but ultimately I thought the fermented sour flavor overwhelmed everything. So, I started making them without fermenting, but with a little cooking to help break down some of the fruits and veggies and blend the flavors, and suddenly everything tasted 10x better. I was surprised, because for some reason I got it in my head that hot sauce must be fermented, when that&#39;s totally not true. Anyway, my $0.02 on fermenting hotsauce."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A link to a great resource for learning about peppers and fermentation, replete with many good recipes: https://m.youtube.com/c/Chillichump (Chilli Chump)Edit for intriguing experiment of mine: I originally began experimenting with fermented chillis due to a suspected h-pylori infection. My reasons were a) h-pylori seems to swim away from capsaicin, possibly encouraging it to develop an excessive biofilm, thus contributing to its own isolation, b) capsaicin, despite its apparent burning effect, can be helpful with ulcers due in part to encouraging healthy mucous formation and c) the lactobacillus and other probiotic factors involved. I believe this was critical in abolishing a rather nasty ulcer that nearly debilitated me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thanks for the nice comments, everyone! I made this but didn&#39;t expect to see it here.As people have noticed, the spinning diagrams are done with CSS, which was fun.Basically it&#39;s just an `animation: linear infinite;` from `transform: rotateY(0turn);` to `transform: rotateY(1turn);`(source here https://github.com/hrldcpr/poole/blob/master/_sass/_latex3d.... )To keep the numbers facing forward, they&#39;re all also rotating, but in the opposite direction :pAnd all of the numbers&#39; `translate3d(...)` coordinates are generated by a Python script because I didn&#39;t want to do that by hand..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most impressive thing for me is that I could copy and paste the text/numbers in the rotating pyramids!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The sum of S(n) = 1^k + 2^k + ... + n^k is a polynomial of degree k + 1 over n. To find a closed form for S(n) you only need to compute  k + 2 points, e.g. S(0), S(1), ..., S(k + 1) and fit a polynomial.The claim that 1 + 2 + ... + n = n (n + 1) / 2 only requires you to verify it for n = 0, n = 1, and n = 2, e.g. that 0 = 0 * 1 /2, 1 = 1 * 2 / 2, and 1 + 2 = 2 * 3 / 2. I found this really surprising when I first heard it and thought I&#39;d share :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The importance of this subject is underestimated and applies as well quite independently of whether humans eat the insects directly or not. Consider the cuban tree frog for example, which has long since initiated its campaign in Florida to host and spread throughout the food chain the rat lungworm nematode. Rat lungworm (angiostrongylus) holds its own in the burgeoning presence of hideous and hostile parasites. It is highly infectious to many species and no picky eater, as it favors the entire body of the host, the brain and all. Burmese pythons are another up and coming host in Florida, and while they might prefer a provincial life in the everglades, many other species will meander north and onward. There are other nasties from nematodes to cestodes and more, gaining new ground. Baylisascaris procyonis is another terrible nematode found almost anywhere in the US, mostly in racoons, but in other species (humans included) with more varying and less frequency and it&#39;s often incurable. A study showed that, if I remember correctly, 40 out of 250 wildlife rehabilitation personnel had been exposed, but symptoms varied by exposure load. Both rat lungworm and baylis ascaris are resistant to environmental elements that normally break things down, with baylis even surviving UV light, formaldehyde and extreme cold. Rat lungworm can be deposited on surfaces (eg vegetables),  and snails are common vectors. Lungworm is very difficult to remove by washing while baylis is so adhesive that wildlife control authorities advise disposing of rather than washing shovels or tools exposed to racoon latrines. The list goes merrily along with other nasties, but it would require time to refresh my memory and accurately describe more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Larger animals can be inspected individually to find pathogens or diseases.Insects are so small that it&#39;s practically impossible to inspect each individual organism. You can do sampling of the batch, but the odds of missing bad ones are still high.Same with the fruits and vegetables, some are easy to inspect, others are almost impossible, or impossible to clean. There are kosher (insect-free) versions of lettuce and some berries which are much more expensive than non-kosher ones.Lastly, disgust is a part of the human immune system. Religious dietary laws and cultural taboos are probably partly developed from disgust, and partly from trial-and-error."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve wondered about this for a few years so this is extremely gratifying to read. I’ll have to go in deeper later to really understand the implications of each parasite, but my main takeaway is that my intuition here was way off. I expected insects to pose far fewer risks from parasites to humans.I wouldn’t have taken a chance based on that assumption, and cooking bugs seems like it would eliminate most of these pathogens, but still. I figured it would be safer.I’d need to read a lot more to draw some kind of comparison between insects and animal agriculture (both seem to carry plenty of baggage), but it’s great to see research like this so it’s possible to begin doing so."</p>
