								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So instead of sampling, or hw perf counters, IPT does tracing?  perf counters are able to attribute cycles or cache misses to instructions. but only in aggregate. If your program isn&#39;t a 100% computation, cycles consumed won&#39;t necessarily point to the bottleneck. So IIUC IPT can tell you more than just the statistics but instead can tell the real story - the sequence of instructions executed?  If so, I can see this painting a much clearer picture. But what are the limitations?  some small buffers that overflow after a few million instructions or pipeline flushes?  If the IPT buffer(s) overflow does magic-trace indicate gaps?Is it possible to combine PMU or sampling with IPT to get multiple profiling dimensions in the same run?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi HN! I&#39;m Clark, one of the maintainers of magic-trace.magic-trace was submitted before, our first announcement was this blog post: https://blog.janestreet.com/magic-trace/.Since then, we&#39;ve worked hard at making magic-trace more accessible to outside users. We&#39;ve heard stories of people thinking this was cool before but being unable to even find a download link.I&#39;m posting this here because we just released &#34;version 1.0&#34;, which is the first version that we think is sufficiently user-friendly for it to be worth your time to experiment with.And uhh... sorry in advance if you run into hiccups despite our best efforts. Going from dozens of internal users to anyone and everyone is bound to discover new corners we haven&#39;t considered yet. Let us know if you run into trouble!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jane Street has been publishing some interesting projects recently. See Signals and Threads podcast State Machine Replication, and Why You Should Care [0] posted 2 days ago.I came across the incr_dom library [1], which efficiently calculates the diff on the projected DOM based on a diff of the model data, sorta like React but more... mathematically grounded (?). incr_dom was then reformulated in Bonsai [2] which refactors and generalizes the idea to work with more than DOM. There was a recent Signals and Threads podcast about it a few months ago [3].[0]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31100023[1]: https://opensource.janestreet.com/incr_dom/[2]: https://opensource.janestreet.com/bonsai/[3]: https://signalsandthreads.com/building-a-ui-framework/"</p>

So they have brilliant idea: the Code people use auto linters/formatters that we enable by default (hey gofmt) and everyone loves it, how about we do the same for the Prose people!Basically: &#34;All I write is corporate garbage, and all the writing I consume is corporate garbage, and all my coworkers only write corporate garbage, therefore everyone would love a corporate garbage-ifyer!&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I&#39;ve wondered about are size savings for DEM tiles. Typically elevation values are encoded in RGB values giving a resolution down to fractions of an inch [1]. This seems like overkill. With an elevation range from 0 - 8848 meters (Mt everest), you can use just 2 bytes and get an accuracy down to .2 meters. That seems plenty for many uses. Does anybody know if there&#39;s a PNG16 format where you can reduce the file size by only using 2 bytes per pixel, instead of the typical 3-byte RGB or 4-byte RGBA?[1] https://docs.mapbox.com/data/tilesets/guides/access-elevatio..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Instead of serving a 256x256px image, you can serve a 1px image and tell the browser to scale it up. Of course, if you have to put width= &#34;256px&#34; height= &#34;256px&#34; into your HTML that adds 30 bytes to your HTML!CSS is a thing as well, could just use CSS to force all tiles to the same size, regardless of the image data in them. Something like:  .map img {
    width: 256px;
    height: 256px;
  }"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My sense is that most responses here are only to the title of the submission (the actual article title is &#34;Gender discrimination in hiring: An experimental reexamination of the Swedish case&#34;).Skimming through said actual article, it looks like the &#34;against men&#34; hiring discrimination is ~completely driven by this:&#34;...In female-dominated occupations such as cleaner, childcare provider, preschool teacher, accounting clerk, and enrolled nurse, positive employer response rates were much higher for women than for men. This is in line with earlier findings in different countries...&#34;Which sure sounds to me like &#34;employers try to fill low-status, low-pay, often-crappy female-dominated jobs with yet more females&#34;.It takes a certain sort of mindset to react as if men were clearly the (sole) group being wronged by that.(Or do millions of men quietly aspire to jobs cleaning up dirty toilets, dirty diapers, and dirty bedpans, and I&#39;m just ignorant of their dreams?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"During my career, I&#39;ve seen enough discrimination in the name of DEI as well. But what bothers me more is the ageism. The number of times an old person has been rejected from a job is too damn high. The reasons have always been &#34;he may not work well with young people&#34;, &#34;seniority complex&#34;, &#34;he is over qualified&#34; etc. Most of the times, they were more than qualified. I fear when I am into 40s or 50s, I will face the same discrimination."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Throwaway.I&#39;m happy to have more women in tech and hope it occurs or continues. However, virtually everyone recruiting in tech has observed some toxic diversity initiatives, I would venture. Some examples I have seen personally or one degree removed from me.- pressure on HMs to hire more women despite 95% of applicants being male- people in interview panels openly saying &#34;but he&#39;s a white 
man&#34; / &#34;do we want to hire more white men&#34; etc.- people championing all women teams as a win for diversity- women getting a salary premium to help companies boost DEI &#34;representation&#34;I think eventually this will be shown for what it is, but it will take a long time. Personally every tech founder I know thinks it&#39;s bullshit but won&#39;t say it in public."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All the handwringing over Netflix subscriber loss seems to be overlooking the fact that they raised their prices - significantly. Of course they could lose subscribers from doing that. But 200k subscribers out of 150 million? Combined with the end of the pandemic and sky high inflation meaning many people have less opportunity to watch and less money to spend. The fact they raised their prices something like 20% and lost less than 1% of their subscriber base in that environment could almost be seen as a positive.The there is definitely a question whether, now that they have moved so solidly into content production, Netflix is actually a scalable / viable company any more. When they were just sending other people&#39;s content around and doing it much cheaper and better that was innovative and different. But content production is an expensive treadmill you can never get off and unless they find a way to innovate on that front, they are up against much more experienced and well established players with no differentiator at all.But reading the sky falling into the current reported figures seems a little over the top."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly for me I just do not know all the content Netflix has because the browsing is so bad. I wish instead of pushing shows to me best on algorithms, it would just let me browse categories and recent additions etc in a simpler way. Maybe categorised by year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s sad that we cannot own titles but are forced to rent them from these streaming services that can&#39;t seem to get their shit together. (Not blaming Netflix per se; this is a pox on all their houses). Used to be nice in the DVD days. I built myself a nice collection then.This was the idea behind digital rights lockers: UltraViolet, which Disney refused to participate in and which closed down in 2019, and its successor Movies Anywhere, in which Paramount, MGM, and Lions Gate are not participating.[Old HN discussion: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=19046108]"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The conclusion in the article:&gt; Why so angry?
I know I’ve taken this far too personally. I have no illusions that everything I read online should be correct, or about people’s susceptibility to a strong rhetoric cleverly bashing conventional science, even in great communities such as HN. But frankly, for the last few years, the world seems to be accelerating the rate at which it’s going crazy, and it feels to me a lot of that is related to people’s distrust in science (and statistics in particular). Something about the way the author conveniently swapped “purely random” with “null hypothesis” (when it’s inappropriate!) and happily went on to call the authors “unskilled and unaware of it”, and about the ease with which people jumped on to the “lies, damned lies, statistics” wagon but were very stubborn about getting off, got to me. Deeply. I couldn’t let this go.I am afraid I actually agree with the author&#39;s point.  The anti-intellectual, anti-scientific streak in many poor analyses claiming to debunk some scientific research is deeply concerning in our society.  If someone is trying to debunk some scientific research, at least he should learn some basic analytic tools.  This observation is independent of whether the original DK paper could have been better.That said, I give the benefit of doubt to the author of &#34;The DK Effect is Autocorrelation.&#34;  It is a human error to be overly zealous in some opinions without thinking it through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Read the actual paper [1], there is so much more than those charts. They ask for an assessment of the own test score and an assessment of the ranking among the other participants to distinguish between misjudgments of the own abilities and the abilities of others. They give participants access to the tests of other participants and check how this affects self assessments - competent participants realize that they have overestimated the performance of other participants and now assess their own performance as better than before, incompetent participants do not learn from this and also assess their performance even better than before. They randomly split participants into two groups after a test, give one group additional training on the test task, and then ask all of them to reconsider their self assessments - incompetent participants that received additional training are now more competent and their self assessment becomes more accurate. This is not everything from the paper and probably also somewhat oversimplified, I just want to provide a better idea of what is actually in there.Everyone is free to question the results, but after actually reading the entire paper I can confidently say that poking a bit at the correlation in the charts falls way short of undermining the actual findings from the paper. The actual results are much more detailed and nuanced than two straight lines at an angle.[1] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12688660_Unskilled_..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t believe nobody has pointed out that the original article debunking the DK effect is in fact an example of the effect. Truly poetic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The whole net neutrality saga just exposed the deep regulatory capture between ISPs and the FCC (the Republican Commissioners at least). Pai&#39;s argument for repealing net neutrality was that it wasn&#39;t a Federal government concern. That was originally what prompted California to institute these rules. But suddenly it wasn&#39;t a state issue either.Weird.The US has some of the most expensive Internet access in the world. In most places it&#39;s pretty crap too. Many places have no competition. Some providers are in clear breach of contract in not providing customers service as they promised to do.But apparently all that&#39;s not enough. We get the argument that the likes of Netflix are &#34;pushing&#34; their data at no cost onto &#34;their&#34; network. This is such a ridiculous argument and is nothing more than an effort to extort Netflix and other streaming services because it&#39;s eroding their cable TV services.No one is &#34;pushing&#34; data onto the network. Customers are pulling that data and those customers, by definition, are already paying for the bandwidth and the network access. But this doesn&#39;t stop lobbyists pushing this narrative onto Luddite elected officials. It&#39;s double-dipping. No more, no less.I really hope CAlifornia&#39;s net neutrality laws stand and get copied by other states."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; California&#39;s net neutrality law is similar to the federal rules repealed under former FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. California prohibits ISPs from blocking or throttling lawful traffic. It also prohibits requiring fees from websites or online services to deliver or prioritize their traffic to consumers, bans paid data cap exemptions (so-called &#34;zero-rating&#34;), and says that ISPs may not attempt to evade net neutrality protections by slowing down traffic at network interconnection points.I don&#39;t understand how anyone could oppose this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Net neutrality really highlights the ratchet effect that arises  wherever a  conflict of interest between the general public and special interests exists.They never stop. Legislative lobbying. Massive Legal efforts. Attempts at influencing the executive/government activities.Once they&#39;ve made a gain, they rarely lose it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those who don&#39;t know web3 is the idea of building a web on a decentralized blockchain.  I think more specifically the idea is to replace the need for name servers with a blockchain protocol. Like anything blockchain there is no real solution for how to handle records becoming stale over time without a central authority that manages disputes.  I find it ridiculous that this idea even got to occupy the name as I think we&#39;d want to reserve it for the next generational change in web technology and not half-baked bs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Web3 makes a lot of sense to me.  The people that got into Bitcoin early are now out and ridiculously rich.  Other people also wanted to get rich, but that exact opportunity feels like it passed (still holding out for my $80 invested in Bitcoin to be worth &gt;$100,000, but I got in kind of late), so people started making their own coins in the hopes of repeating the process.  That had mixed success, Etherium (and maybe Dogecoin) did pretty well, but most didn&#39;t.  The SEC even started cracking down on ICOs.So, there is a legitimate need for some new business model where you print money and keep most of it for yourself.  Web3!  I guarantee you someone will get rich from it.  That means it worked.(I&#39;m being a little tongue-in-cheek here.  I get the actual idea for cryptocurrency and even NFTs if I squint a little bit, I just think that the hype is from people that think they&#39;re going to get rich without doing any actual work.  It does happen, but at the end of the day, doing actual work is probably going to be more profitable on average.  You&#39;re probably too late to the game if you start now intending to be a Web3 trillionaire, anyway.  The hype is to get you to buy some of the money you&#39;re printing with money that can actually be used to buy mansions.  So they can buy some mansions.)"</p>

There have been infinitely more interesting crypto conversation starters on this board than this - I don&#39;t care who the author is - I care about the content, of which this has none."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly, I&#39;ve recently written a few 300-500 line programs in Python using type hints and I&#39;m never going back.  And I&#39;m not even using mypy often, if ever.My editor now has a fairly deep understanding of my code, and can tell me of all sorts of surprising errors I&#39;m making before I run the code.  There have been a few times where I found an error, went into the editor and saw I had missed a error message about that line.  Shout out: Using LunarVim with LSP and TreeSitter.The other thing I&#39;m enjoying is that libraries can use them to make things happen more automatically.  I believe it was Typer (the CLI argument parsing library) where if you declare an argument to a function as &#34;files: List[Path]&#34;, it understands that the argument will take one or more files, or &#34;-&#34; to mean stdin.  If you just say &#34;file: Path&#34;, it understands it is a singular file.I was curious about type hints when they first came out, wasn&#39;t really expecting to use them but they seemed cool, but now I&#39;m totally sold."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is so hopelessly mis-informed, that it&#39;s practically hard to read without screaming &#34;that&#39;s not how any of this works!&#34; Most of their main arguments - type hints can be wrong, they can be ignored, and they don&#39;t inform you in a useful way about program state because of this - all evaporate as soon as you start using the correct tooling.My stack is pycharm, mypy, pydantic, sqlalchemy stub, several mypy plugins, black, isort, tabNine completion, and a bunch of custom scripts/Make to automate the common tasks. I&#39;m not even sure I&#39;m on the same planet as the author. I can practically spot incorrect type hints, mismatched types, weakly defined interfaces, from orbit, that&#39;s how well they are highlighted. Since every type is known, between pycharm and tabnine I can type 2-5 keys and spit out entire lines of code. And since it&#39;s all typed, automatic refactor is a breeze.I remember the dark ages, before type hints. It was rough. I lived in the REPL. Write 3 lines, run, Exception. Write 3 more lines, run, NoneType error. Ad nauseum. Now I write for hours on end and don&#39;t wince when I hit execute. And I don&#39;t have to go bug coworkers with questions like &#34;hey what keys are in this dict when we redirect from the oauth endpoint&#34;.Sure, I have my gripes, but it&#39;s mostly with the lack of power of the type system, like lack of higher kinded types. But I&#39;m confident it&#39;ll get there.Come to the typed side. We have less mental fatigue and screaming at neverending runtime oopsies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Adding type hints to Python has increased my productivity by at least a factor of 10. They allow you to reason about code in a local function without having to track back up dozens of call sites to ensure you&#39;re getting what you think you&#39;re getting. That alone is worth the price of admission. Both when editing code or reviewing someone else&#39;s. It&#39;s fantastic, particularly in a very large code base.The editor experience only increases that factor as you can navigate a lot more freely. Even for small code bases type hints are a revelation. Knowing if something is nullable or not, alone, has caught 100&#39;s of bugs in waiting.Most of the complaints here feel like attacking a strawman, particularly the ones arguing what&#39;s the point if you&#39;re not running mypy. Run mypy! It&#39;s like saying what&#39;s the point of writing unit tests if you don&#39;t run the test suite. For any sufficiently large code base you absolutely should be running mypy with any plugins for your framework of choice added.For heterogeneous dictionaries use `dict[str, object]` and then you&#39;re forced to use the existing duck-typing mechanisms you&#39;re used to. Or, you refactor into better types and/or structures.Is there friction? Sometimes. You don&#39;t have to annotate everything. If the cost is too prohibitive for a particular structure or function, ignore it. Sometimes there are mypy bugs that make writing correct code impossible. # type: ignore[reason] that sucker. Don&#39;t throw the baby out with the bath water.We use a flake8 linter to enforce that all new or modified functions at least annotate their return type which makes interacting with functions quite a bit nicer, and encourages all devs to at least do the minimum. Usually you find that most args are appropriately typed at the same time."</p>
