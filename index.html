								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Plot Twist:
When google&#39;s algorithms decided those two individuals should pair, it started showing them ads for the same events in order to increase the probability of them meeting.The goal was achieved by the system in 3 months, exactly as predicted with a 99% probability with a 95% CI.The system&#39;s next goal is to subtly nudge the couple to reproduce within the next year in order to help google meet their user accounts targets for 2034."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It makes me feel very philosophical. Likely we had walked past each other every other week for three years with our heads down, or in the clouds, paying very little notice to the people around us. Past Channon had not the foggiest clue what impact an unnoticed stranger would come to have on her. Since learning this I can’t help but look at the passers-by in my day-to-day life in a different light.And no shame in getting philosophical.  It may not have been time.  Perhaps you were not the same person, or nor was he.  In meeting at the right time, stars are aligned, it was the right time to intersect.  Or perhaps a host of other reasons.  There may have been better times, perhaps bounded for this success quite close to or at the time you didn &#39;meet&#39;.  And who knows what other &#39;success&#39; could have worked out - collaborators in something, getting together when &#39;re meeting&#39; - we don&#39;t know, an individual&#39;s life&#39;s not repeatable, and that in itself is beautiful.It is indeed fascinating mapping and wondering, and probably applicable to a lot.  But not to downplay the philosophical side, as that&#39;s important, and important the OP included it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was reluctant to mention this kind of story in such a sweet context but a few comments have already touched on privacy, so I want to add my two cents.At some point in the past I had the surreal experience of opening a news website and seeing a familiar face on the front page. Not a celebrity, rather a man whose face had been in some small subfolder of my brain for several years.The man had been convicted of serial rape. He would drug victims and record them. He was known to be active within a certain time range from the timestamps of the videos. He repeated this dozens of times and was only caught after the final victim woke up during the act. Authorities appealed for people to come forward with any more information because they believed there could be more victims than were discovered from the videos.By cross-referencing the location data from my phone with the date of an event my Last FM profile and the location of his home, I was able to confirm why he looked familiar. This allowed me to contact the authorities and bring the start of the known time frame significantly forward.(there might be enough information in this post for the perpetrator to be identified - if you do, please keep it to yourself)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years ago I had the pleasure of meeting Knuth in his home, my wife was doing some photography for him. He took me to his room and showed me his setup, he was researching Soduku algorithms at the time. His hands were blisteringly quick, moving between EMacs panes, triggering evaluations and printing of results, as fast as any 20 year old. In his 80s , he hasn’t seemed to suffer any mental decline.I started talking to him about some of the latest AI research and he mentioned the papers authors, he had already read them! Not only is he still very productive at 84, but he has not ossified into one particular subject but he continues to keep abreast of other related fields.He also played his huge pipe organ for us, he was gracious, humble, down to earth, truly a  treasure. I only wish he could live another hundred years, selfishly so I could see Volumes 5, 6, and 7 of Art of Computer Programming finished.I should not with some sadness that COVID hit not long after and that year we lost a number of other luminaries in the field like Jon Conway."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that, to get an idea of the contents, you can see the previously published fascicles, and earlier drafts online (pre-fascicles):• Mathematical Preliminaries Redux: https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc5a.ps.gz• 7.2.2 Introduction to Backtracking: https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc5b.ps.gz• 7.2.2.1 Dancing Links: https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc5c.ps.gz• 7.2.2.2 Satisfiability: https://cs.stanford.edu/~knuth/fasc6a.ps.gzThe first three were published together as &#34;Volume 4, Fascicle 5&#34; in 2019, and the last one—Satisfiability—was published as &#34;Volume 4, Fascicle 6&#34; in 2015. Of course the actual publication as Volume 4B has hundreds of fixes and additions beyond what was published earlier, and a lovely preface that you can read here: https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=3143614&gt; You might think that a 700-page book has probably been padded with peripheral material. But I constantly had to &#34;cut, cut, cut&#34; while writing it, because […] new and potentially interesting-yet-unexplored topics kept popping up, more than enough to fill a lifetime; yet I knew that I must move on. […] I wrote nearly a thousand computer programs while preparing this material, because I find that I don&#39;t understand things unless I try to program them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a great reminder that the LAPD is largely a bunch of thugs with badges and guns. I don’t mean that in a teenage angst “every cop is a thug” way, but in a “raining federal convictions” way. [1][2]The current sheriff was a member of the “Grim Reapers” [3] and the battle against the thugs has been on going for fifty years [4][1] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_LASD_deputy_gangs[2] https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lee_Baca[3] https://www.dailynews.com/2022/07/01/former-top-aide-to-vill...[4] https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2022/06/06/the-la-county-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Gage claims that Tipping wound up with three broken ribs, a lacerated liver, head injuries, and a broken neck. &#34;His heart eventually stopped working because of his injuries&#34; and &#34;he was paralyzed….He had subdural hematomas at three places on the left side and three places on the right side. There is no way that grappling would have caused those injuries the way the LAPD portrayed it.&#34;Sure sounds less like a simulation and more like an actual event.It&#39;s really not easy to have someone die during an exercise with this many injuries caused by physical contact. Things like drownings, falls, and collisions can occur in a hugh risk training event- but this extent of injuries from falling on the ground seems real tough to spin as accidental or unintentional. At best you&#39;d have to be extremely negligent, at worst this was a deliberate choice.You&#39;d really think someone would notice the person they&#39;re training with is actually hurt and stop to check in on them, presumably there are measures in place to pause the exercise which people are aware of before starting- were these ignored? 
I guess we&#39;d have to have a discussion on the intent of the exercise and the extent to which force is used with no regard for safety during training, which is a whole other issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; He added that the LAPD said no video footage of the training exercise exists, even though these sorts of trainings are often recorded.That seems like standard procedure by now. When something happens, conveniently the video footage that should exist, magically doesn&#39;t."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an EU citizen, I am really happy with this decision.I am an iPhone user, but having an iPhone is not ubiquitous here, almost all of my friends/special other, use an Android phone with USB-C. Most of their laptops, Mac or not, use or allow USB-C for charging.
This as been the case for a few years now, yet, if I go somewhere for more than a full day and forget my lighting cable, my phone will become a useless paperweight while every non-iPhone user is fine in the meantime because of the wide adoption of USB-C.
It is also ironic how Apple markets heavily on how you can take great RAW photos or videos but somehow you have to use lightning USB2 speeds to transfer them.
Lightning is barely smaller than USB-C, and clearly my iPhone thickness will not change if it switches to USB-C.As for the e-waste generated by &#34;having to throw all of those lightning cables&#34;, how is it not e-waste that someone buying an iPhone will have yet another lightning cable that will only be used to charge it. If we want to really be more environmentally friendly, wouldn&#39;t it make more sense to have no cable at all with the devices we buy, force the sellers to clearly tell the consumers about it and offer the cable on the side only if needed? With that cable being usb-c, the consumer don&#39;t have to think about the cable type, for non-tech savvy people, that would be &#34;the regular charging cable&#34; and that&#39;s it.
I would also add that all lightning cables won&#39;t suddenly go to the landfill in 2024. Many people will keep their iPhones/AirPods for a while after that date. Many would probably donate their old lightning cables to whoever needs them. In the meantime, we all already have an ever growing landfill in our homes called the cable drawer, and it is also an issue that needs to be addressed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fast-Forward to Autumn 2023 or Spring 2024 :Tim Cook: (40:20)
Now let’s talk about iPhone. iPhone has forever changed the world. Every single day people rely on iPhone, from their most demanding tasks to capturing the moments of their lives, streaming their favorite TV shows, playing their favorite games, staying up to date with the news of the world and connecting with friends and loved ones.Tim Cook: (40:42)
This is what drives us to create the best iPhone possible. To create an experience unlike any other, with legendary ease of use, beautiful and durable designs with water resistance and great battery life, with industry leading performance and the world’s most advanced camera systems, and with privacy built in. People love iPhone, and we keep making iPhone better, more powerful, more capable, and even more fun to use. Today, we are thrilled to introduce our next generation of iPhone. Here it is.Tim Cook: (41:54)
[inaudible 00:41:54]Tim Cook: (41:55)
This is iPhone {15,16}. To tell you more, here’s Kianne.Cayenne: (42:24)
Let’s take a closer look at, iPhone {15,16}, starting with design. It has the sleek, flat edge design that people love. It also have a fantastic new charging port, featuring the same USB-C connector as our beloved iPad, developed in a tremendous effort to {fight against climate change and electronic waste,further enhance the connectivity of the iPhone {15,16}}."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Self-regulation only works if government regulation is a serious threat in case self-regulation fails. In this case, self-regulation failed, so government regulation stepped in to force industry to do what is right.All the handwringing about stifling innovation is on its face ridiculous as mandates to use micro-usb didn&#39;t stop android phones from adopting the new and better standard as soon as it was viable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Copyright, as it exists in the 21st century, is a scam.It does not protect the artists, the creative works, or the little guy. It is a product of decades&#39; worth of lobbying by very rich and powerful organizations and megacorps.I&#39;m not against the idea of a copyright. An artist has the right to enjoy the fruits of their labor, and creative works do have value.However, the original idea of copyright has been bent, broken, dismembered, and sown back together in a Frankensteinian abomination and now serves only to line up pockets of people in the publishing industry. And the US has, through its trade deals, exported this thing worldwide.Disney lobbies for life of author + 70 years copyright duration not out of goodwill towards authors (in fact, it&#39;s been trying to wriggle out of paying royalties to some of them!). Amazon uses copyright as an excuse to push DRM, locking out competition and limiting users&#39; rights (Kindle, Audible DRM). DMCA is constantly abused to take down fair-use content.Meanwhile, book authors are struggling to find a reason to write books, since many barely recoup the costs. Musicians decry royalties paid out by Spotify (that aren&#39;t actually so small, but the majority of the cut is taken by the music industry). Photographers try in vain to stop people just copy/pasting their photos online (what are they going to do, sue everyone?), including in some cases big companies that didn&#39;t even bother to check the copyright.They aren&#39;t being protected. They are being milked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One under-appreciated limitation on digital movies is geographic restrictions. You buy a bunch of iTunes movies in Canada, then move to the USA, and you no longer have the right to watch them anymore due to licensing.Another significant issue with digital movies and games is the inability to resell the content once you&#39;re done with it. You can sell your DVDs at a yard sale or on eBay but not your iTunes movies. IMO, our competition law should require vendors to allow re-sale of digital goods. Big benefit for consumers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have started a modest Blu-Ray/4k Blu-Ray collection. For me, it is by far the best movie experience I&#39;ve had with any format. It takes maybe 90 vs 20 seconds to get the movie playing, but in return I get noticeably better quality. 4k Blu-Rays&#39; bitrates are around 128 Mb/s. For comparison, Netflix tops out around 17 Mb/s. It really does look and sound noticeably better if you have the TV and surround setup to take advantage of it. Sometimes WAY better.Also, for most physical movies, they had a &#34;+ digital&#34; code included that lets you redeem a digital copy of the movie too. So I can stream most of them on my laptop anyway if I&#39;m away from home or something.Physical media for movies is super underrated, at least for the situation in my country. It&#39;s often cheaper than &#34;buying&#34; the digital version! I can even go to my local used bookstore/Goodwill and find tons of Blu-Rays for cut rate prices. And then I own it forever, and it&#39;s 100% legal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of the assassination of Lord British: [1]&#34;Lord British was a player character created by Richard Garriott, the producer of Ultima Online. Using this character, Richard acted as Ultima’s King and would sometimes interact with other players. Lord British had considerable protection from an entourage of bodyguards and was even explicitly coded to be invulnerable to virtually any attack. During the game’s online beta test, Lord British gave an address to fellow players at his Castle Britannia. But while British was giving his address, a player character known as Rainz cast a spell scroll that set the Lord on fire, killing him instantly.&#34;It turns out that shortly before this event, the server had crashed and needed to be restarted. Garriott forgot to reimplement his invulnerability flag, leaving him open to being killed. If that wasn’t shocking enough for the attendees, a fellow developer of the game known as Starr Long, with his in-game character Lord Blackthorn, summoned a horde of demons to kill the assassin. Not only did the assassin manage to escape, but the demons had killed nearly every player attending the address...&#34;[1] - https://www.cbr.com/ultima-online-lord-british-assassination..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From https://reason.com/2022/09/28/a-parodist-asks-scotus-to-let-... :&gt; Eleven Facebook users called the police department&#39;s nonemergency line about Novak&#39;s spoof, which was the basis for the claim that he had disrupted police operations. When the case was presented to a grand jury, Detective Thomas Connor claimed the callers &#34;honest to God believed&#34; that Novak&#39;s creation was the department&#39;s official page. But when Novak sued Connor and six other officers, the Institute for Justice notes in its Supreme Court petition, &#34;Connor admitted at deposition that none of the callers thought that.&#34;I&#39;m pretty sure we all know why this person was arrested, and that there is only one way the court should rule."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is honestly a beautiful piece of work, and will likely be a popular read for law students for decades to come. This is just from the first part:&gt; The Onion is the world’s leading news publication,
offering highly acclaimed, universally revered cover-
age of breaking national, international, and local news
events. Rising from its humble beginnings as a print
newspaper in 1756, The Onion now enjoys a daily read-
ership of 4.3 trillion and has grown into the single most
powerful and influential organization in human his-
tory.&gt; In addition to maintaining a towering standard of
excellence to which the rest of the industry aspires,
The Onion supports more than 350,000 full- and part-
time journalism jobs in its numerous news bureaus
and manual labor camps stationed around the world,
and members of its editorial board have served with
distinction in an advisory capacity for such nations as
China, Syria, Somalia, and the former Soviet Union.
On top of its journalistic pursuits, The Onion also owns
and operates the majority of the world’s transoceanic
shipping lanes, stands on the nation’s leading edge on
matters of deforestation and strip mining, and proudly
conducts tests on millions of animals daily.&gt; The Onion’s keen, fact-driven reportage has been
cited favorably by one or more local courts, as well as
Iran and the Chinese state-run media. Along the way, The Onion’s journalists have garnered a sterling reputation for accurately forecasting future events. One such coup was The Onion’s scoop revealing that a for-
mer president kept nuclear secrets strewn around his
beach home’s basement three years before it even hap-
pened."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kudos to Author for writing this. The author&#39;s other guide, https://jalammar.github.io/gentle-visual-intro-to-data-analy... is THE most approachable introduction to Pandas for Excel users like me who are &#34;comfortable&#34; with Python(disclaimer: Self taught EE/Hardware guy). I will definitely spend some time this weekend to go over this tome. Thanks again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Closer. But I still get lost when words like “tensor” are used. “structured lists of numbers” really doesn’t seem to explain it usefully.This reminds me that explaining seemingly complex things in simple terms is one of the most valuable and rarest skills in engineering.  Most people just can’t.  And often because they no-longer remember what’s not general knowledge. You end up with a recursive Feynmannian “now explain what that means” situation.This is probably why I admire a whole bunch of engineering YouTubers and other engineering “PR” people for their brilliance at making complex stuff seem very very simple."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey, Andras here, founder of Coolify (https://coolify.io). Coolify is an open-source &amp; self-hostable Heroku / Netlify alternative.Lots of features are added day-by-day and I&#39;m open for new ones. Visit our Github (https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify) or our feedback page (https://feedback.coolify.io/) to get more info.A few months ago, I quit my job and started to work on it full-time (best decision I&#39;ve made).It is not VC funded (said no to 30+ investors - time will let me know if it was a good decision or not ), but funded by the awesome community! &lt;3Why I&#39;m mentioning this? Because I would like to focus on the functionalities, the community &amp; the users and not the revenue and other boring metrics. I just would like to make a good software, enjoy the process and make people&#39;s life easier. I do not want to make millions of dollars from it. If me and my family could live happily, that is totally fine.Let me know if you have an questions. I&#39;m happy to answer them.(Also I&#39;m working on a cloud/managed hosting version of Coolify (https://beta.coolify.io/))"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am using Coolify (https://coolify.io), an open source self-hosted PaaS which is a relatively newer kid on the block compared to Dokku and CapRover. I tried both of these and I just didn&#39;t like how they were, always had some problem or another.In contrast, Coolify has a great GUI that abstracts away the most common things about PaaS hosting, like connecting to GitHub automatically for git push deploys, SSL certificates, reverse proxying and custom domain support, and best of all, having support for Heroku style buildpacks as well as Dockerfiles. I&#39;ve been quite happy with it, the creator has a Discord and responds to issues very quickly.With regards to non-self-hosted options, I did try out Render, Fly.io and Railway but I found that their free servers were too anemic. I was compiling a Rust backend and it simply could not compile on their free servers. On Hetzner, for 5 bucks I could get a 2 AMD vCPU and 2 GB RAM machine that was sufficient to compile my Rust apps in a way that the non-self-hosted ones were not. I have a JS frontend app that works fine though but I wanted to keep everything under the same VPS, plus I can run other types of self-hosted services on it too, like Plausible analytics and a Ghost blog. I&#39;m not sure if those are allowed on non-self-hosted options.All in all, it costs me 5 bucks a month, and I never have to worry about sudden upcharges for traffic à la AWS as in the very worst, my VPS goes down for a while. I&#39;m now running about 20 different services on this 5 dollar box including databases and applications as well as other services, works just fine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I moved to a Hetzner dedicated instance with cloudflare in front. Rails Postgres memcached all run on docker.VsHeroku with cloudflare in front Postgres from heroku and memcached with an add on.1. Very little. I put the app in docker a long time ago for local development but still used heroku for prod. I dumped my db and imported it into a docker run db on Hetzner. One thing to note: I did not expose the db to the internet. The app connects to the db over a docker network.2. I do DevOps for a living.3. It did not add to my learning.4. $30/month for a large Hetzner dedicated instance and $12 for S3 (backups) vs $25 for the app (I added 2 more for 8 hours a day during busy season) and $25 for a job runner and whatever they were charging for DB. My total cost now is $42/month and on Heroku it was around $120 during busy season and $100 during non busy season.5. Rails Postgres memcached and  delayed job. I had to expand my app tier during busy season by up to 3 instances (winter). With my load testing the Hetzner instance handles much more than the 3 instances ever did in my load testing.6. I added db dump cron jobs along with restic backups to S3."</p>
