								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at Facebook when covid first hit. Zuckerburg treated everyone in the company very, very well. There was a blanket &#34;don&#39;t worry about performance, take care of your families&#34; guarantee that honestly was an enormous help.The thing that particularly struck me though was the way he handled contract workers like (some of) the kitchen staff, cleaners, etc. These people don&#39;t work for Facebook and he had zero obligation to them, yet he paid all of their wages for the full length of the pandemic just so they could stay afloat.If it were just about the money, I doubt he&#39;d have done this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I got this wrong, and I take responsibility for that.As always with these things, I wonder what taking responsibility actually means in practice.Businesses usually try to find ways to correct for major failures in decision making. In the case of Zuck, given his ownership, does anything actually happen or change? I&#39;m sure his net worth has been reduced by changes to Meta&#39;s share price, but he was a multi-billionaire before and he still is now. Is that it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some data from the inside:Reality Labs (AR/VR) hit less hard than the rest of the company. No one on my team or adjacent teams let go.Most bootcampers (unallocated new hires) are gone, even ones that were performing well.Low performer from my past team outside RL was let go, so it appears performance was a factor for a lot of roles, rather than just axing entire teams based on business need.edit: updated to clear up some confusion about the meaning of RL and bootcampers"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case we need another example to why Reddit moderation needs... moderation:Attempting to remove the Reddit post myselfI’d had enough. I grew tired of having the respect I afforded Marty, and his employer, with attempts to resolve the dispute privately, get turned into a giant waste of time, effort and money. The Reddit post had been up for 15 months and attempts to resolve the dispute with Marty had gotten me nowhere. With my patience stretched to the absolute limit, I decided to take steps to remove the Reddit post myself.Reddit Moderator: I reached out to one of the r/DOOM moderators. We made contact and arranged a call via Discord.The moderator introduced himself and spoke about his love for the DOOM franchise and its fanbase. Along with the r/DOOM subreddit, he told me he also moderated the official DOOM Discord server.I told him how Marty’s Reddit post had affected me deeply, both professionally and personally. It was a source of ongoing stress and harm, and I asked if he’d consider removing it.Much to my relief, he instantly took it down.But within 12 hours, the post was reinstated. The moderator blocked me on Discord and didn’t reply to my emails.A few days later, Marty’s lawyers contacted me and said removing the Reddit post had greatly offended him. He was furious and made it clear in the strongest terms that an amicable resolution would be impossible.I just read some of the article and that&#39;s horrible behavior from ID.You have my support, Mick."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really disappointing to read. Mick&#39;s soundtrack was a huge part of making DOOM 2016 and Eternal such great experiences.His talk at GDC where he goes into some of the process of creating the soundtrack is fantastic, so much fun to see the creativity he brought to the game&#39;s music.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4FNBMZsqrYThe next DOOM will be a little less DOOMy without him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This Mick Gordon guy has to be the most patient, understanding and abuse-tolerant person on the planet. Even after getting screwed over 30 times in a row he still was hopeful for a reasonable ending. I express that as a compliment, even if in the real world it works against you.It&#39;s not the main topic, but I like to call out attention to this:&#34;incidences of online abuse escalated at an alarming rate as Marty’s Reddit post led to frustration over my alleged professional failure, and toxic gamers grew openly aggressive.They shared my personal details via message boards, including Reddit, which meant that abusers could now reach me in more ways than ever. They email-bombed my inboxes, crashing the server and clogging my messaging services, crippling my ability to communicate. They harassed my other clients with attempts to get me fired from their projects. They called my phone numbers around the clock, screaming messages full of abuse.I began receiving specific expressions of violence, the content so vivid it made me sick. The torrent of abuse telling me how to kill myself, how I’d be mutilated, how they would circulate photos of my body to traumatise my family, how my family would be murdered, how they’d hurt my animals, how they’d shoot up any event I attended, how I’d be raped to death, really started to wear me down in ways I couldn’t previously imagine.&#34;I&#39;m strongly against authoritarian overreach and used to consider trolling a &#34;fact of life&#34;, nothing requiring intervention. I no longer believe that. We&#39;re talking about a disappointing audio track for a stupid game yet the man and his family have to fear for their lives. And surely Mr Manager Marty looks at it with approval.A line has to be drawn in the sand. There must be a cost to such threats. A massive fine or some short prison time. Further, those enabling and launching the mob, even if unknowingly, need to carry responsibility too. This isn&#39;t just defamation, it spills over into real world danger."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember years ago when Java adjacent research was all the rage, HP had a problem that was “Rosetta lite” if you will. They had a need to run old binaries on new hardware that wasn’t exactly backward compatible. They made a transpiler that worked on binaries. It might have even been a JIT but that part of the memory is fuzzy.What made it interesting here was that as a sanity check they made an A-&gt;A mode where they took in one architecture and spit out machine code for the same architecture. The output was faster than the input. Meaning that even native code has some room for improvement with JIT technology.I have been wishing for years that we were in a better place with regard to compilers and NP complete problems where the compilers had a fast mode for code-build-test cycles and a very slow incremental mode for official builds. I recall someone telling me the only thing they liked about the Rational IDE (C and C++?) was that it cached precompiled headers, one of the Amdahl’s Law areas for compilers. If you changed a header, you paid the recompilation cost and everyone else got a copy. I love whenever the person that cares about something gets to pay the consequence instead of externalizing it on others.And having some CI machines or CPUs that just sit around chewing on Hard Problems all day for that last 10% seems to be to be a really good use case in a world that’s seeing 16 core consumer hardware. Also caching hints from previous runs is a good thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great writeup. What a clever design!I remember Apple had a totally different but equally clever solution back in the days of the 68K-to-PowerPC migration. The 68K had 16-bit instruction words, usually with some 16-bit arguments. The emulator’s core loop would read the next instruction and branch directly into a big block of 64K x 8 bytes of PPC code. So each 68K instruction got 2 dedicated PPC instructions, typically one to set up a register and one to branch to common code.What that solution and Rosetta 2 have in common is that they’re super pragmatic - fast to start up, with fairly regular and predictable performance across most workloads, even if the theoretical peak speed is much lower than a cutting-edge JIT.Anyone know how they implemented PPC-to-x86 translation?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone know the names of the key people behind Rosetta 2?In my experience, exceptionally well executed tech like this tends to have 1-2 very talented people leading. I&#39;d like to follow their blog or Twitter."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Recently I started using colima[0], a drop in replacement for Docker Desktop on Mac, and have seen an increase in performance and battery life. You can use all the normal docker and docker compose commands. 
It does not have a GUI but you can use the Docker extension on VS Code to have an overview of running containers.[0]https://github.com/abiosoft/colima"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s also Rancher Desktop in the same space, which includes k3s as a local K8s solution.For personal use I found it great and lighter than Docker Desktop. At work, unfortunately all options but Docker Desktop have issues with either 1) Our Cisco AnyConnect VPN, or 2) Our authenticated http proxy. Couldn&#39;t find anything else providing a container runtime + a local k8s on MacOS that works in this environment. So we just got Docker Desktop licenses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Docker Desktop for Mac released an experimental file sharing implementation back in March[0].
It made working with Docker bearable.Does anyone know how well Podman performs on Mac? Especially file sharing.Edit: A quick Google led me back to this HackerNews comment[1].

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back before the birth of docker when I was consulting, a friends startup wanted a way to install their multi component application (web service, database etc.) inside a corporate environment. They built it on a Debian setup and generally apt-getted (apt-got?) all their requirements, used supervisord to manage the backend process (written in Python) and had it running. To do this on prem, they needed an installer.I cooked up this idea of creating a dummy file (dd), formatting it into a file system, mounting it as a loopback device and deb-bootstrapping it. Then I chrooted inside it, installed all the dependencies needed, added all the code and things we needed for the application, left the chroot and use makeself to create a self extracting zip file of the whole application along with an initial config dialogue. We wrapped up the process using a Python script so that people create such &#34;installers&#34;.Once you ran the file, it would unzip itself into /opt/{something} and start up all the processes. Inside the chroot was Debian with a db and several other things running. Outside the chroot was Redhat or whatever. It ran surprisingly well and was used for a couple of years for all their customers even after Docker came out. I rejoined them as a contractor after they got a decent amount of funding and the same thing was still in use .I wrote about this as an answer to a Stack Overflow question back then https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5661385/packaging-and-sh...It was a proto docker without proper process isolation. Just file system isolation using chroot. Definitely brought back memories. The real value docker added was standardization, a central container registry, tooling etc. It mainstreamed these kinds of arcane old school sysad tricks into a generally usable product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fun deep dive. In a previous life I wrote web apps, and I liked to develop on Chromebooks to make sure that everything ran smoothly on low-end machines.I would set a price point of $2-300, which usually meant I was lucky to get a Rockchip. And this was before it was popular to build for ARM architectures.And yet, ChromeOS&#39; chroot-based projects like crosh always managed to deliver. Surrounded by aluminum MacBooks and carbon-fiber Dells, I would run Rails apps and X GUIs and source builds on a rubberized hunk of plastic that had been designed for use in schools.I have always been surprised at how well that worked. If it was using the same fundamentals as Docker and Podman, I&#39;m not surprised that the containerization movement has enjoyed such popularity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes, containers are more than chroot, until you:- Want to give them their own IP addresses or networks, or- Put upper bounds on their resources, or- Get tired of dealing with chroot and unshare and seccomp and probably other tools I&#39;m forgetting, or- You want to run an arm64 container on an x86 host with minimal configuration, or...this is a really fun (and important) exercise for anyone working with containers seriously to undergo but let&#39;s not trivialize how insanely easy Docked made creating containers become."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Kagi the last few months. I&#39;ve never had a reason to complain about its search results - they seem to work plenty well enough day to day that I don&#39;t really &#39;notice&#39; them. Like most, I now search reflexively, as an extension of the mind, so I only &#39;notice&#39; search when it&#39;s bad.What really excites me is that is that I&#39;m paying them. That sounds odd, but seriously. It&#39;s incredibly refreshing to know that the company providing my search results has an incentive to make things better for _me_ and not a legion of advertisers. With Google I can&#39;t help thinking about every keypress being logged to optimize sales pitches at me. I just don&#39;t feel that with Kagi, because I&#39;m paying them.Sure, they might be logging every keypress (I don&#39;t actually think they are, but you never can tell) but even if they were, I could be reasonably certain they were doing it to retain my subscription, which probably means making my search better, not selling me other stuff.It&#39;s a priveleged position to be in, and the economic argument isn&#39;t watertight, but in the &#34;search as a brain extension&#34; space it still _feels_ premium, because it creates trust. And that frees up brain space for other things - like where the hell was that article I was looking for?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just signed up and tried it a little bit and I like what I see so far. I find myself increasingly frustrated with Google search results for a particular use case: searching for documentation. For example, today&#39;s work had me thinking about Python&#39;s datetime and timedelta and I wanted a reference on what functions are available. With Google I am annoyed with results from geeksforgeeks.org and freecodecamp.com because they are not reference materials and generally only cover some basic use cases. In Google, those two sites are in the top four results. In Kagi, they are not. Instead, there is a longer-form blog post from guru99.com, stack overflow, and the official Python documentation.Now, I will admit that for this particular query Kagi and Google results are pretty close. But my general experience is that when I search in Google I find that I have to look farther down the search results to look past the blogspam to find the authoritative reference."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO this article misses the biggest issue with search engines today. It&#39;s less about any ranking algorithm (like PageRank), but rather the root cause is with indexing. No matter how much you fine tune your ranking system, if your index is filled with SEO junk and blogspam, you&#39;re fighting a losing battle from the start.For some reason, a lot of these search engines like to brag about the number of documents in their index, which never made sense to me. Maybe it was true in the past, but on the modern web, larger index !== better results. In fact, I&#39;d argue the opposite since you&#39;re much more likely to serve SEO spam.That was my motivation to start hacking around on CrowdView (https://crew-rho.vercel.app), a search engine specifically for forums and discussion content (e.g. forums, discords, twitter, reddit, etc). It has a curated index (today, curated by yours truly) to remove SEO junk and help you figure out &#34;what does a real, genuine human think about this think?&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the thick of it, illiquidity and insolvency blur. But not after the fact.As usual, Levine put it best: “the problem is not a timing mismatch, in which FTX’s customers asked for their cash back but FTX did not have enough ready cash because it had long-term but money-good loans out. The problem is that FTX took its customers’ money and traded it for a pile of magic beans, and now the beans are worthless and there’s a huge hole in the balance sheet” [1].Before one is insolvent, illiquidity and insolvency are circular questions of asset value. After the fact, it shouldn’t take someone more than a few minutes to come to a conclusion. (There is a deeper discussion on the folly of accepting as collateral assets correlated with confidence in oneself. I recommend reading the article.)[1] https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2022-11-09/bankma..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s even more funny is that Binance make it look like they are a stable financial institution, and it&#39;s thanks to their high standards that they won&#39;t acquire FTX.
Binance is most probably much more of a fraud than FTX.Binance doesn&#39;t even have physical headquarters in any country in this world - and the reason is that they are being actively investigated or banned almost everywhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why does anyone trust Binance either? They’re notoriously shady about where they operate and what assets they actually hold, to the point that they’re officially not headquartered anywhere.If you have $100k at Binance, is there any reason to believe you could withdraw it tomorrow? Any contract you may have with Binance is made with a local shell company that could just as well be a hot dog stand. Any money you’ve sent them is effectively nowhere.FTX was supposed to be above the board and they collapsed in a day. A few months ago FTX was the white knight buying out distressed crypto companies. Why would Binance do any better?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Serif&#39;s Affinity suite has probably the greatest value for money in the whole software industry. I mean 119 bucks ONE-TIME for three pretty comprehensive graphics apps which are polished and get constant updates is very hard to beat.For people making their living with graphical work (designers, photographers, etc.) Adobe is probably still the way to go (even if just to keep using the muscle memory). However for the many people who only need something like Photoshop or InDesign a couple of times a year, Affinity is just great."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d love to switch to Affinity from Adobe Illustrator, but there&#39;s one feature I just can&#39;t live without:In illustrator you can make a dashed line that nicely lines up with the corners of a square (putting one dash in each corner).  Nothing else seems to handle this case.  [1]I use Illustrator to make stitching patterns and lining up the corners in this way is absolutely essential, otherwise the stitches come out looking lopsided.[1] https://forum.affinity.serif.com/index.php?/topic/145760-how..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I migrated to Affinity after Adobe put the last nail in the coffin for me.I have to admit that even with some experience, Affinity doesn&#39;t get close to Photoshop in terms of shortcuts and ease of use (&#34;getting in the flow&#34;).Sometimes I even resort to using photopea web, rather than open affinity.That said, I really appreciate their pricing model and hope they stick to their guns."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Glasses are expensive because there is no competition. One company - Luxottica - owns pretty much everything.You go to LensCrafters and prices seem super expensive, so you go to Pearle Vision and that&#39;s expensive too, so you go to Target Optical and prices are still high and then you think maybe glasses are expensive, since you went to multiple stores and they all have similar prices. What you don&#39;t realize is that all those retail brands are owned by the same company - Luxottica [1]. They operate under several names, so there is an appearance of competition but there isn&#39;t.But wait, it isn&#39;t just stores, they also own eyewear brands such as Ray-Ban, Chanel, Coach, Oakley, Prada, Tiffany, and so on. Yes, all of those brands are owned by Luxottica [2].Wait, not done yet. They also own insurance. Luxottica owns the vision insurance company EyeMed. [3]Still not done. Luxottica has merged with Essilor and now own multiple lens brands [4].See 60 Minutes story on Luxottica if you&#39;re not outraged yet [5].Where are the anti-trust enforcers in this country and other countries, and why are they not doing anything?[1] https://www.luxottica.com/en/retail-brands[2] https://www.luxottica.com/en/eyewear-brands[3] https://eyemed.com/en-us/about-us[4] https://www.essilorluxottica.com/brands[5] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDdq2rIqAlM"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Same reason medical care is so expensive in the US: Insurance and the art of the upsell. The provider gets to charge high prices because the bulk of the cost is covered by insurance and thus &#34;hidden&#34; from consumers. The insurance company gets a non-trivial cut of the pie, which pads the bill further. And in my experience, when you go in with something wrong with you, most doctors will recommend (or perform without asking) tests that aren&#39;t covered by insurance and you don&#39;t find that out until the bill arrives in the mail.I have a pretty standard vision insurance plan and need glasses roughly every two years. (Two pairs: one for indoors, and sunglasses for outdoors and driving.) I go into an optometrist office and get my vision checked. $10 copay or whatever for the exam. Then the pain starts. The frame selection is terrible and it turns out that the only decent-looking frames and lenses cost 3-4x what insurance will cover. And insurance doesn&#39;t cover more-or-less &#34;required&#34; add-ons to lenses like anti-glare coatings. And the person selling you the glasses is _very_ good at convincing you that you need all the extras.I did the math one time and I paid $200 per year for vision insurance to save $190 (including the cost of the exam) on one pair of glasses.The last time I bought glasses, I took my (recent) prescription to an online eyelasses e-tailer website and purchased a pair that included all the fancy extras for $60 out the door. I don&#39;t _love_ them, but I can certainly live with them for the price."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Warby Parker recognized this as a business opportunity. I’m surprised others haven’t jumped in as well with reasonably priced eyewear.&#34;This author is uninformed. Others have jumped in. And Warby Parker wasn&#39;t even the first.15 years ago I would buy my single-vision prescription glasses from optical4less.com. The cost was $58 for 2 pairs, including worldwide shipping.Today I buy my glasses from Zenni. Last month, I paid $176.75 total for two pairs of glasses, each with single-vision photochromic lenses (and one pair with additional blue light blocking)."</p>
