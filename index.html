								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work on a complex desktop application, and it&#39;s been astounding the number of bugs that have appeared over the years triggered by spaces and other unusual characters in file names. If you do anything with subprocesses or path processing, it&#39;s absurdly easy to hit in a thousand different ways, over and over again.Pro tip: rename your development directory (or even better: the workspace path in CI) to put a space and/or special characters in it.Forces you to deal with this properly, and immediately ensures that every automated test checks this case without you having to remember every time. Hasn&#39;t been particularly inconvenient, since I&#39;m autocompleting it 99% of the time anyway, and I haven&#39;t shipped a single path parsing bug since."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Define &#34;space&#34;.  Is the Hangul filler we talked about yesterday a spacing character?  Is the zero-width non-breaking space a spacing character?  What about the typographic spacing characters?You should better be very afraid of using spaces in filenames.You should do everything you can to support them but you have to know you&#39;ll invariably encounter countless cases where you&#39;ll have this or that tool that won&#39;t work properly with them.I still live in a world where I cannot name a song from the french group L&#39;impératrice with an eacute in the filename or my car&#39;s media system will display garbage (it&#39;s running QNX and I don&#39;t know which filesystem).FWIW, and it should be food for thought, every single Git repository in the world contains a pre-commit hook sample (disabled by default but it&#39;s there) that enforces that every committed file in the repo is named using a subset of ASCII characters.Every Git repository in the world has that example: let that sink in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have recently joined a team that had invested in Svelte. I had previous experience in Angular and React. I was happy with React, but I decided to drink the koolaid and go all-in and do my best with Svelte.6 months later, we&#39;re moving to React. It is partly because our Svelte code was messy enough to warrant a rewrite, and partly because we wanted to leverage the React ecosystem in that rewrite. It was also partly because I just don&#39;t like Svelte very much.I think Svelte is clever, and interesting, and I&#39;m glad it exists. But I found a few points insurmountable:- Too much magic. The abstraction leaks and when it does, it requires a good mental model of Svelte&#39;s magic. I noticed this threw our juniors off.- Special syntax for reactivity is not javascript- I find the javascript-native flexibility of JSX far more expressive than any custom templating- There are major tradeoffs made by doing things at compile time. Things that are easy in React at runtime turn out to be surprisingly difficult in Svelte- Two-way data binding is a constant source of bugs- Svelte practically requires let-style variable rebinding, often at a file wide scope, which again caused our juniors in particular to write bad code- The style system is too opinionated for me. I also find it necessary to break into the global scope for any minor restyling of a subcomponent (or worse, pass in the style as a prop)- Built in reactive store is cool, but our developers all ended up using it for tight coupling and global variables- The strict one component per file approach can be cumbersome. It&#39;s not possible to write a one-line function component or similar- Much smaller ecosystem than React, requiring much more to be done in house (exacerbated by all of the above).- The faster runtime speed in no way made up for any of the above. Bad Svelte code is still slow compared to good React code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this should be great news for Svelte and SvelteKit! Hopefully with Vercel&#39;s backing these projects will fly off.Having worked with React for about 5 years (with a project in Vue in-between) and now having dabbled with Svelte, there is just something more appealing working with less higher-level abstractions. Sure with large apps React does have its benefits and its ecosystem is larger by a good amount.But there is just something about being less annoying that to me is perhaps one of the most important things with any tool. If I enjoy using it, I don&#39;t mind that it may not be the &#34;current best choice&#34; of the moment. People who enjoy MobX especially I think ought to find Svelte quite nice.Sure though would wish SvelteKit was at the same level with Next.js. Fixing dev server errors is a little distracting at times."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such amazing news! Betting on Svelte was the best thing ever for both my career and sanity. I&#39;m now heavily involved in the Svelte community and next Saturday we&#39;ll be hosting our fourth conference solely dedicated to Svelte.If you&#39;re interested in checking it out the URL is here, it&#39;s free and will be streamed on YouTube: https://sveltesummit.comThere are also two watch parties that will be hosted in New York (Rich will attend!) and in Mainz, Germany.Links:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is something very fulfilling (at least to me) about working this way. Not solving the problem in the best way, but solving it in the way you can _right now_. When I was younger this was how I solved most problems, but in my professional life I can&#39;t really do that (and for mostly good reasons).I follow someone on YouTube who moved to a small island in Panama, built his house, many boats, and lots of other items by hand using what he has. He is definitely crazy but he personifies this get it done attitude. A few years ago I travelled to Africa to volunteer at a hospital and was tasked with fixing an oxygen machine. I had to channel this YouTuber because there definitely was not the right tools and I definitely needed to get it done. I honestly surprised myself in how I was able to fix it and it was quite fulfilling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of an 80s tv show called MacGyver which impressed on me as a kid that you can use what you got to get out of tricky situations.  I&#39;ve done loads of different things as a result of this attitude.  The only time I stopped to think about the show&#39;s wider influence was when I was at University (some time ago) in the Engineering building with my best friend (an Engineering student) and a phone went off with the MacGyver theme.  When I told my friend I thought that was cool (these were the days when you had to pay for novelty ringtones) he casually remarked that a lot of the Engineering student body had the MacGyver ringtone and MacGyver had a huge influence on students enrolling for Engineering.After reading this article I wonder if there are MacGyver-esque influences on younger generations?  I haven&#39;t come across any YouTube channels or shows on Netflix, Prime or Disney Plus that would interest my 7 year old son and capture his imagination like MacGyver did for me as a kid.Having said that, in true MacGyver fashion I started teaching my son Chemistry last weekend using a whiteboard, YouTube and some Minecraft analogies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice post. I have nothing in particular to add to this post except that several moons ago I worked with the author for a brief time. So it was surprising to see this name pop up here again. He&#39;s an interesting fellow who does some interesting dev work, last I checked was with WebGL, and I believe was writing a book at the time too.At that time, and due to the circumstances, I was kind of cranky and probably not terribly fun to be around. But I enjoyed getting to know @FarhadG through that time though. So if you happen to see this, hope all is well!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Shares of developer Fantasia Holdings (1777.HK) plunged 50% on Wednesday after it said there was no guarantee it would be able to meet its other financial obligations following a missed payment of $205.7 million due on Oct. 4.Watch the US bond market closely. Today saw a sharp selloff on the 10-year maturity, a favorite &#34;asset&#34; of foreign governments and companies. When those organizations get into trouble, they sell treasuries to raise cash. &#34;Trouble&#34; often comes in the form of dollar-denominated debt which must be serviced in dollars.As the dollar rises, borrowers of dollar-denominated debt must raise more local currency to buy the dollars to service their loans. That puts further upward pressure on the dollar, distressing foreign usd-debtholders even more. It&#39;s called a &#34;short squeeze&#34;:https://www.lynalden.com/global-dollar-short-squeeze/The entire world (including the US federal government) has taken a short position on the US dollar by assuming obligations requiring them to pay later in dollars. Ask any Ape on WallStreetBets what happens to shorts during a short squeeze, and you&#39;ll get the same answer: they get rekt.The dollar spiked past a key technical level today.https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=DXYIn 2020, a similar dynamic took hold, with stocks, bonds, and gold falling in price as the dollar surged. We may not be there yet, but the scramble for dollars in China (and possibly all of Asia) is just starting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting about this is that Evergrande is defaulting only on foreign held debt. Not internal debt after a ccp mandate.If their economy continues its downturn then this precedent would hold for all debt. I would really watch personal funds and investments and insure they dont hold any chinese debt as an asset."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is not even frontpage of ft, bloomberg etc. Bloomberg Europe TV station talks about Johnson &amp; Johnson factory problems in China but not Evergrande.My reading from above pieces of information:it&#39;s not that important yet. Maybe they will pay late again as they did previously when they were late one day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to know more about the &#34;built for devs&#34; concept you are presenting to us. What does that mean to you?For me personally, I rarely perform site:github.com or site:stackoverflow.com searches in my browser&#39;s default search engine. I typically just enter a few keywords and try to make sense of what I find.When I personally think of a search engine built for devs, I think of one that parses queries differently from the natural language processing that seems to be all the rage these days. For instance, when I search &#34;?. C#&#34; I want to know what this operator actually is. Instead,  the algorithm omits the ?. and just returns the most generic results relating to C#. https://you.com/search?q=%3F.%20C%23&amp;fromSearchBar=true This is true even when I put the &#34;?.&#34; in quotes. One of the results is titled &#34;Null coalescing operator&#34; from Wikipedia, but this is actually misleading since ?. is actually the null-conditional operator. The information is there but it is not easy to find.The other item on my wishlist for a dev-centric search engine is to be able to persist the main language(s) I am trying to search about. Its mildly tedious to type C3 and then my keywords (..... dammit, C#, this happens ALL the time), in each query to narrow things down and not get javascript results."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Google Maps may silently be Alphabet&#39;s most powerful property. As someone who has spent the last 8 months religiously degoogling my life, I&#39;ve found that Google Maps features are incredibly hard to replace, while at the same time, giving Google direct abilities to influence behavior in the physical world. People see it as &#34;just a map&#34;, but it&#39;s so much more. OSM-based map tools are pretty good as maps, but they utterly fail at being real-world information directories and functional tools for coordinating physical activities.I do have hope. It seems that there has been a lot of new enthusiasm for these tools lately, and some of them have key features in development.Two low hanging fruits: 1) location bookmarking features that can be synced between mobile/desktop with third party sync tools. 2) Link conversion features that can take Google Maps (or other map links) as input and open the location in OSM tools, and vice-versa.The real-world information directory is a much bigger challenge, but if the low hanging fruit features are developed enough that the average person could easily use open source / OSM tools for everything except a modern phone book, while still coordinating with peers who use Google Maps, then we&#39;d have a much better foundation for tackling the issue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; People will tell me to click that “unsubscribe” button. I will and swear I have before.Regarding this point, I&#39;ve had this suspicion of so many subscriptions – to the point where I was questioning my own memory/sanity on the regular. I finally set up a label in my Gmail inbox called &#34;Already Unsubscribed!&#34;. Every time I unsubscribe to a newsletter, I add a Gmail filter that marks anything from that sender with the &#34;Already Unsubscribed&#34; label. This way I know if I&#39;m just misremembering unsubscribing, or if I&#39;m actually being spammed.Incidentally, I just checked that label after about a year of doing this. As it turns out, there&#39;s only one company that&#39;s ever continued to email me after my unsubscribe request. So I guess my memory (or sanity) has been failing me all this time.(And no, the company is not Wikimedia) :P"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; But open the email and you don’t see that text anywhere!In the email industry, we call this a &#34;pre-header&#34;. The bit about &#34;multi-part email&#34; is pure nonsense. If you put any text above the body, it won&#39;t render in the email but will still be parsed by the inbox preview function (since it ignores any html it sees). This was mostly an exploit back in the day, but clearly email clients love it because they doubled down on supporting it.Having a different from and reply-to is also built into the way email was designed. Both of these features are built into every email client and service.I thought this was going to be a complaint about their clearly hyperbolic messaging, but OP is really frustrated about some of the most basic features of email. I wonder if he has yet learned that the letters he gets from the White House are not actually sent from the White House."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was very involved in GSoC from an open source perspective for many years. I think this is the best tweak they&#39;ve made in years. There is so much talent outside of the University system, and widening this will give lots of motivated people opportunities they otherwise wouldn&#39;t have."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Glad to see Google keeping this alive! I benefited a lot from participating in the GSoC program twice and I probably wouldn&#39;t be where I am right now without it! It can&#39;t be overstated how valuable the mentorship and open-source community experience is for programmers in the beginning of their careers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very exciting! I can&#39;t wait to sign up for it and then ultimately not do anything since I overcommitted myself."</p>
