								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a concern about REPL driven development, which is around how maintainable the result is.The reason people like REPLs is because they can experiment to discover the right way to write the code in a very fast feedback loop. This alleviates a huge pain when you are operating with uncertainties or at the edge of your knowledge - &#39;does this function return null if no matching entries or an empty list?&#39; - etc.The problem is that the reader of your code is not going on that journey with you. They are coming in naively without knowing all of that experimentation you did. The writer now has the opportunity to create code that &#34;just happens&#34; to work by a magic of coincidences and conveniences based on very subtle non-obvious properties of the APIs and systems they are working with. The reader is severely disadvantaged and will have a much harder time to reach parity with the state of knowledge that the writer had. For example, some property of a function or object may not be documented at all, but through the REPL the writer has ascertained it is true. How can the reader know this?So its a double edged sword in that the more you empower the original creator of the code, the greater imbalance you create to the later readers and maintainers of the code. Used well and with great discipline I could see it being very powerful and positive force to make better code. But in the worst case scenario, you&#39;ll end up with extremely unmaintainable code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having used Clojure and Common Lisp professionally, I think advocates for REPL driven programming universally overstate the utility of a first rate REPL.Yes, it’s nicer than Python’s. Yes, it’s convenient. No, I never ended up doing my development in the REPL first. Why? Because editing mistakes in a REPL usually sucks, because a REPL is not a text editor.What I ended up using heavily was REPL to file integration, which gave me the ability to write a function normally, evaluate it in the attached REPL session, and then play around with it in the REPL. This is far short of the “REPL driven development” that’s commonly discussed, and frankly something that’s probably possible with the Python REPL if they wanted to.Editing data and functions in the REPL is a neat trick, but it’s a double edged sword, because a REPL can crash, and it provides incredibly rudimentary support for diffing current state and migrating changes back to permanent files. I would never start with anything more than a trivial “how do I manipulate this list” in the REPL for that reason. Oh, and we had a lot of issues with REPLs getting into a bad state with Clojure due to multi methods and protocols; if you’re doing your primary work in the REPL, then having to restart it due to it becoming unstable really sucks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He&#39;s right to emphasize the properties of the systems that support interactive development with a long-running image. In Common Lisp, the difference between defvar and defparameter is a simple example. Traditional Smalltalk systems only supported image-based development. But I always preferred the moderate approach exemplified by most Lisp systems where the source code isn&#39;t overly entangled with the image state.As a long-time but now lapsed Lisper, I never understood some people&#39;s elevation of the REPL. A command-line REPL is a poor man&#39;s development environment. If you&#39;re doing interactive development in Lisp, you&#39;ll be far more productive if you use a normal buffer with eval-defun, eval-buffer and friends. When debugging, you&#39;ll primarily want auto-updating watch expressions and object inspectors. And when you do have good use for a REPL, you&#39;ll still want it to exist within a proper buffer with persistent history, inline object inspection, etc, instead of the low-effort rlwrap terminal experience which usually passes for a REPL.All of this holds doubly true for Smalltalk environments."</p>

That&#39;s a subjective term, but it&#39;s like the supreme court ruling on pornography, you&#39;ll know it when you see it.These guys most likely &#34;skirt the line&#34; to just operate as a mediocre and crappy content distribution network, that at scale, makes a lot of money because there is a certain subset of the population that will eat up any content at any quality level.Facebook decided they don&#39;t want to be a part of this type of content distribution, and they made a conscious business decision to not to engage with it&#39;s owners and operators because it will simply result in an exercise of splitting hairs and a reduction to the ridiculous.  They just aren&#39;t going to bring themselves down to the level... and I don&#39;t blame them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Facebook has systematically shut down our 2 small businesses during a pandemic and economic crisis without explanation.If you&#39;ve spent $57MM on Facebook ads, are you still considered a &#34;small business&#34;?  Perhaps I&#39;m out of touch.  I think the warning about building your business on someone else&#39;s land still applies but I&#39;m not sure how you get around that when so much of the world&#39;s attention is controlled by a few truly giant companies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ve had similar experiences with other google products:My mom forgot her gmail password and no longer had the same mobile number for a reset, the secondary reset option was set to my email but would not send a reset despite this. We had a live session via thunderbird but there were no channels of support. Luckily we were able to register her old mobile number to achieve a password reset, thanks to a helpful phone provider and NOT google.My mailserver is marked as spam by gmail, a helpful HN commentor pointed out it may be my lack of ipv6 which appears to be the cause. I have no idea why ipv6 would indicate that I’m not a spammer, I can’t ask google because they don’t have a support line.I understand others have far more expensive (read: &gt;1m$) problems with google specifically, and I know I’m not alone here.I just hope that by continually airing grievances with lack of (useful) customer service by major providers, they end up caving and investing in customer support.Until then, fuck you google."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Taking a look at your site, it seems quite clear where all your traffic went. You have a pretty great backlink profile compared to other affiliate sites ive seen but the content is incredibly thin. Based on this, me or anyone else who visits the site just sees an advertising site. There are no personal experiences with the products, the products are not related and the UX does not make the user want to continue exploring the page they landed on. The content here seems more like a statistics site for products than it is a reviews site.The other comments here mentioning cheap as a flag word are somewhat accurate but not entirely. Its possible to rank a site using the word cheap assuming you&#39;re supporting it correctly with related content about a specific product and proper explanation as to what makes it cheap.Honestly, I am very sorry that you lost all your traffic and your revenue but this seems like a VERY fixable problem considering your backlinks. Take your best performing posts, and dramatically increase the word count, add more photos, add overviews of each product instead of just a single line or two pulled from reviews.Happy to help with additional pointers if you want to shoot me a PM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of several posts I&#39;ve seen on HN lately following a similar trend: sudden and unexpected drops in search engine traffic. On the one hand it must be jarring to suddenly have a drop in traffic. But is it necessarily indicative of a bad administration of a search engine?Popularity of sites shift. People&#39;s tastes change. Even without an algorithm change we would not expect search traffic to remain constant. And algorithm changes do shift attention to sites that previously weren&#39;t getting traffic. Would the world better with static search traffic? The incumbents always win, and newcomers have a tough time getting a foothold. That&#39;s what it would take to avoid situations like these, and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s an improvement over the status quo. Between living in constant worry that the algorithm might change and shift search traffic, and a world where the algorithm never changes and search traffic remains rather static I&#39;m not sure which is really better. In the latter goodcheapandfast.com might never even have existed.Bing&#39;s blocking mechanism seems pretty crude, though, and not sharing why it was blocked seems particularly wonky. Sure it&#39;s a cat and mouse game between scammers and devs, but it&#39;d be nice if they at least vaguely alluded to why the false positive happened."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;[Line] fixed it by adding a random number to the user&#39;s destinationThis is a imperfect solution. There&#39;s two possibilities: the offset (aka &#34;random number&#34;) is dynamic, or it&#39;s fixed. If it&#39;s the former all you have to do is sample enough times to get through the noise. If it&#39;s the latter, it&#39;s not vulnerable to the previous attack, but if you have a known point of reference (so you can deduce what the offset is), then you can still stalk them (forever?). IMO the only way to do is &#34;properly&#34; is to quantize people into map cells, like how apple does it with their coarse location feature[1].[1] &#34;Apple doesn&#39;t reduce the accuracy of location fixes by adding noise. Instead, they&#39;ve carved up the world into regions, allowing approximate locations to preserve the user&#39;s current city when possible.&#34; https://radar.io/blog/understanding-approximate-location-in-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Clickbait.User explicitly shares location to all people nearby, discovers it is accessible to all people.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A user does not show up in “People nearby” unless they enable the function. Doing so triggers a warning from Telegram informing you your location is about to be published and it may lead to undesired attention so it really can’t happen by accident.I’m also using the app on iOS, the operating system asks periodically if I want to continue sharing location in the background (in case I forget to turn it off) or I can just choose to enable it while using the app (which is what I usually do)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So many dimensions come to play here.1. There&#39;s the obvious legal aspect i.e. how these laws are framed and interpreted.2. Then there&#39;s the geopolitical aspect. Is it fair to impose sanctions on Iran.3. There&#39;s another aspect around GitHub policy that asks if an entire organization be banned for the location of one team member.4. Finally, there&#39;s the aspect of relinquishing control. Your app development is on the cloud. IDEs are on the cloud. Deployments are on the cloud. App stores are on the cloud.You have relinquished so much control, why be surprised if that stares you back in the face?Ironically, Git is a decentralized version control system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US sanctions on Iran has such a massive impact on Iranians that most of us don&#39;t realise.All US companies have to comply and majority of the tech companies are unfortunately in the US.I know you can use a VPN and configure it on a router level to make sure that you are always connected via a VPN but just the fact that 1 slip-up can result in account level blocks (which google is notoriously good at and can essentially shut down your business) means no company would want to work with someone working from Iran.Coming from a 3rd world country, I know the problems of internet censorship which Iranians also face but being too toxic to touch for everyone outside Iran because the US leadership thinks so is just infuriating and heart breaking.Imagine being a programmer in Iran. Not only do you have less resources to learn and grow, you have a massive handicap to find good work as most work is outside of the country.Only bet is to leave the country but even there you have a very low probability as you basically can&#39;t have a trial period for your job as most companies don&#39;t want to risk having their accounts blocked.Most of us here know how degrading and infuriating the tech recruiting processes can be and now add to it the horrors of working from Iran.Wars are not supposed to have civilian casualties but this one has a generation of civilians being starved of information and experience critical for them to grow."</p>

We have so many cameras and microphones (one in each pocket).It&#39;s also scary to think if it goes wrong (the great filter for fermi paradox). However I&#39;m optimistic.The brain only uses 20 watts of power to do all its magic. The entire human body is built from 700MB of data in the DNA. The fundamental principles of intelligence is within reach if we look from that perspective.Right now GPT3 and DALL-E seem to be using an insane amount of computation to achieve what they are doing. My prediction is that in 2050, we&#39;ll have pretty good intelligence in our phones that has deep understanding (language and visual) of the world around us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;For other captions, such as “a snail made of harp,” the results are less good, with images that combine snails and harps in odd ways.&#34; [0]You try drawing a snail made of harp! Seriously! DALL-E did an incredible job[0] https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/05/1015754/avocado-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some truly impressive results. I&#39;ll pick my usual point here when a fancy new (generative) model comes out, and I&#39;m sure some of the other commenters have alluded to this. The examples shown are likely from a set of well-defined (read: lots of data, high bias) input classes for the model. What would be really interesting is how the model generalizes to /object concepts/ that have yet to be seen, and which have abstract relationships to the examples it has seen. Another commenter here mentioned &#34;red square on green square&#34; working, but &#34;large cube on small cube&#34;, not working. Humans are able to infer and understand such abstract concepts with very few examples, and this is something AI isn&#39;t as close to as it might seem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apple needs to give a little here.I think it&#39;s patently ridiculous that we have to enlist the assistance of console hackers in order to have a chance at porting the most used operating system in the entire world to run on hardware that in all likelihood already happily runs it inside of Apple&#39;s labs.&gt; In particular, we will be reverse engineering the Apple GPU architecture and developing an open source driver for it.This is all a noble goal, but I can&#39;t see this as being anything other than a complete and total non-starter with zero cooperation from Apple. After the street cred of getting a marginally usable OS up and running evaporates, why continue to take the effort of great engineers and waste it developing an ecosystem that doesn&#39;t care? It makes no sense to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very interesting overall.&gt; Apple allows booting unsigned/custom kernels on Apple Silicon macs without a jailbreak! This isn’t a hack or an omission, but an actual feature that Apple built into these devices.Indefinitely? How do we know it&#39;s a feature vs a temporarily convenient oversight?&gt; Our goal is not just to make Linux run on these machines, but to polish it to the point where it can be used as a daily OS. Doing this requires a huge amount of work to be done, as Apple Silicon is a completely undocumented platform. In particular, we will be reverse engineering the Apple GPU architecture and developing an open source driver for it.This looks like the major bullet point.  The wiki is currently empty, but while it&#39;s WIP, it would be nice to see some of the major milestones or breakdown of the goal mentioned above.Best of luck to Hector and the contributors!"</p>
