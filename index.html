								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Mac App Store gives a hint at what would happen if there was any choice.  The amount of software actually available for the Mac is far, far greater than what’s listed in the store.  Furthermore, while some quality and notable apps are still in the Mac App Store, many well-known apps are not there.  The number of lousy apps is also extremely high every time I go to search or just look at the front page, to the point where Apple does itself no favors by even drawing attention to most of the apps on that store (and it gives the impression that “most” Mac software must be like this).If they simply listed all major Mac apps, e.g. linking to their web sites or download links or whatever, they would hugely increase the value of the Mac platform and bring enough direct benefit to developers to be worth some kind of fee (and of course Apple gets $99/year anyway).  Instead, they tried to port the same clueless, greedy, review-burdened scheme to that store, layering completely unnecessary requirements on top (like poorly-thought-out sandboxing).  And since developers had a choice, they mostly said No."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a question about monopolies and market abuses.Apple released their phone in 2007, the App Store in 2008, and in-app payments in 2009. During that time their marketshare was fairly small, and it didn&#39;t start to really grow until they expanded availability to the Verizon network in 2011.Right at launch of the App Store, Apple announced its sales commission would be 30%. Then they extended that same fee to in-app purchases a year later. At the same time they set the rules that third-party app stores were not allowed, and that third-party payment processors could not be used.I&#39;m mentioning all of this history to make this point: Apple made these rules when they were not a monopoly by any definition. They released these products, with these rules, into a free market and let the market (both users and developers) decide which products to use and which products to develop for.Now, obviously, between 2007 and 2021 the iPhone has been a wild success. Its platform has grown in users and developers every year.So in terms of the framing of &#34;market abuse&#34;, at what point between the launch of these rules and now did Apple cross that threshold between free-market competitor who can legally control their own platform to monopolist abusing its power?I&#39;m asking this question not just to make a point, but because I think it will be instructive for future companies to understand where in the growth curve the rules they started with can potentially cross over into being &#34;abusive&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a German movie about the system that is used to gather TV ratings. It&#39;s a special box that some users get which reports what they are watching. Small sample size goes into a big statistic (not sure how accurate the portrayal of the system in the movie is). These boxes are given to the people who pay the German public TV fee, which excludes i.e. students (they don&#39;t have to pay) and some other groups. This group of critical people figured that out and started to hack into these machines to fake ratings. They faked the ratings away from stupid trash TV towards some higher quality stuff, documentaries, culture, ...
Obviously in the movie then the country saw a renaissance, everyone got smarter, yadda yadda, you get it.I feel like this is similar.
All tech savvy people block ads and analytics and at least the known tricks they use against us. So the internet only tracks the defenseless people and is then built to serve them (and or exploit them).Maybe we should engage in large scale AdWords fraud. Send come fake traffic away from Facebook and over to Wikipedia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I expected these numbers to be higher. However, an even more interesting metric is the 88% block in Firefox.Firefox may not have a great market share, but based on these numbers it&#39;s market share may very well be eight times higher than your analytics report. This can change the argument of &#34;it&#39;s only 3% of our users so we don&#39;t need to test on FF&#34; to &#34;it&#39;s a quarter of our user base, we should at least test it&#34;, depending on your target audience. I&#39;ve seen tons of people claim general Firefox usage is negligible based on public data from websites such as statcounter, but these metrics prove that those statistics are unreliable and should not be used.The best you can do is use server side UA inspection, though you can&#39;t really distinguish bots from real users that way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am amazed at how non-techy people use the internet. I teach college and I will sometimes have students go to some web site. I am amazed at how few use adblocking and just accept all the ads and popups and overlays and crap. Even more than that, I will see them using something like google docs and google will put an overlay for some new feature and they don&#39;t click the X to close it. They just type away with that overlay in the corner. That drives me crazy. I don&#39;t know how they do it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So many people in this thread don’t understand how enterprise decisions get made.The business license costs $21/month, probably less in reality.Do you really think that businesses are going to jeopardize the workflows of their $250k/year assets over a very core piece of software for $250/year?Any alternative has switching costs and risks. Companies will just pay this. I see so many people saying “just do these 10 steps and it’s basically the same”. It just ain’t worth it for $250"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Minikube&#39;s docker-engine and haven&#39;t missed DockerForMac for some time now.Minikube sets up a Linux VM using MacOS Hypervisor.It even has a convenience command to configure docker-cli/docker-client.  $ minikube docker-env
    export DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY=&#34;1&#34;

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This appears to be cutting of their nose to spite their face. We have a team of 50+ engineers that all use Docker for Mac for daily development tasks, but I suspect that will no longer be true in a rather short amount of time. Frankly, I don’t really know if anybody actually uses the UI components for it outside of starting and stopping the engine and for basic configuration of the VM. Everything else that comes with it is just useless cruft for our use cases.As soon as there is a viable alternative (and I’d be happy to contribute to the effort), I’ll be moving away from Docker for Mac."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It took me just a couple of minutes to find the bill in question, read up on it and find that most of the claims made in this article are incorrect.It&#39;s not &#34;rushed through parliament in 24 hours&#34;, it&#39;s been in a process since at least December 2020. The &#39;without a judge&#39; part is strongly misleading:  (5)  If subsection (4) applies, the applicant must:
  
  (a)  provide as much information as the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member considers is reasonably practicable in the circumstances; and

  (b)  not later than 72 hours after the making of the application, send a duly sworn affidavit to the eligible Judge or nominated AAT member, whether or not a warrant has been issued.

Subsection (4) is about immediate threats.The AAT&#39;s decisions &#34;are subject to review by the Federal Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia&#34; (Wikipedia).https://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display....This is just the digital equivalent of a police officer being able to arrest you without a court order."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m most curious about what they mean by &#34;ADDING&#34; data...Does this mean the police can create a social media account in your name? Imagine for instance that they suspect one of your family members of tax evasion. Can they create a fake social media account or email account registered to you, and impersonate you for the sake of entrapping someone else? Like hey uncle, love your new car, got any hot accounting tips? I don&#39;t even see anything in these laws that says the person whose data they&#39;re accessing has to be the target of the investigation.Imagine if at any time in any chat, even with your partner or parent or child, you couldn&#39;t know whether you were actually talking with them or a government agent, perhaps because someone they know is tangentially suspected of a crime - without the matter even being brought before a judge. Terrifying. This is how societies turn into places where everyone is completely fearful of saying anything at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a System76 Serval WS with AMD Ryzen 9 3900 and Nvidia GTX 1660 Ti manufactured last year. The laptop&#39;s internal display went wonky late last week but an external display still works fine. It&#39;s annoying to reboot -- the GPU drivers aren&#39;t loaded yet when the boot disk passphrase prompt is shown, so the external display doesn&#39;t show the passphrase prompt (and importantly: whether unlocking succeeded). It&#39;s within a 1-year warranty for parts &amp; labor. I&#39;m currently talking to with System76 support staff to ship it back for repair. The process has, so far, been easy and straightforward.In the past they had pushed a driver update that disabled the laptop display when multiple monitors are connected. I had recognized the problem since their system drivers are open source and was able to recommend &amp; review a PR to fix [0]. It was nice to see that patch go in.[0]: https://github.com/pop-os/system76-driver/pull/182"</p>

Something that improved them in the last 10-15 years, even incrementally.For example SSDs became much more common and affordable over the past 15 years and their parameters also improved.

Overall it doesn&#39;t feel like it&#39;s in the Wikipedia style and some parts are very editorialized, e.g.&gt; As extreme ironing has branched off, the conditions can gain in extreme activity. For example, a branch of ironing has been developed that includes both bungee jumping and well-pressed clothing. Bungee ironing is what some would call the ultimate in the thrill of extreme ironing.[8]That citation leads to https://averyj12.weebly.com/extreme-ironing.html, which was clearly copied wholesale from Wikipedia (all its links and citations go directly back to Wikipedia).Looking at the history, there have been a lot of edits since that text was added in 2007, so it&#39;s surprising that someone hasn&#39;t rewritten it since then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a long case history in front on the NRLB about whether or not employees can use employer&#39;s resource (ie notice boards, email system, slack) for organizing. In general the rule has been that if employees can use something for general non-work purposes (e.g. setting up a baseball game on the weekend) then the company can&#39;t stop them from  using it for organizing.However the specifics (e.g. what if there is a policy about what topics are OK, but some OK topics are non-work, or what if there is a general work-only policy that is selectively enforced against organizing) have gone back and forth depending on the administration.Apple&#39;s behaviour is probably a result of a 2019 ruling [1] which opend the door to this kind of thing. Given that the administration has swung back to being fairly labor friendly, it&#39;ll be interesting if this gets to the NRLB to see if they find a way to make this illegal.[1] https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/labor-board..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really think employer hosted employee activism is just ... always a problem.It&#39;s a minefield, and one with slack where the employer has all that data, what was said, and who... that&#39;s just a mess for EVERYONE.&gt;But that rule has not been evenly enforced. Currently, Apple employees have popular Slack channels to discuss #fun-dogs (more than 5,000 members), #gaming (more than 3,000 members), and #dad-jokes (more than 2,000 members).I would find those more acceptable if I were an employer, even an employee.Edit:  I had a bad typo in this post where I said &#34;employee hosted&#34; and intended it to say &#34;employer&#34; now fixed, thus some of the responses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt;Slack channels for activities and hobbies not recognized as Apple Employee clubs or Diversity Network Associations (DNAs) aren’t permitted and shouldn’t be created.Clearly the solution is to have an &#34;LGBTQ+ and pay equality&#34; channel./s if it isn&#39;t obvious."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In many ways I think this blog post really makes quite compelling arguments and honestly opened my eyes a bit.One (perhaps mad) idea for more secure access to a machine deep behind many levels of NAT where you, the sysadmin, have lawful access but are fed up with having to have a 12 KB ~/.ssh/config file in order to access it because of your university&#39;s overbearing IT department^W^W^W^W network topology, would be to &#34;just&#34; run an onionsite with onion services authentication [1], preventing it being publicly accessed without the pre-shared key. If your onion service just redirects to ssh (presumably with certificate-only auth) I can&#39;t help but think that this is almost an example of security by obscurity done right.[1] https://support.torproject.org/en-US/onionservices/client-au..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently had to do some basic sysadmin stuff over tor and I disagree with OP.Two things that failed mieserably, fetching a file that was just shy of 5M, and a reverse SSH tunnel.The SSH tunnel was unusable, it would only last for minutes at the most. I wish I could use mosh but that requires UDP.The file transfer was actually done with curl and the file was often incomplete.This was all done within Europe where we have the highest concentration of tor nodes.So no, I don&#39;t think tor is appropriate for sysadmin tasks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Most of the dissonance comes from the fact that a job is much more than the core activity.When we speak of pottery as a hobby, we think of handling clay, sitting in front of a pottery wheel, choosing a fitting glaze, then admiring our finished work. The focus is on exploring and enjoying the process. You have complete control over the process and you can do as much or as little as you like because there is no delivery pressure. Sounds fun!But a pottery business is a different beast. Now, the act of making the pottery is a much smaller part of the overall workload. You have to deal with marketing, sales, payments, inventory, and communications. Your pottery time is no longer about exploring, but about replenishing inventory or handling custom orders in time to avoid bad reviews. You can&#39;t just make a piece and be done with it, you have to carefully pack it, handling shipping, drop it off, and hope that nothing goes wrong. If it does go wrong, you now have to deal with the fallout and handle angry customers. Most customers are fine, but it only takes 1 irrationally outraged customer to ruin your day.Hobbies, by definition, can&#39;t be a job. You can try to make a job or business that includes your hobby, but it&#39;s a superset of the hobby with numerous other activities that you may or may not enjoy.I do actually know a lot of people who enjoy running businesses. You might say that businesses are their hobby and delivering results to customers is their passion. Not surprisingly, they&#39;re doing quite well in both business and the mental health department. Lucky."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first half of the article resonates with me. I didn&#39;t use to have hobbies and I used to feel like a machine just going to work, coming back, sleep, rinse and repeat. I love programming but after writing nth CRUD app in flavor of the month framework / technology, it just isn&#39;t that fulfilling anymore. I picked up couple of hobbies - teaching Sanskrit and playing guitar and my life has improved drastically. I no longer derive meaning only from work. Both hobbies are just hobbies and I do it for fun only with no intention of monetizing them. In fact, I couldn&#39;t monetize them even if I wanted to. Sanskrit is too esoteric to have any commercial value of any kind. And I truly suck at guitar. Nobody&#39;s ever gonna pay me to play guitar. But whatever I can play, gives me pleasure, so I do it. My dad asks me why I waste so much time in useless hobbies when I could be investing that time working towards next promotion and pay raise. I reply to him, they are not useless if they make me happy and content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Doing what you love&#34; is a total new-age garbage scam, only possible because we (most of us on HN) collectively live in the wealthiest, most powerful empire the world has ever seen, and nearly all of the important work (food, defense, fuel, manufacturing, etc.) is done by lower class citizens who don&#39;t know what an API is. Sure, the management of the empire requires critically talented minds, but how many roughnecks know what C++ is, and how many executive vice presidents know how to operate an oil rig?Don&#39;t do what you love, do something that allows you and your family (or you and your community if you&#39;re not up to the task of having a family) to build resilience, and then love your life outside of the work you do to provide for it. If that&#39;s making 200 Gs per year for 10 years slinging Javascript and then getting out of debt with the bank, do that. Don&#39;t worry so much about &#34;loving your career&#34;, I promise you no migrant farm workers harvesting your berries love their career, and yet I doubt they wake up with internal mental crises because they haven&#39;t achieved self-actualization at work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As I get older, the less I identify as my current state and the more I identify with the person who transitions through states. My change in perspective has reduced my anxieties and anger significantly. &#34;This too shall pass&#34; and all that. The more of my self image is focused on superficial things, the more I will take things personally. What we are angry about tends to be a reflection of ourselves more than the current state of affairs.If I see myself as a busy professional I might be much more aggravated by someone at the grocery store holding up the checkout line with EBT (since I am busy they must be lazy!). If I see myself as a social climber I will always be worrying if people are using me for something (since I am using them!). If I identify with my wealth I might develop some neurosis regarding the sight of the homeless (since they represent ultimate failure!).I don&#39;t believe in reincarnation but it is a helpful thought experiment to think about what benefits and drawbacks your particular incarnation of life holds and how those might be different if you were incarnated elsewhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t know if this is a mental hack or not, but I found years ago that if I mentally sing the comments (that I know would upset me otherwise), it totally removes the emotional impact of other people’s negative writing.When I was contemplating why this might be so effective, I was reminded that satire of old often involved singing to point out other peoples absurdity. When you think about how much the powerful fear humor and satire, there might be something there…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some people can be aware of what you think their emitions are driven by and use it for manipulative reasons when you react accordingly. Probably it is a good idea to treat people as  grown adults who can be responsible for their reactions whatever reasons are behind them."</p>
