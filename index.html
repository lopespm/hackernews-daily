								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like some of these perspectives are very tech industry focused rather than gamer focused.As a gamer, I think Stadia failed because the system they created doesn&#39;t make sense. You had to buy games at real $40-$60 prices but you could only play them through this limited service. I don&#39;t think anyone wants that.Compare that to paying the same price for a regular PC game which you can play via streaming using a streaming service, but also play locally, and know that you can take that game with you through multiple hardware decides and streaming services.With Stadia, if I move somewhere with bad internet, there is no way to recover the value of my games I purchased. There is no other gaming system like that. All other systems either have an offline possibility or are pure streaming where you aren&#39;t making a game purchase investment, like Xbox Gamepass or Luna.It just doesn&#39;t make sense except to a really small niche and is not competitive to the average gamer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As Google Stadia&#39;s target user, in my opinion a stronger reason Stadia died is because GeForce Now was a competing and better product.GeForce Now allowed me to play the games I already own with a more powerful machine than I could buy myself, for just $10/month. Artifacts were noticeable but not enough for me to care. If I bought my own gaming PC later, I would be able to continue playing the game there. GeForce Now offered &#34;Hey, you&#39;re playing Cyberpunk at 720p@25fps? Wanna play at 1080p@60fps for $10? And you can leave any time&#34; And I said heck yes.Stadia would have denied me the ability to continue playing on my own machine while charging me even more money. There are a bunch of stories of people with saved games trapped in Stadia. Google made no attempt to be better than the competition. It&#39;s like they&#39;re unaware of anything other than themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are advantages to game streaming but Google never really did anything with them, instead they just made a worse version of a console.The marketing at the beginning was confusing. Everyone had the impression Stadia was like a Netflix for games. But it was almost the inverse, Stadia is a free gaming console but the games cost money. At the very least Google&#39;s number one pitch should have been &#34;We&#39;re giving you a gaming console for free. You could buy a PS5 for $500 or you could play on Stadia for $0!&#34; (In practice the free tier of Stadia didn&#39;t have the greatest quality but many people didn&#39;t even know Stadia had a free tier...)Game streaming could have opened up new possibilities. Any YouTube game video  could have a button for &#39;play instantly, one click&#39; that loaded an already running Stadia session into a game-state with the player in a fun spot. YouTubers could have been able to hand off controls of their game session to viewers. &#34;Okay GodGamer420 spamming in chat, if you think this boss is so easy, now you have control. Show us how it&#39;s done.&#34;Even the lowest hanging fruit. The biggest advantage of game streaming is that it works on any device but Stadia didn&#39;t even work on most Android phones at launch, and for many months after."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"He’s right to do so. Statements that your research must be presented with a filter based on how it will advance political goals calls into question the integrity of all research. When people don’t “trust the science” this will be why.But further, I’d never seen the statement from antiracist before…wow. The idea that the only cure for discrimination is discrimination is akin to saying the only cure for violence is violence. It’s abject insanity that such a notion is being advanced in society.The cure for discrimination is forgiveness. The cure for violence is forgiveness. The cure for hatred is forgiveness.The only way anything stops is for people to have the humility and wisdom to say “this will stop with me.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My understand for how we measure systemic racism issues seems to typically be predicated on assumed outcomes.  For example that if the distribution of employees race does not match the general population then there must be a systemic cause for this.What I don’t understand is why that is assumed true.  If we want to encourage many different cultures to live together wouldn’t it naturally  make sense that different cultures would have different outcomes in job preferences?  How do you separate potential racism from cultural differences?My fear is if there are strong cultural differences that lead to disparate racial outcomes so organizations will always be able to point out that systemic issues exist even when they may be eradicated.  I don’t know how we measure this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Free Speech for Me--But Not for Thee: How the American Left and Right Relentlessly Censor Each Other (1992) [1] is a good read on how we got to a point where our ability to communicate across ideologies appears to be broken in many ways.For example, in 1963 Yale disinvited George Wallace, who was popular in the deep south, as a speaker. As a result, observers were deprived of a chance to hear opposing speakers&#39; arguments. To some, Yale appeared censorious. As Jonathan Rauch describes [2], that&#39;s not good for your case. Censorship is all these characters need to gain new followers. Wallace ran for president in 1968 and nearly forced a plurality which would have given him significantly more influence [3].Early episodes of the podcast So to Speak [4] by FIRE can inform the direction that can get us talking again. Basically, open and civil discourse is the way. The podcast demonstrates, through interviews with free speech advocates, a bunch of examples showing why that is a good target to shoot for, and how to achieve it.[1] https://archive.org/details/freespeechformeb0000hent[2] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E0T9XSG73kY&amp;t=4889s[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Wallace_1968_presidenti...[4] https://www.thefire.org/category/newsdesk/so-to-speak/page/1..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Funny I should see this on the front page of HN the day before I finish my Stellarium port for Nintendo Switch [1]. Unfortunately a lot of the UI code in the 1.0 release made it harder to port so I&#39;m currently basing the Switch version on the 0.xy tags, but it&#39;s still a great accomplishment for the Stellarium team!1: Unless I get approval from Nintendo AND Noctua you will need an RCMed Switch with Atmosphere to run it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Have been using it years for astrophotography planning.I&#39;ve never realized it was 0.x, as I haven&#39;t encountered a single bug with Stellarium in my lifetime either on desktop or on iOS.Great to see it promoted to 1.0 (though I think its more of a symbolic thing)!Lovely software, free and open source.

These include Australia, Canada, Germany, Finland, Ireland, the Netherlands, the UK, and the United States.&gt; ..PRC authorities ..use alternative means to apprehend fugitives. “Persuasion” has become a common tactic, which human rights groups have called “involuntary returns.” Such returns are achieved by threats against family members in the PRC, directly approaching and intimidating the fugitive overseas, or outright kidnapping ..Involuntary returns ..comprise a mix of genuine criminal fugitives, officials who have fallen out of favor with the CCP leadership, and others pursued for their religious or political beliefs.Earlier thread: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33049729"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As the report says:&gt; a seemingly recent campaign to counter transnational telecom and online fraud (according to the official provincial statements)The increase in telecom scamming activity is a real thing in China, with scammers operating from southeastern Asia countries. And operators are often Chinese citizens hired for what they originally thought would be &#34;oversea job with good pay&#34;. The &#34;persuaded to return&#34; strategy might be targeted primarily at them.Those scams are particularly bad -- maybe even worse than the telecom scams happening in the US and other wealthy English-speaking countries -- because taking personal loans is way too easy in China. A few clicks on a lender&#39;s app and you get cash transferred to your account instantly. And there are hundreds of such apps. Scammers can talk victims into maxing out their credit lines and wire the loaned cash away.And the fact that there isn&#39;t &#34;personal bankruptcy&#34; laws in China also makes it worse. Such loans are rarely forgiven and victims often had to pay them off with their future income for years out of the fear that loan defaults can affect their credit score for life.So I guess this is Chinese police&#39;s way of &#34;do something about it&#34;. Of course they don&#39;t have jurisdiction overseas and should have gone with Interpol and/or local police first, except that hasn&#39;t been very effective. My 2 cents on the reasons behind this is:1. Local police might be paid off;2. No incentive for local police to prioritize their resource for cases like this -- there were no victims in their own countries;3. There are just too many scammers;Surely once this set up is in place it&#39;s possible to extend its coverage to harass/&#34;persuade&#34; political dissidents but CCP has already be doing it for years without it. If this oversea police &#34;persuasion&#34; program is getting local law enforcement&#39;s attention to the point that they can arrest both them and the scammers, I would see it as an absolute win."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using &#34;persuasion&#34; in quotation marks is perhaps too nice.It&#39;s coercion, if not worse.Not that there is much we can do about it. Though limiting ability of Chinese authorities to operate outside china is fair. After all we don&#39;t permit organized crime either."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The TikTok pixel is not actually a pixel like in the old days. It is not a 1x1 transparent image loaded from their servers. It is executable javascript code. All you have to do to stop 99% of the corporate spying is disable unsafe remote code execution.It&#39;s hard to believe I have to say that after the many decades of people getting it drilled into their heads &#34;Do not open random email attachments&#34; but here we are in a dark future where everyone is going to say not automatically running untrusted code is stupid and not a real option. It is. And it works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah I had to implement this once because we ran a handful of ads on TikTok, so they wanted access to all of our traffic. I protested, saying they didn&#39;t need all traffic to do analytics for people who click through.. just tell me how to identify the traffic you need. This is fair, if somebody clicks on an ad then analytics would be expected.Yeah no, they didn&#39;t allow their advertisers to do that. I ended up getting permission to remove from the site when their pixel was found to be causing a performance impact for users. But without good monitoring for that they would have still been running, possibly for forever. I&#39;m sure this is basically how they get to be everywhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You can’t stop data collection from the tech industry altogether, but with a few simple steps you can make a dent in the amount of information that’s being collected.&gt; Use privacy-protecting browser extensions. You can add extensions to your browser that will do a lot to protect your privacy. One is Disconnect, made by the company that performed our TikTok investigation. The Disconnect extension shows you how websites are trying to track you and blocks a lot of that data collection. Privacy experts often recommend uBlock Origin, as well.&gt; Change your browser’s privacy settings. A lot of browsers have built-in controls you can use to block trackers, including cookies, pixels, and other technologies. Open your browser’s preferences or settings, and you’ll usually find the controls in the privacy section.&gt; Try a more private browser. Google Chrome collects a lot of data on behalf of Google. The Consumer Reports Security Planner recommends Firefox and Brave as more privacy-focused options.Case closed when you use uBlock Origin preferably with Brave or Firefox. As an extra measure I disable JS Unless it&#39;s really needed, and surf in a private/incognito session to stop cookies building up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s kind of crazy is how the images tend to have similarities in small features that become very apparent when flipping back and forth between images, but which are not obvious per se.For example, I flipped back and forth between Beatrix Potter and Paulus Potter. A rounded white bonnet in one picture becomes a couple of blossoms in the other. The roof of a house becomes some shadowy wall with plants in the other. Two flower pots are very similar, just with slightly different coloring.It makes it more apparent that the algorithm etches the images out of noise, and if the seed is the same for two images with different prompts, you&#39;re likely to see traces of that noise represented differently but recognizable in both images."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the million dollar question in psychedelic research today: Are the serotonergic effects of the psychedelic tryptamines primarily responsible for the therapeutic effects, or is the profound religious-mystical component indistinguishable from the positive changes observed? It is a profoundly expensive question. If pharmaceutical companies can deliver a pill that cures depression and gives life meaning without forcing users to face their angels and demons, then the FDA would give approval before the ink on the submission form had dried. As it stands, it would seem the predominant opinion in the community of psychedelic researchers is that the religious-mystical effects are the primary therapeutic vector.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"LSD:Multiple times I did it with others and profoundly deepened my relationship with those individuals.Another time I did it by myself and saw the face of evil and I&#39;ve never been so terrified, but I survived and wouldn&#39;t change a thing.I don&#39;t think any of that can be captured by whatever neuro-binding effect is being mimicked by these designed molecules.I also took antidepressants for awhile once and it was diet and exercise and commitment to changing my life and talking to a therapist that was what helped; but I know others who need to take pills every day or things go bad. I wish there was a short treatment for people who need that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From Plato&#39;s dialogue Phaedrus 14, 274c-275b:Socrates: I heard, then, that at Naucratis, in Egypt, was one of the ancient gods of that country, the one whose sacred bird is called the ibis, and the name of the god himself was Theuth. He it was who invented numbers and arithmetic and geometry and astronomy, also draughts and dice, and, most important of all, letters.Now the king of all Egypt at that time was the god Thamus, who lived in the great city of the upper region, which the Greeks call the Egyptian Thebes, and they call the god himself Ammon. To him came Theuth to show his inventions, saying that they ought to be imparted to the other Egyptians. But Thamus asked what use there was in each, and as Theuth enumerated their uses, expressed praise or blame, according as he approved or disapproved.&#34;The story goes that Thamus said many things to Theuth in praise or blame of the various arts, which it would take too long to repeat; but when they came to the letters, &#34;This invention, O king,&#34; said Theuth, &#34;will make the Egyptians wiser and will improve their memories; for it is an elixir of memory and wisdom that I have discovered.&#34; But Thamus replied, &#34;Most ingenious Theuth, one man has the ability to beget arts, but the ability to judge of their usefulness or harmfulness to their users belongs to another; and now you, who are the father of letters, have been led by your affection to ascribe to them a power the opposite of that which they really possess.&#34;For this invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory. Their trust in writing, produced by external characters which are no part of themselves, will discourage the use of their own memory within them. You have invented an elixir not of memory, but of reminding; and you offer your pupils the appearance of wisdom, not true wisdom, for they will read many things without instruction and will therefore seem to know many things, when they are for the most part ignorant and hard to get along with, since they are not wise, but only appear wise.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rachel Plotnick&#39;s book (Power Button, referenced in the article) is very good. Here&#39;s a much longer excerpt from it, on the button as it relates to carrying out life-and-death decisions (e.g., warfare and executions): https://thereader.mitpress.mit.edu/of-war-and-electric-death...(Full disclosure: I work for the MIT Press, who published Power Button. But it really is one of my favorite history of tech titles we&#39;ve published in the 10+ years i&#39;ve been here)"</p>
