								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a wonderful little game. The concept and execution is extremely concise but the thing that really sealed the deal for me was noticing the escalating difficulty by making the paddles shrink."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me use this thread to tell this somewhat related story of mine.When I was still at university we had a C class and were doing it in a computer lab with partners (back then very few students could afford a laptop). I was always partnering up with the same friend. Since we were a bit bored with the class we started building our own pong in C.
Rendering was done in ASCII in the command line, with paddles being 3 pipes, the ball a capital 0 and the walls &#34;#&#34;. We would spend some time at the beginning of the class building/improving it and at the end playing it. We used keys like &#34;W&#34; and &#34;S&#34; for the left player and &#34;O&#34; and &#34;L&#34; for the right player. Since the initial setup with rendering and &#34;physics&#34; of the game went quite fast, we thought about how to improve it and make it more fun.What made it incredibly fun (at least for us) in the end, was the addition of bonus squares. So, between the two paddles, if the ball that you just touched hit a bonus square, it would activate an effect for you or for the game depending on the bonus. We had:
- &#34;wall&#34;, would create a 3 squares wall at the location of the bonus
- &#34;turn of the lights&#34;, would hide everything but the ball (even the paddles)
- &#34;gun&#34;, would allow you to shoot and destroy walls and bonuses
- &#34;bigger/smaller paddle&#34;, self explanatory
- &#34;net&#34;, would temporarily put a net behind you preventing you from missing the ball
- and some more, like speed up the ball, add an extra ball, etc.It&#39;s been my one and only experience building a game but I think it was the most fun I&#39;ve had programming…
If anybody is up for re-building a pong with bonuses I&#39;d be definitely up for that ;)Back on the topic: love the implementation OP, pretty addictive. And, as can be read above, it brought back some nice memories."</p>

I take the opportunity to make you aware of the upcoming impacts of the Manifest V3 [1], and for those who prefer zip files, I recommend you to have a look here [2].[1] https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFile-Lite[2] https://github.com/gildas-lormeau/SingleFileZ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI - there’s an official standard (MHTML) for doing this that has existed for 20+ years and exists natively in browsers.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/MHTML"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the warning before installing in FireFox:    Add SingleFile? This extension will have permission to:
      - Access your data for all websites
      - Input data to the clipboard
      - Extend developer tools to access your data in open tabs
      - Download files and read and modify the browser&#39;s download history
      - Access browser tabs

... all of which I don&#39;t mind, as long as the extension can&#39;t exfiltrate any of the data it can access (send it to a third party). i.e.    - no network connections from the extension
    - no modifying web pages or executing any code in the context of a web page

Does anyone know whether these sorts of extensions can exfiltrate data? -- this is a concern if the project author&#39;s credentials are stolen by a threat actor, which has happened before."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another advantage to plain text files: source control. You can check your writing into git and get a history of all your edits.It’s something programmers take for granted, but it would be amazing if this got more widely adopted outside of tech. The number of files with names like “Report Final Final draft v3.docx” is truly staggering.“Git for everything“ would be a multi-billion dollar startup easily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Plain text adoption often implies markdown for a richer experience, but we also have the wonderful https://orgmode.org markup.There is no shortage of markdown-based tools on all platforms. Our org markup options, on the other hand, are very few outside of Emacs. Org markup itself is super versatile and can power lots of use-cases.I built two org-powered apps for iOS myself:https://plainorg.comhttps://flathabits.comThere are other great ones out there:https://beorg.apphttps://logseq.comhttps://organice.200ok.chhttps://orgro.orghttp://orgzly.comLastly, a shoutout to Karl Voit who&#39;s been driving org markup awareness outside of Emacs with Orgdown https://gitlab.com/publicvoit/orgdown. He&#39;s also discussed org markup&#39;s strengths at https://karl-voit.at/2017/09/23/orgmode-as-markup-only"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the main strengths of Obsidian, which I have been using lately and I’m extremely happy with: everything is just Markdown files in some folder on disk. Zero danger of lock in.You can have a disk hierarchy if you desire, or trust that search will find you what you are looking for. For me search works fairly well and if I need something extra I can just grep/sed/awk.Plus it has the features that a simple text editor will not have: displaying images, live preview, relationships between topics, etc. It even has a Vim mode!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think anyone who&#39;s claiming that remote work has been &#34;proven&#34; to be better or worse is wrong. There are some studies but they use estimations and proxies, carrying the same flaws as doing performance reviews based on lines of code.We&#39;ve proven that the big tech companies can go fully remote and not completely crash and burn, that&#39;s about it. Some people love the lack of commute and less semi-forced hanging out, some people hate onboarding on a new company as a remote person and so on and so on.I personally prefer a company where everyone&#39;s on site. I want to be able to quickly resolve any issues in person, not over voice call or slack, and I think that an environment where someone can tap me on the shoulder when they need help leads to overall higher productivity, even if individual productivity suffers temporarily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been fully remote my entire career (several decades), in fact in 30+ years have never been on site anywhere for more than 2 weeks total. Wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.But as a counter-point, seeing a whole bunch of people who were never remote before, how little work they are actually doing, it is no surprise to me that a lot of employers are going to start forcing - to the extent possible - employees back into the office.I think a small percentage of people are self-motivated, and more productively at home, but watching this all play out for the last 2 years makes me realize that an awful lot of people are going to try to get away with absolutely anything they can - including working as little as possible - when allowed to be on their own. I have had coworkers literally disappear for days at a time, miss meetings for weeks at a time, constantly miss deadlines etc - and as a manager, that is very hard to manage underperformers with a remote work force.Remote work isn&#39;t for everyone, and unfortunately there is a non-trivial percentage of the workforce that actual does need someone watching over them to make sure they do what they are supposed to be doing each day.Let&#39;s hope they don&#39;t ruin it for the rest of us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked at a startup where everyone being there was essential in how we worked. (We were all pair programming.) It was great. It beats code reviews any day. I learned a lot.But when I was at Google, we would schedule VC meetings with people in a different part of campus just to avoid the walk. Also, I worked on teams that had people worked out in many offices, mostly not Mountain View. I was surrounded by Googlers in an open-plan office, but it was often lonely. I ate alone sometimes. It was often not worth the commute.I think Google having a company-wide policy on this is nuts. Teams vary a lot. They should probably be left to make their own decisions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This feels like a major blow, as someone who just semi recently (probably around pandemic start) started getting into purchasing flac music from indie artists, Bandcamp was a great source of music. I understand nothing will change in the short term, but long term I am very concerned. Especially as streaming becomes more dominant and companies are less willing to provide flac based music and physical discs (where I can rip my own) continue to disappear.This feels like a potential last step of true music ownership and that makes me incredibly sad.That being said if anyone knows of any place to buy flacs of music with great selection would love to know (especially for Japanese music which I generally have to import, thankfully they love CDs)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is absurdly sad to me. I like to own my media (in the most practical sense that current IP laws let me do so). I run a Plex server and use PlexAmp as my primary way of listening to music, and my criteria are always this:* FLAC or similar, I want this to be a lossless preservation of what was on the best-available source.* No DRM. No mandated player. Just let me download a dang file.* &#34;Real&#34; flac: this is technically already covered under the first bullet, but I call it out because I&#39;ve seen it happen before: if I can open the flac in audacity and see it&#39;s obviously just a re-encode of a lossy format that clips the upper and lower frequency ranges off, that&#39;s a smell and I don&#39;t like it. (I know, most people can&#39;t tell etc, but this is less for listening purposes and more for archival purposes).* Supports the artist!Now, I&#39;ll admit, when push comes to shove, I drop the last bullet point first. So previously, my source for music was:1. CD&#39;s (and I would follow What&#39;s guide for making Perfect Flacs)2. WhatBut then what shut down and I lost my main music discovery mechanism. Enter bandcamp! Now I&#39;ve been very happy with:1. Bandcamp (I buy CDs because I like the artwork and they&#39;re cool).2. CD&#39;s (+ Perfect Flac ripping guide still)Now I&#39;m not sure what to do. Epic has really soured me on their brand already, and I already boycott their launcher and any EGS exclusives. I guess I have to find some other way to get stuff now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s been so frustrating watch this play out over the past decade.I keep seeing projects that could have been written as a traditional multi-page application pick an SPA architecture instead, with the result that they take 2-5 times longer to build and produce an end-result that&#39;s far slower to load and much more prone to bugs.Inevitably none of these projects end up taking advantage of the supposed benefits of SPAs: there are no snazzy animations between states, and the &#34;interactivity&#34; mainly consists of form submissions that don&#39;t trigger a full page - which could have been done for a fraction of the cost (in development time and performance) using a 2009-era jQuery plugin!And most of them don&#39;t spend the time to implement HTML5 history properly, so they break the URLs - which means you can&#39;t bookmark or deep link into them and they break the back/forward buttons.I started out thinking &#34;surely there are benefits to this approach that I&#39;ve not understood yet - there&#39;s no way the entire industry would swing in this direction if it didn&#39;t have good reasons to do so&#34;.I&#39;ve run out of patience now. Not only do we not seem to be learning from our mistakes, but we&#39;ve now trained up an entire new generation of web developers who don&#39;t even know HOW to build interactive web products without going the SPA route!My recommendation remains the same: default to not writing an SPA, unless your project has specific, well understood requirements (e.g. you&#39;re building Figma) that make the SPA route a better fit.Don&#39;t default to building an SPA."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have worked as an engineer on products in a lot of different domains in my career including:- edtech- real estate- HR/payroll softwareand every single project I&#39;ve worked on had enough complex state to benefit from using a SPA.I&#39;ve also worked on one complex web project run by someone dogmatically against client-logic, and it was absolute hell.  The codebase was full of janky hacks to approximate the same complex session state and full interactivity that a SPA provides trivially.This whole thread seems like a huge echo chamber of people who seem annoyed that FE development is getting too complex.But do you all really think that the entire industry is so disconnected from its needs, and the entire community of FE engineers just have their heads in the sand about the requirements of working in their domain of expertise?And to everyone saying SPAs are sometimes useful in very rare occasions, what web apps do you use regularly?  Gmail?  Jira?  Slack?  LinkedIn?  Figma?  Notion?  Docs?  Dropbox?  Airbnb?  Netflix?  Airtable? ...How many of these use javascript to do the heavy lifting on the client?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think one of the unsolved problems of client-side interactivity on websites is how difficult it is to add it just a little bit of extra client-side functionality to a traditional server rendered website. For example, recently I had to deal with photo uploads on a Rails app, which works fine out of the box at first, until you want to show progress bars and uploaded previews etc. Then you add a couple of client-side Stimulus controllers, maybe a Turbo frame here and there and it works, but then you get to browser navigation and you&#39;re screwed, because none of this works if somebody were to submit the form, then navigate back. Now you have to implement lifecycle handling to account for navigation and once you&#39;re done, you&#39;ve basically implemented a SPA, except it&#39;s broken into a mix of tightly-coupled Javascript, Ruby and ERB templates."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s discrimination any way you slice it. You can&#39;t lower the bar for one person without raising it for another so long as the class sizes remain the same. If elite universities are about providing education (a valid point of critical contention), then systematically barring Asians from entry is the same class of injustice litigated in Brown v. Board of Education. It&#39;s not enough to say you can learn calculus just as well at the University of Massachusetts.&#34;Here we find our first indication of the strength of preferences for underrepresented minority students. African-American students have nearly an 80 percent better chance of being admitted than their white counterparts, while the Hispanic advantage is reflected in almost 50 percent higher odds compared to whites. By contrast, Asian applicants and those from other races face lower odds of admission on the order of 17 or 18 percent—in relation to comparable whites.&#34;https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/tje/files/..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I attended TJ, back when it was about 30% Asian. I’ve always felt like the school should do more to get more underrepresented minorities. I’ve found the recent efforts very off-putting however.It’s based on a modern strain of social justice ideology that adopts some very ugly assumptions about Asians. I’m reminded of Alison Collins in San Francisco, who called Asians “house n—-ers” and said they use “white supremacist thinking to get ahead.” https://missionlocal.org/2021/03/alison-collins-school-board....Not everybody out and says stuff like this, obviously, but I sense the sentiment lurking under the surface in a lot of modern social justice discourse. In order to fit Asian economic success into their framework of “white supremacy” they end up making some extremely offensive assumptions. For example I’ve seen respectable articles arguing that the “model minority” stereotype arises from white people “allowing” Asian to be successful, to use them as a “wedge” against other minorities. I’ve been told to my face that Asians aren’t “grateful” enough to Black people for the Civil Rights movement and we “owe them.”You see a form of this in particular the discussion around TJ. For example, opponents of merit-based admissions act like test prep is basically cheating, and elevate its effectiveness to mythic proportions. I prepped for the TJ test and SAT. It consisted of going to some Indian dude’s house for an hour every Saturday for a summer. Not private tutoring—six or eight kids crowded around a small dining room table doing practice problems. If that’s a game changer what does that say about American K-8 math education? And they act like the cost makes it unattainable for anyone else. But it’s a few thousand dollars if that (as low as under $1,000) which is reachable to all but destitute families. My uncle does math tutoring in Canada. His students are all immigrant kids from the high rise subsidized housing complex where he lives with my aunt and cousin. (My cousin lived there until he got his engineering degree and MBA and moved to a nice apartment in Toronto.)The modern social justice folks blame all economic disparities on white people, and thus don’t even have the intellectual tools to explain what’s happening with Asians except through some distasteful assumptions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh no! This breaks my heart. :(David and Ron Crane hired me for my first job in California right around 2000.  I had no clue who they both were we just met at a trade show and I said I was looking for a job, we had this crazy interview where we just talked about anything and everything, and voila I was working in silicon valley. I think we spent about 2 hours talking about how we could float a balloon beside an AM radio station and how light up a light bulb...Anyways, who fresh out of school doesn&#39;t work for the inventor of ethernet/fast ethernet/a core founder of 3com, etc? I only spent 2 years working with them, and I&#39;ve always been looking to work with similar talent/kindness/etc.  How they put up with a fresh grad I will never know.I remember David and I working on an SDSL project, and we were just having the worst time ever.  We couldn&#39;t get it train and finish setting up the link, it did almost everything but then just failed at the end.  It was meant to be easy....but we just couldn&#39;t figure it out.  We spent a crazy amount of time on it, maybe a month.  Finally Ron got fed up, and asked &#34;have you tried reversing the pairs?&#34; and it worked!  Turns out we had plugged the cable in backwards, and trying to streamline/debug the code had removed the final bits of cleanup code that checked if the pair was reversed.  Ah well.They were amazing mentors and friends.  David invited me over to his home for wine tastings, to meet his cats (Palo and Alto), etc. I unfortunately lost touch with him over the years as I moved, he moved, etc.Thank you David, you welcomed me to California and you&#39;ll be missed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I ran across him years ago at a shooting event (he had a very cool Steyr AUG). He was humble, down to Earth, and just a really neat guy. Amazing to think how his work impacted us all.His one conceit to vanity? The personalized plate on his older Mercedes SL coupe was something like ETHERNT, which is why I initially approached him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First commercial Ethernet media (1980) also was a RG-8X coaxial cable using the circa-1940 RF connector called “N” (as opposed to the F or the unthreaded RCA phono connector).You could then do “simple” vampire tap into such Ethernet RF cable to expand your network.Because the then-10Base-5 signal is a guided RF-based wire, it was originally made to allow communication in one-direction only … at a time (half-duplex). Each end of the wire had to wait their turn (just like telegraph operators did by beaconing their intent to send info by pre-sending some well-known code).Both IBM and Xerox Parc diverged into Token Bus and Star network configuration to deal with this “half-duplex” issues using the same collision backoff algorithm.I think David unknowingly cemented the IEEE 802.3 standard as a winner when he prototyped the N-backoff algorithm for upcoming 802.3 for the 802 IEEE Working Group.This half-duplex constraint of 802.3 (and 10Base-5) technology was losing out to the IBM token bus (IEEE 802.5) methodology in maximum bandwidth utilization.Of course, without this N-Backoff algorithm, 802.3 wouldn’t have made the next step of leveraging a twisted pair (precursor to 802.3 10Base-T) possible to achieve this full-duplex and modern Ethernet we know to this day. Token bus and token ring both had effectively lost out in the Ethernet “Duplex War”.While Bob Metcalf may have made it possible the 10Base-5 communications, he also got a lot of hardware help so David Bogg actually did the thinking of backoff algorithm … at hardware level. And the PARC performance team refined the backoff algorithm to near perfection.Any error are mine and mine alone.  I was close enough to that circle, others may be closer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I experienced this in the extreme recently. I&#39;m a very experienced dev in a very in-demand field. Money is not a huge priority for me in my career. Flexibility is. I have a proven track record of success in part-time roles after converting to part time at my previous company (after 2 years of full-time, of course). I spent 3+ months trying to get part-time engagements, and was willing to consider both consulting and W-2 arrangements. I got interviewed and then ghosted by two companies, was offered a laughably low rate by a third, and a fourth showed interest but then basically told me that I&#39;d need to work a 40-hour week. I know that a vocal minority has success in part-time consulting, but it&#39;s quite difficult to accomplish if you live outside of a tech hub (I&#39;m based in Central Oregon) and don&#39;t have SV connections.Contrast that with when I gave up and decided to make myself available for full-time (remote) work. In the span of about 5 weeks, I got over 200 recruiter emails, interviewed at 10 companies, and received 10 offers, mostly in the upper end of the $200k-400k range.I firmly believe that this is a cultural block, rather than one that&#39;s rooted in rational/pragmatic concerns. Tech companies want to feel like they&#39;re getting your full intellectual output, even if that&#39;s demonstrably false in the status quo. There&#39;s also this issue that gets brought up of &#34;if Bob is gone half the time, isn&#39;t that going to breed resentment with his full-time coworkers?&#34; (answer: only if you have a shitty &#34;butts in seats&#34; management culture).I honestly don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to see meaningful change in this area for a while. The 40-hour work week is something that&#39;s heavily ingrained in tech culture, to the point where certain companies&#39; &#34;perks&#34; are heavily tuned towards incentivizing you to stay at the office longer and frequently turn that 40 hours into 60. I think it will take an external disruptive event on the scale of COVID-19 in order to change this aspect of tech culture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m working hourly on a contract where I advised the company I could only work 15-20 hours a week.  It can be a win-win I believe, but with tradeoffs for both sides.I&#39;m able to make the 3-4 hours of work a day be extremely productive.  I always deliver in fewer hours than were budgeted for the work.  As a contractor, there are no extraneous meetings to slow me down.  But I&#39;m still involved in client meetings as needed, understand their needs, and take ownership of the codebase to my immense satisfaction.It&#39;s not very different than working &#34;full time&#34; from home where you might take a walk, run an errand, cook your lunch, etc., but I can flex the schedule even further without any guilt.  The change in mindset from &#34;taking a break from full-time work&#34; for an errand versus &#34;I&#39;m not billing this hour, I&#39;ll do whatever I want&#34; is empowering.The negatives: less pay in total for me (but hourly rate can be negotiated), and features might (but won&#39;t necessarily) get done more slowly in terms of calendar days.BTW a typical day might be:- daycare drop-off 9:30, exercise- 10:30 shower, chores, life tasks- 11:45 cook and eat lunch- 12:30-4:30 work with a break for walking or playing pianoI do some &#34;down time&#34; thinking about problems as I fall asleep at night or on walks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two big reasons off the top of my head:1. Two people working a 20h week does not mean the same costs as a single person working a 40h week (think payroll, software licensing, pension admin, healthcare, etc).So costs rise as a result.2. A job generally has a base load of admin and toil (communication, on-call, interviewing, PR reviews, etc) and you can&#39;t reduce or distribute the base load well enough to yield productive output from the remaining work time with part-time workers and some of this adds more toil when distributed across more people (i.e. on-call requires more handovers during the week and takes more communication).So productivity is reduced.*For companies to consider doing this they&#39;d need to perform an trial to satisfy themselves that the above can be overcome. But even doing that may not be possible with existing employees and risks instilling discontent amongst those not in the trial. It&#39;s high risk to try.* Unless the entire company is 100% part-time and somehow base load is fundamentally reworked, in which case #1 still applies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;  Their goal is being able to suspend a game on your desktop and play it on your Deck will likely need them to standardize on a single platform [..] There are some additional challenges with this approach [..] but sticking to a single platform [..] removes some concerns with synchronizing lower level state across multiple platforms.My understanding with the suspend/resume stuff they&#39;ve talked about for the Deck is less about actually suspending/resuming the game by syncing some low-level state like memory or graphics, and more about quickly syncing save games via Steam cloud saves.I only had a quick look over their docs when the Deck was announced and from what I could tell you basically opt into a new system-level save behavior where at any point the Steamworks library can tell the game &#34;this device is going to suspend now, save your progress&#34; then another computer can start the game and immediately load up the save file, giving the impression of seamless suspend/resume.So as long as your save game files aren&#39;t OS specific in some way there&#39;s no reason why this should lock you into any specific platform, Windows or otherwise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly, it works both ways. I recently wanted to play some oldschool Command &amp; Conquer with some friends, and it was very easy to get these old games running in Wine, but my friends (with modern Windows laptops) couldn’t get it to work. Not even with compatibility mode.That was very interesting to me."</p>

Its best selling point was its compatibility with MS-DOS and Windows applications. However, this meant few developers took the time to write OS/2-native apps. So, why run OS/2 at all?"</p>
