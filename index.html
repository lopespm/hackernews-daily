								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Prior art&#34; for this is DNS block lists (DNSBLs).Typically these are used like this: your mail server gets an SMTP connection from some address (let&#39;s use the familiar IPv4 example): 10.20.30.40.You reverse these octets and do an &#34;A&#34; record dns query to some 40.30.10.10.dnsbl.example.com to look up that IP in example.com&#39;s list.  If a match is returned, the address is listed. If you do a &#34;TXT&#34; record query, you can find out why it&#39;s listed.Block lists are typically blacklists, but they can be whitelists as well.DNSBL&#39;s are hammered with queries from vast numbers of mail servers; DNS keeps things efficient."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think one of Tesla&#39;s biggest problems with any of their autonomous systems is the names they give those systems. They confuse regulators, reporters, and consumers.Most reporters seem to confuse &#34;autopilot&#34; with &#34;full self driving&#34; or vice versa. It&#39;s not uncommon to see sentences like &#34;Autopilot, a feature that costs $10k, is still in beta.&#34;Autopilot is cruise control that keeps you within a lane when it can. That&#39;s it. Other cars have it, and they&#39;re equally effective or ineffective.Full self driving, aside from being terrifying, does it all, and I suspect it&#39;s usually what regulators and reporters mean when they say &#34;Autopilot.&#34;I think if Tesla had used &#34;lane aware cruise control&#34; as the name for &#34;Autopilot&#34;, it&#39;d have helped reduce the number of times people confuse the two.Frankly, as an owner of a Tesla that has both features, I wouldn&#39;t mind at all if both were pulled from the software. FSD is absolutely terrifying. I&#39;d rather let my teenage son drive me than have FSD do it. Autopilot feels like a novelty. Given how frequently the car yells at you when you&#39;re not holding the wheel, it&#39;s hardly better than simple cruise control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My use case was autopilot steering me off the left hand side of the road at 80 MPH  during a sunset [1] My (WAG) guess is that the ML corpus was based on a model 3, while the model Y, I was driving, had placed the sensors slightly higher? I dunno; again, tis a WAG.I am a huge fan of Tesla&#39;s permise. My Dad sold Vanguard Citicars [2], and I worked on GM&#39;s interactive ad for the EV-1. I put a down payment on Aptera&#39;s original EV and again on the resurrected version [3].But, I backed out of buying a Tesla. Even though I disabled Autopilot and ran purely cruise control, the Model Y would brake for phantom obstacles. Such as: low rises in the road. Or: passing a 18-wheeler on the left. Driving from AZ to CA, the phantom braking was occuring every 5 miles or so. So, I had to drive 800 miles with a manual accelerator. Bummer![1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31504583[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citicar[3] https://aptera.us [edit]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I don&#39;t quite understand is that many cars have autopilot-like software. Unlike tesla&#39;s which constantly requires putting pressure on the wheel to show you&#39;re there and paying attention, Ford&#39;s lets you drive indefinitely without any hands on the wheel. Wouldn&#39;t this same investigation be put onto other manufactures as a giant audit? Hitting emergency vehicles is obviously bad but 1) it happens in cars without autopilot and 2) if you&#39;re hitting one you&#39;re clearly no paying attention. it&#39;s not like they just appear out of no where"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder if this is related...When I upgraded to Monterey (well, a beta, actually), I was met with a horrible bug that made me want to trash my laptop: my AirPods would randomly &#34;cut out&#34; for a couple of seconds for seemingly no reason. Sometimes it would take 5 minutes, sometimes 2 h. It was infuriating.I spent dozens of hours trying to figure it out. Disabling apps, enabling other apps, tracing logs, killing random applications, seeing if it was load-related, trying reboots. At one point I was half-convinced it only happened after coming back from hibernating (not suspending). I tried desperately to &#34;fix&#34; the bluetooth module, disable and re-enable handoff, delete internal settings, copy old bluetooth modules from older versions, working mostly tethered... Nothing seemed to fix it, until I found a message deep in the logs that led me to try to disable &#34;AirPlay Receiver&#34;.Voilá! It was instantly fixed. I documented my workaround here: https://www.reddit.com/r/MacOSBeta/comments/qjgqjx/i_think_i... and it seems it&#39;s spread a bit like wildfire through the internet. I should have put up a donation link :DWhat that journey taught me was that AirPlay, Wifi, Bluetooth and the like are serious messy beasts on macOS. I work with BLE sometimes while developing and I&#39;m aware of how messy it is, but it seems that macOS has so many features that it makes it far worse.In any case, my workaround is still working and I occasionally still get people thanking me for finding it. I doubt they really know how much time I spent, and how insane I nearly went, just to find that (un)ticking a little box would solve all of my problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I ran into this the other day and did a video about it - not the best quality video but shows it happening in realtime with analysis and commentary: https://www.dropbox.com/s/hra2uxx66kf7z0j/PXL_20220609_21480...The cause in this case was AWDL (Apple Wireless Direct Link.) Holding the Option key while clicking the Wi-Fi icon and clicking &#34;Enable Wi-Fi Logging&#34; and then checking /var/log/wifi.log will show AWDL scans starting and ending randomly, and when the scan is active it causes latency spikes every 1s like clockwork. Unrelated to AWDL, but if a process is requesting a Wi-Fi network scan (different from an AWDL scan), /var/log/wifi.log will also tell you the name of the process, such as &#34;locationd&#34; when the Location Service needs your location. (Tangential, but the locationd process rarely causes these latency spikes for me - on a default macOS install it very rarely requests scans in my experience, backed by my analysis of the log.)AWDL has to be used for things like AirDrop, so it&#39;s expected to have this latency increase while you have the AirDrop window open scanning for nearby devices / sending files to other devices. There are other uses of AWDL (AirPlay, Auto Unlock, Universal Clipboard at the very least)[0], but I don&#39;t know what was triggering it so actively in my case... and why it wasn&#39;t happening on my M1 Air. It also wasn&#39;t always happening in the background like this, it just started that day.The &#34;fix&#34; was to disable the awdl0 interface, but that may also cause AirDrop/AirPlay and related services to not function (I did not test.) It&#39;s easy to re-enable it though.To disable:
  ifconfig awdl0 downTo enable:
  ifconfig awdl0 upUpon disabling, the latency spikes go away permanently.[0] https://owlink.org/wiki/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You would be mistaken if you thought switching to ethernet would fix everything in macOS. There are three options for USB Ethernet chipsets that are supported in macOS without drivers: RTL8153, AX88178, AX88172A (not B or C). When using a RTL8153, I&#39;ve experienced extremely high CPU usage (it&#39;s a shitty user-mode driver), and I&#39;ve had the adapter drop out after transferring &gt;20GB of files over it. I ended up buying the AX88178 and AX88172A adapters which are supported by the kernel. Based on my limited testing, only the AX88172A chipset is stable enough for 24/7/365 connectivity. Unfortunately the AX88172A is only 100Mbit, so consider it if you value stability &gt; throughputThe thread that sparked this rabbit hole:https://discussions.apple.com/thread/252387604TLDR: 2022 and we are still stuck with 100Mbit adapters on macOS"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Holy shit, I’m hiking with this guy right now on the AT!! This was a two-year COVID passion project that Andy made with his brothers (one coded it, the other made the music, he designed all the pixel art).It’s SO cool to see this on here. I’ve been tracking him using it when we get separated. Andy, if you see this, hello from Deadweight :)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He&#39;s currently at Palmerton, PA/Lehigh Gap. The hike up out of town is steep and completely unshaded. You absolutely bake on a sunny day. Once you hit the top of the ridge, the trail looks out over the old zinc smelting plant for the next five or so miles. It&#39;s absolutely one of the most striking parts of the trail.The ridge is basically bare of trees, AIUI because of the plume of pollution from the zinc plant. A Walk In The Woods (the book, not the execrable movie) goes into some detail.12 years ago when I hiked through, the ridge was covered in low berry bushes, possibly as some sort of bioremediation effort. I did not partake of the berries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Project dev here if anyone has any questions- on a technical side, the app is built with Unity WebGL wrapped in a vue.js wrapper. The JS side handles pulling the live data from the server and determines the best Unity scene to show given the parameters- time of day, weather at his last known coordinates, and the location itself.I wrote a separate vue.js progressive web app that is installed on his phone so he can write updates while he&#39;s outside of cell coverage, and they sync when he has internet access again.The backend is a Node server on an AWS EC2 instance that dumps all of his updates and hourly weather data into a postgres database. Everything is timestamped, so we will be able to replay the trip or add an interactive timeline when he&#39;s done."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I was deciding whether this venture was worth committing to another year of 70+ hour weeks. I need a higher level of certainty than investors do because my time is more valuable to me than their money is to them.Investors place bets in a portfolio of companies, but I only have one life.Both startup founders and investors alike seem to forget this (for obvious reasons) so it is good to put this on your toilet wall so you see it often."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, author here.I&#39;m surprised (and delighted) to see this back on Hacker News. I&#39;m happy that people find value in the article, and the process writing it forced me to put my thoughts together and helped get me through an emotionally difficult time.To address a few questions from the comments.1) A common opinion is that I gave up too quickly, that I was just burned out, or taking the money would have let me figure things out later. This was simply not the case. An experienced mountaineer knows if a mountain is climbable with the team, gear, and weather he has. This one was not.2) I would have been 100% fine with the team and investors going ahead without me, but AFAIK, neither side ever discussed it.3) We were absolutely not viewing contract information, and would not have been able to do so even if we wanted to. We anonymously logged when functions were called without storing user or input data of any kind.4) Six years later, I&#39;m doing well. The Disrupting Japan podcast is going strong.  I took a senior role in corporate VC for a while, and ended up at Google.I was overwhelmed by the attention and positive response I got from this article. The asymmetry of value of money and time was one of my main learnings, and I&#39;m glad to see it resonates with so many other founders."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;My team and most of my investors are pissed,I know it is childish,  but I always enjoy this difference between US and British English.In British English when someone is annoyed they may be described as &#39;pissed off&#39;. Describing someone as being &#39;pissed&#39; means they are drunk! These US articles paint such vivid surrealism in my mind. In this case I love the idea of all of the investors being permanently inebriated.There is a lovely part of the &#39;special relationship&#39; where the US doesnt care what the UK thinks of them, and therefore the UK has great fun at their expense. I suppose that is a win win situation? The US projects an image of being the leader of so many things, and the rest of the world jokes about how arrogant this is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a few hundred hours under my belt with a dining table, chairs, and even something with a roof to show for it.For me, a huge chunk of each project’s fun was planning.  Going through my first two prototypes in Sketchup (rather than in real life) was a massive amount of fun.  That part really was not so different to hacking code, really.The physical work itself is then completely different to software engineering.  Nothing is simple — every step of the project presents some unique problem that you have to work around carefully.  Maybe you forgot to include the width of the saw in a measurement.  Or your stock has a knot in exactly the wrong place.  Or you didn’t plan the assembly in the best way to optimise for clamping. Or you drip glue awkwardly and have to clean the first of six benches up before oiling.  Or you want to add a shamfer in an awkward place to a piece you’ve already partly assembled.Imagine having to stop work every few hours to hone the edge on an IDE that’s gone blunt.  Imagine running out of 8mm if-statements (dowels) and having to improvise some more so you can peg a project together.There’s no homogeneity with a natural product.  Everything is slow and methodical with few opportunities to hack / test / prototype.  You have to think and solve problems that you never thought would happen in a new kind of way because you can’t roll back or undo.Above all, there are many things you just cannot automate.  Sanding up the frame of a pergola getting it ready for oiling is going to be O(n) at best, with only ever a single processor to throw at the problem which itself is hard bounded by mealtimes and hours-in-day.I love it because it’s not like software."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great. I took up woodworking last year. The only thing about it that bummed me out is how expensive it is. I didn’t expect that. There’s a saying: “Why would I buy my wife a $500 dresser when I can build it myself for $1000?”Very true with wood unfortunately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why some software engineers like woodworking.I have been a software engineer all my working life, and I absolutely despise woodworking or anything that smacks of DIY.  I find them unbelievably stressful and frustrating partly because I can see how I want things to be, they never work out nearly that good and I can never fix them."</p>

Untangle your self-worth and your workWhen you are passionate about your work, it can easily bleed into every other area of your life — you read about work-related topics in your free time, you think about a particularly challenging problem in the shower, you journal about your work, etc. It also changes ones social circle: hanging out with an ambitious and curious start-up crowd easily leads to work as the default topic in a gathering of friends. Once you have work deeply embedded in your interests and social life, it does not take a huge mental leap to &#34;work is what defines me as an individual&#34;.That then leads to a precarious &#34;all eggs in one basket&#34; situation that leaves you vulnerable in cases of professional failure (&#34;My start-up is not doing well; I am a failure&#34;) or burnout (&#34;I&#39;m cynical about my work; nothing matters&#34;).It took quite a bit of time to disentangle my self-worth and my professional identity, but it makes life so much better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s unfortunate that the entire article is focused on toxic productivity as a feature of individuals, as though their personal/psychological shortcomings are to blame.I think it is worthwhile asking what are the cultural, structural, workplace conditions which contribute to people feeling like this in the first place.  Are people more likely to have &#39;toxic productivity&#39; when they are having unrealistic deadlines/workloads thrown at them?  Does management foster a hypercompetitive environment?  Does being tethered to Slack/Teams contribute?  Do specific workplace methodologies such as Agile, etc have an effect?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So we&#39;re just rehashing workaholism with a modern spin? We really are just living through a cycle that endlessly repeats. I&#39;ve started reading books and listening to interviews done in the early 1980s and I&#39;ve been astounded as to how the culture at the time was almost identical to what we&#39;re doing now. It&#39;s down right creepy but when I think about it it&#39;s not unexpected. From my point of view, that&#39;s exactly 1 generation. My peers and I have no memories of the period and so it makes sense that we haven&#39;t learned any of the lessons from that time. Thus we&#39;re doomed to repeat them now that we are the ones dominating the economy and the culture. It makes me wish for a more thorough survey of modern history to be taught in schools, I&#39;m sure that with enough research you could identify significant trends that repeat on a regular basis which you could then teach to students so that they had some warning of what was to come and could perhaps break out of the cycle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From 2006 to 2014 I owned my own platform.  Several actually.   But I turned them down after it became a lot of work to maintain.  At the time, it wasn&#39;t so obvious the web was dying, but in hindsight I probably helped kill it.In the beginning the web was so new, and growing so fast, with new things, amazing sites, and more people getting online. Like all things in life, competition arises, and better sites started getting much more of the market share.   People&#39;s expectations for what a website could offer rose tremendously, and would abandon a site if it wasn&#39;t up to snuff.   Sites needed to have ever improving visuals, better content, better people, better interactivity, better everything.And I couldn&#39;t keep up with it.  Users went from being happy to try out something new to dismissive and bitter.  More and more it felt like work to try to make them happy, to keep building more and better things.   And that&#39;s exactly what happened.   The Internet became work.   It&#39;s why we all have to be paid to come to work and build the Internet.  No one does it for free, because it&#39;s a thankless grueling job.   The only websites that survived were the ones that made money, and could afford to use that money to hire people.   Google, Facebook, Myspace, Stumbleupon, 9gag, and even Something Awful became money oriented rather than community oriented.   They had to, or else.The advice to &#34;Always Own Your Own Platform&#34; is a euphemistic way of saying make a whole company out of your site and underpay the only employee (you) for ever.   The reason we don&#39;t own our own platform anymore is because it&#39;s soooo annoying to do so.   It wasn&#39;t an accident."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Distribute [your content] via methods you control.I&#39;m being nitpicky but it feels off to me to call people out on owning their own platform but then use Cloudflare&#39;s CDN instead of running their own. And if they did run their own CDN, they would probably have to use AWS or another worldwide cloud provider and not own the hardware. And if I were Richard Stallman I would probably come down on you for using proprietary chipsets in your hardware instead of totally open source hardware. And you can just keep going deeper and deeper with this train of thought. So what level of ownership is acceptable to this website&#39;s author? I feel like the right balance of &#34;ownership&#34; is super subjective.I love a lot of traits of the &#34;old-school&#34; web and am a huge believer in self-hosting as much as possible. But imo yelling at people while on your high horse doesn&#39;t encourage anyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven’t read it before, don’t read the Wikipedia summary; read the actual story. It’s easy to google and pretty short.Isaac Asimov said it was his favorite story he’d written. He imagines the entire history of the future of humanity, to the end of time, in a few pages. Really a marvelous story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my favorite things about HN, is how, every once in a while, some obscure cool thing I have not hear about before gets pointed out, which, I find cool. But then, we &#34;hug it to death&#34; in the HN vernacular. Which is also really cool. Some neglected corner of the web that someone cared about, suddenly, a bunch of us nerds jump on it and recognize the nerd-coolness of it. I love that. Hope this was OK to say and not too off topic. I just love that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This feels relevant: Roger Penrose - Why Did Our Universe Begin? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ypjZF6Pdrwstl;dw: It is well known that the universe expands, tracing this back in time leads to the singularity called the Big Bang. But is it possible to ask for a &#34;before&#34; the beginning of time? What is time? Time is what we measure with clocks. What are clocks? Something that returns to the same state (say, a pendulum, or the earth orbiting around the sun - a &#34;year&#34;). To be able to build a clock you need mass. Only objects with mass, moving below the speed of light, experience time. In the very far future, after all stars have burned out, the only objects remaining will be black holes. Eventually, even they will decay due to Hawking radiation. So in the end, there will be only expanding space, and radiation that &#34;travels to infinity&#34;. Photons themselves do not experience time as they move with the speed of light. Without mass, without anything that has a notion of time, the concept of distance becomes meaningless. The universe will become spacelike. Without distances, the universe may as well be a singular point. Like the Big Bang :)"</p>
