								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before my comment gets dismissed, I will disclaim I am a professional structural biologist that works in this field every day.These threads are always the same: lots of comments about protein folding, how amazing DeepMind is, how AlphaFold is a success story, how it has flipped an entire field on it&#39;s head, etc. The language from Google is so deceptive about what they&#39;ve actually done, I think it&#39;s actually intentionally disingenuous.At the end of the day, AlphaFold is amazing homology modeling. I love it, I think it&#39;s an awesome application of machine learning, and I use it frequently. But it&#39;s doing the same thing we&#39;ve been doing for 2 decades: pattern matching sequences of proteins with unknown structure to sequences of proteins with known structure, and about 2x as well as we used to be able to.That&#39;s extremely useful, but it&#39;s not knowledge of protein folding. It can&#39;t predict a fold de novo, it can&#39;t predict folds that haven&#39;t been seen (EDIT: this is maybe not strictly true, depending on how you slice it), it fails in a number of edge cases (remember, in biology, edge cases are everything) and again, I can&#39;t stress this enough, we have no new information on how proteins fold. We know all the information (most of at least) for a proteins final fold is in the sequence. But we don&#39;t know much about the in-between.I like AlphaFold, it&#39;s convenient and I use it (although for anything serious or anything interacting with anything else, I still need a real structure), but I feel as though it has been intentionally and deceptively oversold. There are 3-4 other deep learning projects I think have had a much greater impact on my field.EDIT: 
See below: 
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32265662 for information on predicting new folds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got a 5th grader question about how proteins are used/represented graphically that I&#39;ve never been able to find a satisfying answer for.Basically, you see these 3D representations of specific proteins as a crumple of ribbons-- literally like someone ran multi-colored ribbons though scissors to make curls and dumped it on the floor (like a grade school craft project).So... I understand that proteins are huge organic molecules composed of thousands of atoms, right? Their special capabilities arise from their structure/shape. So basically the molecule contorts itself to a low energy state which could be very complex but which enables it to &#34;bind?&#34; to other molecules expressly because of this special shape and do the special things that proteins do-- that form the basis of living things. Hence the efforts, like Alphafold, to compute what these shapes are for any given protein molecule.But what does one &#34;do&#34; with such 3D shapes?They seem intractably complex. Are people just browsing these shapes and seeing patterns in them? What do the &#34;ribbons&#34; signify? Are they just some specific arrangement of C,H,O? Why are some ribbons different colors? Why are there also thread-like things instead of all ribbons?Also, is that what proteins would really look like if you could see at sub-optical wavelength resolutions? Are they really like that? I recall from school the equipartition theorem-- 1/2 KT of kinetic energy for each degree of freedom. These things obviously have many degrees of freedom. So wouldn&#39;t they be &#34;thrashing around&#34; like rag doll in a blender at room temperature? It seems strange to me that something like that could be so central to life, but it is.Just trying to get myself a cartoonish mental model of how these shapes are used! Anyone?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lawrence Lessig (Harvard law professor famous for fighting for sane copyright law) does a great presentation on the root cause of Americas problems. He also ran for president in 2016.It can be watched here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJy8vTu66tEThe short version is that to win primaries you need money. Money mainly comes from corporations and rich people. Taking money from corporations and rich people creates a relationship where you have some loyalty to them or they can punish you if you don&#39;t act how they want. Thus the primary corrupting force in America is pro-corruption campaign finance laws.The test for democracy is whether elected politicians pass legislation that the public at large wishes to be passed. Our very own Princeton did a study to answer this question.The key finding: “The preferences of the average American appear to have only a miniscule, near-zero, statistically non-significant impact upon public policy.”[1]In a very real, non hyperbolic sense we are in a plutocracy where money rules. We are not a democracy due chiefly to our campaign finance laws.Here is a campaign that aims to work on this:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hear me out...  few people want to run for federal office already.  The pay isn&#39;t great and it&#39;s hard work.If the US was a company, there&#39;d be no question that we&#39;d need to pay our leadership much better to attract top talent.  We pay senators $170k a year to manage our country with a $20 trillion economy.So what we end up with is activists who crave power and elites from rich families for whom $170k a year is a rounding error.  Those families then use the power from being in office to enrich their families even more.One solution could be to double or triple pay for US representatives along with banning stock trading and things like &#34;speaking fees.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been collecting and sharing (@QuiverCongress on Twitter) data on stock trading by U.S. congressmen for the past couple years.While there is currently legislation that requires congressmen to disclose their financial dealings, enforcement around it is incredibly weak.Congressmen are supposed to disclose stock transactions within 45 days of when they are made, but in practice there are dozens of violations of this rule which result in hardly a slap on the wrist. I&#39;ve seen a couple cases of politicians conveniently waiting till after election cycles to disclose controversial trades.While I&#39;m generally pessimistic about the odds of congress voting to regulate itself, I&#39;m still hopeful that something comes from this push. There&#39;s certainly a lot of room for improvement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tried the cheeseburger recipe. Got the question: &#34;The best indicator of freshness for ground beef is:&#34;I chose &#34;(B) Smell.&#34; Because, you know, that&#39;s the answer (though I&#39;m not sure why I&#39;m starting out with a food safety question).I got a snotty response that I wouldn&#39;t be able to smell things that are in a sealed package, and I should always go by the manufacturing date printed on the package.No. You&#39;re wrong. And you&#39;re wrong about food safety, which is really not good. You go by smell, sliminess, color. The printed date is a nice guide but NOT what anyone should be using for food safety.And on top of that, your question doesn&#39;t say that you&#39;re not allowed to open the package (which... why? in what situation would you be staring at your package of ground beef and refuse to actually open it?) (Edit: Later on it&#39;s revealed that this is a quiz about shopping. So a bit of framing/context setting is missing.)Now I&#39;ve completed the food safety and &#34;do you know what lean meat is&#34; quiz, and I immediately go into another quiz about buying cheese. It wants me to say which cheese is hard and how to store cheese. What does this have to do with cooking a cheeseburger? I gave up.It&#39;s like you&#39;re trying to suck the life and enjoyment out of cooking. This is boring and nothing to do with what I want.It seems like a knowledge graph the way you&#39;ve done it is an anti-pattern of actual cooking. You&#39;re decomposing every recipe into its ingredients and then asking arbitrary questions about each one. Those questions have nothing to do with the final dish, or how the ingredients work together, or the choices you would make in making this specific dish. It&#39;s just &#34;oh, a burger has onion, here is a random question about the history of onions.&#34;What you need is something that shows how the ingredients interact. This is the opposite.EDIT: I don&#39;t mean to be TOO harsh here; I like your mission and the effort you&#39;ve put into this so far. I don&#39;t think a framework of focusing on ingredients in a vacuum, having people get quizzes wrong, and calling them &#34;Junior Chef&#34; is the way to do it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Please, please, please,  avoid status cuisines. It&#39;s going to be hard to do, because they make good PR. But you will be helping your users a lot more of you hold them off with a ten foot pole. What do I mean by a status cuisine? They are meals that are intended to show that the cook is a worthy person, rather than that the meal is practical, healthy, and good to eat. Here are some examples:The endurance cuisine: designed to show that the cook has time to spare, the endurance cuisine requires that no ingredient is pre-processed in any way. Grind your own grain, bake your own breadcrumbs, chop your own veg. Using grapes? You should have peeled them!The hair-shirt cuisine: you have to endure some discomfort if it&#39;s good for you, right? This cuisine specialises in sour tastes and unpleasant mouthfeel -  often using grains that our stone-age ancestors sensibly gave up for nicer ones.The gold plated cuisine: this one&#39;s obvious. Pricier ingredients must be better - or at least show how much the cook can spendThe obscurantist/connoisseur&#39;s cuisine: it can&#39;t be good if it&#39;s easy to find. The cook can only be good if they know exactly how many &#39;extras&#39; you need in your virgin olive oil, and what classification of wine you should put in your coq&#39;au&#39;vin.(Okay this is a bit tongue in cheek - but only a bit. I really do think a lot of recipes are unnecessarily onerous in some way)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve done a few quizzes on the app now, and I don&#39;t get it. The questions feel very contrived, like someone had a quota to fill so just put whatever looked plausible together. They are also _very_ culturally specific.Questions about eggs barely made sense to me being from the UK, with incorrect pack sizes, animal welfare terms, and completely missed our great standards body that makes it easy to know which eggs have met a reasonable quality bar. It&#39;s not that the info is globally applicable, it&#39;s that it&#39;s an awkward combination of wrong and useless depending on where you live. Starting another quiz about kitchen equipment it seems this is a pattern throughout.Cooking is deeply embedded into culture, tradition, region, climate, regulatory environment, retail infrastructure, and more. I don&#39;t think these quizzes will be able to overcome this without being fully localised per country.The recipes? Maybe they&#39;re better. I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m still 7 levels away from being able to know how to make scrambled eggs.Edit: when I opened the app the first time it asked me how experienced I am and I answered the 3rd out of 4 options, I know my way around a kitchen. The app just asked me to match pictures of eggs to how they have been cooked: fried, scrambled, etc. I&#39;m not sure I can survive this level of patronisation, it&#39;s honestly a bit insulting.Edit: &#34;what sort of pan should you cook eggs in&#34;... &#34;no not a wok, people don&#39;t have those at home&#34;. Ouch. At best that&#39;s incredibly sheltered for a food writer, and at worst it&#39;s practically racist."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why is our society so incapable of providing a small box for people to store their valuables? Banks are trying to drop the concept almost entirely.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"After reading a long form interview with a FBI Whistleblower out of their Minneapolis counter-terror office (will link if I find it), working in another part of the govt myself in a previous life, and having some exposure to FBI tech recruiting and related programs, I am convinced large parts of the FBI are horribly inept at providing their core competencies in a changing world.They display the dangerous balance of huge scale and access with an inability to hire well outside of key roles (legal for people trending DoJ, special agents in flagpole jobs, etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One interesting and troubling aspect of this  that I read in other reporting is they asserted a lot of the cash seized was drug money on the basis of drug contamination, but the FBI has deposited at least some of the cash into trustee accounts at financial institutions so no longer has the physical cash to test, thereby making it impossible to test again and show that it was just, for example, trace cross contamination from the boxes rented by the cannabis dispensaries to store their cash. To me that seems like borderline destruction of evidence.I think the only reason this hasn&#39;t completely blown up in their face is they did manage to nab some shady characters, but the ends don&#39;t justify the means."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think that MS here is being used as a convenient scapegoat. This worry was never expressed at the time in significant terms. The FAT and SMB patents were much more of a worry than anything related to the desktop interface - only outright clones were being pursued.At the time, KDE, GNOME and Ubuntu developers alike, were simply drunk on popularity. Linux usage was in ascendancy, money was being thrown around, and the FOSS world was starting to attract young designers who saw it as a cheap way to build professional credibility. And then the iPhone happened and the whole UX world just went apeshit. The core teams really thought they had a shot at redesigning how people interact with computers, &#34;like Apple did with phones&#34;. Interaction targets moved from keyboard+mouse to touch screens, because &#34;convergence&#34; and the fact that the mobile sector was suddenly awash with cash.It&#39;s sad that people try to justify their missteps in this way. Microsoft was (and is) a terrible company and a constant threat to the FOSS ecosystem, but defining some of the biggest design choices of the Linux desktop only in antagonistic or reflective terms does a real disservice to those projects and the people who worked in them.If experience is the name we give our errors, refusing to accept errors were made means stating you&#39;ve learnt nothing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was the lead designer of Unity. Unity was not a response to patent concerns, but rather the manifestation of a convoluted OEM strategy involving exclusive distribution of distinct design features, and a write-once-run-anywhere dream of running Ubuntu on any device from netbooks to big screens to automobiles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is news to me.  I remember that the Linux desktop seemed to be on the ascendancy back in 2006.  GNOME 2 and KDE 3 were very nice desktops; while they weren’t Mac OS X Tiger (which still holds up as an amazing desktop), they were solid contenders to Windows XP.  But then came GNOME 3 and KDE 4, which were major fumbles that set back the Linux desktop for years.If it’s true that GNOME’s radical direction beginning with version 3 is the result of threats from Microsoft to change its desktop to avoid influences from Windows, then that definitely changes my assessment of the era, and my distaste for Microsoft’s anti-competitive behavior only deepens (this is the same Microsoft that complained about Apple’s look-and-feel lawsuits)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really nicely written; kudos to the author for compiling a great deal of information in a readable format.If I can be forgiven one nitpick: Poetry does not use a PEP 518-style[1] build configuration by default, which means that its use of `pyproject.toml` is slightly out of pace with the rest of the Python packaging ecosystem. That isn&#39;t to say that it isn&#39;t excellent, because it is! But you the standards have come a long way, and you can now use `pyproject.toml` with any build backend as long as you use the standard metadata.By way of example, here&#39;s a project that&#39;s completely PEP 517 and PEP 518 compatible without needing a setup.py or setup.cfg[2]. Everything goes through pyproject.toml.[1]: https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/[2]: https://github.com/trailofbits/pip-audit/blob/main/pyproject..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a great article.We start with learning that we absolutely need this Poetry thing because… it&#39;s what everyone else uses. It&#39;s refreshing to see author who can skip usual badly argued justifications and just plain admin that he does not know shit and is just following rest of the herd.
Then we continue by &#34;solving&#34;  depependencies by usual way of ignoring them and just freezing whatever happens to be present.Then there is inevitable firing up of virtualenv, because that&#39;s just what you have to do when dealing  with messed up dependencies.Next one is new to me. Apparently, one does not just set up git hooks nowadays but use separate tool with declarative config. Because if you ever happen upon something not covered by the Tool, that would mean you are no longer part of the herd.Then we push our stuff straight to pypi, because of course our stuff can&#39;t possibly have any dependencies outside of python herd ecosystem. It&#39;s not like we knew our dependencies anyway.Then comes the fun part, pulling in tox, because when you have special tool to handle dependencies, what you just need is another tool with different environment and dependency model.Code quality section I will just skip over, seeing what pass for code quality these days makes me too sad.
What follows is setup of several proprietary projects that modern opensource seemingly can&#39;t exist without.
What is more interresting is &#34;tyding up&#34; by moving code from git root to subdir. Now, this is of course perfectly sensible thing to, but I wonder why is it called &#39;src&#39;? Maybe some herd memeber saw compiled language somewhere and picked it up without understanding difference between compiled binary and source code?Now don&#39;t take this as if I have problem with the article content in itself. No, as a primer to modern python packaging it&#39;s great. It&#39;s not authors fault that his work is so comprehensive it lays out bare all the idiosyncrasies, herd mentality, cargocultism and general laziness of python ecosystem these days. Or is it?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish people would just forget about pre-commit, this thing is especially useless in a setting where a CI/CD pipeline exists. It&#39;s not that hard to write a simple Makefile or shellscript to run linters on push.Pre-commit is one of the most annoying tools that have come into existence in recent years that everyone seems to be cargo-culting. It doesn&#39;t play well with editors since in order to find the actual binary path, you&#39;d have to open up a sqlite database to fish out the virtualenv pre-commit created. Pre-commit also increases maintenance burden, since its configuration is completely separate from your usual requirements-dev.txt/pyproject.toml/setup.cfg etc. If you have dev dependencies in one of these files because making your editors to find the pre-commit created binaries are hard, now you have to keep both versions in sync.I really don&#39;t see the point of any pre-commit hooks unless you are the one guy that doesn&#39;t use a modern CI/CD platform."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like this, the Dropbox career framework, and the Monzo career framework. I synthesized all three recently into one that I keep for our company, and the work pays such dividends. We do quarterly performance reviews and not only does having a consistent standard make these fair, but it reduced my time to write them from 1 hour per report to about 30 min.https://dropbox.github.io/dbx-career-framework/

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a nice idea to things like this _in theory_. Medium has something similar they called Snowflake - https://github.com/Medium/snowflake ... but note the disclaimer...&gt; Heads up: Medium isn’t using this tool anymore, but you’re welcome to!The problem with things like this is the typical engineering mindset, when shown a graphical or numerical analysis of their performance will zoom into analyse every detail and in the end it&#39;s just backed by the managers impressions and judgement.For similar reasons I have a strong opinion that engineers shouldn&#39;t be paid performance related bonuses, because no matter what happens, it&#39;s just going to upset them - the best case - maximum bonus - just equates to a &#34;meh&#34;. Better to pay a good base salary upfront ...Anyway use tools like this with caution IMO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This attempts to recreate https://sfia-online.org/en , but it is way harder than one imagines and then is in danger of being too prescriptive and inapplicable.It&#39;s better to go the other way and work out the principals behind progression... that the further in their career the more ownership, agency, and scope they have. Most things can be guided by merely understanding the principals of it.This very old doc (from Sun Microsystems engineers IIRC) remains excellent https://web.archive.org/web/20090420152505/http://mark.kampe...It speaks to the spirit, the principals, behind progression... and that makes it extremely applicable to lots of fields, personal paths, and environments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tolkien on Tom in Letter 144:I might put it this way. The story is cast in terms of a good side, and a bad side, beauty against ruthless ugliness, tyranny against kingship, moderated freedom with consent against compulsion that has long lost any object save mere power, and so on; but both sides in some degree, conservative or destructive, want a measure of control. but if you have, as it were taken &#39;a vow of poverty&#39;, renounced control, and take your delight in things for themselves without reference to yourself, watching, observing, and to some extent knowing, then the question of the rights and wrongs of power and control might become utterly meaningless to you, and the means of power quite valueless. It is a natural pacifist view, which always arises in the mind when there is a war.The Letters of J.R.R. Tolkien 144: To Naomi Mitchison. April 1954"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, Tom Bombadil is the introduction of natural magic. He is nature, indicating to the reader that there is a source of magic beyond the elves, Wizards, and Sauron.There are many magical creatures in Middle-Earth without a described source, which to me makes the whole story feel more magic. The Ents probably being the chief example.Another important role of Tom’s is his introduction of magic and power outside of the “good vs evil” struggle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Possibly the least liked character in The Lord of the Rings. A childish figure so disliked by fans of the book that few object to his absence from all adaptations of the story.I&#39;ve been a fan of Tolkien for decades, and this doesn&#39;t match up with my experience at all...Tolkien fans seem to generally love Tom, and many were deeply disappointed that he wasn&#39;t in the movies (even though his exclusion makes perfect sense). Did I just run in different Tolkien circles than the author?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel some of the OP points. I was working on a profiling agent lately, and one of the issues was running it on multiple platforms (just the four big ones linux/mac-x86/arm) on FFI (because it&#39;ll be run directly from python/ruby/etc...) and preferably having the thing just work without having to install or configure any dependencies.Like OP I hit two walls: libunwind, and linking. For libunwind, I ended up downloading/compiling manually; and for linking there is auditwheel[1]. Although it is a Python tool, I did actually end up using it for Ruby (by creating a &#34;fake python package&#34;, and then copying the linked dependencies).It was at that time that I learned about linking for dynamic libraries, patchelf and there is really no single/established tool to do this. I thought there should be something but most people seem to install the dependencies with any certain software. I also found, the hard way, that you still have to deal with gcc/c when working with Rust. It does isolate you from many stuff, but for many things there is no work around.There is a performance hit to this strategy, however, since shared dynamic libraries will be used by all the running programs that need them; whereas my solution will run its own instance. It made me wonder if wasm will come up with something similar without affecting portability.Finally, the project is open source and you can browse the code here: https://github.com/pyroscope-io/pyroscope-rs[1]: https://github.com/pypa/auditwheel"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve found rust incredibly portable. I’ve hacked around running the same server side app on the web (WASM), PC/Mac/Linux, iOS, and Android.  Another project is a web app running on iOS and Android leveraging a SQLite DB."</p>
