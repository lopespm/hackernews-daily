								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Essentially the government has built a surveillance state by outsourcing it to private enterprise.I think it would be interesting to know how people really feel about this. I would love to see a survey that actually truly explained the trade-offs and see how people felt about it, eg avoiding the “ should government be able to subpoena records from private business” but actually ask questions like “is it OK with you that with a subpoena that the government can get a list every website that you have visited?” And then present the trade offs and abuse cases.  I really think that we’ve allowed the surveillance state to form without actually having a meaningful public debate about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can download some of the data that Verizon retains from your own cellular use here: https://www.verizon.com/support/download-and-view-vpd-file/When I did it, I could see they recorded IP addresses, time stamps and data transfer volume of every web site that I visited over their network, along with cell tower connections. It was fascinating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The slide also shows that AT&amp;T retains “cloud storage internet/web browsing” data for 1 year. When asked what this detail entails exactly, such as websites visited by customers on the AT&amp;T network, AT&amp;T spokesperson Margaret Boles said in an email that   “Like all companies, we are required by law to comply with mandatory legal demands, such as warrants based on probable cause. Our responses comply with the law.” The document also mentions that law enforcement can request records related to wearable devices from AT&amp;T.&#34;do you know what this “cloud storage internet/web browsing” data looks like?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not a Constitutional scholar, but I would bet SCOTUS rules this kind of warrant illegal. Google certainly has the resources to take the case that far.AFAIK a warrant usually is tied to a specific person or a specific crime. In other words, if an explosion killed Harry McHarryface, then it would be constitutional to ask for names of people who searched for Harry.Or if the fertilizer used in the bomb was shown to have been purchased on March 10, then maybe a search for &#34;fertilizer&#34; in the weeks before March 10 would be allowed.But not a generic search.Just my opinion that&#39;s not legal advice."</p>

That they suck up all the data from media companies to have a mega-graph?  That they are running accurate simulations of us (Sentient World Simulation), in order to better manage us?And don&#39;t expect anything to change - Google et al could change this is a minute - they have the lobbyists to get whatever they want.  They don&#39;t want.  This is good for the government and the corporations.  In fact, what&#39;s the difference?  We are living in technocratic fascism."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience is, # of engineers is directly related to # of product people, which is in turn related to quantity (not quality) of ideas that the founders/leaders are desperate to try out.Higher quantity of ideas == More engineers. Higher quality of ideas == Fewer engineers.WhatsApp success is not about what WhatsApp did, it&#39;s about everything they didn&#39;t do. No desktop, no browser (until after reaaaaaaallly long), no account creation (your phone number is enough, thanks), no hidden ad engine, no hundreds of stupid features that product people stuff down in the name of experimentation.There are some leaders who want anything and everything: Throw 100 darts in the wall. Leave what sticks (don&#39;t touch or nurture it). Go back to throwing 100 more. The other guy does that? We want that too. Mobile? Yes. Desktop? Yes. Browser? Yes. Different affiliate channels? Yes. Custom features for B2B partners? Yes. Merchandizing? Yes. Build a mini Ad engine? Yes. Multi user profile management systems? Yes. Yes, yes, yes, every requirement is a go.The crucial difference is: What happens when you have a restricted pool of people, but insist on doing 100s of things? Some leaders simply treat this as an &#34;org structure&#34; problem, not a problem of focus. They slice and dice the org until the 30 people become split into teams of 2-3 with a manager for each, running into coordination hell on each step – just so that more quantity of features can be seen on paper. This is how most startups are, except for those rare few which don&#39;t &#34;talk&#34; about focusing, but actually focus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m honestly not that surprised about the size. In my experience, efficiency and the number of engineers have not necessarily correlated.For example, I used to work for a company with about 500 employees (relatively large by German standards) and now work for a competing company in the same industry with less than 150 employees. The core engineering team only consists of a dozen engineers.The output is noticeably larger. The number of new features and especially the stability is significantly better. It is noticeable that due to the small team, each project has one or two &#34;heroes&#34;. They are responsible for most of the commits and know the system inside out.These &#34;heroes&#34; have been working on the same or similar systems for over 30 years in some cases and have experienced a lot in their careers. As such, they can bring experience and advice that is just out of reach for others.Given the choice, I would always prefer a small team over a large team."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I looked at it this way. The thing most engineers, hero&#39;s or not, want to work on is new projects and to build products customers enjoy. The last thing they want to work on is maintenance. In my last personally owned company, small as we were, the engineering team and I documented how things worked as part of what we did every day. We found that by having the inner workings documented so that anyone in the team could effect a repair or update a piece of code freed us to work on new products and services. Just having the system continually documented freed our minds and kept us mostly happy (everyone has a challenge from time to time) and productive.The documentation, not that it really matters, was done in a MoinMoin wiki. It was written by engineers, for engineers. We didn&#39;t stop marketing or sales or anyone else from reading it, but the target audience was the engineering and operation staff thus no one had to over-explain the vocabulary of our architecture."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. I&#39;m surprised to see my hobby project on Hacker News.I know this kind of stuff spark the ``it&#39;s meaningless to rewrite everything (especially Linux) in Rust&#39;&#39; debate. I agree 100% that rewriting Linux in Rust (or your favorite language) is just a waste of time and such a project won&#39;t live long.That said, what I&#39;d say here is that it&#39;s fun. Really fun. Implementing ABI compatibility requires you to understand under the hood of the kernel. You can learn how printf(3) works. You can learn what happens before main().Especially, in Rust, it&#39;s inspiring to explore ways to write a kernel safely and expressively. One of my favorite part is the implementation of read system call [1].Lastly, You can try this OS on SSH. Hope you enjoy :)    ssh root@kerla-demo.seiya.me

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just to clarify goals of the project:&#34;I completely agree that rewriting existing large, feature-rich, and robust operating system kernels is not a good idea. However, a question came to my mind: what are the pros and cons of writing a practical UNIX-like OS kernel in Rust from scratch? How does it look like? This is why I started this project.&#34;[1][1] https://seiya.me/writing-linux-clone-in-rust"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rewriting the Linux kernel in rust would be a rehash of why we ended up with Linux in the first place: rewriting an older OS from scratch.I would love to see a solid implementation of a real micro kernel based OS based on a message passing core in Rust to become a viable alternative to the now 50 year old Unix architecture. This would give us a possibility of some real progress on the security and process scheduling front, both of which are severely lacking in the Unix model."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For C++ many standard library functions can&#39;t be implemented in standard C++. And it not only shows some very obvious compiler built-ins in the library, but the library can depend on behavior guaranteed by the compiler which is otherwise undefined by the standard. Therefore it&#39;s not always wise to learn techniques from the standard library, as it can depend on implementation defined behavior, and this dependence can be subtle too.Not too long ago it was impossible to implement std::vector in standard C++, as constructing objects next to each other formally did not create an array. Therefore pointer arithmetic on the resulting pointers were undefined behavior, as pointer arithmetic is only defined within an array.This was fixed by the array being implicitly created in certain circumstances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My advice would be: to learn a new language, simply start writing some non-trivial projects in it (a few thousand lines of code or so). In some languages (like Python), the standard library is the actually important feature, in other languages (like C), it&#39;s better to mostly ignore the stdlib. Example: I started learning Zig by writing a Pacman clone (https://github.com/floooh/pacman.zig) and a home computer emulator (https://github.com/floooh/kc85.zig), the Pacman clone doesn&#39;t use any Zig stdlib features at all, and the emulator only minimally for memory allocation, parsing command line args and loading data from files.Zig&#39;s stdlib is much more useful than C&#39;s, but it&#39;s still entirely possible to write useful programs without it and instead focus on learning Zig&#39;s language features first.But on the other extreme, the whole reason why I learned Python was its &#34;batteries included&#34; standard library."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To learn a new language, read its standard libraryTo learn a new language, read its standard libraryYes, but also no.The standard library is often more complex and uses more advanced features then you often need for most projects. I.e. collections in std are supper general purpose, but if you need to write a collection it&#39;s normally specific to the purpose you need it for.I.e. std is the &#34;most&#34; general purpose library you normally find so even if it&#39;s written with &#34;KISS&#34; in mind it&#39;s still often not so simple.Then it sometimes uses unstable language features you normally can&#39;t use (as it&#39;s often made &#34;in sync&#34; with the language) and/or optimizations which in most other cases would count as &#34;pre-mature&#34; optimizations.Through without a question you can learn a lot there, you just should be aware of the points above."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was at Lambda when they announced the switch from 9 to 6 months and the elimination of paid team leaders. The feedback was universally negative. In a channel for open student discussion, Austen Allred deleted a poll from Slack because of how lopsided the reaction was. He explained the deletion by saying the poll was &#34;misleading.&#34;Students then got a survey &#34;explaining&#34; why the change was actually a good thing by asking questions such as &#34;Do you understand why companies value mentoring experience?&#34; Not just failing to reveal the truth (these were cost-cutting measures), but not even taking the effort to come up with a convincing lie.It was destabilizing: Austen&#39;s twitter account would read ambitious, hyperoptimistic; meanwhile, drastic changes would be made within the program with vague rationales (&#34;after speaking with hiring managers, we&#39;ve made these changes...&#34;), and probing further simply got deflections or gaslighting surveys.There were a ton of good people in the program, and I learned a lot there. But fundamentally there needs to be trust between institution and student when you&#39;re asking people to make this level of time and financial commitment. And at no point did I feel like Lambda at its top level prioritized student wellbeing over PR, costs, or metrics to be sold to investors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It isn&#39;t just Lambda School. I mentor for [insert large coding bootcamp here] and I will say things have been going badly across the board for more than 50% of students. They recently had to cut a lot of staff, and completion rates seem to hover around only 50-60% when you take into account all the students they remove from this calculation when they withdraw for &#34;personal reasons&#34;. The employment numbers I don&#39;t have as much insight into but I have definitely had students who I don&#39;t think will get hired easily, and students reach out via LinkedIn 6th months later still looking for a job and wondering if they can work for me.That said, two of our best junior devs (at Arist YC S20) are Lambda School and Ironclad grads respectively, and neither of them had any background in programming and went right from bootcamp into their current positions. So it definitely works for some people.One thing I&#39;ve tried to emphasize with my mentees is the need to go beyond the curriculum (because it simply doesn&#39;t cover enough) and do personal projects. I always tell them the narrative about how back in the early 00s, the only resources available were things like w3schools.com, documentation, and the occasional dubiously accurate blog entry. I was able to learn almost everything I learned not for the sake of learning it but because I wanted to build X or Y. Bootcamps will teach you a vertical slice of some skills that are relevant in [current year], but they do not do a very good job of getting you started on a lifelong process of self-learning and side projects, which is the only way you get anywhere in this industry. Plus the only way to stand out when you went to a bootcamp anyway is having a very exceptional github profile with open source contributions that demonstrates you actually have an interest and do things beyond what is required by the bootcamp."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really wish we had less kneejerk cliche-recycling (eg &#34;don&#39;t be evil&#34; comments) commenters here just looking for confirmation bias because this is a difficult issue.First, kids use sites and apps when they&#39;re below the ToS age (usually 18 or sometimes 13, at least in the US). How are you meant to know that as a service provider? Don&#39;t get me wrong: it doesn&#39;t excuse you from doing due diligence. There&#39;s such a thing as wanton disregard for the truth. But we all know under 18s use IG, Snapchat, Tinder, etc. I&#39;m not sure fining a company billions of dollars and putting executives in jail is the outcome anyone really wants if a 17 year old uses Tinder.Second, what is personal information, exactly? It&#39;s not as obvious as you might think to the point where lawyers who work for these companies can&#39;t agree among themselves. There are obvious things (eg IP addresses, dates of birth, SSNs, addresses, names). But what about media? Photos, videos and sound files may all contain PII, technically.Third, some will say &#34;well don&#39;t store anything&#34;. Well, if a photo contains PII (which it can) then you can&#39;t operate a photo-sharing service at all for risk of storing PII of children. Also, this ignores legal obligations. If the Feds show up with a warrant about a particular user&#39;s actions then the argument &#34;we log/store nothing&#34; won&#39;t get you as far as you think.So I&#39;m not saying Google didn&#39;t do wrong here but knowing the complexities I am sympathetic to the idea of resisting broad legislative overreach as you can end up with bad laws that do just that.And if we&#39;re going to start singling out tech giants for lobbying Congress, my question is why them in particular? We currently have a Senate that is essentially beholden to the personal interests of one unelected rich guy: Charles Koch. Koch lobbies against health care, taxes on the rich and infrastructure in the Senate. Around the country, he has been instrumental in defeating public transit and many other initiatives in many cities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A week before the meeting, the Federal Trade Commission announced that it was considering making changes to its interpretation of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, which prohibits companies from collecting information about kids under the age of 13 without parental permission.How would that work in practice? A lot of us here operate websites. Your website gets a request. How are you supposed to tell the age of the person that request came from? Maybe Google / Facebook have enough data to identify the person and their age, but ironically, they would have to collect information about them to determine that it&#39;s a person they shouldn&#39;t collect information about.Certainly no child in the history of the Internet has ever lied to a website when asked their age."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;We have been successful in slowing down and delaying the [ePrivacy Regulation] process and have been working behind the scenes hand in hand with the other companies,&#34; the complaint quoted Google executives as saying in a memo ahead of the meeting. The August meeting could &#34;find areas of alignment and narrow gaps in our positions and priorities on child privacy and safety.&#34;This sounds like a starting point for further investigation.Perhaps the litigation will reveal more about what is going on inside Big Tech."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Am I the only one who&#39;s seeing &#34;sealed&#34; classes as an unfortunate development?I can&#39;t count how many times I had to resolve to using PowerMock and hacking bytecode just to mock something in one of the libraries I use because it&#39;s ingenious author &#34;final&#34;-ed the whole API surface of the library (and bits of the implementation usually).Now this gives even greater tool to people who love to lock everything up and think that they know better than me what I need."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately it looks like Java is going to evolve enough to take the wind out of the sails of Kotlin and Scala for most dev shops. I guess the positive take is that those improvements might not have happened without the efforts to develop better JVM languages."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Glad to see Java improve, but I still would like to see more ML features:- ~Exhaustive pattern matching~ it’s here!- Algebraic data types- Tail call optimisation- Do notation- Operator overloadWhy not use another language? Well, the name “Java” guarantees buy-in at this point. Maybe it will eventually be a Trojan horse for ML :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For a moment I thought this was going to be a version of the site with megabytes of javascript, 50+ third-party tracking/ad network/analytics scripts, facebook/twitter/reddit &#34;share&#34; links, a cookie consent dialog allowing me to accept all or &#34;manage my preferences&#34;, autoplaying videos about an unrelated story on each page, a sidebar with thumbnails + clickbait headlines that distracts from the main content, and a popup window that appears once I scroll down past 30% inviting me to subscribe.I was pleasantly surprised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With a different registrar to ycombinator.com, this is likely not owned by Y Combinator, and therefore difficult to trust that it won&#39;t start being malicious in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This solves a longstanding problem. When recommending &#34;hacker news&#34; to people, they would immediately get suspicious. What&#39;s up with this weird address? Why combinator? It would immediately devolve into weird discussions. It&#39;s actually linked to Haskell Curry, who was neither Indian, nor Greek, despite this lambda thing. And no, this is not a new Covid variant. A real nightmare. But thankfully, all this is over now."</p>
