								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All of these supposed &#34;flaws&#34; of leetcode are by design. Big companies want people who are smart enough to do the work, but obedient enough to put up with all the bullshit that comes with working at a big company. What person better matches that than someone who&#39;s able and willing to study for and pass a tech version of the SAT? Every anti-leetcode article I read is some version of &#34;leetcode is bad because it measures the wrong things.&#34; No, we all know it measures those things, and those are exactly the things the measurers want to measure.You might ask, so why do startups do leetcode too? I heard startups are supposed to be, uh, innovating, developing new technology, and working on hard, meaningful problems? Shouldn&#39;t they want brilliant, super effective people, instead of smart-enough, obedient workers? Apparently not. Apparently they want the same workers bigcos want. The implication of this is left as an exercise to the reader."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone who builds a truly novel technology solution involving hundreds of hours of effort gets filtered out of an interview involving contrived scenarios.  You may have built the next generation X, but given an array of strings and a fixed width, can you format the text such that each line has exactly maxWidth characters and is fully justified -- in the next 30 minutes?  Maybe you should have cultivated that skillset instead, because around here we value parlor tricks more than real world accomplishments."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just tell recruiters I simply won&#39;t. Turned down continuing with an interview process with a company just last week for this reason.I&#39;ll do take-home programming, I&#39;ll do collaborative debugging and coding in a shared IDE with something that looks like a real project, I&#39;ll do system design etc. interviews, talk to you about programming, etc. and I&#39;ll show you my GitHub etc. projects and you can judge from that, and my 20 year long resume, whether I might be a fit.Want me to write CS-class algorithm &amp; data structure problems on a timed clock on a whiteboard or equivalent? You&#39;ve just told me everything I need to know about your engineering culture.I worked at Google for 10 years and I hated their interview process, it needs to stop spreading to the rest of the job market. If enough of us say to no to this process, it will end.And to hiring managers: most of you are not Google (thankfully) and don&#39;t have a bottomless pit of talent to choose from. Stop pretending otherwise. You&#39;ll get better results. If you feel you have to do it, save it for new grads and stop using it for senior talent. All you&#39;re testing for is whether people practiced leetcode or whether they&#39;re straight out of a CS program."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reminds me of an incident we had with Dropbox a decade ago.  They deleted some niche accounting software (custom developed by us) from our Dropbox account, plus their own log files covering those deletions.  Then played ignorant.We learned the lesson, and never again trusted Dropbox, for anything.(Best guess - a would-be client got pissed when software which they&#39;d never paid for lacked a feature, and told Dropbox a story.)EDIT:  Only executables &amp; related distribution files were on Dropbox, not any source code.  We lost nothing...except our trust in Dropbox.EDIT2:  Yes, as several others have kinda pointed out, this incident was a collision between (a) naive human expectations (of high-skill, high-touch, highly-invested customer service for such situations) and (b) the actual business model of any huge / cheap or free / convenient cloud provider of X (plus just &#34;internet reality&#34;).  Sadly, I don&#39;t see that either (a) or (b) has changed in the past decade."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an inevitable consequence from the push to make cloud companies responsible for the content they host. Analyzing all of it can only be automated; automation will deliver weird false positives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dropbox doesn&#39;t have any functioning contact points. I cancelled my yearly subscription a month ago the day after it renewed, they cancelled my premium benefits immediately but never send the $120 refund that the cancellation page said I&#39;d get. Tried contacting them from their website contact page, nothing. Tried tweeting at their support account, nothing. I&#39;m half tempted to try to get my bank to do a chargeback.It&#39;s sad, I used to really like dropbox but now they just suck."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember being in an IRC  regularly 10-12 years ago where there was a community that was semi-active about a project to port android to the iPhone created by David Wang (planetbeing). There were a few builds going around at the time which I tried out. This video had gone somewhat viral at the time which is what sparked my interest. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJj0kHQgC9w. It seems like that project eventually became &#34;Project Sandcastle&#34; and the whole topic has seen some kind of recent resurgence from the looks of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve created over 150 videos for a YouTube channel using Shotcut on Windows since October 2020.  The GUI is not intuitive and it took quite awhile to learn many of the basics, but I&#39;ve become fairly productive and crashes are extremely rare.  If it warns about low memory, I reboot, and if I&#39;m doing a large or complicated video I assemble it from smaller parts/projects.  I&#39;m using version 21.06.29 and never upgraded beyond that because it already offers me more than enough and I&#39;m leery that a new version might break something I&#39;ve become dependent on.  It has a vast number of capabilities I&#39;ve never even explored.  If I can&#39;t figure out a feature I can inevitably find an online tutorial video that explains it sufficiently, though the tutorials tend to be of poor quality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very cool! I&#39;ve been looking for some time for a project that has:- a stellar editing UI for &#34;prototyping&#34; a well-edited video- a well-documented timeline-level API for the file format that can replace, timeshift, and add clips and tracks, and- be able to run on cloud hardware as a render serviceImagine creating a promotional video, then automatically swapping in each client&#39;s logo and re-rendering it for each one! The possibilities here are endless.DaVinci Resolve can&#39;t be beat for #1 and seems to support #3 well, but its API seems designed more for plugins than for automated authoring. For instance, the documentation at https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&amp;t=9927... seems to give just read-only access to a lot of things at the TimelineClip level. And https://github.com/pedrolabonia/pydavinci has exactly one contributor.By contrast, Shotcut seems to be built on, and by, https://mltframework.org/ with a close correspondence between the runtime API surface and the file system representation of a file, and it&#39;s fully open-source. Very possibly the sweet spot we&#39;ve been looking for!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Shotcut has this one cool feature [1] - drop a bunch of pictures into it and it&#39;ll create an animated slide show automatically. I&#39;ve looked for ways to automate that via something like ffmpeg, but haven&#39;t found any better options.[1] https://forum.shotcut.org/t/slideshow-generator/19162"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The cost of nuclear energy seems seriously understated.Nuclear waste storage costs the US $6B per year and we still donâ€™t have a long-term storage plan. Weâ€™ll incur this cost for hundreds or thousands of years.
https://earth.stanford.edu/news/steep-costs-nuclear-waste-us...Thereâ€™s also a cost to secure the nuclear infrastructure.
https://medium.com/the-future-is-electric/nuclear-generation...Can anyone find a cost per Megawatt Hour calculation for nuclear that includes security and long-term waste storage? The calculations Iâ€™ve found for the $96/MWh figure seem like they include construction and operation costs, but exclude decommissioning and waste management."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only nuclear plant under construction in the US is at Plant Vogtle, in Georgia.  Regulators set up a system (CWIP) whereby the companies building the plant earn a 10% return on their costs, until the plants come online.  I think it&#39;s not surprising therefore that costs keep increasing and the delays keep coming.  I don&#39;t think we can infer that nuclear power plants cannot be built at reasonable cost, rather that we need to consider &#34;regulatory capture&#34; as a significant construction risk.(Some admittedly one-sided background on CWIP: https://stopcwip.com/ )"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a problem I want to focus my life solving. I believe that software engineering can be made so simple and clear that it can be wielded by an extremely small team of engineers. I believe that there are finite and fundamental classes of problems, that underpin the vast majority of problems, that have a distinct visual representation, and that by representing these problems visually, you let your &#34;visual coprocessor&#34; assist in seeing the solutions. I believe there are well-known strategies (taken from the real world) for managing hierarchies of complexity that ease the cognitive load of exploring any problem. We just need to get these approaches into a programming &#34;langugage&#34;!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Software is never done - it creates new paradigms we adapt to. &#34;Complex Software&#34; is a fallacy. The problem is organizational structure and IT culture around software.People get invested in software, their code, their favorite dev community... they get comfortable... they become biased and influenced as they learn (not pragmatic)... they enter cycles of doom largely centered around conways law &amp; organizational complexity. Scaling any organization is a people/business/cultural problem.E.g. look at React... how tf did it develop into the hook mess. Early versions we so amazing and simple. A react app/oss component that is 2y old now is garbage. In contrast, look at how Angular has developed, or look at Golang, or Kubernetes (yes really) as a modern examples. People are struggling with AI today because python sucks at scale - but they suck at engineering real solutions because they aren&#39;t culturally adaptive. Im no AI/data scientist, but our models running in production on Golang, parallelized across K8s, and the data processing our &#34;yesterday&#39;s devops engineers&#34; are now doing is working out just fine.&#34;Software Engineering&#34; was a mistake. Industry never adapted from the physical personality of the word... building bridges and building software are not the same thing.Edit: grammar/phrasing fix, end of P2."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I highly recommend Rich Hickey&#39;s &#34;Simple Made Easy&#34; talk as a way to think about software complexity.  We all know that complex systems are hard to work with, but I&#39;ve found his presentation very useful in understanding the nature of complexity.  Understanding complexity helps being able to avoid or minimize it.  For example, easy is not the same as simple, and simple changes to one part of a system can introduce great complexity at the macro level.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LKtk3HCgTa8"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, creator here.This is a demo of our recent work presented at Oakland (IEEE S&amp;P): https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/368. The server and client code are written in Rust and available here: https://github.com/menonsamir/spiral-rs. The general aim of our work is to show that homomorphic encryption is practical today for real-world applications. The server we use to serve this costs $35/month!A quick overview: the client uses homomorphic encryption to encrypt the article number that they would like to retrieve. The server processes the query and produces an encrypted result containing the desired article, and sends this back to the client, who can decrypt and obtain the article. A malicious server is unable to determine which article the client retrieved. All search and autocomplete is down locally. The technical details are in the paper, but the high level summary is that the client creates a large one-hot vector of encrypted bits (0â€™s except for the index of the desired article, where they place a 1) and then the server computes something like a â€˜homomorphic dot productâ€™ between the query and the plaintext articles.Iâ€™d like to caveat that this is an in-browser demo to show it is practical to use homomorphic encryption at this scale. As a real product, youâ€™d probably want to distribute a signed client executable (or Electron app) since otherwise, a malicious server could simply deliver bad client JS on the fly.Happy to answer any questions!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting! But, it&#39;d be helpful to clarify further the strength of the following claim:&gt; This demo allows private access to 6 GB (~30%) of English Wikipedia. In theory, even if the server is malicious, it will be unable to learn which articles you request. All article title searches are performed locally, and no images are available.In this demo, the number of article-titles is relatively small â€“ a few million â€“ &amp; enumerable.If the server is truly malicious, and it issues itself requests for every known title, does it remain true that this &#34;Private Information Retrieval&#34; (PIR) scheme still gives it no hints that subsequent requests from others for individual articles retrieve particular data?(Presumably: every request touches every byte of the same full 6GB of data, and involves every such byte in constant-run-time calculations that vary per request, and thus have the effect of returning only what each request wanted â€“ but not at all in any way correlatable with other requests for the exact same article, from the same or different clients?)"</p>
