								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good to hear the reaffirmation from Mozilla that the blocking WebRequest API would be retained. A little over three years ago, Mozilla had promised that it wouldn’t just blindly follow Google on Manifest v3 to the letter. [1]Considering that uBlock Origin works best and can do the most in Firefox with this continuing support, I’m glad Mozilla is still walking the talk on this one.We need at least one browser that makes the web usable, and that might as well be Firefox with uBlock Origin.Edit: Oops. Missed providing the link reference below earlier.[1]: https://blog.mozilla.org/addons/2019/09/03/mozillas-manifest..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seeing this in this context just made me realize that it&#39;s weird to consider them &#34;blockers&#34;, a loaded term. As if we&#39;re starting from some default, correct state, and then blocking part of it. We&#39;ve always been able to choose what content we navigate to. These are content selectors/choosers, which just support our existing ability to choose what content we request and actions we take."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I switched back to Firefox a while ago, and love it. I keep trying to think of how it could be kept afloat once Google stops funding it.IIRC they get $400 million annually. There are 200 million FF users. $2 each wouldn&#39;t be bad... But realistically only 1% of the users would donate and $200 is unpalatable.Maybe another organization picks it up and runs it more efficiently or at a loss for advertising?Or...?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m approaching 50.  Just a scant decade away from being old enough to tap my retirement accounts and have the OPTION to retire.  These next couple of years look like they might not be fun, but overall it looks like I&#39;m actually going to make it.For most of my career, I&#39;ve been told (and I believed) that I would probably get forced out of a hands-on individual contributor role as I aged.  During the late-2000&#39;s, I even had an early midlife crisis and earned a law degree, expecting that I would need to make a career change into IP or something.  That hasn&#39;t been the case.What I think people missed is the compounding effect.  The supply and demand for computer programmers seems to double every decade (maybe the interval is even shorter).  With each doubling, the older cohorts become a smaller and smaller share of the whole.  People look around and think, &#34;There aren&#39;t many older programmers here&#34;, and base predictions off that observation.  However, the more accurate observation would be, &#34;There have been A LOT of younger programmers added here!&#34;.  I don&#39;t believe that it&#39;s actually a zero-sum game, though.I don&#39;t know if this human resources cousin to Moore&#39;s Law will continue indefinitely, but it&#39;s certainly held up through my career.  Even when it inevitably slows down, I think that just means you&#39;ll see the age cohorts balance out more over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At 64 years I am still going strong.  I consider myself blessed that I have landed a position that allows the to be the leader (I manage a small team) and still be hands on with everything: Architecture, desgin, coding, infrastructure, cloud engineering, DevOps engineer, DBA, the list goes on.  It is a Goldilocks job.  The technologies that we manage and master are miriad. We are a small company and my team owns the entire space.  All my years of knowledge and experience enable me to be coach, mentor, and teacher.  Over the course of my 44 year career I have played every instrument in the band.  I manage with a socratic method which my team enjoys.  Because I have been a life long learner, I have sought out and explored new technologies with eagerness and hunger.  This enables me to lead the team to adopt some of these technologies in usefull and vaulable (to the enterprise) ways.  The team absolutly enjoys learning and applying new and emerging technologies.  I could not have asked for more from what will probably be the last gig of my career. I don&#39;t intend to retire until 70 (assuming I am that lucky - you&#39;ll know what I mean when you get here).  I am having so much fun I wish had 30 more years ahead to enjoy what comes next.  I always like to say: It&#39;s good work if you can get it - not everybody can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found I lost interest in vapid work. Programming is still fun, but it&#39;s a big challenge to find a job that is fulfilling.When I was younger, I&#39;d work on whatever. Then everything started sounding like yet another get rich quick company, and is that what I was giving up my life for? Just to move little green pieces of paper around?The most appealing thing I&#39;d seen recently was a company that wrote software to help maximize farm yields. At least there was some real, effective benefit for a great many people.It&#39;s like the goal of the company gradually became more important than the tech or money. And altruistic companies are very rare.But I always really wanted to teach, so that&#39;s what I do now. Pays about 40% of what I&#39;d make in industry, but I get to geek out all day and do work that benefits the world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yeah, no. Maybe with old laptops, but newer laptops still have their fair share of issues. When I bought my thinkpad A485 kernels wouldn&#39;t boot without additional parameters, the graphics would freeze at times and cause a hardlock, sleep and hibernation have been fixed and broken again intermittently over several kernel versions, the wifi card&#39;s AP mode started causing segfaults in kernel 5.2 due to the driver&#39;s rewrite but has since been fixed, the fnlock key LED didn&#39;t update properly, which I spent a while debugging and submitted a kernel patch for, and while over the years the fingerprint scanner has been implemented, it&#39;s a pain to install and support for fingerprint scanning in linux is still in a very sorry state. Oh and bluetooth still can&#39;t connect more than one device at a time, so I had to buy a dongle to connect two joycon controllers.Granted, I&#39;ve always had these kinds of issues with new laptops, especially when it came to proprietary nvidia or AMD graphics (before AMDGPU) and I agree it&#39;s improved a lot, but I still need to tell people that there&#39;s caveats with some (especially newer) laptops."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have the reverse...Unless you have a thinkpad or some other popular hardware, you&#39;ll find Linux barely works at all out of the box, and even with hours of fiddling around, you&#39;ll still have to live without some features.For example, power saving features, sleep and hibernate, screen brightness controls, fingerprint readers, keyboard hotkeys and backlights, etc. rarely work.  Prepare for broken external hdmi ports or USB stuck at USB 2.0 speeds.  Have fun with the fan stuck on either max or zero, or the CPU stuck at the lowest clock speed.There are still lots of things you have to go hunting for the right old firmware version for.I think Linux is only great if you have whatever hardware distro developers have, because that will be all that works out of the box."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just received my Framework laptop recently, installed Fedora 36 + KDE Plasma, and even though it took some tweaking to get a close to my Mac behaviour, it works perfect. I had 0 driver problems. So it looks like Linux on the desktop seems to be getting there.
And the best part, with this laptop, no shop needed to replace the battery, I can do it myself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Every automotive code base I&#39;ve seen has been a dumpster fire. This (mostly) isn&#39;t the fault of the developers and Rust won&#39;t fix it. The business process creates this outcome. No one likes it but little is done to address it.The software development timeline is slaved to the rigid manufacturing timeline. There is no allowance for slippage, so making things work By Any Means Necessary is the rule of the day. Concurrency problems often are not debugged; locks and similar are just sprinkled around until they disappear in testing. It is TDD taken to an extreme -- passing the enumerated tests, technically, is the definition of done even if the code is obviously poor or broken.There are a vast number of software and hardware components sourced from myriad vendors that are swapped out every year to save a few dollars or deal with a supply chain issue. There is no stable baseline but all of these components need to work together. The code has to constantly adapt to the reality that someone sourced parts for a new model year that work differently or are in a different programming language.This code is usually required to be supported for 10+ years. The developers don&#39;t just have this year&#39;s tech stack and code base to deliver on a rigid schedule, they are required to maintain several older implementations concurrently, often built in different languages and architectures.Basically, the automotive industry has failed badly at the transition from being hardware manufacturing companies to being hardware + software manufacturing companies, and try to run their software processes the same way they ran their traditional hardware processes. Choice of programming language is the least of their concerns, that isn&#39;t the source of their code quality issues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of comments so far are complaining about the software quality in cars now. But what did you expect? This is what happens when you hire the same kinds of people to write the software for your car that you&#39;ve hired for 25 years to write the terrible internal applications inside the company that everyone hates, and in the same terrible way. The end result is going to be exactly the same.Over the years, I&#39;ve seen various discussions brush up against the issue of professional certification. Professional Engineer, in civil engineering, is a serious credential, which can hold people professionally liable for bridges that fail, or buildings that fall over. Making cars a network of computers that all talk to each other, operated entirely &#34;by wire,&#34; and giving up any consideration of mechanical backups (like with a plane) is going to very quickly drive the point home that the programming profession needs a similar credential. As a mechanical engineer who has made a living writing software for 30 years, I understand the difference, but the legal externalities are not going to care that software is VASTLY more complicated than, say, designing a plane wing with a factor of safety.Now, I have to go figure out why my Rails application can no longer restart the delayed_job process on deploy. Is the problem in Rails, Ruby, my gems, Capistrano, permissions, SSH, or some updated package on my Linux VM? Designing a bridge, frankly, is easier, because it&#39;s &#34;concrete&#34; and closed-form. Sure, I&#39;ll figure out my deployment problem, but next month some obscure thing in the 24 layers that make up a simple web app these days is going to get updated, and break something else. At least once a bridge is built, it&#39;s done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember proposing looking into introducing Rust as a second language next to C++ just 3 years ago while working with a German car manufacturer in Berlin, every single architect refused and most of them were making fun of me, anyway I&#39;m not bitter ...Actually back then it was the beginning of me stopping carrying about improving and just go with the flow like a dead fish. Everyone is happier, I have much less clashes with coworkers much less stress and you know what they say: Nobody got ever fired for choosing IBM.I think this is the main reason for the state of software quality in cars now. People who care can&#39;t stand the industry and leave, if you want to stay you have to stop carrying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Note that this thread is still active 13 years later!  The most recent post is by the OP, and reads:&gt; I want to take a moment to recognize that the Homemade Heat Pump Manifesto has gone beyond 2 million page views. I would like to thank Daox and any other people who may have worked behind the scene to make it possible.&gt; My initial goal was to make available the knowledge and possibility that anybody with a few tools and gumption could convert discarded air conditioners, and dehumidifiers into very high efficiency heat ources, or cooling sources. Through the years, we have received reports of success from many people, living in many states, and countries.&gt; Another goal was to make zero money from this project, to give it away and to encourage others to take it, share it, sell it.&gt; In the beginning I thought that maybe 200 people would find this interesting. Obviously, I was wrong, gloriously wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One note of caution, he describes removing the lath and plaster and inserting eps insulation. It didn’t mention if he did this, he might have done, but it’s important to have a continuous taped vapour barrier on the warm side of the insulation to prevent water vapour from passing through, condensing on the timber structure and causing it to rot. Also ventilate the cold side of the insulation or a least have a gap to form a capillary break with the cold outside wall. I’ve seen a few badly done insulation jobs in timber buildings that have needed floor joists and studs cut out and replaced. It only takes about 15-20 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the same forum, a 50+ page thread on DIY ventilation heat exchangers, e.g. 4&#34;x4&#34;x24&#34; window unit that moves heat from exhaust airflow to fresh incoming airflow, https://ecorenovator.org/forum/showthread.php?t=891&amp;page=38#... and a home-sized DIY HRV, https://ecorenovator.org/forum/showpost.php?p=26861&amp;postcoun...&gt; outside temperature is 10,0 degrees Celcius, inside T is 21,1 and incoming fresh breeze (top) at 19,0!!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Removing all uses of undefined behaviour is probably a fool&#39;s errand, as it would require significant changes throughout the code that would take time and come with a performance impact, all for no immediate practical benefit. So I just hunted down the undefined behaviour cases that actually broke determinism. This was easy enough, as we have plenty of tools we use to test determinism. By comparing the game state CRC for every tick of every test (we have 2,417 tests) between x86 and ARM, I believe I got a pretty good coverage of potential issues.Holy hell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;This is the first time we had to make sure the game is deterministic between ARM and x86. We should be fine, C++ is portable, right?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m an Iranian living in Italy and have an Italian phone/WhatsApp number. Couldn&#39;t call anyone or receive WhatsApp calls to/from Iranian and non-Iranian numbers yesterday afternoon when the internet blocking started in Iran. It was like all numbers somehow in touch with Iranian contacts were blocked from completing calls. As soon as either side of the call would answer, the call would end with a message like you are connected via a network that has blocked WhatsApp or something similar."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve seen many tweets from people in Germany, USA, Turkey etc. that they can’t access their WhatsApp account. Seems to be both Iranian government and Meta.Edit: can be a compromised CDN.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oppressive governments must be thankful to all BigTechs able to consolidate userbase and services around a handful of apps. It makes it really easy to switch things on/off when needed. The original purpose of the Internet as being a resilient p2p network for the people has been completely defeated in some nations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I saw one of these at a job when I graduated undergrad. I had an over the phone interview with a consulting company, Revature specifically. I can&#39;t even remember if I applied to them or not (since I applied to so many). After what was a 10 trivia question type interview they decided to &#34;give me an offer!&#34;. It was a contract $50k a year, for two years with a $20k &#34;training fee&#34; that was fully repayable if you leave before 2 years. I obviously declined it because that is a ludicrously low salary for a software developer in the US, and also it was an insane &#34;training fee&#34;. So I presume, their business model is desperate people for jobs, &#34;train&#34; them, then keep them in indentured servitude. They also tried to hard sell a job which is obviously gross."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is debt peonage. The trouble is, the US law against peonage was not drafted tightly enough.&#34;The holding of any person to service or labor under the system known as peonage is abolished and forever prohibited in any Territory or State of the United States; and all acts, laws, resolutions, orders, regulations, or usages of any Territory or State, which have heretofore established, maintained, or enforced, or by virtue of which any attempt shall hereafter be made to establish, maintain, or enforce, directly or indirectly, the voluntary or involuntary service or labor of any persons as peons, in liquidation of any debt or obligation, or otherwise, are declared null and void.&#34;[1]As you can see, the reference is to &#34;the system known as peonage&#34;. So, new, innovative means of accomplishing the same result may or may not be covered. So far, cases involving training repayment agreements do not seem to have taken the peonage route.[2]The PetSmart case in California makes several arguments. One is that PetSmart is illegally operating an unlicensed educational institution. The &#34;California Education Code provides that “a note, instrument, or other evidence of indebtedness relating to payment for an educational program is not enforceable by an institution unless, at the time of execution . . . the institution held an approval to operate.” (Cal. Educ. Code § 94917&#34;) There are other specific California labor laws probably being violated here.
This case is just starting in San Mateo County Superior Court. Scheduling hearing in November.But that won&#39;t help in other states with weaker labor laws.[1] https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1994[2] https://towardsjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PetSma..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think it should be legal to charge employees for training in any form. Either provide it for free, or don&#39;t provide it at all. What possible purpose does putting yourself in the middle as both the lender and beneficiary have other than to fascilitate abuse?"</p>
