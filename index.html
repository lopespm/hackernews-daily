								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author of the article here. Since I first published this blog post I was getting messages from people asking how it ended.Sadly it&#39;s pretty anticlimactic as the owner of the place had a meeting with the guy who put the Pi there (without me as he didn&#39;t want the Pi-dropper to feel ambushed) and in the end decided not to escalate it to legal and just basically told him to pack his things and get out.So no legal after play and just a slap on the wrist"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was a confused by a screenshot in the article, with the caption:&gt; Not the actual site but a similar oneLooks like the article, when speaking of tracing down a wrongdoing suspect, used a screenshot of a Web page of an uninvolved Web site.  The screenshot included photos of actual people presumably uninvolved, and a name, phone number, and email address also presumably uninvolved.While I&#39;d guess this probably reduces Internet vigilantism and accusations of libel (at least involving the actual suspect), I suspect that a journalism professor, editor, or lawyer would advise not to do it that way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Eh 20-ish years ago the shit happening on Island and Archipelago would blow most people’s minds. Undocumented, conditional, non-displayed order types. Routine wash trading. Shear-but-don’t skin multi-venue arbitrage. The ECNs were the Wild West. Smoke-filled dark pools.Island and Arca are NASDAQ and NYSE now.But Ben, US equities have intrinsic value unlike this BTC garbage! Well unless they pay no dividend, have dual-class share structure, and IPO without a profitable quarter. What’s a share of SNAP entitle you to exactly? Ah right, you think someone will buy it for more.Crypto will have it’s 2001-style GC cycle, the useful stuff will stick around until Goldman owns it and the SEC makes a show of regulating it, the tulip garbage will wash out leaving behind a bunch of rich guys who are really annoying because they never built anything, and we’ll go back to arguing about programming languages."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a hype cycle right now with the claim that Walmart is going to issue NFTs, or get into cryptocurrencies, or something.[1] Walmart is not saying that. They filed for a trademark for &#34;WALMART&#34; for the trademark class that includes cryptocurrencies. Which means only that WalMart, Inc. spent $400 to protect their brand name from someone creating &#34;WalMartCoin&#34;. WalMart, asked for a statement, said they had no immediate plans in that area.[1] https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/16/22887011/walmart-metavers..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting tidbit:&#34;An aside on NFTs Because they’re “unique” objects, NFTs are a perfect vehicle for wash trading. You can easily ensure you only wash trade to yourself. The common scheme is to wash trade with yourself until some credible dunce buys the NFT from you at your manufactured “fair” value, leaving you to walk away with real money.&#34;It&#39;s such a stupidly simple idea it&#39;s actually brilliant."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For most of human history, people have lived in small, local information bubbles which were hard to penetrate with facts from the outside world. We see this manifest as the pre-industrial global patchwork of weird and wonderful religious/spiritual/cultural variety.Then somehow the world started to join up and information began to seep into local cultures and sweep away a lot of these pre-rational beliefs. And for a while, it seemed like the direction of travel was towards a global system of thought based on a widely distributed factual, rational approach.But in the last ten years, something seems to have arrested this direction of travel and reinstated local bubbles of thought, insulated from outside challenge.Cryptoscams are the perfect (but not only) example of a self-sustaining shared consensual delusion. They don’t talk to the outside world. So much so that something like this happens. They are living inside a pre-rational info-bubble which has budded off from reality and floated away on its own wind.We are not just dealing with scams and fools here. There is an intense current of reality-defiance and cult behaviour. Some people get sucked into the crypto-attractor, but other hallucinations are available."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my opinion, there shouldn&#39;t be.Documents like these shouldn&#39;t be automatically processed, they should be reviewed by humans. Reducing someone&#39;s life history to a list of educational institutions and employers feels robotic even for a software developer&#39;s mindset.I understand that there are real life problems because companies do use automated processing on applications, but that kind of behaviour shouldn&#39;t be encouraged."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to work in ontologies, and what I learned is that people would rather get an 80% heuristic solution for dirty data rather than a 100% correct solution for data they have to clean.The big job sites have resume parsers that work well enough from a PDF or Word doc, and then they don&#39;t have to worry about you forgetting a close tag or a mandatory field. Sure, stuff gets lost, but they get 80% of a billion resumes rather than 100% of a million of them. They can&#39;t exchange data or even trust what they have, but it&#39;s good enough for them to make money. Meanwhile, a competitor demanding good data from its clients never gets off the ground.Anyway, every data format for human information ends up being either vague (to allow in everything) or impossible (see the myths that programmers believe about names, time, addresses, etc.) You end up giving a string for each field... Then give up, just accept any string, and hope for the best.Everybody wants Google or some machine learning solution because the formats never work for the information people want to convey. Better solutions could exist but the hacky ones are first to market, in a natural monopoly where there really only needs one good enough product.If you think a lack of a good resume format is bad, look at electronic health records. Those are far more important to be correct and exchangeable, and even there the cleanup effort is always enormous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is!
https://jsonresume.org/But nobody really uses it for data interchange. I use it to render my resume in new layouts now and then.Although, it does let style dictate content sometimes (some templates force you to have dates down to the day for job start and end dates, etc.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A link to the actual research paper would be helpful.In this experiment, what amount was given to the treatment group that received basic income? How often? How does that amount compare to the cost of living in their city?&gt; ‘It’s sometimes said that people will sit around doing nothing if you give them free money.’I’m not an academic, so take this with a grain of salt.If my job requires menial labor or involves getting berated by customers (many retail jobs), personally I would absolutely not work.My spouse worked for the state government as part of a benefits/disbursement program. She took phone calls from benefits recipients. Some who are disabled, on unemployment, or generally within the states bar to qualify for tax payer aid.The pay was slightly above minimum wage. My spouse quit after about a year, during which my souse constantly suffered from verbal abuse and even callers who didn’t qualify threatening to murder my spouse unless they received cash from the state.My point is - there are plenty of jobs where you absolutely will quit and not work if the basic income can provide a sufficient substitute.I’m not making an argument against basic income. I suppose it’s sad that we as a society treat a significant number of people, even in developed countries, without a shred of dignity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;They simulated the reward structure of different forms of social security in an experiment. ‘We got people to do a task on a computer,’ says De Kwaadsteniet. ‘In multiple rounds, which represented the months they had to work, they did a boring task in which they had to put points on a bar. The more of these they did, the more money they earned.’&#34;short term experiments done in a lab&#34; seems to be psychology&#39;s equivalent of &#34;in vitro&#34; (aka. in a test tube). I&#39;m not really sure how you can draw any conclusions about someone&#39;s lifetime behavior, using a experiment that looks at the behavior of people sitting at a few hours at a computer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Multiple studies of where basic income was tried in the real world found it to reduce work.For example, &#34;Manitoba, Canada experimented with Mincome, a basic guaranteed income, in the 1970s. In the town of Dauphin, Manitoba, labor only decreased by 13%, much less than expected&#34; [1]. There are plenty of others.I expect a targeted need use of scarce resources (tax money) is a much better use for helping those who need it, instead of ham handedly giving it regardless of need, thereby shorting those who need it at the benefit of many who do not.And the current inflation (and previous events where govts gave out decent sums of cash to help short term other econ issues) shows what happens when people get money for free - prices rise to absorb it. The reason being if person X is willing to put in pain Y for product Z, this does not change if you rescale the meaning of money.Product Z simply rises to cause person to put in the same pain to obtain it.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_basic_income"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The best teacher at my high school could never eat enough to maintain his body weight - all day long he sipped little juice boxes of protein goop that he took with a grimace from a bear sized stack of pallets against the back wall of his office .
He was nearish to seven foot, and in his opinion, didn&#39;t have a big enough stomach for the task.
As a young man he&#39;d been a skinny pole. During a university science lab he had discovered he has an extraordinary ability to taste tiny concentrations of chemicals, somehow this information got passed on to an ice cream factory, and he got a summer holiday job tasting the ice cream for traces of the &#39;wrong&#39; flavour e.g. could he still taste coffee after the line had been switched form ice coffee to strawberry. The story went that over three months of eating ice cream all day everyday, he blossomed into a ripped Adonis, and subsequently with his new athletic physique become a windsurfing champion. (yes there is such a thing as a windsurfing champion) But eating ice cream is not the universal delight you and I assume it is. It was a subjective ordeal, a long torturous slog, long days of spoon upon spoon. At the end of the summer, the now champion, couldn&#39;t face another bucket and began the lifelong search for something he could endure eating in quantities to satisfy his metabolism"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I knew a guy once with a milder version of what appears to be a similar syndrome. We worked together, and he would go out for lunch and wolf down a whole large pizza. Afterwards, he would get very hot and sweaty. He was not particularly tall and skinny as a rake. He wasn&#39;t an athlete, had a sedentary job, yet he was eating 2-3 times normal calorie intake, maybe 5-6K calories/day at least.  In all other respects he seemed a normal guy, who to my knowledge did not eat toddlers. There was clearly some medical reason for what was going on, but since he seemed normal in other respects as far as I know he never went to the doctor about it. I&#39;m not medical and have no idea what his syndrome was, but I wonder if it could have had something to do with his mitochondrial functions. See https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/shilling-for-big-mitoc... I&#39;m not suggesting Tarrare was taking a drug that hadn&#39;t been invented yet, but that possibly he naturally had a natural version of the mitochondrial permeability syndrome that DNP induces."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Am I the only one that finds it disturbing that it&#39;s mentioned that people saw no sign of mental illness in him yet he ate live puppies and kittens, dead bodies from the morgue, and was ejected from the hospital when he was suspected of eating a toddler?Honestly this whole article is nightmare fuel about what a person might become if all-consuming hunger is the driving urge of their life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The `gvpr` tool in graphviz deserves more recognition.Graphviz, at its core, is a simple graph description language (DOT), which allows progressive enhancement, and a bunch of auto-layout tools where some double as renderers.The double-duty of the layout/renderers masks GraphViz&#39;s true power, which is that you can create a pipeline modifying your graph source (confusingly referred to as &#39;.dot&#39; files), progressively adding attributes.This is where gvpr comes in. While most are familiar with GV&#39;s all-in-one layout+rendering tools like `dot` or `neato`, gvpr is a generic Awk-like programming tool that iterates over nodes and edges. With it, you can implement any layout algorithm you like (or not!), to specify part or all of the attributes of your graph (like positioning and style), to then be rendered using `dot` to the format of your choice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used GraphViz a number of times and highly recommend it as a standard tool on your belt. Having a stand-alone executable that can export to SVG is great.The most complex thing I&#39;ve done with it [1]: a tool (MIT-license) that builds diagrams of the data and addressing pipeline for a DSP processor, and lets one &#39;scrub through&#39; the assembler code frame by frame and see the values propagate through the blocks.Also PlantUML [2] uses it for most diagrams.Getting layout and positioning the way you want can be tricky but is usually achievable with patience and hidden objects.[1] https://github.com/paphillips/DFB

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of incompetence makes me seriously doubt that Google is doing anything to more substantially review apps for deeper security issues, either statically or at runtime.The asymmetry of effort in this situation is profound: consider that you spend all your time and effort writing a, long, complex, thoughtful message by hand (the app), taking hundreds or thousands of hours, but then they respond with machine generated message that cost them 10ms of computer time.The solution, I think, is obvious: Google needs a &#34;zone defense&#34; with the play store, a much larger (and expensive) staff, to do in-depth app reviews and be a stable, stateful relationship with the developer over time. This person would, in fact, become a 3rd party &#34;expert&#34; on a small set of apks and their contents, with a &#34;feel&#34; for what is changing over time, with the core mission of protecting users from malice, but working with devs, as a human being."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some Google engineer probably thought they were very clever when they applied &#34;the algorithm&#34; to translated titles.Pretty fucking draconian some of those rules, if you ask me.  In games and works of art it&#39;s not uncommon to have a title longer than 30 characters.  Nevermind when you have different editions or things that are related to the main title.So how does this actually work?  Why is &#39;Life is Strange: Before the Storm&#39; (33 characters) on Google Play?  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.squareenix..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had an unusual experience this weekend while I was sick. After laying around for 2 days with brain fog, I woke up early Sunday morning and watched TV, checked social media, etc, but was sick of consuming information and had the strangest feeling that I wanted to work on something productive but my body aches wouldn&#39;t let me concentrate. I also felt like.. playing video games? I haven&#39;t had the urge to play video games since my first semester of college in 1995 before I discovered partying and dating.I was bored.It finally hit me that I haven&#39;t been bored in over 25 years. I&#39;ve been hopeless, exhausted, overworked, financially destitute, depressed, burned out, lost in countless ways. But never bored.Now, I meditate often, I&#39;ve learned a great deal about the higher self on neurodivergent TikTok, and I&#39;m mindful of my contribution in service to others. But I can&#39;t really emphasize enough how much this shook me. I&#39;m still processing it.I wonder if getting life goals done could be as simple as carving out large blocks of time where you aren&#39;t allowed to work on them. I don&#39;t mean filling the time with something else like work or other obligations. But literal you-time, with a rule that you can&#39;t exert yourself in any way or you&#39;ll risk relapsing into nonprogress. This is more like transmuting one form of attentive energy (negative) into another (positive) by dwelling on the opposite thing than you&#39;re used to.For example, I perceive every stoplight as being red. Since I started commuting a half hour to work a few days per week, I&#39;ve been bringing coffee. Now I find that I never get a chance to drink it, because every light is green."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The goal is to have moments of clarity where you’re able to see “ah that’s what’s going on in my mind right now”.I think this is valuable advice, and it applies not only in this productivity context but in any day to day situation.I feel worked up, angry, disappointed with those around me in certain situations. Whereas 5 years ago, I might get worked up and complain about all of it to my manager, I’ve learned to recognize my own emotional state. I feel X because of Y reasons.In 30 minutes after I’ve had a snack or maybe just a glass of water, I’ll feel significantly better and will want to take back anything I say now. Not because I’m wrong or that what someone did or didn’t do is actually right, but because I need to control my emotion and how I respond. There’s a correct way to approach the problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As of lately I&#39;ve found a useful insight in the opposite direction: getting &#39;in the zone&#39; is never instantaneous. Just like many other activities (e.g. social, or sport), you can&#39;t go from 0 to 100 just like that.And that transition period sucks. Your brain was over-stimulated and now has to focus. It&#39;s crying like a child who&#39;s been deprived of his favorite toy.It sucks and there&#39;s no way around it. But: being aware of it is liberating! If you remain aware that starting work is painful, you won&#39;t be waiting for a later moment where it will magically become more enjoyable.Best of all, the hard first few minutes are just that, a few minutes. Maybe 10, which again are painful, because one is under-performing and mentally dispersed. If you are aware of the transient nature of this state, it will be less frustrating.Embrace the suck."</p>
