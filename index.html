								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Haha. Literally just finished a game with my family and was thinking &#34;you know I should laser cut and engrave/mill some metal pieces because these move too much&#34;.For this project I would&#39;ve had each board host an analog switch (neighbour selection) and use SPI and/or I2C rather than onewire. This would allow cheap flash memory (unique ID per tile + local storage/configuration) with SPI/I2C passthru. That way the host could determine topology easily and deduplicate redundant routes. A dumb read-only MCU could populate the local RGB from flash if required. With the spare cycles thus obtained you could even implement animation.So... who&#39;s got wood for my sheep? https://youtu.be/VBmRCclzCVU?t=33"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was a C student in high school. I never took a math class beyond basic algebra. I started from Khan Academy&#39;s first exercise when I was 33 years old. It seems silly looking back that I was solving problems on the number line as an adult.At that time, around 10 years ago, Khan Academy had excellent coverage through trigonometry and single variable calculus. Once I reached that point I went to my local community college and took all of their math classes. I transferred to University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and continued onward to get a BS CS, BS EE, and MS EE. I finished at 41 years old and landed a dream job that I would have never thought possible when I started.I guess my advice is to start from the beginning and see where it takes you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m in my 40s and I started a machine learning degree in Nov 2020, so it&#39;s been about 1.5 years for me till now. I am a slow learner and my recommendations may reflect the same.1) Maths (precalculus and calculus) - I started with Khan Academy 10th grade onwards. I finished till grade 12 in a week. By this time I had gone through content elsewhere, so 1 week may (not) be enough. Regardless, Khan Academy app comes highly recommended.I did realise that there were a few gaps (more basic in nature), I covered those with Eddie Woo on YouTube (e.g. why is zero factorial 1). For others I just looked up relevant searches online.2) Maths (calculus) - MITs videos on YouTube. That is the pace of content I really love. Lots of overlap with Khan academy calculus, but do go through both. Also 3blue1brown &#34;essence of calculus&#34; playlist.3) Maths (Basic Linear Algebra) - although if someone were to say Gilbert Strang&#39;s MIT videos, they would be bang on perfect, I had to start slower. Bingewatch (with popcorn and beer) 3blue1browns &#34;Essence of linear algebra&#34; on YouTube. Then move ahead to the channel &#34;Math the beautiful&#34; which has a slower pace. You would also wish to visit their website www.lem.ma where they have exercises. Then of course come back and start Prof Strang&#39;s lectures (you&#39;re delving into heavier stuff midway through his course).4) Statistics - hands down professor Leonard on YouTube, he is the statistics equivalent of Eddie Woo. Slow, smart, funny and he has biceps too ;-) After this Prof Tsitsikilis (MIT) on YouTube.It goes without saying that you&#39;ll need to practice problems (ironical, coming from me). You can download question sets of your country from online.5) When you&#39;ve done the above, your search for &#34;linear algebra&#34; and &#34;calculus&#34; on HN will yield a lot of lovely results. Hidden gems will be there in comments too. Check those books, interactive books, websites, etc out. Your pace will be good by this time, but you will occassionally come across something which you have not come across before.If there&#39;s anything else, feel free to ask."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve done this and would echo the good advice you&#39;ve already gotten about Khan Academy but I think the comments in this thread are skipping over the most important part: pace. Work slowly. Don&#39;t move on until you really &#34;get&#34; the concept you&#39;re working with. Some topics might &#34;click&#34; right away and others might take weeks of bashing your head against the wall until your brain makes sense of it. That&#39;s okay. It can definitely be tedious at times (so be kind to yourself!) but a lot of learning happens when you&#39;re struggling to make sense of something so it&#39;s worthwhile to lean into the trouble you&#39;re having and figure out what it is that you&#39;re struggling to understand.The downside of formal education is that the teacher has a timeline that needs to be kept and the class will move on without you. It might not seem like a big deal in the moment but in math the foundation is so important because the concepts build on one another. Sometimes in really subtle ways. If you have the motivation (and it sounds like you do!) then the huge upside to self-paced learning is that you can build a really strong foundation and the more complicated advanced topics will be so much easier to master. Khan Academy is really good at breaking subjects down into tiny bites and then slowly building on what you&#39;ve learned but if you don&#39;t quite understand a lesson or if you haven&#39;t properly paid attention don&#39;t be afraid to do it again. If you guessed the right answer but don&#39;t understand why your answer was right, don&#39;t be afraid to go back and do it again.So just because one person here could do all of the Khan Academy 9th grade algebra in a week that doesn&#39;t mean you should set that timeline for yourself. Everyone is starting from a different place. So maybe it&#39;ll take you a day, or a week, or a month, or even months. But however long it takes is how long it takes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my car-centric city (southeast USA, population ~125k) when I visit private property with no bicycle parking, I try to find the owner and offer to install one of these just for the cost of materials. The idea being, they can put in another one when they see more than one customer on a bicycle at the same time. It&#39;s very cheap, less than 100 bucks typically as I have the requisite tools in my garage to make them from scratch out of metal tubing. There&#39;s a variety of materials, finishing, and mounting options the property owner can choose from. I&#39;ve done about a dozen of them, it makes biking around my city much more pleasant and my day is brighter when I see someone else using one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In general, the author is right, and the simple design is by far the best. But the classic Sheffield stand with a circular cross section can be easily cut with a pipe cutter. Contrary to an angle grinder, a pipe cutter doesn&#39;t make any noise.
Thus, the design has been improved by making it solid instead of hollow and giving it a rectangular cross section, like [1].
I used to hate the improved design because it&#39;s obviously less friendly to a nice bike&#39;s paint job until I learned the reasoning behind it.[1] https://www.thieme-stadtmobiliar.com/de/produkte/fahrradstae..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For most bike &#34;racks&#34; here in NL it seems like the primary purpose is not security, but just having somewhere to lean bikes against and give people a sensible place to park their bikes (as opposed to &#34;in a huge pile&#34;)Most people don&#39;t bother physically locking their regular city bikes to anything (only using a ring lock on the bike itself), primarily cheap beater bikes but also there&#39;s a guy in my street with a €2000 Van Moof e-bike that I think is just leaning against his front wall."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the post, multiplications and 2 additions are not faster than 2 additions.The post compares (1) loop code that can be vectorized, as loop rounds are independent and do not depend on the result from the previous round, and (2) an &#34;optimization&#34; that makes calculations shorter, but also makes each loop round depend on the result of the previous round, so this cannot be vectorized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tldr: autovectorizer transforms the first code into SIMD instructions, but the second into 64 bit instructions.SIMD is very powerful, and modern compilers can sometimes simd-ify your code automatically.-------The second code can probably become SIMD as well, but it&#39;s beyond GCC&#39;s ability to autovectorizer it in that form. I kinda want to give it a go myself but don&#39;t have time today...Autovectorizers are mysterious, often harder to see and use than explicitly SIMD code (like OpenCL or CUDA)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The part about data dependencies across loop iterations is fascinating to me, becuase it&#39;s mostly invisible even when you look at the generated assembly. There&#39;s a related optimization that comes up in implementations of ChaCha/BLAKE, where we permute columns around in a kind of weird order, because it breaks a data dependency for an operation that&#39;s about to happen: https://github.com/sneves/blake2-avx2/pull/4#issuecomment-50..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I collect these things for fun and one of my big discoveries is that there&#39;s no &#34;standard&#34; system font stacks - here are my list of system font stacks and their sources: https://github.com/sw-yx/spark-joy/blob/master/README.md#fon...some of them even come with annotations as to why they make the choices they make.Github&#39;s font stack isfont-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &#34;Segoe UI&#34;, Roboto, Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif, &#34;Apple Color Emoji&#34;, &#34;Noto Color Emoji&#34;, &#34;Segoe UI Emoji&#34;, &#34;Segoe UI Symbol&#34;;VS Code:font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &#39;Segoe UI&#39;, Roboto, Oxygen, Ubuntu, Cantarell, &#39;Open Sans&#39;, &#39;Helvetica Neue&#39;, sans-serifprobably more &#34;native&#34; on mobile:font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, &#34;Segoe UI&#34;, &#34;Roboto&#34;, &#34;Oxygen&#34;, &#34;Ubuntu&#34;, &#34;Helvetica Neue&#34;, Arial, sans-serif;apparently all modern browsers have this new shortcut that make it as simple as:font-family: ‘system-ui’, sans-serif;https://chromestatus.com/feature/5640395337760768"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I disagree with much of these stacks. I would scrap at least Avenir Next, Avenir, Helvetica Neue, Helvetica, Ubuntu, Roboto, Noto, Arial, Apple Garamond, Times New Roman, Droid Serif, Times, Source Serif Pro, Apple Color Emoji, Segoe UI Emoji, Segoe UI Symbol, Monaco, Liberation Mono and Lucida Console, and probably a couple more, for one of three reasons: that the family is superfluous, for an obsolete platform, or inferior.—⁂—But as a consumer of the web, I personally don’t actually need to worry about these things any more, because I have my browser set to use my chosen sans-serif, serif and monospace faces (Equity, Concourse, Triplicate), and you can too! ① Use Firefox. Other browsers may have something similar; dunno; but Firefox is good anyway. ② Settings (about:preferences) → Fonts → Advanced → untick “Allow pages to choose their own fonts, instead of your selections above”.I started doing this a few months back as a week-long experiment, and found it so significantly improved the web that I’m not going back. (It did feel a little strange for a few days, as Concourse is a somewhat narrower sans-serif than the likes of Arial, but that’s about the specific fonts that I chose. Now it’s just perfectly natural.)I have experienced a very few icon-font related breakages, about which I wrote yesterday at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31540234, but it’s surprisingly few given how popular the technique was for a few years. I also get a fair bit of bonus unintended serif from people that have neglected to add a generic font family fallback, or misspelled it (e.g. sans or &#34;sans-serif&#34; (quoted) instead of sans-serif), so that it falls back to the global default, which I have left as a serif."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m kind of confused as to why they don&#39;t have a demo showing all the fonts. I&#39;m not just going to blindly pick from system fonts, I want to choose which I prefer first. Yeah I could look them all up, but just seems like they missed showing off the core thing..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article seems right up my alley, so here are some thoughts:- ZFS is pretty amazing in it&#39;s abilities, with it ushering in the age of software RAID over hardware RAID- ZFS shouldn&#39;t be limited to FreeBSD. The Linux port has come quite a long way. I&#39;d advise you to use PPA over repo though, as many key features are missing from the version on repos.- TrueNAS is more targeted towards enterprise applications. If you want good utility as a home user then give Proxmox or the like a look. Then you can make it into more than just a NAS (if you&#39;re open to it).- If you want to make things even more simple then consider something like UnRAID.- ZFS&#39; snapshotting can really shine on a virtualization server application, with the ability to revert KVM VMs to a previous state in a matter of seconds. Lookup Jim Salter&#39;s (great dude) Sanoid project to see a prime example.- I don&#39;t recall why, but I&#39;ve heard that RAIDZ should be avoided, in favor of stripped mirrors."</p>

There are a lot of options for secrets management these days, and making it harder for attackers to totally own you if they only manage to crack one piece of your infrastructure is key to limiting damage from this sort of attack."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have worked at home my whole career. It was life changing when I discovered I could aim several LED shop lights at my ceilings (90,000 lumens total, in a vaulted living room) to create a summer day indoors, even on the dimmest cloudiest winter day.When I remodeled my new home, I put 3 dimmable LED light strips around each ceiling, hidden above molding, so every ceiling is effectively a diffuse but high lumen light.Then I use smart bulbs in accent lamps and other lighting, to add color for variety and mood."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s an article? A rehash of a handful of common ideas with no relation to the title and no further exposition, let alone some support for the ideas? How does something so empty get upvoted so quickly? Did brightness and dark mode become some kind of belief system?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Phillips Hue lights are something you think is a luxury until you get them.The ability to have light change colour temperature or dim depending on the time is so calming.Whenever I revert back to the non—colour-temperature-adjusted light, I feel like I’m in an operating room.The only thing I would note is that they are dimmer than regular lights. Having dim lights in the middle of the day really makes me sleepy."</p>
