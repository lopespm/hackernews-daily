								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One nice thing I recognized is that the generated RSS feed contains full html text. I wish more blogging platforms are like this; save a lot of effort for feed readers.I&#39;d also recommend to add open graph meta for the blog posts. Presumably people will want to share the posts somewhere; a nice set of open graph metas goes a long way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Content in mataroa blogs is unfiltered and unmonitored. Users are free to publish any combination of words and pixels. However, content of animosity or disparagement of an individual or a group on account of a group characteristic such as race, colour, national origin, sex, disability, religion, or sexual orientation will be taken down immediately.&gt;If one notices something along those lines in a mataroa blog please let us know at admin@mataroa.blog.There should probably be something explicit in there about what kinds of pornography is allowed on the site. Also, the first part of the paragraph seems contradicted by the second: I would say users aren&#39;t really free to publish any combination of words given the sentence that follows.P.S. it looks like a great service"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was using and loved mataroa. It was the fairest, most painless option I had found for blogging (as of 2020.) I eventually switched away from it because the default font was small and I couldn’t change it. I wonder if this has been updated since. (At the moment, I’m hosting my blog as a static site with NFS. I go back and forth about wanting comments/email sign-up.)The developers were nice though, and I used their source code to learn Django. Really grateful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My time to shine! I work in music distribution.The Apple Music style guide is a great and accessible place to look if you&#39;re interested in music metadata: https://help.apple.com/itc/musicstyleguide/en.lproj/static.h...DDEX is the set of metadata standards used across the music industry: https://ddex.net/Also worth knowing that not all content on streaming services is music! Some of it is spoken word, ASMR, non-music field recordings, etc. The difference between sound and music is subjective of course though.On an artistic note, music can of course be presented in an infinite amount of ways. Not all these can be represented (i.e., re-presented) on streaming platforms. Installations and generative music for example. That&#39;s ok! To be able to represent all this music (and non-music) requires restrictions, otherwise we wouldn&#39;t be able to create programs for it in the first place.Sometimes restrictions on sound content are to make the streaming services friendlier to use, like the formatting of featured artists in titles. Royalty laws put restrictions on the handling of different roles, like songwriters and composers.BUT nothing is stopping you from building your own way of representing music digitally, so long as you follow relevant laws."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a reason why MusicBrainz SQL schema looks like what it looks like, after years of careful simplification to achieve an optimum approximation of reality.https://musicbrainz.org/doc/MusicBrainz_Database/Schema10+ years ago at Zvooq, during the golden age of music metadata and recsys startups, we tried to really solve entity resolution in the domain. I&#39;ve never seen another streaming service make an honest attempt at this, even at Spotify with their 2014 acquihire of the Echo Nest. You still get Utada and Hikaru Utada as ~completely separate entities"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand &#34;horrible&#34; in this case in a somewhat lighthearted sense. But it points to a tendency to simplify cultural complexity in the interest of &#34;legibility&#34; from the system perspective. The same diversity of cases need to be accommodated in much design done for, say, a diverse country like India where though urban populace me be English savvy, rural populace aren&#39;t necessarily so ... And even in urban areas local language and culture dominates.A place this diversity crops up most commonly is the so called &#34;standard&#34; firstname middlename lastname fields. This just doesn&#39;t work in India where people may have even 7 components to their names ... and who are you, dear system developer, to dictate what their name should be like.The name structure diversity I understand is a problem for Europe too with hyphenated names. This brilliant sketch by Fry and Laurie says it all - https://youtu.be/1LopIroSjsU"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been using Windows for about two years. Just this morning, when I booted into Windows, the boot loader (or whatever you call the part before Windows is fully loaded) prompted me saying I need to finish setting up. The only options were &#34;accept&#34; or &#34;remind me in 3 days&#34;, so I accepted. Then it asked me to change my default browser to Edge. Apparently &#34;finish setting up&#34; means &#34;we don&#39;t like that you are using Firefox&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the one hand, WSL has made Windows truly viable as a developer platform. But on the other hand, this sort of aggressive marketing bullshit makes it such an unfriendly place to be. I want my computer to treat me as an adult. Since it increasingly doesn&#39;t, I did the adult thing and walked away. If a relationship turns abusive, one must leave.I would love to be able to pay for &#34;Windows Professional&#34; or something to get rid of this bullshit. But I guess my eyeballs are more valuable than my dollars. In that case, MS will get neither.I moved back to Linux two months ago because of shit like this. Good riddance. Thankfully wine acts as the WSL for Linux, and makes the migration possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google started doing this with their search. And still does, regardless of how many times I say &#34;I&#39;m not interested&#34;. And as someone else mentioned here, Safari does the same.And Microsoft follows suit.Irritating as all hell, but complaints hit HN front page only when it comes to Microsoft.I do wish, though, that Microsoft would take the moral high ground."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Howdy. My name is Dave Martin. I&#39;m the CEO of WordPress.com.VM (Sorry, I don&#39;t know your full name) thank you for sharing your concerns. Comments aren&#39;t open on your blog, so I&#39;ll weigh in with a few thoughts below. I&#39;m happy to chat more about any of this in the comments below, or you can reach out to me directly via email dave.martin (at) automattic.com.You&#39;re right to call us out. I did a poor job of sharing context around why we are making change, so I can see how they could come as a shock. I&#39;m sorry! That&#39;s on me.Yes, as of this week we&#39;ve gone from 5 plans down to just 2. That said, we&#39;re not done making changes. This was the first of a couple of phases of changes.Those 5 older plans that you mentioned were the culmination of like 10 years worth of plans and features sort of haphazardly being added to WordPress.com with no real strategy. With those older plans, it was really hard for customers to see at-a-glance why they should choose one plan over another.Let me address a couple of the things you mentioned in your post:- No older sites/blogs have been affected by these new price changes. If your site is on an older plan, there should have been no changes to your billing.- As you pointed out, we have historically adjusted our subscription plan prices in a number of regional areas to ensure that WordPress.com stays affordable for folks in those areas. We will continue to do so. Looks like we forgot to do this for the new Pro plan. Thanks for calling this to our attention! We will get this updated ASAP.- Traffic limits will only be enforced on the honor system. If you consistently go over the cap month after month, we will let you know and ask you to pay a tiny bit more to cover the cost, but we will NEVER shut off access to your site, nor will we ever auto-increase the amount you&#39;re paying.- Our mission still remains to democratize publishing. We have no intention of ever removing older sites from WordPress.com. Even if you had a custom domain that expired, your site will always have a default WordPress.com sub-domain and your content isn&#39;t going anywhere.- The Pro plan you see now (at $15/mo) is essentially the the exact same plan as the old Business plan (which used to cost $25/mo). The only difference being the default storage that is available and a cost savings to customers of $10/mo.- We will be announcing affordable add-ons for both the free plan and the Pro plan to extend both your traffic and your storage as needed. In fact, we plan to also add a handful of affordable add-ons to the free plan to make it easy for customers to pick and choose which additional functionality they want, without needing to upgrade to the Pro plan.Again, thank you for sharing. I&#39;m sorry that I did a poor job of publicly sharing context around these changes, prior to making them. Please let me know if you have any additional questions or concerns."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the features WordPress.com doesn&#39;t offer on a free plan is a proper backup that can be restored to another WordPress instance. Posts/Pages/Comments and Media can be exported, separately, but for a proper backup you need to fork over $180.I have an old site on their $13/yr custom domain plan that I&#39;m probably going to let die this year because I don&#39;t wish to keep paying for it and it&#39;s not worth that hassle to restore to its original state on my own server."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Forgive me for this digression and for sounding selfish, but as a junior, I’ve really struggled for the last 2+ years to fully adapt to remote / hybrid working.I’m wondering if anyone has advice on how I can continue to grow and become a top-class engineer within a remote environment?Based on my experience so far, it’s very difficult to both onboard and mentor a junior from a remote setting. It’s not impossible, however, a lot of employers / teams still have not setup effective means for including and training the less experienced members of the team. I realise that much of this learning is of my own responsibility but I really, really miss spending time with my team and learning from those more experienced than I. I feel as though I have stagnated an awful lot over the last two years and there’s only so far self-learning can take you when software engineering is such a collaborative process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Same. Half the people we hired during work from home are remote (that was never allowed before). Now all meetings are on zoom and all conversations are on slack. Being in an office is beyond pointless. It wastes time, gas, etc. the main take away from the past 2 years is working in an office is beyond stupid (at least for certain careers like developers). I drive to work, communicate with no one except on the computer, then drive home. So so so stupid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the most frustrating part of being forced back to the Bay Area. Even before the pandemic, we always had distributed meetings, with people calling in from various buildings, conference rooms, phone booths, etc.So nothing changes between last month and this month, except that managers get peace-of-mind knowing I’m calling in from somewhere on the premises, and I’m back living in a place where I can’t afford a house.(I did have previous jobs where we worked on hard technical problems, and spending face-to-face time with a couple colleagues hashing out solutions at a whiteboard was invaluable. But that is not my FAANG job, where the whiteboards are rarely used for anything other than interview questions.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember many years ago coming across a reimplementation of the server side for a popular MMORPG of the time, reverse-engineered from the client (which was Flash) by what was likely a teenager --- it was over 100k lines in a single file, written in Visual Basic. Global variables everywhere, short names, and not even indentation. All the account data was stored in flat files, there was no actual DB. No &#34;best practices&#34; at all. Yet, not surprisingly, it worked pretty well and was actually not difficult to modify --- Ctrl+F would easily get you to the right place in the code.I guess the moral is, never underestimate what determination and creativity can do, and always be skeptical when someone says there&#39;s only one best way to do something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back in the days at Zynga, there was this ritual that new members of the STG (Shared Tech Group, which developed the game engine stack) had to try to refactor the road logic code.Suffice it to say, it&#39;s a 28k LOC file that was so bad, it could even hold up in court as evidence that a South American company stole the code of Zynga&#39;s -ville games. We could reproduce each and every single bug and its effects 1:1 in their games, with all the crashing scenarios that were easy to reproduce, hard to debug, and almost impossible to fix.Once you dig into the hole of depth sorting and being smart by &#34;just slicing&#34; everything into squared ground tiles on the fly, there&#39;s no way out of that spaghetti code anymore.Fun times, was always a joy seeing people give up to a single code file. The first step to enlightenment was always resignation :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So afraid to write bad, spaghetti code, I ended up writing no code at all.This thread made me realize that it&#39;s better to have a working profitable project with bad code, than a perfect unfinished  project, with meticulously chosen design patterns.Afraid   of being judged for bad code, I could not start until I had the right architecture.I&#39;m glad I read this.This is developers therapy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of the story one of my university teachers used to introduce himself. He was the most brilliant educator I&#39;ve had, really passionate about making sure people could actually follow and so humble. The course was called &#34;Digital and Computer Technology&#34; and it was a first year course teaching you to build a CPU starting from logic gates and then program it with assembly.He said that when he had recently graduated and just moved from Norway to Sweden his first job here was as a technician for the local railway. One of his first assignments was a call where the computer controlling all the track switches had stopped working. Luckily there was a backup, but they needed him to fix it immediately.He arrived, took a look at the computer and its backup running next to it. He started out by measuring voltages on both, comparing to see what the difference was. After a while some men in suits came in and asked how things were going. He said it was all good, they said it wasn&#39;t because now all trains had stopped. Apparently, he had short circuited the backup.&#34;And that&#39;s when I decided to go for a theoretical career!&#34; My teacher happily concluded. The classroom was left in a stunned silence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While having algorithms and computers dictating every aspect of train movements, crew scheduling, resource allocation is efficient and in a sense optimal, I think there&#39;s something compelling to be said about having a system that can survive with human-rememberable patterns when such an optimizer fails.   That it can fall back on (or have at the core) simple patterns that people can still operate without algorithmic intervention.  I.e. the algorithmic tuning enhances at the edges, and isn&#39;t at its core some tangled non-interpretable system that someone can&#39;t operate without computer assistance.  The idea of a protected set of core routes and staffing patterns that operates without having to be computer-determined?I used to be so impressed at European train stations that they had a single sheet that would give the entire day&#39;s arrivals and departures, down to which track.   I assume that behind that were schedules that weren&#39;t so far from being hand-calculated with equivalent sheets that told people and equipment where to be at what times.I think we lose something when we jump so far forward that you cannot fall back gracefully without a system completely breaking down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of when the entire Swiss train network shut down in 2005[0]This was, however, not due to a computer glitch, but problems in SBB&#39;s electrical grid, which lead to overload of some of the lines and then to a complete shutdown of the entire grid.Warnings were displayed on control consoles, but were drowned in 1000s of other meaningless warnings (there&#39;s a lesson for an UI designer here).I was in the ICE from Basel to Zurich at the time and after fuming for a few minutes I figured: &#34;What can you do?&#34; and moved to the bar wagon. There we had something of an impromptu party until there was no more power for the cash register and they stopped sales.In the end it was a (relatively) funny adventure for most and a huge embarrassment for SBB. I don&#39;t think they like to be reminded of that faithful day.[0] https://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/swiss-train-network-shuts-down/..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m not sure a lot people know that Albini ended up washing his hands of his work with Nirvana. After the recordings were wrapped and the mixes were done, Kurt was really unhappy with some of the sounds. If memory serves it was the vocals and the bass. They ended up doing some overdubs and sharpening things up in the low end in mastering. The very thing Albini specifically said he didn&#39;t want them to do. I personally think the results speak for themselves. In Utero is a FANTASTIC rock record. I can&#39;t help but wonder what the original would have sounded like though..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great letter. My favorite piece of writing from Albini is &#34;The Problem with Music&#34; [https://thebaffler.com/salvos/the-problem-with-music] in which he explains how record companies were screwing artists in vivid detail, numbers included. The first two paragraphs alone are worth reading."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Other than a few technical details, most of it seems to me like DIY punk cliches and goes on much too long. But I guess they know the business better than I do, hired Albini, and made a hit record, if that&#39;s what they wanted.I though the sound on In Utero was too glossy. Listen to live Nirvana, including their official live album. Nothing in a studio, by anyone, can compare and with the live material available it has no reason to exist.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LhYNe6yu0JMhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tGc8jL4dzaoAdmit it - you were sleeping. Was it for years? Now you&#39;re awake again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is pretty common actuallyAt Facebook too there was no staging environment. Engineers had their dev VM and then after PR review things just went into prodThat said features and bug fixes were often times gated by feature flags and rolled out slowly to understand the product/perf impact betterThis is how we do it at my current team too…for all the same reasons that OP states"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article has some very weird trade-offs.They can&#39;t spin up test environments quickly, so they have windows when they cannot merge code due to release timing. They can&#39;t maintain parity of their staging environments with prod, so they forswear staging environments. These seem like infrastructure problems that aren&#39;t addressing the same problem as the staging environment eo ipso.They&#39;re not arguing that testing or staging environments are bad, they&#39;re just saying their organization couldn&#39;t manage to get them working. If they didn&#39;t hit those roadblocks in managing their staging environments, presumably they would be using them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This works for services that are growing slowly in features or have few other services integrating with it. I’m not sure how this scales when there are multiple services across multiple teams with dependencies on one another where services are being rapidly developed with new features. At work, we have staging/pre-prod environments across most teams that my team works with so new features can be tested in staging and other teams can test integrating with it. This is also possible to do with just a production environment but requires some engineering effort to add feature flags and special headers indicating a request is from a team looking to try a new API."</p>
