								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amusingly - fittingly for our times - in the same issue of the exact same journal (Nature) another paper has been published that indicates that the prior, so much &#34;hyped&#34; discrepancy might be due to the theory having being applied inaccurately in the past. When computed with the new method, the experimental and theoretical models align far more accurately.So now all that matters is what kind of article do your want to write. A sensationalist one to get eyeballs or a realistic one that is far less exciting. Thus the exact same discovery can be presented via two radically different headlines:BBC goes with &#34;Muons: &#39;Strong&#39; evidence found for a new force of nature&#34;
https://www.bbc.com/news/56643677&gt; &#34;Now, physicists say they have found possible signs of a fifth fundamental force of nature&#34;ScienceDaily says: &#34;The muon&#39;s magnetic moment fits just fine&#34;
https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2021/04/210407114159.h...&gt; &#34;A new estimate of the strength of the sub-atomic particle&#39;s magnetic field aligns with the standard model of particle physics.&#34;There you have it, the mainstream media is not credible even when they attempt to write about a physics experiment ..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Switching to electric cars from ICE cars is continuing to do the wrong thing and make the wrong choices, but doing this wrong thing a bit better.It&#39;s still the same status quo, woefully terrible and unsustainable transportation model.Automobile oriented transportation doesn&#39;t scale, is a huge waste of resources, and perpetuates unsustainable, ultra expensive and resource intensive sprawling urban development patterns.In contrast more compact cities with bike lanes take CO2 intensive cars off the road, and less cars means less parking, which enables cheaper buildings with less CO2 intensive concrete parking lots. Wins all around.It&#39;s frustrating to see so called environmentalist politicians that go all in with big electric car mandates but can barely put any money toward active transportation and rebuilding our cities to be more space efficient and accordingly use less carbon.Remarkably former British Columbia Green Leader Andrew Weaver even got on twitter recently to oppose a Victoria area protected bike lane and got into all sorts of arguments with cyclists. Incredible to see an environmental leader do this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cycling is not only good for the environment, but for cities in general.During the last confinement, when car traffic completely stopped, I realised that cars are the single biggest reason why living in the city can be unpleasant. People may not realise it consciously, but when they move out of the city, what they are looking for is a place with not as much cars driving around.Cars destroy cities by making a vicious circle of making it unpleasant to live there, therefore enticing people to move to the suburbs and commute by car, which make the problem worse.Setting up biking infrastructure fixes this, because it reduces the room for cars used by commuters, while creating room for bicycles used by people living in the city.With less cars, you can make the city center where people work liveable. You can have offices mixed with housing and have people live close to their work place, further diminishing the need for cars.If you think that your city can&#39;t possibly be a good place to cycle because weather / hills / etc, you are probably mistaken. Electric bikes and the appropriate clothes make biking pleasant in most places. IF there are not too many cars and infrastructure for the bicycle of course, which is probably the thing you don&#39;t have"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; We also estimate that urban residents who switched from driving to cycling for just one trip per day reduced their carbon footprint by about half a tonne of CO₂ over the course of a year, and save the equivalent emissions of a one-way flight from London to New York.Put differently, reducing air travel is much more effective than ground travel habits at reducing your carbon impact.&gt; When we compared the life cycle of each travel mode, taking into account the carbon generated by making the vehicle, fuelling it and disposing of it, we found that emissions from cycling can be more than 30 times lower for each trip than driving a fossil fuel car, and about ten times lower than driving an electric one.I&#39;m surprised that bicycles are only 30/10x less.  It seems like, before any usage, manufacture of a single car would use far more than 10x the energy of manufacturing a bicycle (1000x?)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting. First time I&#39;ve head of Wuffs. As someone that still uses C, this in particular sounds neat:(from https://github.com/google/wuffs#goals-and-non-goals)&#34;&#34;&#34; Wuffs&#39; goal is to produce software libraries that are as safe as Go or Rust, roughly speaking, but as fast as C, and that can be used anywhere C libraries are used.[...] Wuffs the Library is available as transpiled C code. Other C/C++ projects can use that library without requiring the Wuffs the Language toolchain. Those projects can use Wuffs the Library like using any other third party C library. &#34;&#34;&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My favorite part of the Wuffs github page has to be the definition it gives for Dependent Types&gt; ...Dependent types are a way to implement compile-time bounds checking, but they&#39;re not the only way, and there&#39;s more to programming languages than their type systems. Wuffs does not use dependent types.Wuffs looks really interesting! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever even heard of a language that is designed to only be used in an auxiliary role along side another general purpose programming language!Edit: As pointed out below, scripting languages like Lua are used in an auxiliary role, but in a very different way! Wuffs is designed for use in the deepest most crucial parts of an app, where as scripting languages are typically GC&#39;d and used at the very highest levels, often times by animations, game designers, or even end users!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; decompressing the entire image all-at-once (into one large intermediate buffer) instead of one row at a time (into smaller, re-usable buffers). All-at-once requires more intermediate memory but allows substantially more of the image to be decoded in the zlib-decompressor’s fastest code paths.Mozilla&#39;s imagelib has a neat trick to gain performance while working with smaller memory buffers when you want to render the output image at a smaller resolution than it is encoded. They call it downscale-during-decode.So this library pulls zlib decompression into the decode loop. Imagelib on the other hand optimizes at the other end of the pipeline and pulls downscaling into the decode loop.imagelib&#39;s optimization has the advantage that it helps with both small images as long as they&#39;re not displayed pixel-exact and also makes decoding humungous images feasible without causing the browser to explode with OOMs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m probably going to make a few enemies with this opinion, but I think modern C++ is just an utterly broken mess of a language. They should have just stopped extending it after C++11.When I look at C++14 and later I can&#39;t help but throw my hands up, laugh and think who, except for a small circle of language academics, actually believes that all this new template crap syntax actually helps developers?Personally I judge code quality by a) Functionality (does it work, is it safe?), b) Readability c) Conciseness d) Performance and e) Extendibility, in this order, and I don&#39;t see how these new features in reality help move any of these meaningfully in the right direction.I know the intentions are good, and the argument is that &#34;it&#39;s intended for library developers&#34; but how much of a percentage is that vs. just regular app/backend devs? In reality what&#39;s going to happen is that inside every organization a group of developers with good intentions, a lack of experience and too much time will learn it all and then feel the urge to now &#34;put their new knowledge to improve the codebase&#34;, which generally just puts everyone else in pain and accomplishes exactly nothing.Meanwhile it&#39;s 2021 and C++ coders are still- Waiting for Cross-Platform standardized SIMD vector datatypes- Using nonstandard extensions, libraries or home-baked solutions to run computations in parallel on many cores or on different processors than the CPU- Debugging cross-platform code using couts, cerrs and printfs- Forced to use boost for even quite elementary operations on std::strings.Yes, some of these things are hard to fix and require collaboration among real people and real companies. And yes, it&#39;s a lot easier to bury your head in the soft academic sand and come up with some new interesting toy feature. It&#39;s like the committee has given up.Started coding C++ when I was 14 -- 22 years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The #1 feature I currently want is the ability to do an implicit lambda capture of a structured binding, at least by reference. I appreciate there are interesting corner cases of like, bindings to bitfields: I simply don&#39;t need those corner cases solved... if it just supported a handful of the most obvious cases I would be so so so happy, and then they can spend the next decade arguing about how to solve it 99% (which I say as we know it won&#39;t be 100%... this is C++, where everything is some ridiculous epicycle over a previous failed feature :/).(edit:) OMG, I found this feature in the list!! (It was in the set of structured bindings changes instead of with the changes to lambda expressions, which I had immediately clanged through.) I need to figure out now what version of clang I need to use it (later edit: I don&#39;t think clang has it yet; but maybe soon?)... this is seriously going to change my life.https://oleksandrkvl.github.io/2021/04/02/cpp-20-overview.ht..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope one day we can get a widely adopted C and C++ package manager. The friction involved in acquiring and using dependencies with odd build systems, etc. is one of the things I dislike about the language. I’m aware on Linux things are a bit easier, but if it were as easy as “npm install skia”, etc. everywhere, I think many people would use the language more.
 Rust has package management, but not the ecosystem yet. On the other hand, C/C++ has the ecosystem, but no standard way to easily draw from it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Give me a dedicated office with a door that can shut, allow me to commute during off-peak rush hours, and raise my pay or shorten my work hours for the same rate... then we will talk about coming back in.Currently:I have an dedicated office at home, I can shut my door and work when I need to be distraction free. I don&#39;t have my head pinched by headphones for hours, and I can work in silence like I prefer. No coworkers interrupting me when I&#39;m in the zone.I&#39;ve saved between 8-10 hours per week in not commuting. Worse, I&#39;ve had bosses who enjoy flexing by having meetings promptly at 8am, where you have to leave extra early because you travel at peak rush hour.I don&#39;t have to keep up appearances when I&#39;m done with my work for the day or moment. If I&#39;m waiting for responses or reviews, I can veg out, watch Netflix or play a video game, while staying on top of my email and work load. I&#39;ve also taken to getting some of my house work done during this time. Laundry, mowed grass, exercise, lots of little things that used to get stacked up on the weekend.I never have to eat off my diet, or feign excuses for not wanting to eat another office provided carb loaded meal. I stock my own foods, and have a hot meal for lunch everyday.Finally, I don&#39;t have to smell the 2 smokers that spend a couple of hours smoking every single day nor do I have to sit next to someone with questionable personal hygeine. Yes Richard, you smell awful, and stink up half the office with your body odor and cigarettes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t believe it.I do believe that 34% of polled workers said they would quit rather than return to the office, but I do not believe even a majority of them would actually go follow through on that threat. Especially if you filter out high paid/high job-security developers and similar people who might have the financial security to do so.People, particularly Americans, are shackled to their jobs for many reasons and most people are risk-averse.Despite myself being pro-remote, I think that we will see a sizable return to office-centric work culture over the next few years. The office may (hopefully) end up looking or feeling a bit different as an outcome. All the stories about the &#34;end of the office&#34; are overblown.Once it again becomes beneficial for your career and/or social life to participate in office culture people will come crawling back. Not saying it&#39;s a good thing, but it&#39;s what will happen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another recent Postgres-complaint post from one of the best engineers I&#39;ve worked with: https://blog.nelhage.com/post/some-opinionated-sql-takes/Quoting his conclusion:&gt; As for Postgres, I have enormous respect for it and its engineering and capabilities, but, for me, it’s just too damn operationally scary. In my experience it’s much worse than MySQL for operational footguns and performance cliffs, where using it slightly wrong can utterly tank your performance or availability. … Postgres is a fine choice, especially if you already have expertise using it on your team, but I’ve personally been burned too many times.He wrote that shortly after chasing down a gnarly bug caused by an obscure Django/Postgres crossover: https://buttondown.email/nelhage/archive/22ab771c-25b4-4cd9-...Personally, I&#39;d still opt for Postgres every time – the featureset is incredible, and while it may have scary footguns, it&#39;s better to have footguns than bugs – at least you can do something about them.Still, I absolutely wish the official Postgres docs did a better job outlining How Things Can Go Wrong, both in general and on the docs page for each given feature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it’s worth mentioning that most of these problems only occur at a scale that only top 1% of companies will reach. I’ve been using PostgreSQL for over a decade without reaching any of the mentioned scaling-related problems.PostgreSQL is still the best general purpose database in my opinion, and you can then consider using something else for parts of your application if you have special needs. I’ve used Cassandra alongside PostgreSQL for massive write loads with great success."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My single biggest beef about PG is the lack of query planner hints.Unplanned query plan changes as data distribution shifts can and does cause queries to perform orders of magnitude worse. Queries that used to execute in milliseconds can start taking minutes without warning.Even the ability to freeze query plans would be useful, independent of query hints. In practice, I&#39;ve used CTEs to force query evaluation order. I&#39;ve considered implementing a query interceptor which converts comments into before/after per-connection settings tweaks, like turning off sequential scan (a big culprit for performance regressions, when PG decides to do a sequential scan of a big table rather than believe an inner join is actually sparse and will be a more effective filter)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congratulations to the Django project and contributors on a big LTS release. And a huge thank you for the consistently excellent framework that so many have built their web dev careers on.I&#39;ll post this as a Show HN soon, but I&#39;ll mention it now as a soft-launch introduction. After a decade of using Django I started a project I always wanted to exist: backported security and bug fixes to old versions that the Django project has dropped support for.I&#39;ve seen many Django projects eventually get stuck on an old version as the team I&#39;m on is forced to defer upgrades in favor of commercial pressures and essential product delivery.So you can subscribe to https://www.codestasis.com/ to stay patched on your old version, removing the urgency to upgrade. Then unsubscribe when you&#39;re caught up.It&#39;s free for personal use and a paid subscription for businesses and organizations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple thoughts on django as a long time user.  First, the good:- Django was the first framework i learned when learning to code.  It&#39;s documentation was amazing, and it made conceptualizing an MVC framework really easy.- Django&#39;s ORM is phenomenal for managing migrations of a relational database, especially postgres with stuff like jsonb.   I&#39;ve even included it in non-python projects, just to handle table migrations/rollbacks.- The huge ecosystem is amazing.  Great for rapid prototyping.  Plugins for all kinds of crazy stuff.Now the bad:- In some ways it feels like a relic of an earlier stage of python.  It&#39;s support of asyncio is spotty at best (running the orm in a thread executor not a good work around).- It&#39;s support for type enforcement with mypy is not great.   This is maybe my biggest issue with using it on large collaborative projects.- It doesn&#39;t play nicely with a lot of the rest of the python ecosystem.  Want to swap in SQLAlchemy?  Sorry, no dice.  Want to have nice swagger documentation?  Use django rest framework or you&#39;re out of luck (i know it can be done, but it&#39;s kind of messy).  So in short, it&#39;s a bit of a monolith.These days I tend to only use django for it&#39;s orm in situations where i want a quick ad hoc database for something, or for rapid prototyping.  If I&#39;m going to do a larger project in python, I&#39;d definitely go with FastAPI.  But still, gotta appreciate that it&#39;s there, and has been reliable/well maintained for more than a decade."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Django is the gold standard for consistently pushing out reliable, well documented open source software without any marketing fluff or other bs. The amount of value the team is adding to the world can&#39;t be overstated."</p>
