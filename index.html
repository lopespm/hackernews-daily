								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll be the begrudging devils advocate for a decision that is sure to have devastating consequences for poor women in red states.It is good for unelected bodies like the Supreme Court to allow such dividing issues be figured out democratically. The US house has bled power to the other 3 institutions and of them, the judiciary is the least democratic. Ofc, my support for this change assumes that this Supreme Court will show restraint towards political activism (in either direction) in general. Call it naive, but I&#39;ll wait and see.States rights has always been a double edged sword. You can&#39;t have your cake and eat it too. The same state rights that allow gun control and homosexuality to be locally legalized before national concensus; also now lead to abortion legislation being a state issue.The sad part of democracy is that it aims to represent the views of the voting majority. If the voting majority truly cares about access to abortion then we will hopefully see enough democratic traction to give them the mandate needed. Now, the rural republican votes counting for more in the senate is a huge issue and threat to democracy that the US needs to figure out if it ever wants to represent the views of the people. But, the Supreme Court should not be responsible for managing dysfunction in other branches of govt.My personal opinion is that polarization has pushed both sides to be completely antagonistic towards each other. &#39;Own the libs, fuck the deplorables&#39;, no compromise. The jaded side of me says: vote in more moderates that are willing to strike compromises. Crazed jesus Republicans and hyperprogressive activists are terrible people to put into national office. They gain power by antagonizing and being unhelpful roadblocks for change, all while asking for the most stubbornly impossible outcomes.In the long run, history will have a dim view of this era of global polarization with all political sides to blame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I almost lost my wife due to the Catholic Hospital&#39;s policy against D&amp;C procedures. Had the OBGYN not put his career on the line, and over-riding the prohibition on the procedure, she would have died.  Now that same hurdle can become risking prison.A few years later, we were blessed with a child who is doing well. I would have neither if not for Roe v. Wade.This isn&#39;t about abortion, it&#39;s about denying healthcare!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before anyone writes a eulogy based on the headline, note the following:So it’s sad, but also awesome in its own way, that 2022 will see the end of Zachtronics. Not because their publisher shuttered them, or because their venture capital funding ran out, or because Activision made them work on Call of Duty, or any other number of reasons (bankruptcy! scandal!) game developers usually close their doors.No, Zachtronics is closing because...they want to.“We’re wrapping things up!” Barth tells me, way more enthusiastically than you would normally expect under these circumstances. “Zachtronics will release Last Call BBS next month. We’re also working on a long-awaited solitaire collection that we’re hoping to have out by the end of the year. After that, the team will disband. We all have different ideas, interests, tolerances for risk, and so on, so we’re still figuring out what we want to do next.”I play games too infrequently to invest the necessary bandwidth into a Zachtronic game, but I read some of ZACH-LIKE and always respected the philosophy. As long as no one is getting the rug pulled, this sounds like an awesome way to go and an awesome thing for the gaming industry. Hopefully this means more smart indie gems in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve found it difficult after starting to work full-time to fully enjoy Zachtronics games, since they use much of the same parts of my brain as my day job, but the sheer joy I got out of Zach&#39;s earlier games (SpaceChem, KOHCTPYKTOP, Codex of Alchemical Engineering) contributed a lot to my decision to work in software. I&#39;ve experienced little else that scratches the &#34;design itch&#34; in such a pure and thoughtful way, whether games from other developers or actual software development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zachtronics leaving game development is such a blow to the industry. Zach is directly and indirectly responsible for a lot of games we see today. His game Infiniminer was a major inspiration for Minecraft, he published a game that was also a book explaining his philosophy on puzzle design, and his games were genuinely fun with no BS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is Alina Chan, one of the co-authors of Viral: The Search for the Origin of Covid-19.I’m going to answer some of the questions that have come up in the comments.1. Are Chan and Ridley selling a book?Yes, the updated paperback comes out in the US next week: https://www.harpercollins.com/products/viral-matt-ridleyalin...The updated epilogue now discusses three significant new developments since the publication of the hardback that are being hotly debated in the comments here. The first was the discovery of a virus in a bat in Laos that is slightly more similar to SARS-CoV-2 than the virus studied at the Wuhan Institute of Virology; but both are still not the progenitor of the pandemic. The second is detailed information about how prominent western virologists, who had privately thought the virus was likely manipulated in a laboratory, began to instead tell the public that no lab-based scenario was plausible. The third is a trio of conflicting studies about whether the Huanan seafood market was the site of a natural spillover of the virus from animals to people or just the site of a human superspreader event in December 2019.As with the hardcover, half of our earnings from the book have gone/will go to charity.2. Does the available evidence lean towards a market origin?Some experts have asserted that there is dispositive evidence that the virus jumped from animals to people at the Wuhan Huanan market. However, their analysis failed to take into account the realities in the early days of the pandemic. Without access to the methodology and actual data collected by investigators in Wuhan, their interpretation unfortunately falls prey to ascertainment bias. Please see this thread for details: https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/1499794942012579843At the moment, US intelligence, the WHO SAGO advisory group, and many top virologists and experts find both natural and lab origin hypotheses plausible and deserving of investigation. The evidence does not lean so strongly towards one hypothesis or the other that we can assume one as the default truth.I personally think the available evidence points towards a lab origin but would not go as far as to say that there is dispositive evidence of it. 
Please see these 2 threads:
https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/1524394197738049537
https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/15397457368076165133. Can scientists manipulate and genetically engineer naturally found viruses without leaving a trace? In other words, can the genome of the virus tell us its recent history?We describe the seamless genetic engineering capabilities developed in the years leading up to the pandemic in VIRAL. Due to advanced technologies, it is no longer always possible to use the genome of a virus to distinguish between a natural pathogen vs one that has spent time in a laboratory. Even top coronavirologists, including Ralph Baric who collaborated with the Wuhan scientists, have said that the only way to know is to look at the Wuhan lab records. You can also read my twitter thread: https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/1493733086089121794Even the presence of the furin cleavage site insertion that is unique to the pandemic virus and is indeed what makes it a highly infectious pandemic virus is not “dispositive evidence” of either a natural or lab origin. Please see our peer-reviewed analysis here: https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/39/1/msab327/64260854. Why does the lab leak hypothesis encompass so many different scenarios by which research activities could lead to the emergence of the pandemic virus?A natural spillover hypothesis also encompasses several different scenarios, e.g., bat direct transmission to people in natural habitats, bat to people in markets, bat to farmed animals or wildlife to people in nature, at farms or market, etc.This doesn’t mean that a natural or lab origin are insinuations. It just means we are lacking so much key evidence that it’s not possible to pin down an exact mechanism by which the virus emerged in the Wuhan human population.5. Does finding close relatives of the pandemic virus in bats, e.g., in Laos, mean that its origin is natural?No, because viruses that escape from labs were also ultimately derived from nature and we know that scientists in Wuhan had been collecting viruses from across 8 countries (China and SE Asia) where the closest relatives to the pandemic virus have been found. Please see the graphic in this tweet: https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/15221172706124513356. Is there anything to do about finding the origin of Covid-19 now? Isn’t it a dead end? And is that why interest is waning?There is plenty to do to investigate the origin of Covid-19 using sources and data that exist outside of China. Please see a recent peer-reviewed letter in PNAS: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2202769119And my thread on it: https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/1527381169729425410It is very surprising to me that these feasible routes of inquiry have not been explored more than 2 years into the pandemic.7. Have infected animals on sale at the Huanan market been found? Was there any evidence that SARS-like viruses were circulating in the Wuhan animal trading community before the emergence of Covid-19?No. I recommend reading my medium post for more details: https://ayjchan.medium.com/a-response-to-the-origins-of-sars...8. Regardless of the origin of Covid-19, shouldn’t the focus be on making sure there is more oversight and regulation of current and future pathogen research?I agree and wish that we didn’t need to prove the origin of this pandemic to motivate scientific leaders to better regulate risky pathogen work. I have been dedicating efforts to this cause since last year and hope to be able to share some exciting news later this year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those with a bit more background in the sciences, there&#39;s an increasingly massive amount of evidence to support Zoonotic origin.  Philipp Markolin has a good rundown:https://protagonistfuture.substack.com/p/natures-neglected-g...Most of the &#34;evidence&#34; for lab leak is just weird insinuation -- it&#39;s increasingly hard to pin down what the advocates for that position are even arguing (e.g. whether it&#39;s a natural virus that escaped or an engineered one, how different lineages showed up at the market, which lab it allegedly escaped from since the WIV campus is much further from the market compared to the CCDC, etc etc).China is a bad actor and definitely contributed to the conspiracy madness around the virus by being so shut-down and performing such a half-assed investigation but unfortunately they would have done the same whether the virus came to be via the same animal trade that caused the last SARS outbreak or if there was some secret Wuhan project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think understanding the origin is important, but I also understand why it wasn&#39;t a media fixation during the pandemic itself.1) Understanding the origin doesn&#39;t change the consequences or response to the pandemic2) Unlike the nuclear analogy in the article, pandemic virus outbreaks happen naturally, and fairly frequently. Combined with the huge increase in global travel, when one does happen it can be around the world in every airport before anyone has even identified it.So in the big picture this type of outbreak seems inevitable, not anomalous or inherently preventable.Understanding the origin, either by cross-species origination or a laboratory containment breach, is indeed important and significant and should be pursued, but I also understand why the search for that answer isn&#39;t at the top of the 24-hour news cycle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Banning sending URLs via SMS is a terrible idea, there are too many valid use cases.Potentially disabling URLs from alphanumeric senders is a good idea, but it’s also very easy to get virtual numbers for sending SMS spam.I think a good balance would be making URLs not clickable for any number that is not in your contacts which also makes it difficult to copy and paste for an average user.The onus is then on providers to make sure anyone they may send links to saves the number as a contact and that they always use the same number, and have that number on their website.So when you register for delivery notifications a message goes out saying you should save the contact number. If all Fedex notifications come from the same number the user only needs to do this once."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bottom line up front: When sending tokens via SMS, you must include a &#34;do not share this token with anyone besides X.com&#34; text. Otherwise account takeovers become trivial.The article&#39;s attack is relatively benign - the user simply goes to a website. Sure they may end up putting info in that website, but probably not. Plus existing systems for malicious website filtering can kick in to prevent this.The more concerning attack is the social engineering one where a third party says something like &#34;let me &#39;verify&#39; your identity, I&#39;ll send you a number tell me what it is&#34; then triggers an identity verification request on the domain (this can be done either manually or part of a sign up flow for some honeypot service). Now the target needs only relay 6 digits to someone they already &#34;trust&#34; and are in a conversation with, versus in the article&#39;s example they needed to put their full account info into an unknown website."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"All their marketing seems to be pitching the product against Google Analytics. But they don&#39;t spend any time differentiating themselves from other privacy-first analytics companies, of which there are many.I mean, when they started in 2018:&gt; Uku’s first thought was, “Ugh. Can we just  use something other than Google Analytics?”. This is how the idea for Plausible was born.Surely they must have looked around and seen that there were already quite a few products doing privacy-first analytics? But yet they started anyway? And had success even though their marketing doesn&#39;t really state any reasons why the user should use them not the many other privacy-first analytics offerings out there?I mean I&#39;m happy for them that they&#39;re successful, but I think there must be more to it than alluded to in this blog post, both in (a) the decision to start in the face of lots of competition and (b) success despite not trying to differentiate themselves from the competition."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I might be abusing the term here, but Plausible seems like the best example of a mittelstand[1] that sells SaaS.They are not beholden to VC investors and can grow slowly, organically. According to this article, they were able to cover their costs by January 2021. By keeping their team small, they can remain sustainable for a long time and refine their product.The biggest challenge for growth right now seems to be that customer support costs will scale linearly with growth.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31327219"</p>

What&#39;s happening is that a financial institution is being regulated and pro-actively adopting steps to please regulators. And those regulators will never be satisfied.As regulators squeeze harder and harder, it will drive Coinbase under. That is not the disaster that some might think. It&#39;s a necessary next step for Bitcoin to prove that it can actually deliver on the promise of censorship-resistant money.At the very least what&#39;s happening with exchanges, regulation, and the over-eager suits at Coinbase demonstrates the need for censorship-resistance in the first place.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Currently this seems to apply only for customers in the Netherlands:https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/trading-and-funding/se...Related to this:In 2020 the Netherlands approved the implementation for the European fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5). Crypto providers operating in or from the Netherlands also needed to apply for registration with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB). Besides the AMLD5 implementation DNB required from crypto providers to implement additional measures, which is the same wallet verification that Coinbase now requires.Bitonic (a dutch crypto broker/provider) filed a lawsuit against DNB regarding the additional wallet verification requirement, which was not part of AMLD5. DNB formally acknowledged the complaints from Bitonic and revoked the wallet verification. I&#39;m not sure but I believe (until now) it has only be revoked for Bitonic.Bitonic published some articles on their site:https://bitonic.nl/en/news/206/dutch-amld5-implementation-la...https://bitonic.nl/en/news/224/lawsuit-bitonic-vs-dutch-cent...https://bitonic.nl/en/news/231/dnb-formally-acknowledges-com..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the future of databases, but nobody seems to realize it yet.One of the biggest problems with databases (particularly SQL ones) is they&#39;re a giant pile of mutable state. The whole idea of &#34;migrations&#34; exists because it is impossible to &#34;just&#34; revert any arbitrary change to a database, diff changes automatically, merge changes automatically. You need some kind of intelligent tool or framework to generate DDL, DML, DCL, they have to be applied in turn, something has to check if they&#39;ve already been applied, etc. And of course you can&#39;t roll back a change once it&#39;s been applied, unless you create even more program logic to figure out how to do that. It&#39;s all a big hack.By treating a database as version-controlled, you can treat any operation as immutable. Make any change you want and don&#39;t worry about conflicts. You can always just go back to the last working version, revert a specific change, merge in one or more changes from different working databases. Make a thousand changes a day, and when one breaks, revert it. No snapshotting and slowly restoring the whole database due to a non-reversible change. Somebody dropped the main table in prod? Just revert the drop. Need to make a change to the prod database but the staging database is different? Branch the prod database, make a change, test it, merge back into prod.The effect is going to be as radical as the popularization of containers. Whether you like them or not, they are revolutionizing an industry and are a productivity force multiplier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That looks awesome. One of the listed use-cases is &#39;time-travel&#39;: https://dolthub.com/blog/2021-03-09-dolt-use-cases-in-the-wi...I wish we could use this at work. We&#39;re trying to predict time-series stuff. However, there&#39;s a lot of infrastructure complexity which is there to ensure that when we&#39;re training on data from years ago, that we&#39;re not using data that would be in the future from this point (future data leaking into the past).Using Dolt, as far as I understand it, we could simply set the DB to a point in the past where the &#39;future&#39; data wasn&#39;t available. Very cool"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A quick scroll through the comments and it looks like no one is actually talking about the book itself, so I will. I came across it at a really good time in my computer science self education. It helped me learn about some essential data structures and algorithmic analysis. The video lectures interspersed in the text augment the text and vice versa. The sections without videos were tougher for me to digest, but are written clearly and bear revisiting and study. If you, like me, are looking for a good next step after Grossman’s PL MOOC, I recommend spending some time with this incredible free resource."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found my experience trying to work with a large OCaml base a nightmare — when signatures changed in an unstable dependency (e.g. function argument removed and nested inside another), the errors spat out by the typechecker were utterly incomphrehensible.This was largely due to automatic currying in OCaml — if I have a function call &#34;some_function arg1 arg2&#34; and &#34;some_function&#34; adds a third argument, that call becomes a function that requires a single argument, arg3, but the typechecker message that tells you all of this is well-nigh unintelligible.Switching to Rust was a blessed relief, not least because Rust has much better developer tooling and documentation (but also no automatic currying).It made me think that OCaml is efficient and beautiful if you&#39;re the only person touching your specific codebase (which I think is true in the vast majority of cases) or if many of your colleagues are deep OCaml officionados with PhDs, but it&#39;s not a good collaborative language for the rest of us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent a lot of time on Standard ML in university.OCaml was always portrayed as the engineer&#39;s alternative for real applications.I spent some time brushing up on OCaml a few years ago using Exercism.io.While OCaml is a personal &#34;top tier&#34; language, I&#39;d always prefer Haskell, Rust or Scala.Type classes / traits just seem to beat a higher-order module system for me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All these things are related.  Back in the 1990s I worked with others to develop DSL technologies (ADSL, HDSL, VDSL) for telcos.  Why not fiber, some ask?  oh, fiber materials may be sand, but installed fiber is sand, energy, and labor.  Installation costs trump everything - use what you have for the physical medium.While we (PairGain) also made point-to-point private links, it was clear then, and even moreso now that most DSL involves a service provider managing the network - with specialized skills, practices and setup.In the 2010&#39;s I was spending time with the Ethernet folks, and in particular industrial folks with large plants.  I ended up chairing IEEE Std 802.3cg which developed the 10 Mb/s 1km technology.  Not really a speed increase - more an application refocus.  As the networking world developed, many realized that converging networks above the physical layer added network complexity and therefore setup and ongoing operating costs...  So we now also have SPE - pure Ethernet at DSL-like distances...Similar tech with different use models, enabling connectivity for whatever...I&#39;m not Al Gore - I won&#39;t claim to have invented the internet.  I just an engineer who happened to have a hand in both of these technologies, and am still pleased to see that people use them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I built a tiny single pair Ethernet bridge (10BASE-T1L) that can transmit 10mbps over a kilometer on a single pair of twisted copper wires.Would love to get some feedback for the next iteration"</p>
