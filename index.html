								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"was posted here sometime ago:The door refused to open. It said, &#34;Five cents, please.&#34; He searched his pockets. No more coins; nothing. &#34;I&#39;ll pay you tomorrow,&#34; he told the door. Again he tried the knob. Again it remained locked tight. &#34;What I pay you,&#34; he informed it, &#34;is in the nature of a gratuity; I don&#39;t have to pay you.&#34; &#34;I think otherwise,&#34; the door said. &#34;Look in the purchase contract you signed when you bought this conapt.&#34; In his desk drawer he found the contract; since signing it he had found it necessary to refer to the document many times. Sure enough; payment to his door for opening and shutting constituted a mandatory fee. Not a tip. &#34;You discover I&#39;m right,&#34; the door said. It sounded smug. From the drawer beside the sink Joe Chip got a stainless steel knife; with it he began systematically to unscrew the bolt assembly of his apt&#39;s money-gulping door. &#34;I&#39;ll sue you,&#34; the door said as the first screw fell out. Joe Chip said, &#34;I&#39;ve never been sued by a door. But I guess I can live through it.&#34;(Philip K. Dick: Ubik)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is just bullshit.A $8/mo charge for a app based remote start? I could live with that. Servers need power, the app needs updates etc.A $8/mo charge for something which does not incur costs for Toyota? Hell no.It seems like bit by bit - every single industry is going down a fucked up route. TVs with built in ads? Cars with pay-by-month features? DRM locked coffee machines? I really hope, there is some sort of evil-bullshit-corp ranking homepage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And the toxic trend of corporate short-term-ism continues...This is clearly set up as a gotcha with a 3 year/10 year &#34;trial&#34; included, then suddenly $80(!) a year. The irony is that both periods are right around the time different demographics start to consider a new vehicle, and Toyota has just pulled this nonsense.You may be thinking $80/year isn&#39;t so bad if it includes breakdown coverage/SOS button, but you&#39;d be mistaken. The $80/year is ONLY for their &#34;Remote Connect&#34; service (app stuff, remote lock/unlock/start and notifications), you also need to pay another $80/year for &#34;Safety Connect&#34; (breakdown, SOS, stolen vehicle location), &#34;Wi-Fi Connect&#34; starting at $420/year for 2GB, and &#34;Destination Assist&#34; for $80/year.So you could be paying $660 per year OR MORE for your Toyota vehicle subscriptions alone.edited/fixed: &#34;per year&#34; now, instead of a confusing mix of per month and per year. Also, originally miscalculated the per year total and mislabelled it on top (was &#34;$275 per month&#34; which is double-wrong)."</p>

Someone mass banned my google dev account for one app that I had for around 8 years as &#34;impersonating or trying to impersonate&#34; whatever that means.I applied for review and got an automated review that even all related accounts will be banned and they went ahead and banned a related play dev account.Weird thing is that I have a google cloud account with $120k yearly spend and my startup on it. Time to hedge my bets and move off google cloud."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m suspicious of video #4 being the reason.There is a wave of people copying other people&#39;s music, claiming as their own and then sending claims to the original video.Maybe since your channel is small, Youtube decided to just ban. I&#39;ve seen it happened with people who tried to pirate music more than once.I don&#39;t post any music at all on Youtube. It all goes trough a third-party service that posts on my behalf and on streaming services."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work solely in marketing/advertising and have no clue how to code. I generally enjoy technology, which is why I&#39;m on HN.I think marketers and developers need a stronger culture between ourselves. The tools of marketers (data mining, consumer behavior analysis, surveys, market testing, etc) aren&#39;t just a veneer to be applied at the completion of a development project. Marketing, when done correctly, informs UX. Marketing can provide developers with insights into the problems they should try to solve.From what I can tell, many developers view the development process as a sacred protected space for creation. This is not the optimal means to delivering a high-impact product. Developers should be asking themselves during the development process: &#34;Is this feature going to excite a group of users, and do we have some statistical mechanism to predict that excitement?&#34;When you create something that you already know will excite people, the product launch becomes much simpler."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s the thing. Developers are generally perfectionists and marketers are realists. As a Developer, I am naturally uncomfortable with marketing because my default view is that I don&#39;t want to lie or over-promise and I don&#39;t like fluffy claims.Marketers and sales people can be less bothered about facts but I think much of the time, we just think that, the truth is that there can be a lot of fact-based marketing but also you just have to remember that your product will never be a perfect fit and neither are any of your competitors but you can sell anyway because you are making your customer&#39;s life better, not perfect!Imagine you are selling something like a Toyota SUV. Is it perfect? No. Is it the best price-point? Possibly not; the best MPG? Probably not but I am selling a package, a vehicle that ticks a lot of boxes for someone and ultimately something that is better than the competitors in some ways and worse in others.If I am uncomfortable selling the Toyota because the MPG isn&#39;t the best it could be, I am not saving the customer from disappointing MPG, I am pushing them to a competitor and taking away the benefits that they would get from a Toyota.If your product solves a problem, assuming it isn&#39;t garbage, then it will be better than competitors in some ways and worse in others. You can market it accordingly!Good luck."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I struggle with marketing so much. I built an amazing product, existing customers love it, but spending any time on doing marketing feels like either wasting development time or spending time to try to force people into buying something they might not want.Most ads are trying to trick you into buying stuff you don&#39;t really need. I know there are cases in which you actually see a relevant ad for something you really want to buy and that will bring value to your life, but that&#39;s usually an edge case.What I am working on doing now is to combine development + marketing. Instead of creating marketing material to sell, I am creating marketing material to educate: create how-to instructional videos, technical blog posts, improve the documentation, etc. If you sell a tool I think this is the best way to go, instead of advertising how cool your tool is, teach people how to use your tool and what they can do with it (eg. if you sell a hammer don&#39;t show people how to drive nails and give a 50% limited time discount code; teach them how to build a chair and let them decide themselves if they need a hammer or not)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The coloring, fonts, monsters, sets, and UIs of NGE are so pleasing to look at.I hold NGE in much higher regard than other similar IPs, and would continue to do so even without the excellent art direction. Like many other stories, NGE asks &#34;what would happen if a young boy with an unusual ability was entrusted with the saving of humanity?&#34; However, unlike many other stories, the show answers &#34;he would fail, be driven insane in the process, and humanity would fall.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The typography in Evangelion&#39;s titlecards is a tribute to Japanese film pioneer Kon Ichikawa. For instance, Ichikawa lets diagonal and horizontal layouts coexist in the titlecard to bring typography into a different dimension. In his masterpiece &#34;The Inugami Family&#34;[1], the opening title is just 90 seconds of white Gothic typeface on a black background, but the layout is playful, letting the font speak more than the text themselves.[2] In fact, director Anno Hideaki drew inspiration from this in Evangelion.Ichikawa was very keen on layout. While Ichikawa mainly focused on live action features, he began his career as an animator, where he honed his craft of laying out &#34;deliberate&#34; camera shots. Later in &#34;Brother&#34;,[3] he was even criticized for a jarring camera layout, where characters sometimes bifurcate the shot composition by standing in the middle. [4]Ichikawa continued with his &#34;jarring&#34;
style; he would insert sudden bursts of opposite shots in the middle of characters speaking. The influence of Ichikawa&#39;s cutting style is evident in Anno&#39;s works too. For example, in the expository scene in the &#34;End of Evangelion&#34;, he would also insert brief shots of the subjects the characters are talking about. (e.g. &#34;Second Impact&#34;, &#34;Adam&#34;, and such jargon)Anno is like a Japanese Tarantino; he absorbed much influence from his predecessors, and refines their qualities in his own works. Right now in Tokyo, the Anno Hideaki exhibit is gathering much fanfare. A good portion of the exhibit is devoted not to his works, but the prior art he was heavily influenced by. Clearly, he wants to give more credit to his predecessors by giving them the spotlight they deserve.[1] https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0074691/[2] Opening title: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wkAryQPocLA[3] https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0054151/[4] Ichikawa also innovated in film color processing, where he and cinematographer Kazuo Miyakawa left the silver while processing film, giving an eerie lush glow to the colors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Typeface work in NGE it&#39;s amazing. Despite using the most common typefaces, you can recognize the card titles as the &#34;Evangelion Art Style&#34; despite only using fonts, copywriting and layout as design elements.Plus I love how Evangelion falls into a middle of exaggerated UIs to have the &#34;hacker look&#34; of /r/itsaunixsystem/, and at the same an amazing level of detail that make sense in their own world.Like when MAGI it&#39;s being hacked by the Computer Angel or SEELE, you can see they use a form of assembly and a Unix System to fight it.And then, the MAGI system by itself it&#39;s an amazing use of redundant architecture with 3 computers that should have the same output. That a system that it&#39;s resistant to data corruption, but at the same time working as an GAN AI.Amazing to think this it&#39;s from the 90s, and the most amazing part that those details are just 1% of what makes evangelion interesting."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; As TypeScript is a core part of the Deno ecosystem, we are also very interested in pushing for even closer alignment of TypeScript and JavaScript in the future.I&#39;ve wondered why the frontend community hasn&#39;t gotten together and said, &#34;The next version of JavaScript - is TypeScript!&#34; I&#39;ve been using TypeScript for five years professionally now and cannot understate how much easier it has made large frontend (not just Web, but mobile and desktop) projects.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I’d like to see, in browsers, Cloudflare Workers, Deno, etc: explicit network firewall in the software stack.An example with Workers, one script might only need to fetch from Backblaze. I’d like to set their host as a whitelisted address, and so even if a log4j type vuln happens, it can’t go anywhere except Backblaze.I think this could even work in browser-land? If you don’t need to pull in any resources outside the original host, deny any fetch made unless it’s added to a whitelist. For browsers this would need to be opt-in for backwards compatibility, but an ideal state would be opt-out (to allow all)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My experience has always been that &#34;not supported&#34; means anywhere from &#34;physically impossible&#34; (e.g. because there just isn&#39;t that many address bits) to &#34;we won&#39;t help you because we haven&#39;t tested it&#34;.Some quick searching shows that others have managed to get that CPU to use 32GB of RAM:https://forums.overclockers.com.au/threads/p55-chipset-i5-75...I thought he would go as far as patching the BIOS itself, which would make it a &#34;permanent&#34; fix. In fact one of the projects I haven&#39;t gotten around to finishing is to patch the memory init code for an old Atom processor embedded motherboard to make it recognise more combinations of RAM modules; analysis of the BIOS and leaked sources shows that it was stupidly written as &#34;if(512MB in slot 1 and 512MB in slot 2) ... else if(1GB in slot 1 and empty slot 2) else if(1GB in slot 1 and 1GB in slot 2) ...&#34;, when the memory controller can actually be set up generally to work with many more different configurations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was looking to Hackintosh an older Dell desktop I had squirreled away and in the process of gathering all the hardware every piece of documentation I found insisted that it topped out at 4GB. This was a late-era Core 2 so that seemed completely nonsensical to me (I don&#39;t think I ever owned a Core 2 that had less than 8) and, wouldn&#39;t you know it, 8GB worked perfectly fine.Funnily enough, like the article&#39;s author I also encountered a DSDT-related problem on that same system: if you were to dump the tables and recompile them with the standard Intel utility it straight up wouldn&#39;t work. Came to find out that there are apparently two compilers, one from Intel and another from MS and the MS one is super-lenient about accepting garbage. Eventually worked out that the logic in the stock tables was such that several features (HPET and sleep, iirc) just straight up don&#39;t work unless the OS identifies itself to ACPI as Vista (and not like Vista+, Vista exclusively). Such a pain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of course they&#39;re scared. Even if Intel is able to close performance gaps, cloud computing is often an easy sell for ARM and Amazon is likely going to be able to get the chips cheaper given that they&#39;re looking for markup on the service end while Intel needs markup on the chip.If I&#39;m writing new software using Java, C#, Python, JavaScript, etc. it&#39;s easy to deploy to ARM. With Apple moving to ARM and 25% of developers using Macs (41-45% using Windows)*, there&#39;s going to be good ARM support for what developers need. Sure, some things might might run better on Intel and some things might not easily port, but that feels like it isn&#39;t the case for the majority of stuff that developers are going to be doing.It seems likely that Microsoft and Google will introduce ARM-based instances. We know Google has dipped its toe in with its Tensor processor for the Pixel. We&#39;ve seen reports that Microsoft has been working on ARM processors for servers. Qualcomm is gearing up for a major push into better ARM processors to compete with Apple on the desktop/laptop, but presumably they&#39;d be happy to get cloud workloads as well. Oracle, while not a major cloud provider, has ARM-based instances already.Intel has had a virtual monopoly for 20 years. Now they&#39;re facing a resurgent AMD stealing x86 marketshare and ARM processors that are quickly becoming a better price/performance option - and Apple is ensuring that everything developers need will be ARM compatible. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s an existential threat, but there&#39;s a huge difference between the margins you get as a virtual monopoly and the margins you get when you have to compete against strong competitors.Plus, I&#39;d guess that AWS is probably making sweet margins off those Graviton instances. Let&#39;s say that their margin on Intel instances is X and that margin on Graviton is 2X. That leaves AWS a lot of room to start pushing Intel out of their datacenters as old hardware is replaced. Let&#39;s say you&#39;re a company spending $100M/year with AWS and you&#39;re renewing your contract. Maybe Amazon suggests that they could give you a 20% discount off Intel boxes and a 40% discount off Graviton boxes - which they say are already 20% better price/performance so it&#39;s basically 52% off!It also gives AWS negotiating power with Intel. If 20% of AWS customers move to Graviton, you can go to Intel and say, &#34;we&#39;re finding Graviton processors really cheap to make and operate and customers are loving them...more and more they&#39;re realizing they don&#39;t need your Intel processors...if we don&#39;t get cheaper Intel processors, we might have to accelerate our incentives to get people onto Graviton boxes...the more we accelerate that, the more Google Cloud and Azure will likely want to prioritize ARM boxes...&#34;They&#39;re scared because it&#39;s the type of thing that snowballs until their lock-in is near meaningless. If ARM becomes 50% of the server market, there goes Intel&#39;s ability to demand high margins. 5-10 years from now, most deployments could use Intel or ARM based on price/performance rather than instruction set - and that makes life a lot harder for Intel.The problem with this ad/page is that the ship has already sailed. Once Apple introduced its M1 MacBooks, we were getting first-class ARM support for everything developers would need going forward. It didn&#39;t happen overnight, but with Apple going all-in on ARM chips and with Macs being such a big player in developer usage, the war was lost that day. Now it&#39;s just a matter of time. Once all your devs are running and testing their stuff on an M1 MacBook, why not deploy it to an ARM instance?* From StackOverflow&#39;s 2021 developer survey"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This ad reminds me of the way it felt to work at Sun Microsystems around 2002, when all the engineers  knew that cheap GNU Linux boxes were the future. The marketing people had similar FUD-based ads about how the TCO of Linux was higher, how certain HPC jobs wouldn’t run well etc. super similar to this Intel ad today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"25 years ago I was excited to learn that the Quake editor (and Doom before that) was written on NeXT. I figured with my rudimentary Linux and C skills I could get it working, but of course it was a little harder than installing everything and running makeFrom JohnC:&#34;This is a NEXTSTEP application, so hardly anyone is going to be able to use the code as is. This is not an OPENSTEP application. It doesn&#39;t even use the foundation kit, so porting to gnustep or openstep-solaris/mach/nt would not be trivial.&#34;&#34;This application was really not a very good fit for NEXTSTEP. The display postscript model fundamentally doesn&#39;t fit very well with what we need here -- if you run in an 8 bit color mode, the line drawing runs at an ok speed, but the texture view goes half the speed it should as it dithers from 24 bit color down to 8 bit. If you run in 24 bit color mode, you get less screen real estate and significantly slower line drawing as a 3 megabyte XY view is flushed. Sigh. If anyone does actually run this on NEXTSTEP be advised that you want a fast machine.&#34;&#34;QuakeEd is written for NEXTSTEP 3.3, while GnuStep is an implementation of the OPENSTEP spec. I haven&#39;t had time to port it to openstep yet, but it looks like it will take a little effort. NeXT has tools in NS 4.0 to help, but it still isn&#39;t automatic.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So I use GNUstep and I really like it.It is not an Apple emulator—it is an OPENstep emulator and so it implements the amazing Cocoa API and many mac/iOS frameworks can be used server side with minimal porting.This makes it easy for what I intend to keep as a one person project forever or as long as Apple continues to support Objective-C.You want to know an unpopular opinion?? I love Objective-C and I think it is better—way better than Swift. And—if you have discipline, the preprocessor is excellent.So while many might say GNUstep is buggy, it is working for several of us—and happily so.I do agree that the homepage is terrible and that what should be done is put some installer scripts so you can start using it immediately. An Ubuntu installation following the corresponding script here is foolproof: https://github.com/plaurent/gnustep-buildCheck it out!!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was nice endevour to port NeXTSTEP development stack.Nowadays with it being several releases behind macOS tooling, and the whole issue of what from Objective-C v-latest is actually supported, it is more of a curiosity and nostalgic experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;The physical signals in wires and the electromagnetic waves are the basic building blocks of the link layer&#34;.&gt; So, what is a CPU anyway? A central processing unit (CPU) is your processor (or processor core).&gt; Nevertheless, making a thread-safe code unsafe is more than easy and so if your application works with threads in some ways, make sure things work as expected.Cut the filler and just say what you&#39;re trying to say."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone new to deployment this book was a great read. I learnt a breadth of new techniques (ssh, security (e.g. fail2ban, selinux, permissions), bash commands, dns and configuration of a vps) and i also liked, that the author gave advice on which tools could be helpful (e.g. Ansible).The book however does not go into detail on these tools (ansible, terraform), its goal is to teach the basics of deploying an app on a linux vps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For a book on deployment, I feel there is too much content on setting up a server.  Would have like to see pros and cons of differing ways to deploy.Also, for taking apps to production, there should definitely be a part on high availability."</p>
