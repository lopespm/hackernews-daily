								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am 100% not surprised. I spent a year working for Ubiquiti, running the Network Controller team.Trust me, this whistle-blower &#34;Adam&#34; (I have a few suspicions of who it actually is), toned it down.The reality is much much worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; ”Ubiquiti had negligent logging (no access logging on databases) so it was unable to prove or disprove what they accessed”Perversely, this is exactly the logging that you want to have in place in case of a breach.You can then (factually) make the statement that ”we have no evidence any customer data was accessed.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This old TechCrunch article from 2018 (https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/23/what-is-this-weird-twitter...) posted at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26636153 has a former &#34;Amazon Ambassador&#34; actually explain that job:&gt; An actual former ambassador and three year Florida warehouse veteran Chris Grantham explained it in more detail to Yahoo Finance’s Krystal Hu, who shared the information with TechCrunch:&gt;&gt; When I was there they just got an extra paid day off and a gift card after Peak [pre-holiday season]. This is what I got. A paid day off (that expired in 3 weeks lol) and a $50 Amazon gift card. Plus, they gave us lunch. Coldcuts and sandwich bread. I absolutely did not get paid more to train people.&gt;&gt; Ambassador isn’t a ‘job’ you do every day, its just something you are trained to do. You go to a 4 hour class and they teach you how to teach others to tie a knot using a set of instructions. This is how new hires a supposed to be taught. You are supposed to teach them right from a script using a set protocol. Becoming an ambassador was a way to get out of loading trucks, or packing boxes for 10 to 12 hrs. You may ambassador 1 day then unload trucks for the next 3.&gt;&gt; I stopped doing it after the first year I was there because it didn’t pay more. It’s voluntary. Your manager picks them. Generally speaking ambassadors are the “kiss asses” of the department.&gt; In case it isn’t obvious, Chris is no longer at Amazon and is happy to speak his mind. Thanks for helping us clear this up, Chris."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like authenticity of online communication is an unsolved problem.  The web was supposed to be a democratizing platform: all you need to communicate with the world is an ISP and a keyboard.  But if there&#39;s no way to control for authenticity, online sentiment will just be an arms race for who can pay for the best astroturfing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imagine being worth 185 billion dollars and still obsessing about your workers advocating for better pay and conditions?What a miserable existence that must be. Bezos has always struck me as a man who cares about nothing else only his own personal wealth and success.There is no joy in his life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Specify it in pixelsNo thank you.I regularly wonder if it might not be better for the web if we got rid of pixels as a unit entirely. We can&#39;t realistically do that for a lot of reasons, and there are legitimate reasons to use pixels sometimes, but resolution independent font-size and container sizing should be the default. If you are using pixels on the web for font sizes, consider this a public intervention that you need to stop.The fact that `em` units are not related to physical size attributes is intended. We don&#39;t want them to be related to physical size -- what `2em` is saying is that you want a piece of text to be twice as large as the &#34;default&#34; size of the specific font on the platform/device. That is a superior way to think about text size, because as a user I don&#39;t want you to try and figure out what the pixel density or screen ratio or resolution of my device is.Size your fonts with `em` and `rem` units, and size your containers based on the number of characters you want to fit in each line. Don&#39;t use pixels. It doesn&#39;t matter if your fonts are bigger on Mac or Windows. It is intentional that platforms can size their fonts differently, and your interface designs should take that into account.If anything, native platforms should be moving more in this direction, they should not be moving away from it. There was a period where you could decide to only care about responsive design on the web, but increasingly you should be thinking about responsive design on native platforms too. And resolution-independent font-sizes based on the user/platform are part of that process.EDIT: Yes, I&#39;m aware that pixels on the web are not necessarily 1:1 ratios with physical pixels on a screen. That doesn&#39;t change anything, pixels are still bad to use on the web. Tying font size to resolution, whether that&#39;s browser window resolution or physical resolution, is still equally problematic. And it certainly doesn&#39;t mean that we should move in the opposite direction on native devices -- the web&#39;s pixels are the way they are because the alternative, being tied to literal physical pixels, would be even worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fantastic article and I welcome this conversation.As the author states, sizing of fonts and line spacing is currently inconsistent across OS&#39;s, inconsistent across fonts, and inconsistent with other UI elements.It&#39;s madness. There&#39;s no good reason for any of it except inertia and lack of forethought.The author&#39;s proposal to specify cap height is really the only reasonable solution I think there is, though I&#39;d modify it slightly:- When defining cap height, be clear what the logical obvious equivalent in other scripts, e.g. Chinese logogram height- Specify cap height in whatever unit other UI elements are specified in (the author refers to pixels, but that&#39;s arbitrary)- Then line height can also be controlled predictably and exactly in whatever unit UI elements are specified inEnd result: zero inconsistencies. Text shows up exactly where it&#39;s meant to no matter what.How do we get there? Browsers should adopt it first, with something like a CSS &#34;font-cap-size&#34; property that can be used instead of (and override) &#34;font-size&#34;, as well as something like &#34;cap-line-height&#34; overriding &#34;line-height&#34;. (And for units, recommend using &#34;px&#34;, or &#34;rem&#34; ultimately based on a root &#34;px&#34;, and never touching &#34;pt&#34;.)Then OSes can migrate similarly with new function calls/parameters based on cap height, and also try to phase out &#34;pt&#34; sizing in preference of the logical &#34;px&#34; sizing used in the rest of interfaces.I really think this is the way. I really hope browsers and the W3C can consider something like this. It&#39;s decades overdue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;I see no reason to honor the so-called “default line-height”. It’s basically a font designer’s personal preference, imposed on every user of the font in every viewing condition.Erm... To a large extent, these details of a font _are_ the the designer&#39;s -personal-preference- professional judgement, and that&#39;s the point.  We use different fonts because they have a distinct feel or quality, and how much spacing they have between lines is one of the many little details that add up to the gestalt of a font.  If you don&#39;t like the line spacing of a font, don&#39;t use it.  Or tweak it if you like. But don&#39;t pretend that declaring that all fonts should have a line spacing of 200% of their cap height isn&#39;t similarly trying to impose your personal aesthetic preferences on everyone else as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34; Modern cars regularly send basic data about vehicle components, their safety status and service schedules to car manufacturers, and mobile phones work in very similar ways.&#34; -GoogleThis is a beautiful quote because it is an example of one industry&#39;s bad behavior leading to another industry&#39;s bad behavior, upon which the first industry then users the second&#39;s similarity to justify themselves. Cars only started doing this because phones made it normal. It&#39;s wrong in both cases.It&#39;s similar to when Apple defended it&#39;s 30% store cut by claiming it&#39;s an &#34;industry standard&#34;... specifically, an industry standard that Apple established."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;20X more telemetry&#34;, in terms of data usage, is a pretty meaningless statistic on its own (unless it&#39;s large enough to affect your mobile data cap or something).For instance, I would consider it a much bigger privacy violation for my phone to transmit my exact location every hour than my current CPU usage every 10 seconds."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of 500px. I used to be a huge fan of 500px. It was the most beautiful photography site on the internet, designed with attention to every tiny detail. It allowed you to share your photos under a CC license, presented them beautifully and had fantastic curated feeds with photos by fantastic photographers.In 2018 they were acquired by an investor company and partnered exclusively with Getty. As a contributor, you were now pushed to &#34;earn money with your pictures&#34;, CC licenses were discouraged and (I think) eventually removed. The site stopped getting optimized for aesthetics, it was now getting optimized for selling stock photos. I deleted all my photos and left.I hope this doesn&#39;t happen to Unsplash. But I&#39;m not optimistic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My main association with Getty is their &#39;copyfraud&#39; practises where they claim public domain images (NASA, Library of Congress etc) as their own and sell licenses[0]. They&#39;re also well known for aggressive acquisitions[1]. Perhaps this a good time to create a mirror[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images#Claiming_copyrigh...[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images#Acquisitions"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m going to instead see this as an opportunity for something better to emerge.My biggest problem with Unsplash is that they did not use a standard license that would easily be compatible with a Creative Commons or open source licensed work. If I incorporated images from Unsplash, suddenly I couldn&#39;t say &#34;you&#39;re welcome to do whatever you like with my work.&#34; In fact, they used to use a CC0 license, but then changed, because other sites were copying them. As a user, this was a feature, not a bug.I would far prefer to see the community band together and produce an image sharing website with CC0 as the default license. Creative Commons image search right now is in need of some TLC from an engaged community."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see a lot of misunderstandings in some comments : we are not talking here about desired RF emissions but about unwanted EMC emissions at harmonic frequencies which just happen to interfere with the regular 2.4 GHz devices.This has nothing to do with how much spectrum is allocated to wifi vs mobile vs whatever... Here it is only about EMC (and it is well known for years that USB is difficult with EMC and it requires a lot of care on the PCB design !). And USB3 is not the only product that leads to difficulties : there are for example a lot of debates (at least in Europe) now with regards to the impact of LEDs (which might surprise a lot of people). Another example are debates on Wireless Power Transfer (which are desired emissions but with very strong harmonics that affect sensitive radio services)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(2012)It also interferes with GPS and Iridium. USB3 is a broadband jammer.Previous thread on the subject:

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is not a BitPay competitor until PayPal allows users to deposit cryptocurrency. Until then it is a closed loop system, users and merchants cannot yet deposit or withdraw crypto itself, similar to Robinhood.Highly disappointed that Square (Cash) has not launched a BitPay competitor and still only supports Bitcoin. They’ve allowed BTC deposits and withdrawals for years (with great UX!) yet are lagging far behind in release cadence.The biggest barrier to spending crypto is still finding merchants that accept it, even through third parties. PayPal’s huge merchant userbase will allow dominance if/when they flip the switch to an open loop, “deposit your crypto” approach.Only PayPal and Stripe can flip that switch at scale with a hosted checkout experience. Merchants don’t care how a user paid, they want fiat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No, they didn&#39;t. They launched a service where you can buy certain cryptocurrencies from PayPal and then sell it back to them at a later time, which may happen to be at the same time as you are paying a merchant fiat money. You can&#39;t even transfer your cryptocurrency to or from PayPal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The company will charge no transaction fee to checkout with cryptoWill this be like what they do when they offer &#34;no transaction fee&#34; currency conversion but build it into the rate they use?"</p>
