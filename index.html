								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m the cofounder at Lumina - we&#39;re building a modern webcam designed to solve some of these problems.There&#39;s really been a lack of innovation in the entire home office space, with the webcam being particularly bad. It sucks that a decade-old product (Logitech C920) is still the bestselling product today -- that would be like if Apple stopped releasing new phones after the iPhone 4S (launched 2012), and it remained the bestselling phone through now.A few thoughts to add to the article:- On why webcams aren&#39;t seeing innovation, I&#39;d disagree that the market is too small. There&#39;s enough gross margin to produce a $B company just by selling webcams [0], especially if you can actually get customers excited about the product.- A big reason there hasn&#39;t been innovation is that the space doesn&#39;t attract entrepreneurs (because hardware is viewed as hard) or investors (because hardware is viewed as hard).- Size isn&#39;t everything. As the iPhone shows, you can get very good image quality from a tiny sensor and lens if you have the right tech supporting it. (At Lumina, most of our eng effort is on the software layer)I would&#39;ve loved to see Lumina in his comparison. We launched a few months ago and are seeing many reviewers prefer us over the Brio (Logitech&#39;s flaghip) [1]. Personally, I&#39;d guess we&#39;re 60% of where we can be in terms of quality and think we can achieve a quality level between an iPhone and a DSLR, hopefully closer to the latter.[0] https://s1.q4cdn.com/104539020/files/doc_financials/2022/q4/...[1] https://www.windowscentral.com/lumina-ai-webcam-review"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a reason that for hundreds of years painters and (later) photographers have preferred working in spaces with North-facing windows[0], and that is because it&#39;s a simple way of ensuring neutral, even light.  My home office is (by design) in a room with one North-facing window.I use a Logitech C920.   Many people have told me how good my webcam feed is.   I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that the C920 is particularly brilliant, it&#39;s that if you know even a little about photography, you can do an awful lot to help ensure a good picture.[0] assuming they were in the Northern Hemisphere, of course"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can use you phone&#39;s camera as a webcam with Reincubate&#39;s Camo App. This required a wired connection iirc.You can also use OBS Studio along with a virtual camera plugin to use any device which can output directly to your computer.But most of these solutions do not work on Safari or FaceTime unless you manually modify the app.Now, Apple is going to soon introduce their &#34;It Just Works&#34; solution with the next release of macOS and iOS. You will be able to use your iPhone&#39;s camera as a webcam wirelessly with your Mac by just sticking your phone on the back (Apple is partnering with Belkin[0] for this stand) [1]I personally don&#39;t care about the camera as much as I care about the sound quality.[0] https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/6/23156834/apple-iphone-webc...[1] https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2022/10018/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find it really strange where some privacy debates have gone wrong, and this is a perfect example. It&#39;s basically a form of &#34;don&#39;t trust them, better trust us, also we&#39;re in a country with better privacy laws&#34;. Which is an imperfect solution at best, and given that I have no idea who bunny.net is it&#39;s a questionable one at best.If you embed a font hosted somewhere else you expose some of your user data to them. Now with fonts there&#39;s a really simple solution: Just don&#39;t. As an added bonus, hosting fonts on your own server is faster as it goes through the same HTTP connection.There are situations where you can&#39;t completely avoid privacy issues, and then you can try to do better than others. But if you can completely get rid of a privacy issue then obviously that&#39;s what you should do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do not use this, use Google Fonts, just self-host them. This site claims better privacy, but does so using the wrong solution since you still have to trust them.Self host (supported by Google Fonts but not by this service):
- Better privacy
- Better performance (no extra DNS lookups, TLS connection)Their default embed code is a CSS 
@import directive. These must never be used in production code (It&#39;s fine as a directive for the compiler for local files but not with remote URLs). Leads to FOUC and FOIT.Also, next step in amateur hour: They serve their CSS and fonts on the same domain as their marketing website. Cookies galore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the font pages, they use this as the example sentence:&gt; The quick brown bunny jumps over the lazy dog.While the site is trying to be quirky and cute, replacing &#39;fox&#39; with &#39;bunny&#39; doesn&#39;t showcase what &#39;f&#39; and &#39;x&#39; look like."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is. I generate the Windows executables for a program by cross-compiling Rust on Linux. Then test with Wine. The Rust crates are cross-platform enough that I don&#39;t have to special case platforms. This is easier than having a Windows machine.The only current headache is that there&#39;s no pure Rust bundler, to make &#34;.msi&#34; or &#34;.msix&#34; installer files.If you dump the legacy OS stuff, it gets easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Counterpoint for this rant (showing it&#39;s again not very objective, and just what your or your environment&#39;s expectations are): it&#39;s easier to cross-compile binaries for Linux (using Clang and a sysroot on Windows) than it is to natively compile on Linux (not using a sysroot, as that is the &#39;default&#39; flow there) if your environment is mostly Windows already. We do this for one of our products, in fact.The post meanwhile seems to be part about open source policy (nasty, but not a technical issue - also including a new-to-me and hard to find on a Google or DDG search fact about the VS gallery endpoints having led to legal threats), part issues induced by &#39;weird&#39; modern languages not caring to support Windows (as expected?), part Git for Windows not bothering to handle symbolic links cleanly (and the weird admin-only default thing that remained from Vista), and part... concerns where if people would spread the proper way of doing stuff (curl.exe bundled by default for downloads, or long file names being &#39;weird&#39; - albeit less broken than claimed here) instead of just ranting this&#39;d be fine too... but not really a coherent whole."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Only if you want to be trendchasing rather than letting backwards compatibility take care of itself...I&#39;m a native Win32 developer, have been one for a few decades, and know quite a few others still using MSVC6 because it&#39;s fast and enough for what they do. Takes &lt;250MB of disk space, and the self-contained binaries it generates will work on any version of Windows starting at Win95.Long file paths: Azure, OpenSearch, and ~90 other open source projects have to document how to enable long file paths on Windows because the default is a ~255 character limit.Personally, I think 260 is long enough and plenty to work with, while at the same time discouraging the ridiculous verboseness that seems to have crept into &#34;modern&#34; software. Then again, I stay away from .NET, VSCode, and the like. I am reminded of this post by Raymond Chen:https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070301-00/?p=27..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Highly complex, in-depth, system simulation is like a siren song for game developers and players alike.There&#39;s this perception that an amazing simulation will be the basis for an amazing game.In practice, high-quality simulations seem to be interesting but not all that fun. See: F.E.A.R.&#39;s Goal-Oriented Action Planning (https://alumni.media.mit.edu/~jorkin/goap.html) which had to be modified to broadcast its intent to the player, because play-testers felt the game was unfair and that the A.I. was cheating.And it also seems like players can&#39;t really tell the difference between a sophisticated simulation and a handful of heuristics with some calls to random() thrown in. From the perspective of a player who does not know how the simulation works, the latter can _seem_ like the output of a complex system. See: _Designing Games_ by Tynan Sylvester, developer of RimWorld (https://tynansylvester.com/book/).Dwarf Fortress, I think, is the exception which proves this rule.Anyway, I think simulations like this are really cool to build, but hard to turn into a fun game."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi! I’m the developer of Citybound.I’m happily surprised to find this on HN again.The project is currently on a hiatus because I’m focusing on building a startup, but Citybound is an will always be my 100% passion and “anything goes” research project.I’m not on a computer today, but I will try to get back to everyone who posted in this thread.If you have any other questions about the project or the tech please just reply to this!(Side note: the main way I built a wonderful community for Citybound was to directly reply to each and every comment whenever it got interest somewhere - a tactic I can highly recommend)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Im working on a game in the same vein: Archapolis, a city builder with real time traffic simulation and interior views of your citizens homes (which you can customize/build yourself if you want), so you can watch them live their lives. I&#39;d like the player to have a more hands on approach to managing the city as well.Here&#39;s a tech demo of what I&#39;ve been working on: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7q0l87hwmkII created a path finding algorithm that can simultaneously path hundreds of thousands of units to random destinations at a comfortable frame rate (or around 100-200K like in the video using one CPU core). Units can choose from any of the shortest paths between two points (there are many in a grid), and from those paths, can also choose the path that matches any preferences they have.Very early stages of development still!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s a self-correcting equilibrium though, since the block difficulty is tied to the hashrate, which will fall as miners pull out.That said, the hashrate is not showing major drops yet:https://www.blockchain.com/charts/hash-rate"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a serious problem that is not much discussed. Bitcoin is susceptible to a 51% hash rate double-spend attack. As Bitcoin has grown, this has never been a practical issue. No miner or consortium has had that much hash-rate compared to the rest of the market.But when the hashrate drops below 50% of its previous maximum, that means that there are idle mining resources enough to carry out the attack. And owners of those resources may not mind throwing the whole Bitcoin system into chaos if they can get one last big payday.The lower the active hashrate grows, the smaller the consortium required to make an attack.So watch for chain forks and double-spend attacks. Maybe not this month or this year, but my expectation is it will be part of the eventual Bitcoin downward spiral."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What many people don&#39;t realize is that the operational and customer service costs of payments don&#39;t scale with payment amount. Customers will cost almost just as frequently dispute, have questions, have problems, ask for help, attempt to defraud etc with a $1 transaction as they will a $100 or $1000 transaction. This is the real killer with micro payment schemes. Customer service costs scale more with number of payments than payment volume.  And these real costs are born by Patreon, by the networks and by the banks which is why min txn costs exist. The crypto bros totally miss the point in understanding this too.Source: 25yrs experience building payment networks"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I think is something people easily overlook with Patreon and similar platforms is that it&#39;s quite hard to make a decent profit on $1 or $5 transactions that most of Patreon&#39;s income seems to come from.They&#39;re definitely overcharging for more profit, but your margins won&#39;t be much lower if you handle payment yourself. Your 3% bank cut to receive money doesn&#39;t always work because often there&#39;s a minimum fee per transaction.I know most iDeal (Dutch payment provider) transaction costs are 25 cents. It&#39;s a flat fee, so buying a €2000 TV will still leave you with 25 cents of fees, which is great for big stores, but when you use them do donate a single euro, the transaction fees are a whole quarter of the donation.Tons of tiny transactions is a pretty terrible way to receive money. It&#39;s not &#34;give up &gt;15%&#34; terrible, especially if your patrons tend to donate more, but Patreon needs to spread costs over all creators to make small content creators worth the effort.Having a look at Donorbox, the same issue becomes clear: the cost for receiving payment in .NL is only 1.4%… and a €0,25 payment processor fee. These low processing fees are also only applicable to registered non profits in the NL which the author most definitely isn&#39;t. Even with the extra cheap rates and a non profit the fees to the lowest tier (±€3) add up to nearly 10% on a platform that&#39;s built around minimising costs for non profit organisations. There is the ability to use bank transfers for real cheap, but that&#39;s always a possibility anyway. One thing this site does seem to offer is the ability to offload all the site&#39;s cost onto the person who donates rather than subtract it afterwards, but that&#39;s just raising the donation price to compensate, not really a decrease in cost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Patreon is a business and I don&#39;t begrudge them the ability to charge customers for their service (though I think it&#39;s pretty buggy). Before Patreon, I did not subscribe to a single podcast. After Patreon, I subscribe to 3-5 at various times. I subscribe to a couple other standalone products but the bar is certainly higher as the value they must provide is greater to get over having another subscription on another platform.So I think Patreon likely does help individuals get business, even if they aren&#39;t out advertising on your behalf. That said, I agree the fee does seem high, given it is largely payment processing (and a simple media player) and we know what Stripe charges for that. I think they will probably be at risk from higher quality entrants like Substack who is moving into podcasting as well."</p>

Epitome of &#34;show, don&#39;t tell.&#34; Hard to overstate what an impact it had on the company at the time (I think we were about 25 employees).[0]: https://avc.com/2010/08/how-to-pitch-a-product/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not an answer to OP, but I just wanted to say thank you for this thread (and everyone for answering).I&#39;ve been insanely burnt out by random bullshit at work, wondering why I&#39;m even in this business to begin with, and after watching a few of these it really motivated me, brought back the old memories of wanting to build cool stuff and ideas to solve real problems (a lot of the ideas that I still hold onto), and made me realize that I&#39;m unhappy with work because all I was doing was just people bullshit and bureaucracy bullshit every day, and not actually out there, building stuff; that I just became &#34;yet another white collar worker&#34; and not a hacker and an engineer.And that has allowed to see what went wrong, and plan for how to get out of this &#34;ditch of boring, stressful politics and human pit&#34;.Seriously, thank you.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You might get some inspiration from Bret Victor’s videos/demos: http://worrydream.com/Personally I do not remember ever having the experience you describe, but that’s probably because in my formative years videos mostly didn’t exist yet on the internet, and I learned new tools from reading books, software documentation, forums and blog posts. And once you’ve reached a certain experience level, it becomes much more difficult to get your mind blown by some new tool, because the ideas usually have all been there in some form already, and you also see the limitations and possible drawbacks more quickly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Aren&#39;t employers in most jurisdictions required to verify work eligibility and report income?Does &#34;pseudonymously&#34; just mean that they these employers commit to supporting your alternative identity when engaging with the public, the way publishers might handle a pen name?Or is this something different?I&#39;m probably not the only person who will wonder about this, so it might help to put the answer as text on the site. (Maybe it&#39;s explained in the video, but a 30 minute video is a big ask)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of other comments around the dubious legality of this, at least in the US.I&#39;d like to comment, though, on the fact that the majority of these jobs are in the crypto/defi space. I&#39;m also not alone in commenting on this, and this fact alone is obviously not surprising, but I&#39;d like to point out that the central idea of crypto that you can somehow &#34;escape the government&#39;s control of finance&#34; by using crypto is as much of a fever dream as that you can feasibly work anonymously for a company.At the end of the day, the vast majority of people need the services of society and government to function. Crypto advocates have long crowed &#34;look how great it is that we have gotten monetary supply out of the control of government&#34;, but you only need to look at the current environment to see how ridiculous this is. At the end of the day people expect to be able to exchange money for goods, and not go to jail for doing so, and that is something government&#39;s aren&#39;t willing to give up, regardless of the medium of exchange.As it related to this case, the biggest question folks have is &#34;what benefit to I get for working for a company pseudonymously&#34;. On reflection it&#39;s largely downside for the vast majority of people unless you are an anti-government absolutist, or are working in something like the drug trade or a hit man that is shady to begin with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;using your legal identity at work is unnecessary, and puts your safety, security, and privacy, at risk.It is?I want this?I tried watching a bit of the video but it kinda lost me with the bitcoin stuff as I don&#39;t really think of bitcoin and my relationship with my employer ... have anything to do with each other."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly I&#39;d rather a battery that&#39;s super reliable and NOT using any lithium ion inside it in my home.As it doesn&#39;t need to move, it can sit there in an unused space and be really heavy. Lead Acid Batteries are a very good fit here (traditionally used as the 12V battery in cars).In Australia you can buy a 12V 42AH (amp-hour) battery for ~$150AUD or $100USD.
20 of these will give you 10kWh @ 240VDC.Couple this with a 6kW solar system and you&#39;d be almost entirely free from grid electricity, especially in summer.You can individually test out the batteries and swap out bad ones. The batteries themselves typically last &gt;5years in a car and I imagine much longer at home where they aren&#39;t exposed to high engine temps and large continuous current discharges (engine cranking on start up)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s unclear, but if this is Toyota&#39;s proven NiMH technology from the Prius, rather than Lithium technology (i.e. in the Tesla Powerwall), I&#39;d personally opt for this.It will last longer, and is a lot safer. Unlike Lithium, NiMH is not particularly unstable at high temperatures or flammable. And Prius batteries have been proven to last more than 20 years (at reduced capacity) without any safety problems -- we don&#39;t ever see Prius&#39; catching fire."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m just happy to see more competition in this space. More competition will drive down costs and increase innovation. Give me 20 companies all trying to sell me the perfect solution for my home, please!When we reach a day that most homes have a basic battery like this in them to balance their power draw, power sources like wind and solar- which have variable output- become increasingly more economically viable. Oh, you can only produce when it&#39;s sunny/windy? That&#39;s fine, half the homes in the country are willing to pay you for energy right now and then use it later when it&#39;s not.What I&#39;d love to see next: larger units for condo/apartment buildings. Put a massive battery pack on the roof, or next to the parking garage. Because of the shared draw, there would be a very consistent daily pattern of use, and you could right-size the battery to ensure maximum utility of it."</p>
