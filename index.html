								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow.Hadn&#39;t heard of Mullvad before reading this, figured I&#39;d give it a try. That is hands down the BEST onboarding experience for an app (let alone a VPN) I&#39;ve had in I don&#39;t know how long. Took me maybe 2 minutes to go from no account to a working VPN connection.I love that everything is anonymous (down to the account credentials just being a randomly generated token)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; convenience comes at a cost and we no longer think this is an acceptable trade-off.In an age where dissertations about what color and position to use for buttons go pages long, that&#39;s a courageous position that follows a clear strategy. Kudos!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always loved that Mullvad wouldn&#39;t let you accidentally compromise your own security.For example, the port-forwarding feature won&#39;t work if you have a recurring subscription.This just extends that kind of thinking to the service in general.Been a Mullvad customer for a long time now, and it&#39;s always been awesome."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Wirecutter is a highly flawed review site, but at least it&#39;s a real one. There are vanishingly few left for general consumer products. There&#39;s WC, Consumer Reports, and what else? They&#39;ve seem to have all been killed off. When I&#39;m researching some category of product, I feel lucky if I find any professional reviews written by people who have actually touched the thing they&#39;re reviewing. I know we&#39;ve all had the experience googling &#34;reviews of X&#34; only to get overwhelmed with SEO spam. Forget finding something written by somebody who has experience with it. It&#39;s hard enough to find something written by a human."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article actually makes a bunch of claims itself that are false. For example, it claims that the Wirecutter believes air filters work like sieves. Whereas the Wirecutter review page for air purifiers goes into how they do not behave like sieves and also references a NASA study that shows how HEPA filters are good at capturing both particles smaller and larger than the 0.3 micron test standard.It’s pretty obvious that the Wirecutter has used HEPA standard filters as a filter for whittling down the many air purifiers that exist in the world. They eliminated the IKEA filters because they do not meet HEPA standards (this blog’s focus on he true-HEPA marketing term is misguided, because the authors own referenced wiki link shows that E12 is not considered HEPA). However, they also reached out to IKEA about this, and the IKEA spokesperson told them their focus is on PM2.5.They don’t recommend the IKEA filter based not on its inability to capturer finer particles, but because it’s not AS efficient as capturing finer particles as HEPA filters, AND because of its lower CADR.It doesn’t meet the standards they set, so they don’t include it for price comparisons.Maybe they haven’t set the right standards. Maybe they should have allowed for lower CADRs or for filters that meet lower filtration standards than HEPA.However, the insinuation this article makes that they don’t seem to understand what they’re talking about is completely wrong.Maybe this author should try reviewing over 20-30+ different air purifiers at a minimum without setting arbitrary thresholds up front and then get back to the Wirecutter folks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wirecutter is like Leetcode interviews.The goal is not to find the &#39;best&#39; option, but minimize false positives under intense time-pressure. Their recommendation is usually the 8/10 solid option that you can blindly buy and be moderately satisfied with. In the process, they drop out or misrepresent other comparable options, but their final recommendation is never shoddy.This is in stark contrast to other reviewers like IGN who give 10/10 to every new cash-cow game, and The-Verge that tows the &#39;mainstream&#39; line to play it safe. Additionally, Wirecutter&#39;s guides are up-to-date and cover every imaginable category. Are rtings, Anandtech, LTT, Crinacle, notebookcheck, gsmarena, etc. better ? Yes, a 100%. But each of them cover a small niche and particularly leave out appliances of all types.I agree with Dynomight on Wirecutter being mediocre. But, consistent mediocrity is incredibly hard to execute at at scale.I would never use wirecutter unless I absolutely had to. But, often, I absolutely have to. Because no one else remotely trustable is going around reviewing humidifiers and vacuum cleaners."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like hating on Jira is the pastime that is now passed down from each generation of programmers to the next.I&#39;m going to stick up for Jira. I certainly don&#39;t &#34;love&#34; Jira, though I do think they&#39;ve made significant improvements with &#34;new Jira&#34; (I think they call them team-managed projects now).The problem I have with the incessant Jira bitching is that I rarely feel that bitchers have a true understanding for the extreme difficulty of the organization-wide problem Jira is trying to solve. It&#39;s always taken on from the position of &#34;well, it didn&#39;t make my specific use case easy&#34;, but never with an appreciation with some of the complexity that Jira needs to solve for other users at your company, never mind other companies.Obviously some of the complaints (speed, stability) are very valid, but here&#39;s a question I think is just as valid: why don&#39;t you think some other company has come along and toppled the Jira crown? Certainly tons of them have tried, and while many have their supporters, they are almost equally likely to have their detractors.The fact is, building a generic project management and tracking tool is a really difficult, hard problem. In my old age as a programmer I feel like Jira is kind of like our form of government: &#34;Jira is the worst project management tool, except for all the others&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OK, so what don&#39;t I like about Jira?1. It&#39;s extremely slow.2. It&#39;s difficult to predict the effect of making any kind of change.3. The permissions system is so convoluted, I can be the admin of a board, and yet not have permission to see a ticket on it.4. It relegates the conversation to a second-class UI element, when this is the most important part of any project management system.5. Trying to operate on a bunch of tickets all at the same time (e.g. move all tickets in this status into some other status) requires a lot of time.6. Every Jira setup is so different, trying to compare a piece of work from one area of the organisation to a similar piece of work elsewhere is useless.7. The UI is extremely buggy. I can add a mandatory field to a ticket, then when I try to use a shortcut to create a new ticket, it won&#39;t work because I can&#39;t fill out that mandatory field.8. There are random side-effects when one person does something on one bit of the system, and VOILA everybody&#39;s workflow is broken, with no obvious warning that would happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish the comments were more specific about which features they don’t like.For me a particularly frustrating aspect is the way the UI moves around a lot. I’m quite anxious to click anything until all the loading spinners have stopped in case I click the wrong thing. Then I could be taken to a page or feature I’ve never seen before.Also it’s really annoying when I try to copy something from a ticket description but it starts editing the whole description field.EDIT - I&#39;d also like to add that as a developer, once I finish my ticket I assign it to a QA. Then I can never get back to the ticket. I&#39;d like a really easy way to see all of the tickets I&#39;ve ever completed. But completed tickets aren&#39;t assigned to me, they&#39;re assigned to QA."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One big advantage not mentioned in the article particularly relevant to this audience:  git diffs (or your VCS of choice).  One sentence per line means diffs will operate per-sentence, rather than per-paragraph.  This way the diff can capture the restructuring of the paragraph (adding/removing/replacing a sentence), which gives much more insight than swapping out the paragraph wholesale.  It also means minor changes (e.g. typo fixes) will only add+delete a single sentence, making it much easier to identify what has actually changed from one commit to the next.I take this a step further and will often split out a single sentence into a clause per line, but this is a judgement call rather than a hard and fast rule."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I personally use this approach but mostly because a lot of what I write ends up in a git repository and diffs make way more sense when there is only one sentence per line. I also find things much easier to manipulate in vim when sentences don&#39;t span lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember struggling to write essays when I was in highschool. Well, I was fine, but my teachers insisted it was long-winded gibberish. Concerned, my grand’mother told me: “Ask Sonia” I knew she was her friend, and they liked to argue a lot, but I was a bit confused by the advice.It turns out, editing was Sonia’s job: she was the head reader at a very prestigious publishing house, meaning she was giving notes and feedback to very famous authors, including four Nobel Prize laureates. You kind of have to know what you are doing when you are sending a manuscript full of red in the margins and the person can respond “I’ve got a Nobel Prize and you don’t.” She definitely had the icey stare to match.Oddly, her advice was incredibly simple, and fitted in two very short pieces:* Subject, Verb, Complement –– in that order. If you see two verbs, but a period between them.* Things are confusing if you don’t put them in order: start by the beginning, find the widest piece of context that explain the rest.I don’t apply her rules every time, but for every technical document, every time I’ve tried, it’s been night and day.That typographic argument is really resonating with me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First of all, I really like the concept of grid based flow charting. It&#39;s one of the popular metaphors used in &#34;wiring&#34; software based musical instruments and effects and works really well for a significant percentage of signal flows that don&#39;t have too many back looping or crossing virtual wires.However, would it be possible to make the flow go vertically rather than horizontally?I find that a vertical direction of flow is- more practical because of the ubiquity of mouse wheels for easy up/down navigation compared to the various less common ways of navigating horizontally- the much more common direction for sequential steps in programs or scripts- more culturally global, since there are quite a few right to left languages (as in addition to the left to right language used on this site :-)- distance between boxes is easier to keep constant vertically while still allowing different size boxes (due to longer or shorter labels)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey all, author here. Graphs are used for tons of purposes across a lot of disciplines, but we don&#39;t have a fast general-purpose graph editor. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do with knotend [0]. It&#39;s a keyboard-driven directed graph editor. I made it for myself for planning project dependencies. It&#39;s also a great tree editor.I actually posted a very early version as a Show HN [1] which you can see was mostly met with question marks, and rightfully so. It was literally a grid, with the gridlines rendered, and had very cryptic keyboard shortcuts. I&#39;ve spent the last year just working on the UX, to make an intuitive and fast editing experience.I&#39;d love more feedback especially about any UX issues. It&#39;s free to use the purely client side version, and you can join the waitlist [2] if you want a user account to persist graphs to the backend (I&#39;m slowly onboarding people).- [0] https://www.knotend.com- [1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27256861- [2] https://www.knotend.com/waitlist"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; After dragging around boxes for a few minutes you need to take a break and ice your wrists. It&#39;s just too slow, there&#39;s too many micro-interactions, and it distracts you from what matters most: defining your dependencies.This is an interesting claim. I&#39;ve programmed LabVIEW professionally and didn&#39;t have to take breaks every few minutes. And neither do PC gamers.What about PlantUML and other text-based diagramming solutions? How do those compare here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Think few people realize how bad the Apple situation is. If your company just ships like an iOS app and an Android app maybe you don&#39;t really notice or maybe don&#39;t care.But work at a company where you try to build something like new hardware devices or systems without having to resort to building either an iOS app or handing over 30% to Apple and the situation becomes very worrying to dire. Simple things suddenly become impossible or have workarounds piled on top to get their browser to function in the ways their desktop one does or Android&#39;s browser does.You can feel some of their engineering choices are actively hostile against anyone trying to exist outside the App Store ecosystem. Sure I know some advocates push this as a good thing but I think they&#39;ll disagree when the endgame plays out.Because in 10 years, what currently exists as the only option on iPad and iPhone will be the only option on MacBooks too. There is a reason why the last WWDC was all about making the iPad feel more like MacOS and making parts of MacOS feel like iPadOS.I used to be a huge Apple advocate but I&#39;m really worried with where they&#39;re heading as I&#39;m trying to create new technology and Apple causes so much pain when you try to make anything other than an iOS app.I do love my M1 MBP, have a lot less love for my iPhone these days but I&#39;m worried where the tide is moving. It&#39;s all absolutely fine, until it isn&#39;t and then the problem is it&#39;s completely locked down from the touch screen to the silicon..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a good article in many respects, but its logic unwittingly falls down when they try to have it both ways, advocating for an outcome that is functionally impossible. From the article—&#34;It’s great when Apple chooses to defend your privacy. Indeed, you should demand nothing less. But if Apple chooses not to defend your privacy, you should have the right to override the company’s choice. Facebook spied on iOS users for more than a decade before App Tracking Transparency, after all.&#34;The important thing to appreciate is that App Tracking Transparency isn&#39;t something Apple can enforce with code. It&#39;s not an API or operating system feature which shields users against tracking. Enforcement is purely the threat of retribution by Apple, made legal by the terms of the agreement which all developers sign. Apple&#39;s monopoly on iOS app distribution means that a wilful breach of Apple&#39;s privacy policies is a dangerous path for any developer to take.I cannot see any plausible scenario where an Apple made impotent through legislation could possibly result in a net gain of privacy control for consumers. And even if there is a better way, how about we get that working BEFORE tearing down the current imperfect system?That paragraph is a layer cake of wishful thinking. How does the EFF propose to enforce a consumer right to override Apple&#39;s choices over privacy within iOS? This kind of rhetoric is unhelpful, eliding reality on so many levels. The notion of consumers self-policing their own privacy is a nice sentiment, but as an idea that must be implemented in reality... rather optimistic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s worth mentioning the case of tumblr - a giant social media company that was literally worth hundreds of millions of dollars. People remember the whole &#34;wow, tumblr was so stupid for banning porn&#34; but forget that the reason they did so was because Apple threatened to remove all of their users from tumblr if they didn&#39;t. Apple gave tumblr unreasonable &#34;safety standards&#34; that almost single-handedly killed a gigantic site for the vast majority of users.Apple should not have this type of power. Maybe they used it for good with Facebook, but I wouldn&#39;t count on it always being the case. Apple can kill entire social media platforms if they want to. IMO, it&#39;s a matter of time before they start charging an &#34;adult tax&#34; (that just so happens to be barely below the profits a company makes from adult content via Apple users). Maybe the only thing preventing them from doing so is regulatory pressure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This might be the most interesting and important point:&#34;The thing is, this banning/terminating/deleting troll crap has been going on since I first got my modem in 1986. I’ve been on every popular web platform, every one — and I’ve been “un-platformed” each time, because of specious complaints. The emerging media companies court early adopters, and then they can’t get rid of us fast enough.&#34;She participated in the famous WELL, back in the 1980s. It is interesting how long this particular struggle, over moderation policies, has been going on.She makes a good point that each of these companies has followed a similar pattern of first courting the kinds of radical experimenters who blaze new trails, and then later kicking them off platforms because they are not respectable:&#34;This has been going on for decades now. It isn’t just Google, it’s all the majors: Apple, Amazon, FB, Twitter, Microsoft, AOL, on and on. I could name a dozen others who’ve disappeared in the social media mist. It’s cruel that each of them censor the very people who created their original incubators. Did you know that On Our Backs was the first magazine, of any kind, to publish with an early Apple computer and Adobe Pagemaker 1.0? Yes, we were. I was on The WELL in the 80s. Our idealism and commitment was ferocious!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like the account got restored. Seemingly, nothing got erased, the account was just temporarily unavailable.&gt; Needless to say, the OOB lecturers were fully clothed and rather obsessed with our historical narrative. Anyone not interested in feminist politics would have probably fallen asleep.The lecturers perhaps, but the streamed lecture contains full-screen examples from pornographic magazines that obviously should be flagged for verification by any porn detecting algorithm.Youtube does state that explicit materials are allowed for educational content, but if their copyright machines can&#39;t even distinguish white noise from copyrighted music then I have very little hope that context like &#34;educational discussion&#34; will ever be recognised automatically.As a society, we may need a platform where educational/government institutions can upload content (with content warnings, if necessary) because Youtube is a terrible fit for content like this. Youtube&#39;s scope is too large to be managed by humans who can understand context and their advertiser seeking behaviour provides an incentive to &#34;punish&#34; videos containing even allowed nudity in their self-learning algorithms. Requiring every institution to set up their own video hosting infrastructure is unnecessary and even wasteful of public funds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The point is, and this is crucial: If a writer/journalist charges a fee— even so much as a dime— trolls can’t be bothered to complain and harass. They’re such cheapskates.Really interesting point, and I hope it works for them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Orkut was nothing like current social networks. It didn&#39;t have any kind of feed. You had to manually visit user pages if you were looking for something. Also, user pages had no &#34;blog space&#34; for posts, just main description, &#34;testimonials&#34; (for friends describing you) and scrapbook (like a public email inbox, later turned optionally private). Oh, and a photo gallery.Another thing that was massive in orkut - but still niche as most users didn&#39;t use this feature - was community forums. It was great to be able to read and talk about any topic using the same account, in the same website and the same layout. Worldwide, what filled this gap was obviously Reddit, but it&#39;s still English-only for most subjects. Also the format is different, Reddit is not a typical flat internet forum."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish him the best on this endeavor. We&#39;ve bought, rebuilt, redesigned Fotolog in 2017 and we failed to lift the social network, even with 50M users. The only solution I saw to this problem, isn&#39;t technology but convincing people to come back or use this social network over others.I have learned that social networks obeys to generations more than to features. People only switch when a new generation operates on the social network. So, in order to make Orkut succesful, the founder will have to work hard to convince the new generation (those who know have 15yo onwards up to 24yo) to use the platform and gain ownership."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Orkut was big in India too. But far from fake profiles or hate groups, brigading groups etc. The reason it got so big was the users were from populous countries. 
Also, one main reason for its success I believe was that we did not have mobile phones or landline phones and we had lost touch with our friends and it was a platform to reconnect. There was no number portability. If you had lost the landline number of your friends or if they had moved to different regions, the number would have changed. With Orkut groups it was easy to find and message and connect. But later with Facebook and LinkedIn, most of them got on there. 
I cannot comment on what the new platform will do to keep on a mission that it did not fulfil earlier.Shameless Plug: I am working on a social platform with a similar mission and might do a Show HN in the coming months :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ah this article put the finger on why I don&#39;t trust my &#39;new dentist&#39;:The operation is just too slick from a business POV. As someone familiar with SaaS or in general this kind of recurring business model, you can sense all the little operational policies and procedures designed to increase your LTV.It&#39;s a well-oiled machine. Without fail, the hygienist recommends cleaning not once every 12 months or even every 6 months, but every 3 months. When pressed on why, eventually they&#39;ll admit it&#39;s how nice it feels to have clean teeth and how important your smile is - but NOT strictly necessary for health.This particular dentist also will shut down and take their entire staff to a resort for a week every winter if the team &#34;hit their targets&#34; for the prior year. That&#39;s the literal phrase they used to explain the trip. When I asked what those targets were, the person turned bright red.So dentistry has a trifecta of factors that will encourage dark-patterns: (1) a true health-related reason for going both preventatively and to deal with problems; (2) a cosmetic / vanity-related reason (white teeth), and (3) the air of higher-educated medical authority.Wrap that all in a lucrative recurring business model and of course it&#39;s going to lead to people taking advantage or at least overpaying for what they really need.Just writing all this out made me realize I shouldn&#39;t be going to my current dentist! Thanks OP. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a truth about corporate dentistry, and it common in family practices but less so.I used to know a few dentists. One was a conservative, family dentist with a small home office in a small home (and a mountain of savings). He had a good rep bc he earned it. The other two had a bit more extravagant lives, and they earned it through specialization (and in my opinion, probably a little bit of this article).What consumers should be most concerned about is the end of family practices, and the start of corporate 1800-DENTIST/Supercuts for dentists. Issues like this article are the norm, and instead of a local dentist to seek resolution with, you’re doing the equivalent of filing a Jira ticket with a faceless insurance conglomerate.This is the trend the industry is going bc of the costs and difficulty of owning a practice. If you can, I recommend finding a young dentist who has recently bought into a home office partnership, and stick with them until corporate dentistry takes over. It is the only way to consistently avoid situations like this article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Throwaway because I run a large dental software company.Dentistry is practiced as a business focused on maximizing revenue. Dentists are routinely coached to deploy sales tactics to increase their treatment acceptance beyond what is needed. If you walk into a dental office, you need to protect yourself from being abused. A second opinion unfortunately puts you in the same position, but now with a new dentist who will play into the narrative of only needing to monitor your condition for a while.The business of dentistry is unfortunately antithetical to conservative treatment, which is almost always in the interest of the patient, because it results in significantly lower patient lifetime value."</p>
