								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My late father, who was a software developer by trade before his retirement, had a desktop machine set up running Windows 7 (probably?) that he used for checking email, and buying stuff online.A few years later, when he had been diagnosed with cancer and was on chemo, it updated itself to Windows 10 without his explicit consent. It completely fucked up the install, and was unusable for him from then on. He was too tired to go through the process of getting it sorted out, and was thus unable to book a vacation that he had intended to take to recover from that round of chemo.Microsoft&#39;s unfriendly us-first, customers-second process robbed him of his last holiday and I will not easily forgive them for it.If a seasoned developer can be robbed of quality of life by this flavour of bullshit, what chance do the non-technical types stand?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get it. For a few more bucks they instantly get their brand connonated with slowness and being unreliable.How do manufacturers throw in all the crapware and expect a good user experience and happy customers? Oh of course, they don&#39;t care.I&#39;ve moved to Mac but back in days I used Windows, the VERY FIRST thing I did was to install a fresh copy of Windows, then install any necessary drivers which are absolutely required for proper function (I remember just finding the driver files and installing them manually from add hardware dialog instead of installing bloatware of the manufacturer).Wish things have changed in 10 years... apparently it didn&#39;t.And of course I&#39;m tech savvy. I don&#39;t see any less-savvy senior being able to solve this problem; it should be regulated in a way that there should be a mandatory and ugly label showing all the crapware included with the device while buying, perhaps even extra taxing for each crapware included, discouraging manufacturers from including them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These days I simply can&#39;t recommend anyone (especially nontechnical people) buy a computing device that isn&#39;t either:- An Apple device- First-party (Microsoft Surface, Pixel phone, etc)- Running Linux (assuming they can deal with everything else that comes with that)Even these aren&#39;t perfect, but everything else I assume to be hot garbage unless you&#39;re planning to install your own OS anyway. The problem, though, is that this mostly excludes the real budget-tier devices (at least for nontechnical folks), which is unfair to those who can&#39;t afford anything elseBurn it all down"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the things that has kept me out of the cryptocurrency space is that when their advocates discuss value, they speak in pure nonsense.A big part of that problem is that value is very difficult to discuss. On the one hand you have the classic goldbug that insists that gold has &#34;intrinsic value&#34;, which is some sort of platonic ideal thing that gold simply ambiently has and defies any attempt to nail down what it grounds out in. On the other hand you have cryptocurrency advocates claiming that all value is arbitrary and/or based entirely on scarcity. In that context, observing that my kid&#39;s doodles are scarce but not valuable is not a cute tweet; it is a complete and utter demolishing of the argument.(I think one of the things education can accidentally (mis)teach is that short arguments are always worthless and arguments must always be long. This is false. A good grounding in mathematics can help with internalizing this. It is completely possible to demolish entire massive argument edifices in 10-20 of the correct words, and the fact that the &#34;other side&#34; has deployed literally hundreds of thousands of words does not make them right if the foundation is rotten.)Value is intrinsically a dynamic process. It grounds out in human desires, which are intrinsically temporal, variable, and fickle, and this makes a lot of people uncomfortable as they seek either a more solid or a more completely ethereal/arbitrary base. However, there is no other sensible way to think about value, however complex and ever-shifting this may be, and it is neither mathematically solid, nor an amorphous vapor of no consequence subject to one strong person&#39;s Nietzschian will."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been a concern of mine for a while; I have also published absolute garbage just to see how far I can take it. I&#39;ve published music under various pseudonyms, books underneath different pen-names... the list goes on. I&#39;ve retracted such publications, but it is frightening if one person like myself had the curiosity to try, what is already out there, and, what a well-funded nation-state actor could do.----Post-truth, like post-modernism, does not mean an absolute absence of truth, but a decline in confidence in common knowledge, making your own truth the center of your life, rather than a set of values   shared by a community.We now believe that our own truth is somehow better than the &#34;centralized&#34; or &#34;official&#34; truth. We are now free from the institutions and authorities that controlled the truth. But this is an illusion, because the very definition of truth requires trust in something other than you.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/philosophy/comments/j5gyp5/the_sear..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there’s a good chance it was ghost written by a content farm for someone who wanted to publish a book in a popular category to make a quick buck. I recently learned that this is a soft-scam technique advocated for by a couple of guys called the Mikkelson Twins. They say you can make money by publishing audiobooks on audible by finding a popular topic on audible, then hiring a ghost writing service to write your book, then hire a voice actor to record it, publish it on audible, and then you too can become fabulously wealthy as the Mikkelson Twins claim to be. Except what the Mikkelson Twins actually make money on is selling you on a “money making course” where they tell you to do the above. So there’s all kinds of people trying to follow this method out there, it seems.This excellent video [1] from Dan Olson at Folding Ideas is in my opinion a fascinating deep dive in to this whole scam. I don’t want to spoil everything in the video, but Dan does an exceptional job exploring how this ghost writing works, and why it produces the kind of nonsense writing that looks like GPT-3 but is actually being done by an overworked human who is trying to write an entire novel in three weeks or so on a topic they haven’t had time to properly research.[1] https://youtu.be/biYciU1uiUw"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pigs were recorded in Domesday as having woodland to support them. Note that woodlands supporting pigs was primarily comprised of oak, since the pigs fed on the acorns they dropped.Source 1: https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/domesday/discover-domesd...In the modern world, you can manage about 5 pigs per acre. You should be able to do that many pigs or more per acre in the medieval world since the animals were physically smaller for the most part. So in an 80 acre pannage woodland, expect about 400 swine.Some tree types are far more damaged by pig foraging than others since, if they don&#39;t get the yummy acorns, they tend to dig up roots, eat the saplings and do other damage. So the oak and the pig are good neighbors. The elder or the olive tree, or even the wild apple tree, all tend to suffer far more damage when used as pannage.Source 2: https://acrcd.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Pigs-and-Trees...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of a passage in Jesse Schell&#39;s game design book. Playtesters were confused seeing flags of pirate ships blow forward, toward the front of the ship. They were told that sailing ships have the wind at their backs, so everything blows forward. However, so many playtesters were confused and made comments that they just made the flags blow back.Maybe it was the same with the pigs; people just want to see pigs squealing around town, adding to the atmosphere of the game."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I really like their lightweight, SQL-like protocol instead of Elasticsearch&#39;s fat JSON, I really think that this project could have much more impact if it could be a drop-in replacement for ES.Even if it offers only a fraction of the features offered by ES, that may be fair enough for at least half of the use-cases out there.Sonic could have really had a strong selling point: &#34;Use an ES-alternative that works fine in most of the real-world applications, but it&#39;s written in Rust and it only takes a fraction of the memory footprint required by ES, and it shouldn&#39;t require you to change your application code&#34;.Instead, they are proposing yet another search protocol, that developers have to learn and adopt. That definitely increases the adoption barriers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow it&#39;s weird that this comes up, I&#39;m actually running a site I am going to repost to HN today that I want to use as a testbed for search engines (kind of like an extension to my recent collaboration with supabase[0]).Right now I&#39;ve got the site going on just Postgres FTS + trigram and it&#39;s pretty darn fast, looks like I need to test sonic too.Going to burn some midnight oil (in my timezone, anyway) and get it out -- though sonic isn&#39;t implemented yet!Anyway to make this comment useful to people, here&#39;s my short list of engines that I want to run in parallel:- MeiliSearch (https://github.com/meilisearch/MeiliSearch)- TypeSense (https://github.com/typesense/typesense)- Lyra (https://github.com/LyraSearch/lyra)- OpenSearch (https://github.com/opensearch-project/OpenSearch)- ZincSearch (https://github.com/prabhatsharma/zinc)- Sonic (https://github.com/valeriansaliou/sonic)There isn&#39;t enough out there comparing all these for the simple typical fuzzy search/search box usecase, so I&#39;m adapting a little podcast search site I made to try and use all of these at the same time. So far only Postgres though, will try and add Meilisearch today and post it!Like other people are pointing out, most of these engines won&#39;t have all the features of ES (or more accurately Lucene) but I am pretty convinced that most of the time it doesn&#39;t actually matter and if someone is searching on your site excessively maybe there&#39;s a problem with your UX (unless you&#39;re a search engine or repository of information).[0]: https://supabase.com/blog/postgres-full-text-search-vs-the-r..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve written a full-text search engine as well. I don&#39;t tout it as a replacement for Elasticsearch, but it does have a few advantages: it&#39;s fast; supports HTML documents; supports Polish inflection (via a full-blown morphological dictionary, not just a stemmer); and has a very compact on-disk format (pre-parsed HTML trees, Huffman-encoded over large alphabets). Oh, and it&#39;s 100% Clojure.It underlies a concordancer GUI called Smyrna: https://github.com/nathell/smyrna, https://smyrna.danieljanus.plI haven&#39;t touched it in six years, other than a few small changes. But I do plan on revisiting it when time permits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here in the ultra-dense Netherlands, threats to insects are magnified. As such, it&#39;s easier to point to specific causes.Butterflies: 50% reduction in 50 years. Beetles: 75% decline since 1985. Ladybugs: 50% reduction in 20 years. Across the border in Germany: a 75% decline in flying insects since 1989.It doesn&#39;t take much of a scientist to see the trend. I&#39;ve been hiking the forests here multiple times per week for 20 years. You can clearly see how some groups are disappearing whilst others remain.There&#39;s several root causes but the primary one is a lack of native plant diversity. Since agriculture over here is done in close proximity to forests, the soil becomes acid due to the nitrogen disposition. This benefits the growth of a handful of plants at the expense of all others. In some of our forests, the soil is now so acid that snails no longer develop a case and bird eggs collapse.In this plant monoculture, insects depending on a specific host plant disappear. Outside (protected) forests, things aren&#39;t much better. Even the tiniest of strips of grass that would normally produce wildflowers, are aggressively mowed down. People&#39;s gardens are designed to be as hostile to insects as is possible.Secondary reasons are invasive species and light pollution.It&#39;s a sad state of affairs and one we should be deeply ashamed of. We&#39;re not talking about some iconic predator requiring hundreds of acres of wild forest just to survive. We&#39;re talking about insects that require little space, healthy soil, a flower, and for it to be left alone. We can&#39;t even offer that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is  pretty characteristic of the chemical industry influence trying to muddle the waters.I&#39;ve watched recently a conference[1] by several renowned scientists. They affirm that neonicotinoids / neonics are responsible of at least 80% of the decline.They also affirm that the &#34;merchants of doubt&#34; are working their best to muddle the evidence with things like &#34;there are multiple factors&#34;, &#34;it&#39;s complicated&#34;, &#34;we need more research&#34; etc.But just like the overwhelming majority of lung cancer comes from smoking, the overwhelming factor in insects decline (and its consequences like birds decline) is PESTICIDES and neonicotinoids in particular.[1]: sorry, in French : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FQT7b2ExP4

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To everyone replying “aerodynamics”, I’ve had the same car for about 9 years now and the drive along the 5 from Bay Area to LA feels like there’s fewer bugs on my windshield (granted not recorded diligently for scientific purposes but whereas before I’d need to scrub the windshield at least once halfway these days I can drive all the way and still don’t need a wash at the end)Same goes for the argument that bugs have evolved to migrate away from the roads - the 5 has been a busy thruway for a long time with lots of cars and trucks.The article is short but says scientists have clear data that populations have plummeted and the larger vehicle consumer trend + more people on the road means that there’s fewer bugs to encounter per windshield on top of that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why are plastics 3-7 allowed if they are unable to be recycled? Also it seems to me that a tax on plastic might incentivise glass and metal usage.  Plastic is only used for convenience and cheapness, let&#39;s make it less convenient and cheap than glass and metal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps the best way to prevent pollution of the environment with plastics is to ban the export of plastics as garbage. Currently, much of the plastic pollution is due to dumping in 2nd world and 3rd world countries where rules on disposal are very lax. So, while many people are actually quite conscientious and dispose of their waste in the appropriate manner, the garbage then just gets exported and not disposed of in any way that is responsible. Stopping the export also forces the originator of the garbage to deal with their waste creation... so dual benefit.Of course, eWaste is also a sizable contributor to plastic pollution and most people don&#39;t even think about disposable of these items. They either sell them, or they toss them in the garbage... sometimes with lithium batteries still in them which is extremely hazardous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a Linux idiot, just got sick of Windows, and took the plunge in 2016. (After some ill-fated tinkering in 1996 with Slackware, but we don&#39;t speak of that.) I started with Ubuntu and had a pretty good time for a year or two, until a dist-upgrade broke everything. Luckily /home/ was easy to restore from backup.So I was fine for another two years on Ubuntu until another dist-upgrade broke everything again. Sensing a pattern, I decided to give Pop a try.I&#39;m now about a year into Pop and sure enough, a few weeks ago a dist-upgrade broke a lot of things, but unlike Ubuntu, I was able to find System76&#39;s tech support page, I ran the commands it suggested, and everything&#39;s fine again!https://support.system76.com/articles/package-manager-ubuntu...Miraculous, I tell you.I still can&#39;t figure out why there are multiple versions of some things in the Pop Shop, but they all seem to work, so I&#39;m not complaining, it&#39;s just weird. Someday I&#39;ll figure out this whole tiling-windows thing, but I think that&#39;s for people with bigger screens so I turned it off so my alt-tab reflexes work again.In general, it just works, and that&#39;s more than I can say for Windows or Ubuntu at this point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like Pop Os. I&#39;ve always liked Debian descended distros, and prior to this I was using Ubuntu. While I like it, I always found a lot of rough edges esp. when it came to proprietary drivers, etc. where things didn&#39;t always work without some tweaking. Pop Os on the other hand seems to &#34;just work&#34; - it is like a polished version of Ubuntu with a nice selection of apps in the Pop Shop.

I wanted to improve my desktop efficiency by using a tiling window manager; I tried i3wm and XMonad, but none of them really clicked with me. Finally, I decided to try the Pop!_Shell tiling mode and it was awesome. (Hardcore tiling window manager fans might not agree but Pop!_Shell is a lot more newbie-friendly.)Furthermore, you don&#39;t even have to install Pop!_OS to get Pop!_Shell. For example my preferred distribution is openSUSE Tumbleweed with GNOME, so I just need to    sudo zypper install gnome-shell-extension-pop-shell
    wget https://github.com/pop-os/shell/raw/master_jammy/scripts/configure.sh
    # configure.sh mostly configures keyboard shortcuts. Inspect it before running.
    sh ./configure.sh
    
And then enable it. That&#39;s all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The update is cool but the update process was not.  -Update available, wanna install?
  Sure
  -OK don&#39;t mind me I&#39;m gonna need a while
  OK
  -HA HA I LIED I&#34;M READY TO TERMINATE EVERYTHING BYEEEE
  WTF
  5 reboots with just an Apple icon and a progress bar
  The progress bar also moves backwards sometimes
  I guess it&#39;s a metaphor for life, which is how long this seems to be taking
  -OK hello I am back but I need 10 minutes of alone time
  -Here is some unfamiliar wallpaper but you can log in I guess
  -Oh it&#39;s you again, do you want to share analytics with us
  -OK here is your familiar desktop, I am not telling you what has changed
  Um preferences
  -Oh hai I&#39;m called Settings now and I reorganized everything
  Yikes but OK this is sorta well laid out I guess
  -Hello I am Stage Manager, I put a desktop on your desktop so you can work while you work
  Sorta neat, can I configure some things differently though
  -No
  
Funnily enough I had just started reading the Ars Technica review when the upgrade took place so that helped with navigating the changes but it was an oddly jarring transition. I get that Apple doesn&#39;t like burdening users with too much technical information (as in &#39;any&#39;) but given how significantly the Settings app has changed I&#39;m surprised there was no Release notes or feature tour of any kind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Countless person-years of engineering effort, and Spotlight is still mostly useless.All I want is to hit Command-F to quickly search the filenames in the current folder (not start a sluggish scan of my entire hard disk).  There used to be workarounds for this, but then they removed &#34;Find by Name...&#34; from Finder just to make our lives harder.  Does anyone know a workable alternative?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My friend has some issues with using the `scp` command on Ventura to copy files to a Synology NAS.It turns out the `scp` has been updated to use sftp protocol since OpenSSH 8.9 and Synology seems to use a different port for sftp, causing some hard to understand errors.https://lwn.net/Articles/835962/ for context."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So the real complaint is dynamic pricing, which is essentially raising prices to what the market will bear, instead of having (what was formerly artificially) low prices that get scalped. Now the extra money that used to go to scalpers goes to TM instead, and the downside is that some % of fans that could previously luck out and get cheap tickets no longer can.Isnt this...not a bad thing? There&#39;s fundamentally just a supply and demand problem, with more people wanting to see these concerts than there are concerts. The article mentions that Garth brooks solved this by doing more concerts (e.g. 9 in a row in the same city!), but that&#39;s obviously not viable for everyone. Is there a better solution? Even if there were 5 different companies selling concert tickets, wouldnt they inevitably move to dynamic pricing for the same reason?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sometimes wonder why venues choose Ticketmaster; large as Ticketmaster is it&#39;s not the only option, and how did they come to be the main player? My only conclusion is that the venues (and bands) are benefiting.Here&#39;s my theory:Venues and bands know that for PR reasons they can&#39;t jack up the price of tickets, but they don&#39;t want to miss out on the revenue from people willing to pay scalper prices. So they set tickets at a nominal price but reserve huge blocks of tickets for the band and venues. Nominally these are &#34;family and friends&#34; tickets, but in practice the band and venue put them immediately for resale. This way the bands and venues can get that gigantic revenue. Meanwhile a small number of tickets are sold at face value and immediately sell out.  Ticketmaster profits from fees on the ticket sales and resales.A &#34;known evil&#34; company like ticketmaster is now a benefit, as &#34;obviously&#34; the jacked up costs are ticketmaster&#39;s fault. Meanwhile ticketmaster is really just a service to take the heat off of bands and venues for what would otherwise be seen as price gauging."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of comments here from people who haven’t read the article and don’t know about the scalper-eliminating on-demand pricing it’s actually about. Or that it addresses supply-and-demand near the end with some interesting comments on Garth Brooks:Country superstar Garth Brooks—who has called out dynamic pricing as well as suggested that the secondary market should be “illegal,” has more or less solved the problem for his fans with one simple trick: He adds shows until they no longer sell out. In recent years, on single tours, Brooks has done the following: He played nine concerts in a row in Edmonton, Canada. He played a dozen shows in Chicago. He played six in Kansas, nine in Tulsa, and eight in Denver.Indeed, the headline doesn’t seem particularly supported by the actual article to me."</p>
