								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Early in my career I got a Monday morning meeting invite on a Friday afternoon just after I left the office. The meeting was called “The future of &lt;business unit I was in&gt;“Entire weekend was a write off. I was so anxious.  And yep. They shut down the unit (but I got to keep my job).As a result this is forefront in my mind as a manager. One thing that works great is whenever I ask questions about something, anything, I also say “this is on my mind because…” and I find that both calms people and gets me more useful information. Context matters so much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; When you’re communicating with your team, lead with context and reassurance. Never message someone on your team, “let’s talk when you get a minute”. That’s void of information and scary as heck!This should be engraved on a plaque in every office building."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way I see it, if &#34;let&#39;s talk when you get a minute&#34; comes across as spooky that means you already have a communication breakdown and mistrust has already blossomed. Here&#39;s a slightly different scenario: You have a disagreement with management; there are many subsequent conversations happening behind the scenes; but no one keeps you in the loop or updates you on what is being decided. In that situation, practically any message (apart from &#34;here is exactly what we are thinking..&#34;) comes across as spooky, and you will start reading into what _isnt_ said.
In short, if you think someone might want to know something, and they have a reasonable claim on deserving to know, let them know. Keep people informed, and if you do that then &#34;let&#39;s talk when you get a minute&#34; won&#39;t feel like such a lurking shadow."</p>

Until then, SEO was the enemy. Google and Yahoo had previously sponsored a conference in 2005 on squashing search engine spam.What&#39;s new is that Google has now managed to alienate ad-supported publishers, their paying customers, as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even in relatively technical circles, like HN, many people are not aware of this and I use every opportunity I have to reiterate:A SIM card is a full blown computer with its own CPU and memory.Your carrier can upload and run arbitrary code without your consent or knowledge.  They can do this at any time.This means that your &#34;phone&#34; is actually three different computers running in concert - the actual phone itself (iOS or Android or Symbian), the baseband processor running the baseband code, and the SIM card."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ahh this is so useful that it&#39;s at the top of HN.We&#39;ve (probably) arrived at one of those &#34;hidden&#34; dominant operating systems out there in the world: JavaCard OS. It&#39;s not just (probably) in your cell phone SIM, it&#39;s also (probably) in your credit cards. Add all of those devices up, and you realize that, in a weird way, if aliens were to inspect the activity of humans, they&#39;d say, &#34;the humans seem to be using some sort of weird thing they call &#39;JavaCard OS&#39; to run their society.&#34;If anyone is a JavaCard OS master, shoot me an email - numair@numair.com. I&#39;m having some IC card issues that could use some external input...In terms of the linked article, I think this part makes it clear what&#39;s going on, if we are to take an innocent view on things:&gt; After the lab work, deposition of an AT&amp;T employee revealed that the only other trigger is a firmware update of the baseband processor. That is also consistent with the SIM requesting the IMEISV, since the “SV” part means “software version”, and it is updated every time the baseband processor loads new firmware. In this particular case, the phone had recently downloaded an update that included new baseband firmware. That was almost certainly the trigger for this message.If I was a network engineer, I&#39;d probably want a way to figure out whenever someone&#39;s putting new equipment on my network. This is a brilliantly sneaky way to do it. There&#39;s probably other uses for this, though, and you can imagine that your favorite intelligence agencies have thought about it long before it showed up in a Hacker News article..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Would eSIM[0] improve the state of affairs with respect to privacy?On the one hand, as SIM circuits are now being shipped with phones, I can imagine the manufacturers having the opportunity, for the first time ever, to control the operations of a SIM such that it’s no longer a black-box. On the other hand, due to legislative and practical reasons, eSIM modules would likely be no different than those black-box baseband processors with the further downside than we would also become unable to intercept the communication between a SIM (whose circuitry is now embedded) and a phone.I would love to read the answers of those who are more knowledgeable on the subject.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESIM"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Using Pdfsandwich in college was like having a superpower. We would often be given PDFs with only image data. While my peers were still scrolling through and copying quotes by hand, I was there in seconds with Ctrl-F to find and copy/paste.Once you have text in the PDF, you can use any sort of text analysis tools. You can use tools to convert it to plain text and grep through, or anything else you want.That being said, it&#39;s not perfect, but still pretty awesome. Sometimes the spacing was off or it would confuse symbols like 1, I, or l. But these are minor and usually only on poorly scanned PDFs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nuclear is one of a number of alternatives that needs to be seriously considered but due to the long timelines and high costs of nuclear it is also one of the best stalling tactics for the fossil fuel industry seeking to extend the life of their assets. Possible increased adoption of nuclear in the future is not a reason to avoid setting sunset dates for emitting technologies now and commence transition to whatever low emission technologies are the most available and affordable right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be fine with more nuclear power plants, but if wind/solar plus batteries are cheaper, that&#39;s what&#39;s going to get built.Also, renewables don&#39;t require a high degree of trust in the human operators to manage risks appropriately.  I think that&#39;s really the main sticking point with nuclear; reliable reactors can be made, but how do you manage the humans who maintain the plants in a way that&#39;s not susceptible to corruption or corner-cutting?If nuclear can be made to handle more of our energy needs for a reasonable cost, then that&#39;s a good thing, and if it can be made cheaper by updating regulations without sacrificing safety, then I think that would be awesome.  But I think we should plan for the future under the assumption that most of our energy will come from renewables.  That&#39;s the lowest-risk plan that doesn&#39;t require major regulatory changes or new technology.  (Apparently there are also some major lithium iron phosphate patents that are expired or expiring soon, which should open up cheap battery manufacturing to companies outside of China.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;When your company won&#39;t be the first to market, because about 20% of your total development capacity needs to spent on keeping up&#34;In the world of JS and Typescript this ratio looks more like 80%. I swear that node hipsters at my last job spent four out of five of their working days wrangling with dependencies or their transpilers, linters, packagers, bundlers and whatever the hell else needs to happen to actually make a node program run. Meanwhile the geezers that worked on Java services reliably pushed new versions of their code sprint after sprint, no heroics, no drama required. What the fuck happened to those &#34;modern stacks&#34; that babysitting them takes the vast majority of developers time? It&#39;s a nightmare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I appreciate the contrarian point of view, and I don&#39;t want to pick on the author, but this sounds like words of wisdom from someone who doesn&#39;t have much real world experience.I worked in such a project who never upgraded once. And then Specter/Meltdown hit, and we had the mandate to patch all our systems (and the threat was very real). Welcome to a hellish mess of outdated deps that took weeks to sort out.But is not only me. I watched a talk from a Principal Engineer from Amazon builder tools, and one of their biggest mistakes was not to upgrade often enough, which made each upgrade more painful.So what do we do now working in multiple, large, multi-year projects?First, we set tools that tell us when deps are outdated, and alarm when vulnerabilities are found.Second, upgrading deps is part of the regular dev process. When you make a change, take the chance to upgrade the deps. Vulnerabilities are addressed proactively. The vast majority of times upgrades require no code changes.Third, we regularly upgrade deps of inactive packages.Lastly, if a dependency upgrade requires significant work, we create a ticket for it and address it as a new feature. In practice this happens very rarely, so it doesn&#39;t disrupt the development process much.As other&#39;s said, the key is to upgrade often, and then it wont be as painful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Corollary: Do hard things more often, per Martin Fowler - https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FrequencyReducesDifficulty.ht...Upgrade everything all the time and it will never be hard. You&#39;ll have full context for breaking changes, and the diff from A to B is always smaller than from A to Q, and less likely to break in strange and confusing ways."</p>

Obviously the solution would be &#34;just learn vim already&#34; but I&#39;m lazy. I settled on nano because it at least shows what shortcuts are available, saving me from having to Google &#34;how to find text in vim&#34; every time. But its shortcuts are weird (to me) and even the descriptions are. UnCut? WhereIs? Huh?Micro really got the UX right for people like me and it made me more happy than I expected.

And a good alternative to Nano.But from the website: &#34;curl https://getmic.ro | bash&#34;NO!We need to stop getting people comfortable with the idea of just curling random stuff into their shell.Even worse is software that suggests you sudo curl it into bash. What could possibly go wrong?Download and build it yourself. Or download and install a packaged .deb or .rpm or whatever is the equivalent for your platform.Do not just blindly curl into your shell things coming from people you don&#39;t know and trust to the level that they are personal friends and you would loan them your house keys or your car."</p>

http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=1%20egg%2C%20two%20slic...I was curious about the relative usage of two names over time.   Michael, Henry

								<p class="story__comment_others">"1. It&#39;s slow, even for simple microsecond computations like log(2). Takes about 5-20 seconds to load a page on my 1Gb fiber connection. Opening Python/SymPy Gamma is much faster for most things. https://gamma.sympy.org/input/?i=log%282%292. Every time I use it, a box saying    NEW: Use textbook math notation to enter your math. TRY IT

pops up over the result, and clicking the X doesn&#39;t hide it the next time I search. This adds ~3 seconds to the result time.3. I&#39;m a long-term Mathematica user, but typing literal Mathematica syntax usually never works, except for simple expressions.4. Results are PNGs, and copy-pasting a numerical result takes a few unnecessary clicks. &#34;Plain Text&#34; &gt; Copy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Siri and Alexa pass a lot of questions to Wolfram Alpha.When Apple first started using it, they were responsible for 25% of all WA traffic. With Alexa, I assume that the majority of WA&#39;s queries are coming from smart assistants at this point.
