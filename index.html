								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can appreciate this perspective because I used to have it. I even wrote a similar blog post 10 years ago - it was on the top of HN and the comment section was a beautiful shitshow. For me, this perspective was a good story to tell myself - it justified why I was only investing my time in “work”, and validated me for having “come so far”.Over time, I have reflected and shifted this perspective. That reflection centered around the question the author hasn’t asked himself yet: who creates these expectations? It’s always some loose definition like “society” or “elite”, or some other handy wavy grouping of people.But, to be clear, those expectations are coming from the author. That’s his perspective of what the world thinks, based on his interactions, based on what he chooses to read, listen to, etc. He&#39;s not describing anyone but himself.I found that if I find myself projecting onto social norms, society, or some other loose definition of “they”, what I’m really doing is projecting a part of myself that I haven’t been honest about yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do people find this stuff compelling? Rank speculation and confident assertion with minimal substantive backing?I’d find this statement equally compelling (which is to say, not at all):&gt; Since we stopped using horses as a primary means of transportation, men’s sense of self worth has diminished.  Riding a horse carried a lot of high status connotations: drive, masculinity, towering above the land, and man’s domination over nature.  Now, we drive metal cars, low to the ground, and driving one is seen as commonplace.  All of men’s low sense of self worth stems from this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there are quite a few alternative explanations for the data cited in the article than the ones the author proposes:&gt; &#34;Today, one in six American men between the ages of 25 and 54 are unemployed or out of the workforce altogether: about 10 million men. This number has more than doubled since the 1970s.&#34;We have this place in the USA called &#34;The Rust Belt&#34; which was once a dynamic and active manufacturing center providing millions of well-paid jobs for these now unemployed American men.  California once had a world-class electronics manufacturing industry (and a garment manufacturing industry) that provided hundreds of thousands of such jobs.  Under the rubric of neoliberal globalization, those jobs were shipped out to Mexico, China, Indonesia, India and other low-wage centers, and the huge cut in labor costs went right into the pockets of a small fraction of now-extremely wealthy Americans. Why neglect that  phenomenon?&gt; &#34;Over the past half-century, the number of men per capita behind bars has more than quadrupled.&#34;Again, we have a robust alternative explanation: the explosion in incarceration under the War on Drugs program launched by Nixon in the early 1970s and continued and amplified by successive Democratic and Republican administrations.  This resulted in the explosive growth of the quite profitable private prison complex (which did not exist before the 1970s), and of course enforcement was highly skewed towards poor and minority groups. These groups were far more likely to smoke crack on the street corner than to snort cocaine in private clubs, and a 100-wt of cocaine powder was considered equivalent to a 1-wt of crack crystal in sentencing.So if the author wants solutions to these problems, why not promote rewriting domestic and international law to exert significant penalties on corporations who outsource manufacturing overseas, and also end the War on Drugs by eliminating incarceration for possession of drugs, and instead focus on a public education approach emphasizing the benefits of getting off drugs and alcohol?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People are realizing that social media is draining, predatory, and entirely superfluous.Of course there are employees here of social media corporations who would want to stem the tide of this mass exodus, but it&#39;s useless. Social media corporations have overstepped their boundaries and become a net negative on human society.Deleting your social media accounts results in an immediate improvement of quality of life and mental wellbeing. These sites are intentionally designed with predatory psychological mechanisms, they are designed by hackers like ourselves, but the hackers who see &#34;social engineering&#34; as a perfectly ethical practice and not simply psychological manipulation.These services are designed to be addictive, full stop. Addiction is not healthy, and neither is social media. Maybe this will bring SV back to its roots, real technological progress for the nation and not desperate bids for data mining based on cheap psychological tricks.People are growing sickened of the endless scrolls of psychological disturbing viral content combined with the false positivity of human interest stories. It is deepening social divisions, racial conflicts, political partisanship, and general misery. We don&#39;t need social media, what we need is real social connections in an increasingly isolated society, and social media stands in the way of this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve found myself between deleting, deactivating, and moderating my use of these apps for many years of my life.I never found deleting or deactivating to be very helpful. At some time or another you&#39;re going to need said account for something.While deleting is a bit extreme, some of these services will respect the actual deletion and others will not. I suppose the question at the end of the day is...why bother?I&#39;ve found it much more easy to &#34;declutter&#34; by following digital minimalism practices of getting rid of apps, only using browsers, practicing mindfulness of said platforms, and only using said platforms with a specific intention.There&#39;s a laundry list of tips you could use to make social media harder to use or even more bearable, but the most effective approach I&#39;ve used is simple moderation and mindfulness.Also why is Mozilla writing articles about this? I get the privacy angle, but aren&#39;t they also willing to put ads in front of people and other partnerships sacrificing that privacy for users? Like how does Mozilla make money outside of Google search engine being the default? I do know they lay off many of my friends who work on dev tools or even mobile apps there(i.e. browsers)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To protect my mental wellbeing, I find that carefully selecting who to follow on some of these services improves considerably my experience.For Instagram and Twitter, my rule of thumb is to prefer topical accounts to entity ones. That is, accounts that are dedicated to a single topic, no matter how narrow or large the scope, over those of people and/or companies.Personal and business accounts, no matter how focused they are, tend to go off topic very often, and there&#39;s nothing to do about it. A designer or an art studio can still post about politics, religion, or whatever the controversy du jour is about. An account about logo design or some python framework, not so much if ever.This allows me to have a feed whose content I sort of control. With Twitter, it gets even better with lists, so I have ones about dev stuff, others about business topics, etc. and the content there is almost on topic most of the time.Since I started doing this, the impact of social media on my mood almost vanished, yet I&#39;m still able to closely follow what&#39;s happening on topics I really care about.When I want to see what&#39;s happening on the real world, I check my Facebook.I&#39;m sure aware of how bad these companies are with personal data. So it you think it&#39;d be better to delete your account, then, yes, do it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ouch! I&#39;m glad the guy is okay, that could not have been &#34;fun&#34; given the description of the ejection.In Sunnyvale they used to train Orion P3 crews at Moffett field. Of course Sunnyvale and the surrounding towns had a few military contractors doing RADAR development who did not have many military targets to paint, so when a P3 flew over it made for a good &#34;real life&#34; test.On one such flight, the check pilot decided to &#34;spice up&#34; the newbie pilot&#39;s life as they returned to Moffett field by casually flicked on the RADAR threat detector. Sure enough, one of the contractor&#39;s search RADARs was &#39;pinging&#39; them, but unexpectedly they were also testing a tracking RADAR which then subsequently got a good lock on the plane. That made the RADAR LOCK alarm go off in the cockpit and the trainee, as he was trained to do, immediately hit countermeasures without thinking. (That will save your life!)The plane was on final approach to the field, and when it activated countermeasures it consisted of both chaff and IR flares (bits of magnesium, lit and cast to the side to distract heat seekers) These mostly landed on the Sunnyvale golf course which is in the approach path.I used to play that course, and after this event there were a number of burn spots where the flares had landed and then burned out on the ground, and for probably two months there were bits of foil chaff that could be found in various nooks and crannies around the course!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The downsides of peer pressure. If you don&#39;t want to do a thing: don&#39;t.I&#39;ve been called some pretty bad names by captains of industry for not wanting to partake in their chosen &#39;team building exercises&#39;, not a team player and so on. My body, my rules and if you want to bond over kayaking, parachute jumping, alcohol, drugs or bearing your heart out to perfect strangers that&#39;s perfectly ok with me. But I will join if and only if I feel like it. And any kind of pressure is going to turn a &#39;maybe no&#39; into &#39;definitely no&#39;.And that goes for backseat rides in fighter jets as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It feels like Google’s attention span, leadership longevity, and product development patience is roughly 3 years.  Any product that survives longer than that probably has transcended beyond being a “pet project/toy” into a PR-problem or revenue-stream significant enough that it takes on a life of it’s own.  As management turns over, that lease on life is renewed…https://killedbygoogle.com/While this fosters new ideas and opportunities, that conversion into long-term direction and execution can be pretty rough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just give us a web filesystem already. Stop with these shitty infantilized GUIs with no hierarchical organization and an overreliance on search to find things. I have literally hundreds of thousands to millions of files on my local machines and have no trouble remembering where I put things. Drive can&#39;t seem to scale past a few dozen before it&#39;s confusing, useless, and apparently lossy. Remember when web servers would serve up the contents of a directory as a list with hyperlinks on the file names? That actually worked ffs. I cannot understand how we could be moving backwards so quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Times have changed in many more ways than one.These days I greatly prefer to own my data more directly, which I accomplish using a NAS. I don’t use Dropbox OR Google Drive, I use Syncthing, which can do stuff that neither of those could ever dream of in terms of syncing between machines.Not only do I not want Google Drive, I don’t even want anything like it.That said, I totally get why it’s still important. I do use Google Drive at work and for that type of use case I would not argue in favor of self-hosting. Syncthing is great for a single person or even a fairly large group of people, but not for a big organization. Not to mention you probably use Google Docs or Office 365 anyways, both of which are integrated with their respective company’s storage offerings. Syncthing won’t give you directory sync, docs integration, or granular ACLs.But that’s actually perfectly fine, because I don’t need any of those things. Hell, I flat out don’t really want them. You could probably get something similar with ownCloud which I did try running, and I’m not even particularly enticed. I’m sure Synology has a full suite as well, but it’s not what I want out of my NAS. Part of being happier with my technology was just as much realizing what I didn’t want as it was realizing what I wanted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love textualize/rich (and charm)!I think this solves some of the web&#39;s browser problems by breaking things out into components:- browsers are way too complicated to build, terminals are way easier- browsers have a huge attack surface, terminals are smaller- browsers lock you into JavaScript (more or less), terminals don&#39;t- browsers have to support tons of backwards compatibility (quirks mode, TLS), terminals have less to support by being more circumspectIt feels like we&#39;re on the beginning of the next cycle a little. First we scattered a bunch of apps to see how we should use the internet, then we focused on the browser, now we&#39;re scattering some more apps to see which solves our new problems better.To that end, presuming we stick with terminals, I wonder if they&#39;re at risk of falling prey to the same problems, or if they have different potholes in their future. One thing in particular I saw someone else mention in a comment in a different thread is that terminals are almost all written in unsafe languages like C, which feels super bad. Something else is auth and identity--something the current web is pretty bad at."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like a lot of great work went into this.
But I&#39;m not sure I want to see CLI applications continue going down this path. Maybe I&#39;m missing the point of this, but I like my terminal applications simple, small and easy to drop into the rest of the shell ecosystem. This means applictions willing to accept input from either the keyboard interactively or from a stdin input stream of bytes and lines. Output should be a simple, structured, human readable and machine consumable format for easy drop into pipelines and shells scripts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While these are unarguably cool, I really don’t understand why would we want to force an ungodly hack onto a text-based, letter-displaying protocol to display arbitrary graphics. Especially when the people liking it - I assume - has quite a big intersection with those who prefer simplicity over anything else. Reusing Braille fonts and font styles and whatnot is exceedingly harder than.. putting a pixel onto a framebuffer. Especially when we pair it with event handling and the actually hard part of GUIs, they simply loose out on everything."</p>

On one hand, adding a button doesn&#39;t have to take 3 months despite all the necessary reviews etc., not if it&#39;s actually considered a priority. On the other hand, if the benefits were considered worth the fine/fee, you&#39;d expect a bigger delay."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The linked source: https://blog.google/around-the-globe/google-europe/new-cooki...It is &#34;funny&#34; reading that, the amount of energy they spend to be illegal but only just so that they can squeeze as much dark patterns on their users before they get a fine. Rinse and repeat.For normal companies / webmasters it is quite simple though. You don&#39;t have anything to gain from extorting your users. So please respect your users instead.Don&#39;t use shady practices that require you to bring up a cookie-banner in the first place. Just don&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still don&#39;t understand why this is a website thing and not an user-agent^W^W webbrowser thing.EU could have requested browser vendors to implement a mechanism to accept or reject cookies. We wouldn&#39;t have those oddly designed (and infrequently infested with dark patterns in attempt to sway users towards accepting everything) bars and popups, and it would&#39;ve been 100% reliable (and even the reject decision would be remembered correctly) instead of hoping that website actually respects the choice instead of having a banner that does absolutely nothing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I develop languages full time, and it&#39;s clear to me that RC will make massive strides forward in the next decade, for a few reasons:1. First-class regions allow us to skip a surprising amount of RC overhead. [0]2. There are entire new fields of static analysis coming out, such as in Lobster which does something like an automatic borrow checker. [1]3. For immutable data, a lot of options open up, such as the static lazy cloning done by HVM [2] and the in-place updates in Perceus/Koka [3]Buckle up yall, it&#39;s gonna be a wild ride![0] https://verdagon.dev/blog/zero-cost-refs-regions[1] https://aardappel.github.io/lobster/memory_management.html[2] https://github.com/Kindelia/HVM[3] https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/perceus..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with a lot of what he says.He gets something subtly wrong though: GC barriers are waaaaay cheaper than ARC, in the limit when you optimize them. Libauto had expensive barriers, but as Chris said, it’s not super interesting since it was overconstrained. But the production high-perf GCs tend to have barriers that are way cheaper than executing an atomic instruction. JSC’s GC has barriers that basically cost nothing, and that’s not unusual. It’s true that low latency GCs tend to have barrier overheads that are higher than high throughput GCs, but even then, the cost isn’t anything like atomic inc/dec. The barrier overhead in RTGCs is often around 5-15% except for the esoteric algorithms nobody uses.Also, GCs trivially give you safety even if you race to store to a pointer field. ARC doesn’t, unless you introduce additional overheads.Does what I say mean that ARC is bad? Heck no, ARC is super impressive. But it does mean that it’s a good idea to weigh ARC versus GC as a determinism versus speed decision, and accept that if you chose ARC, you lost some speed.Oh but ARC also let’s you do CoW better than what a GC could give you, so for some languages ARC is a speed win over any possible GC because it’ll let you do fewer copies. I think that’s true in Swift. But if you don’t have CoW then GCs are def faster."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find this whole conversation frustrating or somewhat confusing because it&#39;s a weird distinction: Reference counting is garbage collecting. It&#39;s not a mark &amp; sweep or generational tracing collector, but it&#39;s a collector. And in fact it even traces, though the tracing is explicit (in the form of the declaration or management of references.)My copy of the Jones/Lins Garbage Collection book I&#39;m looking at on my shelf makes this quite explicit, the chapter on reference counting makes it clear it&#39;s one form of garbage collection.When I was messing with this stuff 20 years ago, that was my understanding of it, anyways.There are advantages and disadvantages to reference counting. I think some of the confusion in terminology and some of the frustrations (or opposite) here comes from the rather awkward way that Objective-C implements reference counting as something you have to be explicitly aware of and careful about, even with ARC. My brief stint doing iOS dev made this clear to me.But I&#39;ve used (and written) programming languages that had transparent automatic garbage collection via reference counting, and the programmer need not be aware of it at all, esp if you have cycle detection &amp; collection (or alternatively, no cycles at all). And, there are compelling RC implementation that are capable of collecting cycles just fine (albeit through a limited local trace.)Anyways, he&#39;s right that RC can be better for things like database handles etc. Back in the day I/we used reference counting for persistent MUDs/MOOs, where the reference counts were tracked to disk and back, &#39;twas nice and slick."</p>
