								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It turns out that the BBS also had a warez copy of Lotus 1-2-3 for UNIX. This was widely thought to be lost – I’m told it couldn’t compete with a more popular UNIX office suite called SCO Professional, so there were not many copies sold.I wonder if anyone still has a copy of Lotus 1-2-3/M? It was the port to the IBM mainframe operating systems MVS (nowadays known as z/OS) and VM/CMS (nowadays z/VM). [0] Not that I ever used it or saw it, but just I have become fascinated with it from reading descriptions of it. From what I understand, it is more different from 1-2-3 for DOS than the Unix or VMS ports were; the Unix and VMS ports work with character mode terminals (such as VT100 compatibles), which while rather different from the terminal model used on MS-DOS or text mode OS/2 (direct memory access to the  screen buffer), nonetheless are close enough that the bridge can be gapped–which (on Unix) is classically the job of the curses library (and its various descendants). By contrast, 1-2-3/M was written to work with the block mode 3270 terminals commonly used on IBM mainframes, which send to/from the terminal whole screenfuls of data at a time, rather than individual characters (somewhat similar, in principle, to classic HTML forms). This forced greater changes in the UI compared to the other ports, because a lot of things which are easy to implement with character mode terminals are essentially impossible in 3270.[0] https://www.ibm.com/common/ssi/ShowDoc.wss?docURL=/common/ss..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That was awesome, but they skipped over the crucial part I&#39;m most interested in: how the heck did they rewrite and reroute the incompatible system calls and libc functions? That&#39;s probably the hardest task of it all.How would you go about it in the first place?EDIT: ah, their coffsyrup tool (https://github.com/taviso/123elf/blob/main/coffsyrup.c) with help from objdump (it&#39;s more powerful that I gave it credit for) does the relocation and patching. I would have loved to read more into that part of the process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fascinating write up!Curious how piracy seems half the time to be the best form of archival for older software that was abandoned (most older software is no longer available to download even if one has a license, let alone still runs on a more modern environment, but if you have A you can try and sort out B, as this post so nicely demonstrates)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apple can’t win here. If they had sent the sleek, easy to carry tools this author asked for, the author would complain about the pathetic tools they are providing.Really disappointed in The Verge on this article. Could have been a cool piece about the specific tech that Apple provides, but instead it’s framed so disingenuously that I come away not feeling particularly good about right to repair in general. It no longer sounds to me like people trying to get access to their own devices. It sounds like people taking potshots at BigCo because big co bad.By the way. The tools this guy used are common, dead-common in China. Go to any repair mall in Shenzhen and you’ll see hundreds of these.Does he actually want to repair his phone? It doesn’t seem like it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading this article and the comments here makes me quite sad.1. The repair kit described here is not mandatory for anyone to rent to be able to buy the parts. You can just buy the parts alone and use whatever tools you want. If you attempt your own repair, you should use the simple ifixit style tools, and understand the higher risk of damage you are taking.2. The kit described in the article seems very decent for any kind of independent repair shop. They will probably already have pretty much the same setup.3. Right to repair is about access to documentation and parts. Nobody epects anyone to make it easy for the user to replace 512 pin BGA part. Right to repair does not mean that it should be easy to repair something, just that there shouldn&#39;t be artificial obstacles and that there should be supply of documentation and parts.4. Repairability is still an important topic and with discussing, but it is a separate issue from right to repair. E.g. I think phone makers could make replacing batteries much easier and that it would be a much smaller design compromise than some people like to claim. But that is a different topic from the baseline of right to repair.To me this seems like Apple has a good basic right to repair offering both for individuals and independent shops. This article is bad for the right to repair movement, because it doesn&#39;t understand what it is asking for.Parts. Documentation. No artificial obstacles."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If made to fulfill the word of the law without actually having to follow it in spirit, this would be my modus operandi too.By designing $1200 deposit, $49 rental &amp; two Pelican suitcases of tools and manuals, while keeping the battery replacement price same at $69 (what you&#39;d normally pay in total at Store), they have entirely disincentivized self-repair without actually breaking any law.Masterstroke /s"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The singular habit I picked up way back in the day was to simply cope with what was available.There&#39;s all sorts of utilities and such. Emacs was a grand example at the time as well. Lots of better mousetraps.But when you bounce around to a lot of different machines, machines not necessarily in your control, &#34;lowest common denominator&#34; really starts to rear its ugly head.That vast majority of my command line concoctions are burned into muscle memory.Today, I think the base line install of modern *nixes are higher than they were back in the day, but the maxim still applies of working with what they have out of the box."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to love fd - I&#39;m a big believer in the idea that CLIs don&#39;t have to be scary, intimidating things (see normals using Slack with /commands and keyboard shortcuts), and find has a gigantic hairball of a UI.The thing is, though, I know find well enough to not notice the terrible UI that much, and I know I can rely on it being everywhere. With fd that isn&#39;t  true.So it&#39;s hard for me to justify making the move.Same thing happens with things like the fish and oil shells - I have little doubt their UX is better than Bash&#39;s, but Bash is pretty ubiquitous.Emacs has this problem too, as an Emacs user. The UX is completely alien by current standards, but if you update the defaults you&#39;ll break a lot of people&#39;s existing configs.How do you get around backwards compatibility / universality UX roadblocks like this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Civil forfeiture is a direct and obvious violation of the US Constitution and shouldn&#39;t even exist under the USA legal system and is dangerous to the US legal system:&#34;Article the sixth... The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.&#34;Police under the US Constitution have to go before a judge and court and make an Oath under perjury of law describing the items to be seized. There has to be a justification and supported by affirmation meaning evidence and supporting facts. In the case of the building that was seized it was operating a perfectly legal business under state law. It had the necessary licenses and permits. There needs to be a direct challenge against this type of extra-judicial seizure in the US Supreme Court as it&#39;s a clear challenge to the entire operation of the rule of law and legal system."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve long had an idea for solving the civil asset forfeiture problem.It&#39;s simply this: any asset seized must go to the general fund, not into a law enforcement fund.If a local police department seizes cash or a car, that asset goes to the state. If federal law enforcement does the same, it goes to the treasury, not the FBI or ATF or the Justice Department.This small change would remove the incentive to seize assets for any reason other than stopping criminals.We also need due-process reforms, but this would be a good start. Government departments should never profit from criminal activity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Coops is one of the structures that the author talks about in &#34;Developer Hegemony&#34;. The bulk of the book is about the inverted pyramid that modern software development houses are (with production being at the bottom, and manager on top).I really like this passage:&gt; “Consider a law firm. Do the founding partners go out and hire a Lawyer Manager to order them around, and then do they hire a VP of Lawyering to order the manager around? Do they then hire a CEO to rule over everyone and a CFO to handle the finances and a COO to schedule court dates and such? Of course not. There’s no historical precedent for all that fluff. Rather, they handle facets of the business themselves. What they can’t or don’t want to handle, they delegate to subordinates that they hire. The partners don’t specialize in finance, sales, marketing, or operations. That would be silly. But they understand enough about it to act as the boss.”...and this one:&gt; “It turns out that treating knowledge work pursuits like manufacturing operations doesn’t work particularly well. But it was the model inherited from the Industrial Revolution, and it’s been hard to shake. The thinking goes like this: if you break a complex operation down to its individual components and then have people specialize in those components, batching the work and letting people get good at tiny slices of it leads to greater efficiency. This works well for stations on an assembly line but not so much for writing software.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy to see this list here on which our coop startup appears! (https://kantree.io) It is very challenging to raise funds as a coop indeed but we have managed to do it on small amounts (a few hundreds of thousands). We are one of the few product based coop and not service based.France (where we are based) is actually a very interesting market for coops. There is a very good legal framework around coops and a growing percentage of them. There&#39;s even an investment fund of tech coop as of recently! https://coopventure.fr/I think coops are a great ownership model for the future and for a more responsible economy. It is too bad that there is still very little support and recognition around it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I deeply wish this was more of a thing. If you look at the way law firms work, this is how they take their specialized knowledge and keep more of the value they create for themselves. I don&#39;t see any reason we can&#39;t/shouldn&#39;t have a similar model in software engineering be the de-facto now that the field is mature enough to support it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seen this kind of thing several times.&#34;Assistance&#34; programs meant to prop people up with so many reporting requirements and perverse incentives that punish you for improving your situation to the extent that the best path is to not even try to improve your situation and be entirely dependent on the program because when you do start earning income or saving anything, they take so much away from you that there is a significant cost to any amount of improvement until well after you&#39;d be self-sufficient.  i.e. it is more expensive to earn any income than it is to earn none, and the constant threat of losing support of the program (explicit threats) is much more anxiety inducing for the most vulnerable populations often than the situation they were trying to exit.Being homeless, getting into a program to help the homeless, and then constantly being threatened with a return to homelessness if somebody doesn&#39;t do the paperwork exactly right is just crazy, but I&#39;ve seen it first hand."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to counter the prevailing negativity in this thread. I admire the pragmatism of this project. The developers are clearly willing to work hard to achieve what they value, such as producing a single self-contained executable on Windows. But they&#39;re also unafraid to take pragmatic shortcuts where they feel that it&#39;s OK to do so.I wonder if the fact that the original author comes from the largest non-English-speaking population in the world [1], a population large enough to have its own distinct software development culture, is relevant. I&#39;m guessing that they don&#39;t routinely participate in our English-speaking software development communities. If that&#39;s so, then they&#39;re not exposed to our norms or the constant negativity of our online discourse. Perhaps that&#39;s liberating. Perhaps we need more independent cultures, doing their own thing with no regard for what we think. In any case, for me, software developed in China, such as this project and Zoom (particularly the Windows client), provides an interesting peek into what Jimmy Maher called a mirror world [2]. It may trigger our natural discomfort with foreignness, but some of the differences from the typical American commercial software culture, such as a continued willingness to develop bloat-free native Windows apps, are refreshing.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31457771[2]: https://www.filfre.net/2017/06/tales-of-the-mirror-world-par...Edit: If anyone thinks what I said is offensive, please let me know, either publicly or privately.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Recycling is the most obvious way to cut down on plastic waste.I would think that the most obvious solution is to not use a material that lasts thousands of years for disposable packaging that’s only needed for a few months. Seems like these types of “revolutionary” new processes to make recycling finally work come out every year, and yet nothing changes. I can’t imagine this will be any different. As long as it’s cheaper to create new plastics than it is to recycle them, nothing will change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US sends millions of tons of trash to China, India, and other places. Perhaps it would be better for places to implement local sorting (glass, plastic, paper, etc.) and composting- as many other nations do as opposed to disposing of all trash in the same containers and shipping the problem off for someone else to deal with. But even better would be to generate less trash in the first place or at least have an attempt at transitioning to using biodegradable packaging. Packaging, which also is excessive and unecessary in the first place, like items in layers of plastic casing, plastic boxes, plastic wrapping, and so on when there are ways of distributing goods without convenient prepackaging in favor of instead refilling reusable containers or utilizing materials such as fabric, glass, or others which can be repurposed and reused more flexibly and reliably than plastic.Not even going to get into plastics being contaminated by toxic things, leaching chemicals, microplastics, affecting acquatic life, a variety of other problems relating to plastics and excessive plastic waste.I really wish people would push to decrease the production and use of plastics in the first place, seems more sustainable than trying to engineer solutions at the tail end of the issue. Seems to me much more effective to curtail the source of the problem than to attempt to implement solutions later on  although I do appreciate that some people see the issue and are working to do something about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Depends on what the waste products are and how they are captured, otherwise you trade one problem for another. The plastic takes up space but if it&#39;s in a landfill you have carbon capture, best not to release that carbon into the air as CH4 or CO2."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll add my own data point into the mix. I&#39;m 49, have been married for 22 years, with kids who are either grown up, or well on their way. Throughout my life though, I have been an absolute loner in spirit. I grew up quite isolated, in the UK countryside, and learned to amuse myself early on. My first love was computers, which luckily has served me fairly well, career-wise. I haven&#39;t had many girlfriends, and felt very aware of this lack. When I met my wife, I married her more rapidly than I should have, if I&#39;m honest. I had no confidence in myself regarding my ability to form intimate attachments to women, and thought something like &#34;well if I&#39;m married, then that&#39;s that problem sorted!&#34;. Not so much.Still, we&#39;ve persevered, and made it work for 22 years. But I will soon be 50, and have chosen to view this round number as significant. I would like to start living life as I would like it, both career and relationship wise, and am currently trying to plan out what shape that might take. The stories and information in the comments here, are truly fascinating to me, the breadth of ideas being mentioned are a real breath of fresh air, and a great example of what makes Hacker News great (in my view), so thank you everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Loving families are easy to idealize from afar.How many families actually fit that profile? I’m not entirely sure.This is not a jaded attempt to say the pursuit of relationships or family aren’t worthwhile. I just want to set some context here for those feeling lonely, for those who feel like they are standing outside in the cold on the street looking through windows into warm living rooms full of people with warm feelings toward each other.I’m the only one of my siblings who has consistently been on speaking terms with either of my divorced parents. Both of my divorced parents consistently tell me they wish they could get away from their current spouses but feel it’s too late start over. Only one of my 3 siblings isn’t currently fantasizing of leaving their spouse. The mix of who in the extended family is currently speaking to whom is always in flux. Of my friends in very long term relationships that I know well enough to know if they are happy or not, about half are somewhere between resentful to  outright miserable. My grandparents divorced  when they were in their late 60s and went on to live much happier separate lives. In the hospital before my grandfather died, he insisted my grandmother should absolutely not visit him.Again, I am not saying seeking loving relationships and building a family isn’t an extremely worthwhile goal for everyone. Even given all I’ve said so far, I hope I can build one someday. It just bums me out to see people in threads like this idealizing what it means to find a partner, to have a family. It can be extremely good. It can also be extremely bad. Joining with others is not a magic spell that, on its own, fixes your life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m in my mid 50&#39;s and a number of peers from different circles have all come to the same conclusion: they want to create intentional communities of friends to age with. One couple purchased several acres of land and has two friends living in a tiny house with them. Another friend is trying to raise capital to build the type of apartments/dormitories that the majority of US city-dwellers inhabitied in the late 1880&#39;s early 1900&#39;s: ones that shared a common dinner table and parlor for entertainment. Another has a B&amp;B that also serves as co-housing for 8 adults from their mid-50s to their 70&#39;s, and they share chores, which has been together for over a decade.I find this to be a uniquely western culture issue, compared to eastern asian cultures and indian subcontinent where multi-generational families mean you&#39;re never really alone.The author seems to have fallen into this void. I&#39;m sure even with everything I&#39;ve mentioned above it is still possible, but intentional or filial, the family must still grow and add new members to prevent this unique type of loneliness. I don&#39;t know how my friends&#39; intentional families will persist over the decades as they start to die, but they seem to be committed today."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"They touch on it at the end but I think it is under-appreciated ... the big benefit of a SPA is continuity of client side state. I don&#39;t actually care whether it&#39;s one page or ten but it does simplify things enormously that I can maintain a single model object and not have to persist it in and out of local storage or even worse have all the complex UI state replicated on the server side to maintain continuity, just because the user clicked a button or something. Especially with reactive frameworks where updating the model automatically triggers re-rendering of the UI everywhere it needs to, a whole piece of complexity in your architecture just goes away."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Where are those SPAs everybody is talking about?All sites I use regularly are MPAs:Hackernews, Amazon, AirBnB, Booking.com, Wikipedia, GithHub ...Reddits new design is kind of a hybrid. It is MPA when you hop between subreddits and other pages. But it shows a post on the same page when you click on it in a subreddit feed. I actually are annoyed by the new Reddit enough to switch to old.reddit.com most of the time when I end up on Reddit. Not sure why. But maybe it tells something, that the only &#34;somewhat SPA&#34; I know makes me switch to its MPA version regularly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Author of Elder.js (mentioned in the article) and avid lover of both MPA and SPA.Daily I am writing MPAs for SEO assets and SPAs for internal dashboards used to manage the huge amount if data collection our teams do.It really boils down to what you are building.Google is decidedly terrible about indexing JS for sites with a low crawl budget. Why make your life harder. That is why I wrote Elder.js. Statically generate everything, sprinkle in interactivity where needed.But for internal dashboards I developed a internal framework to spit out crud apps based on nothing more than a couple graphql queries and a couple yupjs validations. It is a breeze and adding new data collection fields takes minutes so I and my team can focus on stuff that drives business value… instead of crud.As with everything picking the right tool for the job makes the job a lot easier. Don’t give into the hype one way or another."</p>
