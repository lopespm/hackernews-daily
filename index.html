								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The register article on this https://www.theregister.com/2021/02/11/microsoft_azure_ubunt... has responses from Canonical and MS, which shed a bit more light on the situation.The Canonical quote is the most illuminating :-&#34;As per the Azure T&amp;Cs, Microsoft shares with Canonical, the publisher of Ubuntu, the contact details of developers launching Ubuntu instances on Azure. These contact details are held in Canonical’s CRM in accordance with privacy rules.&#34;On February 10th, a new Canonical Sales Representative contacted one of these developers via LinkedIn, with a poor choice of word. In light of this incident, Canonical will be reviewing its sales training and policies.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who works in tech sales - the real bullshit here is that this is some right-out-of-college 22 y/o entry level sales person (SDR) who was likely told to to take this list and message everyone on linkedin 1x1.The negative impact of this goes on his shoulders where the positive responses from this get passed off to someone else who is outside the blast radius.Stuff like this is the norm when sales is viewed as an extension of marketing (&#34;we need more leads&#34;) and not as a function that helps companies coordinate the evaluation and purchase of software (&#34;we need to find out if this is the right fit for them&#34;) and the ones who pay the highest price are at the lowest levels when it&#39;s executives who are giving the orders."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Early in my career, I worked for a tiny company that exclusively built plug-ins for a specific SAAS platform. I noticed there was a public-facing page where one could search for any customer of this SAAS platform, so I built a scraper that would auto-search names, main URLs, and ticker symbols for every company on the S&amp;P 500 into this search.I demoed it with 5 companies to a member of the sales team, and he politely asked me to remove the script from the company laptop, and seemed to be annoyed at my script kiddie antics. He said it was nearly impossible to build a lead out of that kind of information, and that any shop that would try and use that kind of poisoned fruit would quickly tarnish their reputation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Chick Corea was a god.I learned Spain on the bass in the hopes that one day I could play my meager rendition for him. In a concert at SFJazz he picked people out of the audience to paint their portraits with his piano. How lucky was I to be placed upon such a seat where Chick dismembered me with his eyes, eviscerating my soul upon a platter. He stared at me with the eyes of a musician who had searched heaven and hell for the most tempestuous chordal mixtures. The two minutes I spent in that seat where he painted my portrait with his keystrokes are some of the most treasured moments of my life. I felt like I had been seen, chewed up, devoured, and reincarnated as the everloving Chick Corea sycophant I had always known myself to be.The man was a goddamn monster on the boards and we are all at a loss with his passing. Rest in Power Chick, you&#39;re in my heart forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The night I turned 18 I was drinking with Chick Corea.
It happened that in 1995 he had a classical music project involving some local orchestra musicians in Modena, Italy, where I was living at the time. One of the musicians was a friend of mine&#39;s brother who invited me to the dress rehearsal in a renaissance villa. Concert was good.After the concert, I got introduced to him and he asked me if I liked it. Shortly after I was drinking with him and others, and I turned 18 right there.:)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a huge fan of Chick Corea; he is my favorite jazz pianist.  I was saddened to hear this news this afternoon.  My very first jazz album outside of smooth jazz was “My Spanish Heart,” which was my introduction to jazz fusion.  I then discovered Return to Forever and the Elektric Band, and I also learned about Chick Corea’s post-bop work.  Chick Corea’s music has been a mainstay in my life for the past 15 years.  I love the playfulness of his piano playing and his compositions, which I feel is missing in a lot of music.  He has helped inspire me to play: I received an electronic wind instrument (EWI) for Christmas that I’ve been practicing.The jazz community lost a legend.  RIP Chick Corea."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a compilation of gotcha-discovery-reports, distributed across the surface area of K8s (which, since K8s is huge, covers many nooks and crannies). This is not a compilation of &#34;K8s sucks, here are 10 reasons why&#34;, which is what my kneejerk expectation was. (maybe I am too cynical...).Overall, this is a fantastic index to some very interesting resources.There&#39;s an old saying that you learn more from failure than from success (whose analogue is a blogpost with a title &#34;look how easy it is to set up k8s in 15 minutes at home!&#34;). If you really want to think about how to deploy nuanced technology like this at scale, operational crash reports such as these are invaluable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s mine -  
We were running on Cloud Foundry, had one DevOps person that mostly dealt with Jenkins, payed for 32-64GB RAM.  
Decided to move to K8s (Azure AKS),  
Three months later we have 4-6 DevOps people dealing with networking, cross-az replication, cluster size and autoscaling, 
And we&#39;re paying thousands of $$$ pm for a minimum of 6 64GB VMs.  
FAIL"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The current trend goes to multi-cluster environments, because it&#39;s way too easy to destroy a single k8s cluster due to bugs, updates or human mistake. Just like it&#39;s not an very unlikely event to kill a single host in the network e.g. due to updates/maintenance.For instance, we had several outages when upgrading the kubernetes version in our clusters. If you have many small cluster it&#39;s much easier and more save to apply cluster wide updates, one cluster at a time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here’s a fun thing that happened to me on LinkedIn:A few years back, I was job hunting, using LinkedIn at bit to find leads. During this ongoing process, my father, who’d been receiving chemotherapy treatments passed away.Being the “technical one” it fell to me to manage his various accounts. I logged into his gmail from the same browser I’d used LinkedIn, and started to contact people he knew but was out of touch with.The next day, I started receiving email, from my dead father, from LinkedIn. Claiming he’d just joined the service and wanted to connect to me.I still don’t have the words for this, years later.What exactly is wrong with these folks at LinkedIn? They seem like caricatures of actual humans to me now, and I no longer even bother to visit the site.If anything positive comes from cancel-culture, canceling LinkedIn would be my preference."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Imagine you have a friend. A good friend.One day, when you&#39;re not paying attention, your friend says to you, in a tonguetwister, &#34;ifyoudontmindmelookingthroughyouraddressbookandcallingeveryonesaywhat?&#34;&#34;What?&#34; you reply.&#34;Nothing.&#34;, says friend.Later that day, when you&#39;re not looking, your friend copies all the numbers out of your address book and starts calling everyone. If they pick up the phone, friend says:&#34;Good afternoon, Friend&#39;s Name, Your Name said you&#39;d be interested in my new social network, would you like to sign up?&#34;If you found out that this had happened, would you still be friends with this person? Would you still talk to them? Would you still want to know what they have to say?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"LinkedIn taught me, back in 2005, to never link my address book to anything. This has been so helpful because any time an app wants to do anything with my address book, I assume that they will do the dumbest, most embarrassing thing possible.Also, I used to have the “I don’t care if people see what I do setting” turned on, because why not. Then LinkedIn started emailing people because I moused over their post and stuff. Some contact emailed me to ask what I needed from her and it was so weird. And the email it sent her was super incorrect and stupid and said something like “Prepend wants to get back in touch with you.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s a shame. I had high hopes at the beginning that S4TF - and the investment in Swift from Google - would help Swift break out of the iOS ghetto and cement it as a mainstream language.Swift&#39;s a delightful language to use.  It has a lot of the nice things about Rust&#39;s type system, but is a heck of a lot easier to use at the expense of a bit of performance.  For a lot of use cases, I think this is a great value proposition.  ML/data science is a great example where practitioners could benefit from a more grown-up type system than what Python has on offer, but would still be able to keep low level details at arms length.I think Serverless would be another ideal use-case for Swift, where the productivity, clarity and correctness tools it offers would be a huge benefit.Some very interesting things came out of the S4TF project - like the work on autodiff, and python interop.  It&#39;s a shame the project never really seemed to get legs, it seems like it just languished for years with no clear direction.These days I do most of my work in Rust, and I&#39;m happy to do so because the tooling, community, and ecosystem is really amazing.  But there are a lot of language concepts and features I miss from swift.  I guess it goes to show that the governance and availability of a language have a lot more to do with adoption than the merits of the language itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back when I was doing a lot of Swift programming, this seemed like such a great idea. Since then I moved on to Julia. And when I looked at the ML code for Swift and compared it to Julia, I was thinking &#34;How on earth could anyone think this was ever a good idea?&#34;Doing machine learning stuff in Julia is simply much more user friendly than doing the same in Swift. Swift is nice for iOS development, but I think in data science and Machine Learning Julia will always be a much better choice.It is a pity Google did not go for Julia. Julia has gotten exceptionally far despite limited resources. With Google style resources, Julia could have been massive.Despite modest investment, the Julia JIT beats almost anything out there. It would have been amazing to see what they could have pulled off if they had put the kind of resources that was put into the JavaScript V8 JIT into the Julia JIT.Julia uses a method JIT, which are quick to implement, but which makes latency gets bad. Meaning if you load a whole new package, running the first function can cause some delay. With a JavaScript style tracer JIT added into the mix one could have probably managed to have both high performance and low latency.Alternatively with more investment they could have had better precompile caching, meaning libraries that had been loaded in the past would JIT really fast. Julia does that today, but it could have worked a lot better than it currently does. It isn&#39;t that it can&#39;t be done, but it just requires resources."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"S4TF lost out, not to Python, but to Python&#39;s AI/ML ecosystem -- people, projects, libraries, frameworks.Despite its many shortcomings, Python has become the lingua franca of AI and ML, to the point that whenever I come across a newly published AI or ML paper that I find interesting, I expect to be able to find code implementing it in Python.For example, yesterday I saw a post on HN about approximating self-attention matrices in transformers, which have O(n²) computational cost, with a seemingly clever approach that has O(n) computational cost: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26105455 . &#34;Huh, that looks interesting,&#34; I thought, &#34;let me see if I can find some code.&#34; Three clicks later, I found myself at https://github.com/mlpen/Nystromformer -- the official implementation... in Python. A few moments later, I was playing with this thingamajiggy. No other language comes close to having this kind of ecosystem in AI and ML.Julia still has a shot at becoming a viable alternative to Python, especially if the Julia developers can shorten the &#34;time to first interactive plot&#34; to make it as fast as Python&#39;s, but they face an uphill battle against such an entrenched ecosystem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to say turbo tax wasn&#39;t that bad, and that free filing was easy if you just ignored their promises to save you money if you upgraded.Last year however I got all the way to the end of the process where they revealed I made too much and had to pay. That felt extremely unethical, as the information required to come to that conclusion was available far earlier in the process.And yet what am I going to do but use turbo tax again. The perceived risk and effort of using a non-automated system to fill them out doesn&#39;t seem worth the cost."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been involved in many web scraper jobs over the past 25 years or so. The most recent one, which was a long time ago at this point, was using scrapy. I went with XML tools for controlling the DOM.It&#39;s worked unbelievably well. It&#39;s been running for roughly 5 years at this point. I send a command at a random time between 11pm and 4am to wake up an ec2 instance. It checks its tags to see if it should execute the script. If so, it does so. When it&#39;s done with its scraping for the day, it turns itself off.This is a tiny snapshot of why it&#39;s been so difficult for me to go from python2 to python3.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For someone that&#39;s been following Dolphin&#39;s progress for so long it&#39;s really amazing that there&#39;s already a pretty well done Nintendo Switch emulator."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone have any links to blog posts they consider good descriptions of what goes into making a game console emulator?I am super impressed by the content of this post, but I bet there is also a lot that is going over my head that I am not even aware of."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apparently, a lot of indie developers do well on switch for some reason. Breaking even is so hard for most indies that it sort of made me sympathize with the console model at least a little bit more"</p>
