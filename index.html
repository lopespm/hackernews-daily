								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apart from the general consternation about an OSS license becoming non-OSS, can we also talk about the problem that companies are formed, invest a whole lot of resources into creating a product, open-source it, and then have Amazon eat into their profits by just installing and maintaining that product as a service?No matter how you slice it, I think Amazon is bad for us end-users, and Elastic is good. Elastic could have released ES as closed source, but they didn&#39;t, and the OSS ecosystem is better for it. They were hoping to make money off their product, which I don&#39;t think anyone can fault them for, but instead Amazon came in and took a bunch of that money while not giving anything back.Now Elastic is not happy, and I wouldn&#39;t be either. As an end user, I&#39;m grateful the circumstances exist that allow companies to make a living from OSS, and I want to encourage that. AWS is the fly in the ointment there, and I don&#39;t see how blaming Elastic for not giving us stuff for free any more is anything other than entitled. We should be grateful that ES is OSS at all, and we should want an environment where companies that produce OSS can thrive, instead of blaming them for wanting to get paid for the work that they release freely into the world.Amazon hinders that, period. I don&#39;t think Elastic is in the wrong here, I think Amazon is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I have grown a rather hard stance on this over the years: putting an open source license on a product isn&#39;t a business model. It&#39;s, by and large, a part of a larger business model.A license is a choice. It means you choose to not gain revenue by directly licensing the IP. Instead, you choose to put the code out there without any further legal obligations on your part as well as those who use that code.It also means that you have to find alternate ways of making revenue e.g. by providing consultancy, building services or licensing the trademark (which is an entirely different ball game from open sourcing the code!).The trouble isn&#39;t that Amazon decided to use ElasticSearch in their own offering. The trouble is that Amazon simply out-competes ElasticSearch with their own product when it comes to consultancy, services, etc.To add insult to injury, Amazon made the mistake of leveraging the ElasticSearch brand a few times too many in ways that just rub the ElasticSearch people the wrong way.Of course, the founders of ES could never predict how successful their product would become after a decade. There are plenty of open source products engineered by commercial companies  that never catch the eye of behemoths like Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Chromium 86 safelisted some distributed web schemes for registerProtocolHandler() [0][1]. Among them are also `ipfs` and `ipns`. As my first contribution to go-ipfs I grabbed the corresponding issue and added support for the gateway code [2], which will be released with go-ipfs 0.8.0. This means anyone will be able to call e.g.navigator.registerProtocolHandler(&#39;ipfs&#39;, &#39;https://dweb.link/ipfs/?uri=%s&#39;, &#39;ipfs resolver&#39;)Afterwards opening something like:ipfs://QmbWqxBEKC3P8tqsKc98xmWNzrzDtRLMiMPL8wBuTGsMnRwill be redirected to the public gateway configured above and handled accordingly.You can also configure a different gateway as some have voiced their concern about routing everything through dweb.link.[0] https://blog.chromium.org/2020/09/chrome-86-improved-focus-h...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Massive. I have a project that assumed ipfs:// would eventually exist natively within a mainstream(-ish) browser, and I&#39;m very pleased to discover that after updating to 1.19.x it all just works.Excited for the forthcoming DNSLink support too, even if it&#39;s just a bridge to something even better. Best of luck to everyone who wants the web to stay bundled inside of the corporate state."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been a diehard user of the Vivaldi browser for a while now. I just posted the referenced article to their forum stating that Vivaldi should follow suit. Without such support I&#39;ll likely change to Brave specifically due to IPFS support.The internet is in desperate need of decentralization."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My wild guess is that watermarking is done on the client. Doing it at the server stage requires running an encoder for each user connected to the meeting, which increases broadcast costs imensily for Zoom. It would make sense for security reasons, but the trend with them seems to be profit instead.If watermarking is therefore done at the client stage just before being heard/seen at each endpoint, then there is a good chance that it is hackable and watermarking code could be patched or audio/video extracted before watermarking occurs.It would still require whistle-blowers to take this more envolved step before leaking a meeting though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some articles found by googling [1] [2] from two years ago describe this capability as &#34;ultrasonic watermark&#34; so it is not new. I think this is coming to light as Zoom has become popular with the pandemic. For a journalist wanting to sanitize audio I would think they need to remove anything higher than 15kHz.[1] https://www.nojitter.com/video-collaboration-av/zoom-takes-v...[2] https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/22/zoom-is-bringing-ultrason..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fascinating and really made me think.  The article is pitched at leakers but it could just as likely be pitched at journalists.  If you consume news from an outlet that doesn’t follow The Intercept’s advice then complain immediately to the editor.When you leak something it needs to be credible.  Removing watermarks also reduces the fidelity and therefore the credibility.  If 99% of the screen is blurred and the audio has been transcribed then how does the receiver know this is a real leak at all?The answer lies in reputation.  Leak high fidelity material to a trusted third party, usually a journalist.  This can include just showing them the material though that involves meeting in person.  They will verify the source material, summarise and down sample it to conceal the source actor, and maybe even destroy the source material itself.The economics are simple: if you get a reputation for revealing sources then people will stop leaking secrets to you.  Newsrooms that rebroadcast Zoom caps verbatim are revealing sources and need to clean up their act if we are to continue to rely on what’s left of The Fourth Estate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent 6 months in lock down in a 1 bedroom apartment in Australia. Working from home. 1hr outdoor/exercise a day. No more than 5km from home. We had pretty strict rules. I went for a walk around the block with my mate once a week and spoke to my family on zoom once a fortnight and that was about the extent of my social contact for a large part of 2020.I managed pretty well. I&#39;m a naturally introverted person, which is perhaps a good trait to have in this situation. I&#39;m already used to spending a lot of time by myself and I have things I like to do. This is key, I think. I spent long hours making DJ mixes in Ableton and playing records on my hi-fi. That&#39;s a creative place for me and it was very satisfying to have the time to bury myself in it.I wrote code, not heaps, but I played around with a few things.I dug up some old/remake computer games (Half Life Black Mesa was by far the best)! I watched a bunch of old films I haven&#39;t seen in years, and a few bits and pieces on Netflix. I read books. I went for a 1hr walk every day and enjoyed the sight of trees and the sound of birds. I said a sincere thanks and smiled with my eyes at the people who staff the stores I shopped at once/twice a week. They have a hard job and I think it&#39;s important to convey gratitude to them.I&#39;d be lying if I said it was all fine, there were definitely days when I was bored stiff, depressed or otherwise not in a great place, but it was helpful to remember that everyone was in the same boat, and my sacrifice, along with everyone else&#39;s, are what is going to pull us through.Keep your chins up. Especially you guys in the USA. What a mess you have to fix over there. I hope this year is productive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had to leave California (been there 6 years). I was lucky because I had four other room mates to keep me company but even with that it was tough. I also wasn&#39;t really enjoying what I was working on at my previous company (adtech) and needed a change.I ended up moving to Taiwan a few weeks ago. Zero COVID here, and was surprisingly easy to immigrate (coming from someone who was dealing with the US immigration system as a Canadian). Working at a fun startup back on the consumer product side instead. Went to a bar for the first time in a year last week and was able to just sit in a coffee shop with 10 other people this morning. I&#39;m still teaching myself to read/speak Chinese but it&#39;s totally worth it.Anyone with experience with TypeScript/React interested in tagging along to Taiwan, send me an email (my email is in my hacker news profile). I&#39;m actively hiring engineers now. We&#39;re a distributed team across many different countries but a few of us hang out in Taipei together at a coworking space. It&#39;s the best of both worlds, I&#39;m able to WFH when I feel like it but still go to a public space to be around people"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally, I&#39;m not burnt out.To void burn out, I did a few things which I feel are extremely helpful.1. Have a room that is a dedicated office. When I leave this room, I leave the &#34;office&#34;.2. Establish communication throughout the day. This means having slack conversations (typed and video) that are casual. It&#39;s okay to vent on these calls.3. Have a defined schedule - Awake at 6am, washed/dressed by 6:30am, Red Bull (or if you like food) and at my desk by 7am. I do work long hours, but I enjoy it because I&#39;m accomplishing something.4. Work on something that excites you or find joy in your work somehow.5. Lastly, realize most of the mental stress can be managed with a little mindfulness, learning to accept that you still can grow and find joy even when at home and cut back on social media; or if you&#39;re like me, I cut out 99% of social media.I hope everyone remains positive. Do something today, that makes you better tomorrow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Specifically, at the URL, the Repository hosts and offers for download the Project, which, when downloaded, provides the downloader everything necessary to launch and host a “clone” infringing website identical to Nyaa.si (and, thus, engage in massive infringement of copyrighted motion pictures and television shows).I&#39;d like for Motion Picture Association to publish a step-by-step guide on how I can engage in massive infringement of copyrighted motion pictures and television shows using this piece of software.Because I imagine at some point in the guide they&#39;d tell me to generate torrent files of copyrighted files I have and upload them to the site, which is really outside of this project.Or is Nginx also infringing because when downloaded, it allows me to start engaging in massive infringement of copyrighted motion pictures and television shows by enabling directory indexing and uploading MP4s?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The MPA seems to be getting braver with these takedowns, considering how quickly the youtube-dl one got flipped around. This one seems particularly shaky as you could not use it to explicitly download anything - rather to host data of your own (with no explicit requirement for it to be unauthorized copyright violation).EDIT: perhaps just a ploy to unmask the authors of the torrent site?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This site is mainly used to share Japanese media. The streaming services have really dropped the ball in this area. They either don&#39;t simulcast to other parts of the world (netflix), offer terrible subtitles that are worse than fan translations (netflix, crunchyroll), or just plain never release content for international audiences.I pay for every relevant streaming service I can, and even when I can access legal, official distributions, I still generally prefer fan releases. It&#39;s embarrassing.I&#39;m so tired of the rent seeking in the entertainment industry. I want to pay artists and content creators, not an ever growing pile of mediocre middlemen and their lawyers. How can we pool our money to hire lobbyists and change the landscape of this industry?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think one day we’re going to wake up and discover that AWS mostly runs on Graviton (ARM) and not x86. And on that day intel’s troubles will go from future to present.My standing theory is that the m1 will accelerate it. Obviously all the wholly managed AWS services (Dynamo, Kinesis, S3, etc.) can change over silently, but the issue is EC2. I have a MBP, as do all of my engineers. Within a few years all of these machines will age out and be replaced with m1 powered machines. At that point the idea of developing on ARM and deploying on x86 will be unpleasant, especially since Graviton 2 is already cheaper per compute unit than x86 is for some work loads; imagine what Graviton 3 &amp; 4 will offer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing about all of these articles analyzing Intel&#39;s problems is that nobody really knows the details of Intel&#39;s &#34;problems&#34; because it comes down to just one &#34;problem&#34; that we have no insight into: node size. What failures happened in Intel&#39;s engineering/engineering management of its fabs that led to it getting stuck at 14 nm? Only the people in charge of Intel&#39;s fabs know exactly what went wrong, and to my knowledge they&#39;re not talking. If Intel had kept chugging along and got down to 10 nm years ago when they first said they would, and then 7 nm by now, it wouldn&#39;t have any of these other problems. And we don&#39;t know exactly why that didn&#39;t happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found the geopolitical portion to be the most important aspect here. China has shown a willingness to flex its muscles on enforcing its values beyond their borders. China is smart, and plays a long game. We don&#39;t want to wake up one day and find they&#39;ve flexed their muscles on their regional neighbors similar to their rare earths strong-arming from 2010-2014 and not have fab capabilities to fall back on in the West.(For that matter, I&#39;m astounded that after 2014 the status quo returned on rare earths with very little state-level strategy or subsidy to address the risk there.)"</p>

And maybe every 10 years thereafter.Google&#39;s Eric Schmidt suggests that young people should change their name upon reaching adulthood:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Death is no escape either - my grandfather died almost thirty years ago but you can still find his name and last address on all of the people search sites. My grandmother was still getting marketing materials addressed to him when she died about five years ago. I had an uncle who died in the early 80s and there is no trace of him, so 90s seems to be the point at which the data brokers decided that nobody ever dies. Online advertising is already a sham (no really, I am never ever going to download Homescapes but I see ads for it thirty times a day), add on top of that all the dead people’s data being passed around. There really needs to be some regulation and oversight."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article they mention a user being angry that they lost their kick data. It felt like they were highlighting this scenario like it was somehow weird or unusual that a pregnant mother was upset that she lost this data.This &#34;fascination&#34; from the author is unhelpful IMHO.I am not surprised that the pregnant mother was upset - in the UK it is now drilled into you that you need to keep track of kick data for your child and that you must - must - call the hospital as soon as you notice any change at all in kicking from your unborn child (1).They are deliberately very vague and unclear about what a &#34;change&#34; constitutes - just that if you feel something has changed at all or in any way then you need to call. From experience, these calls always end with a request that you go into hospital for a check from a midwife. So 55 kicks today, but 60 yesterday?  Come in and a midwife will hook you up to keep track of your baby&#39;s vitals for an hour just to be sure with lots of reassurance that you did the right thing by coming in and getting it checked.So no shit if you&#39;ve entrusted this data to an app and they&#39;ve dropped the ball, no wonder you are angry: this is not just data for data&#39;s sake - not having it potentially endangers the life of your unborn child because you don&#39;t have your historical data to compare against any more, so you can&#39;t know anymore if today&#39;s kicks are changed from yesterday&#39;s or the day before etc.I am sure many people will scoff and call this an overreaction (including apparently the author of the article) but this is the current recommendation from the NHS here, and not everyone has a totally normal medical history or otherwise-textbook pregnancy where it is all skipping through meadows of wild daisys and baby ducklings quietly nuzzling at your feet followed by the perfect stress and pain free delivery. People can and do have medical circumstances that influence pregnancy. It ain&#39;t all plain sailing.People have reason to need to trust that their medical data is stored safely and reliably. To insinuate that is is odd is deeply unhelpful.1 - https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/your-babys-movemen..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The way Thai&#39;s feel about honor and defamation is a lot more complex and causes friction when the (existing Western) system tries to apply legal rules of how conflict is resolved (and punishment is applied) in an environment where the old values of honor are still valid.when I still lived in the South of Thailand early 90ies we took people diving from Koh Samui, Koh Phan-gan, Koh Tao. The relationship between Thai&#39;s and the law is a strange one. It&#39;s almost like there are 2 systems. One for Thais one for &#34;Farang&#34;.A Thai would not dare to speak ill of the monarchs. They leave the room if a &#34;farang&#34; has had one too many and says something critical (they&#39;re peace loving but their love of peace might end there). This applies to both the very rich and the very poor.We hired the captain from another region of the South to transport our divers. He was with the company since the day these islands were still 100% jungle and the place belonged to local fishermen. The reason why he left the region was because he had an argument and killed his neighbor. The deal was that he would not get killed only if he left the region and settled without ever returning to his family - this is considered not just shameful but seen as a huge disadvantage to make a living. They settled it without police, lawyer, bailiff, or judge, all among themselves.Our other captain (in charge of the boat that left Koh Phangan) was also the right hand man of the most powerful person on the island. That guy was like a major, or village elder because he owned what was then the only &#34;super market&#34; on the island, and lot of the land. Our captain and &#34;right hand man&#34; to this guy was a devout monk (every year for several months left his wife to sweep the floor in silence in the monastery). He was a family man, highly respected within the community, and it was no secret among Thais that he was also heavily armed and had a body count of 12 people in his short life (late 20ies).While murder is obviously illegal by law in Thailand, it is still used as a way by locals to settle disputes within rural areas of the South. The illegality isn&#39;t even considered here since in this case they see it as their moral duty which still trumps whatever some judge/lawyer&#39;s definition of justice is who has never before left Krung Thep.Long story short it&#39;s quite complex to transform what is still in ways a tribal society into what we call &#34;law-abiding&#34; citizen. Especially when the law contradicts the values of society. And even more so when the existing police force is just a show for the tourists and to the urban population."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Poland, we still have a blasphemy law. A newspaper along the lines of Charlie Hebdo had its owner dragged over courts for over 8 YEARS. The offense was illustrating an article about emptying churches with a surprised Jesus in a road sign. The newspaper routinely posts much more offensive content: cartoon dicks, cartoon sex, caricatures of pope, Jews, politicians (some dick-headed or engaged in homosexual sex), national flags in dog shit... But it was ostensibly a surprised Jesus that crossed the line.Since the current government entrenched itself, police is investigating things like suspicious duck-shaped snowmen next to statues (related to last name Kaczyński). The party leader that had 80 police squad cars guarding his villa.One of worst parts of thin skinned politicians is fabricating excuses to harass people they don&#39;t like."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know this is probably what most users want but I hate the why Chrome&#39;s camera/mic permissions work. Your options are(1) block a domain from camera/mic access(2) give a domain camera/mic access forever2 is what people pick. From that point on, that domain, in an iframe, can turn on your camera/mic. That means if messanger.com or meet.google.com or zoom.com wanted to make zoom.com/embed/this/url/as/iframe/to/spy/on/people.html they could, and then sell that service for ads to embed in their ads. They have the permissions needed to turn on the mic/camera whenever they want at that point, no more questions asked.That bugs me.Firefox at least has &#34;allow camera access once&#34;.I don&#39;t know what a better solution is. One might be mic/camera permission per URL instead of domain. I supposed that&#39;s not really any different if you can just append ?dothespything=trueAnother might just be that it always asks. It&#39;s not like the phone feature of a smartphone has the option to just always answer immediately. Instead you choose whether or not the take the call. Does it need to be any different on a webpage?PS: I like that webpages have this feature. I like that I can video chat/conference in a sandboxed environment instead of having to install a native app that can spy on me in other ways too. I just wish this permission issue worked differently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good analyses, but I was expecting more discussion of how best to work with (conceptual) state machines when writing code.I&#39;m no expert on the matter, but there are code-generative tools out there that help make state machines very explicit: you describe the state machine, and the system generates the code. This should help to avoid issues with transitions that you failed to consider, which may be of real value as such unexpected transitions may pose a serious security issue when implementing the state machine &#39;by hand&#39; in code. More so than many design patterns, it seems to make good sense to use a code-generative approach for state-machines.This is of course related to how regex works, as regex is implemented with state machines, but state-machine code-generator systems might not make use of the usual regex syntax.Related reading: Turning vaguely reassuring finite-state machines into regular expressions, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25496045"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time a vulnerability like this comes out, especially if it&#39;s a company that has some people with a chip against them (and most companies do), people say &#34;See, that&#39;s why you can&#39;t trust Company With Vulnerabilty, I never use their software.&#34;But if you actually pay attention you&#39;ll realize that vulnerabilities happen everywhere. Not all software is created equal, some might be more secure and have fewer vulnerabilities than others. But a single exposed vuln, no matter how severe, is pretty much never enough to judge which software is which.I remember hearing about this exact bug in Facetime, but I had no idea that, as OP demonstrated, an analagous bug effected pretty much every popular similar A/V group chat software. Including the vaunted Signal.Did this one OP find and reveal it in all of them? wow.Also, I really wonder how many of these the NSA knew about before we did, but who can say (except the NSA)."</p>
