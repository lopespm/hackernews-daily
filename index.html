								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article mentions ”gn” in passing, but it doesn’t give it enough credit: this is an enormously useful motion, almost more useful on its own than the rest of the article.The thing that makes it golden is that it is a motion, and thus combined with a command, it is repeatable! So, like:1. Search for something (either using / or *).2. Type ”cgn” in Normal mode (i.e. change next search match) and replace what you searched for with whatever3. Hammer on ”.” (i.e. repeat last command) to replace other matches.This replaces, like, 97% of uses of :s and is a much more convenient way to do search/replace, especially if you use * to search for the word under the cursor. It’s the bee’s knees!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Vim is getting more popular. Not just within vim, but outside vim! Practically every full-featured editor has a vi or vim mode, and when they say vi, usually they also mean vim.Things that have nothing to do with vim but are inspired by vim are even sprouting up! And apparently it&#39;s OK to name something based on vim: https://groups.google.com/g/vim_use/c/EnSMrx_rGg4/m/d_nVlmLQ...Edit: In Bram&#39;s reply he mentioned the household cleaner. Apparently it&#39;s similar to Ajax. That&#39;s so awesome. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vim_(cleaning_product)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Recently Apple added a feature to iOS that allows you only to allow selected photos to be accessible by an app. This allows the user to respond positively to an access request, but allow the app to see only a subset (or zero) actual photos.It would be a very useful feature for Apple to do the same for contacts: the app would think it&#39;s getting access to your contacts, but would only actually receive a subset of them, and be none the wiser. This would be a tremendous boon for privacy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see what the point is.&#34;Data poisoning&#34; gives companies a bunch of fake contacts... on top of all your real ones?Who cares? So they send some e-mails to addresses that don&#39;t exist or something? So it takes up an extra 1% of disk space in their database?If you could share an empty address book then that would actually preserve the privacy of your contacts. But this doesn&#39;t do that.I don&#39;t get it."</p>

There are some folks I don&#39;t even want to possibly find in a social app."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the most important skills is learning to communicate clearly.You need to give up details and be able to express the key concepts clearly on different levels of detail and business/technical understanding.Explaining this is something you will be doing again and again, so it is worth a lot of effort to get there.I recommend iterating until you have an A4 with the skeleton you need explain all this. It will include key stakeholders/users/integrations, key technologies/protocols, key services/components and the high-level system landscape with key internal and external systems.Notice that a good diagram for this mixes a lot of different views and formal notations.The key idea is that you should strive to provide a skeleton on which your audience can place their understanding and fill in the blanks that they are interested in based on you explanation.If you try to put everything there or follow a formal model like UML you will drown out the key concepts in the noise of the details."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is neat.  I decided to diff two pods in a replicated Kubernetes service.  It seemed that it was going to take forever to run, so I just wrote a short Go program to do the same thing (load two JSON files into a map[string]interface{}, cmp.Diff them) while it was going:https://gist.github.com/jrockway/73982949b3d2ce9b443528042c4...My program runs in less than 10 milliseconds (/usr/bin/time reports 0.00 seconds), and graphtage takes 5 minutes and 17 seconds.  I&#39;m 317,000x faster!  (Not including the time to write the program; if you do that, then it&#39;s about even assuming graphtage took 0 seconds to write.)Graphtage prints the entire file in JQ colors, with diffs inside fields colored red and green, which I love:    ...
    &#34;hostIP&#34;: &#34;10.136.13̟9̟2̶1̶.139̟1̶&#34;,
    &#34;podIP&#34;: &#34;10.244.1.18̟6̟7̶&#34;,
    ...

(My terminal can&#39;t display the dots under the numbers and the strikethrough, but it looks great on HN!  I really love it.)My program produces relatively boring line-by-line diffs:    -               &#34;hostIP&#34;:    string(&#34;10.136.121.131&#34;),
    +               &#34;hostIP&#34;:    string(&#34;10.136.139.139&#34;),
                    &#34;phase&#34;:     string(&#34;Running&#34;),
    -               &#34;podIP&#34;:     string(&#34;10.244.1.17&#34;),
    +               &#34;podIP&#34;:     string(&#34;10.244.1.186&#34;),

Honestly, I get what I want out of mine, and wait 317,000x less time, so... I probably won&#39;t be using this on a daily basis.  But I will be stealing those dots and Unicode strikethroughs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s insanely cool to see a non-IM use case built out on top of Matrix appearing (almost) out of the blue - congratulations :)The implementation currently freestyles a bit on the event format for the messages, which is somewhat our fault on the Matrix team for running horrifically late on MSC1767 (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/msc176...) which proposes how to do rich custom event formats (e.g. blog posts) which are still renderable and visible to more generic Matrix clients (e.g. Element).  As a result, if you join a Hummingbard conversation via another Matrix client currently you can&#39;t see all the messages (or vice versa). However am hoping that Hummingbard might be a trailblazer for actually exercising MSC1767 in the wild and knocking it into shape, which would hugely benefit the whole Matrix ecosystem :)In terms of licenses, it depend on how you want the project to be used.  If you want folks to run it for personal use as a decentralised social network, I&#39;d personally go GPLv3 or AGPLv3.  If you want commercial folks to be able to build on it too, then Apache is probably the best bet.  copyleft + proprietary dual licensing is another option, but means you&#39;d need any contributors to agree to the dual licensing (could be tricky), and could be seen as not being in the spirit of the GPL.  that said, IANAL, YMMV.(At the risk of going somewhat off topic, another exciting Matrix client also appeared today: https://github.com/pixlwave/Watch-The-Matrix - the first native Matrix client for Apple Watch. https://youtu.be/Jh9iewrBdGQ)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What does it look like to actually write a program ontop of Matrix? Eg i have a key value store that i&#39;d like to use Matrix (or IPFS/etc) for the P2P layer. Is it a lot like IRC channels that you connect to, pushing data into them and getting data out from other clients in the same channel?Ie is it a series of messages? Or is it something more advanced; with built in conflict resolution or other P2P-y features?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is missing one of the best features of iso 8601: it‘s string form is naturally sortable. You don‘t need any specific logic for sorting, so e.g. your filesystem will automatically sort files correctly if you prefix them with a iso 8601 date."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangentially related: I hate GNOME&#39;s approach at configuring formats.In their format settings, you have to pick a country and that determines the format of dates, time, numbers, and the unit system.Of all the countries, none of them has the sane choice for all of the fields, namely: ISO 8601 for dates and times with 24h (no AM/PM), metric system (or SI, whatever), and dot as decimal separator.You can have sane dates, but then you have AM/PM in the clock. You can have 24h clock, but then you have a comma as decimal separator, etc.Can we add a country &#34;Saneland&#34; with the sensible options for all fields? cause that&#39;s where I want to be from. Saneland: the imaginary place where we use reasonable standards and things work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At the risk of nitpicking, I prefer RFC 3339, which is a profile of ISO 8601. ISO 8601 provides room for things you typically don&#39;t want, e.g. dropping time zone offsets.While I&#39;m typing this I realise that I&#39;ve never actually read the ISO 8601 spec, like probably most people here, because it&#39;s not free. I cannot even be sure it really exists."</p>

It is fully off-grid (except WiFi) and we made smart decisions and installed reliable systems.You pay your money and you maintain the house.Unfortunately it’s never like that. It’s all DIY:Come camp with us for 4 weeks without a hot shower while we teach you how to mix AirCrete and sell you a pump. Get 4 friends and spend 4 months slathering cob incorrectly together. Never cut down a tree before? Buy a chainsaw and start stacking 1-ton logs- you’ll be perfectly safe: nobody has blogged yet about having crushed themselves.I realize this is contrary to the spirit.I just want a convention-over-configuration small off-grid house that I can see in models, read specs for, and purchase outright, including the land it’s sitting on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve ridden the RAGBRAI (Register&#39;s Annual Great Bicycle Ride Across Iowa) three times. Each year, a different route brings you and 15,000 of your closest friends through small towns like Marne and Manilla. The chosen communities always enthusiastically rise to the occasion by providing food, water, beverages, entertainment, fun diversions, historical themes, hospitality, well wishes and much more.Riding out of town after having a stack of pancakes at the firehouse or a piece of pie from the local Rotary Club, you have plenty of time to think about what it takes and how remarkable it is for some of those towns to accommodate everyone.The RAGBRAI is a great way to experience the State of Iowa."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Around 20 years ago, I had the opportunity to listen to a member of Nasdaq top management talk about the stock market. It&#39;s all a _tiny_ bit blurry, being a long time ago, but I remember how he talked about three different perspectives for investing in stock:First, the &#34;company perspective&#34;. An investor would buy stock in a company they believed in. Maybe they had good products, or good management, or something else. The idea was looking at the how well the company would perform.Second, the &#34;stock perspective&#34;. An investor would ignore the underlying company, but look at the stock itself. It didn&#39;t really matter if the company was doing good, but only if the stock itself had good potential. The idea was looking at how well the stock would perform.Finally, the &#34;game perspective&#34;. An investor would not really care about the stock, but only about the behavior of other investors. Day trading would be the example here, profiting mainly on marketplace dynamics, no matter the stock. The idea was looking at how to be a better player than the others.Then he talked about how the game perspective was the only model that really matched the marketplace, and how the stock market had evolved from being place where people would invest in companies, to a place where they would play a game with other peopl."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is only scratching the surface of the question.For interest, there&#39;s a very common negative expected value bet that almost everyone is required to make: insurance.We don&#39;t consider that gambling, in fact we often tell our parents to buy some when they fly on holiday.Why? The answer touches on the lottery.We care about not just the average case, we care about what might happen.Regarding Kelly criterion, there&#39;s a good reason why people don&#39;t used exactly the amount it says. If you look at the risk, ie the chance your probability is wrong, there&#39;s a chance you are overbetting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Gambling occurs when you have a poor understanding of risk, resulting in either (1) negative expected value bets, or (2) poor bet sizing that leads to ruin.&#34; Not so. Top poker players are still gambling, but have an excellent understanding of the risks. Their skill doesn&#39;t turn them into investors. Gambling is taking a high risk bet. Whether the expected pay off is high enough to justify the risk and whether you can afford to lose the bet is a separate issue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the hardest thing about being a parent today is the constant shame and confusion about the “right” way to do it. We don’t live in a hunter gatherer society anymore, we just don’t. There’s lots of wisdom in that way of life, and sure we could learn from it — but there’s enough anxiety as it is, parents don’t need more of it.We have three kids and we sleep trained them. (Not a pediatrician, standard disclaimer.) This article calls it an ‘extreme’ practice. For us, ‘extreme’ was the sleep deprivation we experienced with baby number one as we tried every ‘no cry’ method in the book. The baby cried and cried and cried. Once we started sleep training, there was a bit of crying and then - a sleeping baby! Through the night! Total amount of crying went from hours to zero. The kid became happier — they weren’t sleep-deprived anymore. And neither were we. I no longer felt like I was going to drop the ball due to extreme exhaustion.Babies two and three had the benefit of our experience, and they barely cried at all. The third one would lay down eyes-open and fall asleep. “So it actually does happen! — I thought the books must be lying.”By all objective measures our kids are happy, healthy, and well-adjusted. But that doesn’t mean we still don’t get the stink eye from people who think it’s a cruel practice.Just raise your kids with love. Be compassionate, and patient. Find a doctor you trust. Don’t let people add to an already stressful endeavor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of all the &#34;weird&#34; things we do as parents in euro/anglo nations, sleeping arrangements seems nowhere near the top.IMO, the top &#34;offender&#34; is over-scheduling kid&#39;s activities. So many kids in my area have their days booked solid with sports, academic tutoring, music lessons.  Approaching zero free time to enjoy being a kid.Edit - and this isn&#39;t really a western thing, &#34;Tiger Mom&#34; and similar probably pre-dates this behavior in the US."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Speaking as a parent of 5. Parental mental health has a much bigger effect on the child than choice of methodologies. You really need to look after yourself before you can look after them - so if you are suffering from sleep deprivation, doing what you have to do is the right thing to do.Put your own oxygen mask on first."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I commend Firefox for trying to do this... but it worries me.3 obvious holes:- Proliferation of dialogs. When you don&#39;t know whether a site will suddenly break or not, standard users will be implicitly trained to say yes to all dialogs.- Domain &#34;homogenizing&#34; (spoofing) services will win. Trackers that offer a widget you can install on your server will win. Facebook et all will still know where they sent you, and will be able to track you server side. If mozilla provide a centralized whitelist, then SSO providers who also provide trackers will win. Essentially, the big players will find a way, the little players (who users weren&#39;t worried about anyway) will still lose.- The web will break. SSO will be broken for a good couple of months on over 50% of websites using it - possibly more. &#34;This only works in Google Chrome&#34; will become more and more popular. Potentially, Firefox doesn&#39;t have the market share to make this work.Those of us who will stick with Firefox regardless are in for a world of pain, and not a lot of gain. I guess it&#39;s necessary to move the web on, but the pessimist in me doesn&#39;t see that happening any time soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think what you want is essentially an entirely fresh browser session for every website you visit. Pretty mind-boggling to what lengths we need to go in order to prevent companies from tracking us. That said most tracking companies seem to have devised strategies to construct fingerprints from data like IP addresses, user-agent strings and any other meta-data they can get their hands on, so the next step will probably be to restrict what kind of information can be learned about the browser environment via JS (e.g. getting exact screen resolution).Also, data exfiltration via browser extensions is still not a solved problem, there are very popular extensions (Ghostery for example) that are highly privileged in the browser and often collect a ridiculous amount of data. Really can&#39;t get my head around why browser vendors still allow that while being so strict on all other forms of tracking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This needs to be bypassed to use SSO, to bypass it the SSO providers site will need to ask for Storage Access, in some cases the user will be asked for permission…“After the user has granted access, Firefox will remember the storage permission for 30 days.”So lay users will get used to just clicking through and blindly granting the permission.The end result will be an additional step for trackers, and a bunch of headaches for all the legit services that get broken from this change.I’m all for less tracking but this doesnt seem like a good solution."</p>
