								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Most companies don’t do this because of the mountain of complexities with taxes, payroll, and time zone availability, but I hope we can open-source a solution so other companies can offer this flexibility as well.I think this is a genius growth play for Airbnb. Make it easier for _other_ companies to operate in a similar way so that _their_ employees can travel and live in an... Airbnb! Next, they should lobby to get US and EU to make short-term &#34;tourism + wfh&#34; visas more accessible so that this becomes even more popular. I think everyone wins here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sooo.. w/o getting into my history too deeply, my ex and I left the US in 2006 and worked freelance/remote. Wired did an article about us in 2008 living in a solar van when that was, like, unheard of. It seems like every few years a new batch of people want to try this approach, and it&#39;s always popular with the press to write about it. Sometimes it works out. I think it&#39;s a great way to live, and it teaches you a lot about yourself.We used to just find vacation rentals. One of the key tricks I used when AirBnb came out was figuring out who the owner was and contacting them directly with a cash offer for 3 months rent with ~25% (sometimes 50%) knocked off if I pay in USD up front. So I&#39;d say most of the places I lived from 2009 on (about 20 places?) I found on AirBnb, thanks guys, and then paid cash to the owner. Only once or twice, for a couple days at most, have I ever actually used AirBnb to run a transaction for me.Not for nothing, I now live in a house I own in Portland with an AirBnb right next to me whose owners are off living in some other AirBnb out of the country, and I&#39;m pissed as fuck that I&#39;m living next to what&#39;s turned into a goddamn motel. But it&#39;s wonderful that the AirBnb staff now get the same in-system privileges that unionized airline employees have had for decades. It would be better if it wasn&#39;t literally gutting every city from Amsterdam to Bangkok in the process and turning them into hipster slums."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;I completely underestimated how much work it takes to build a business. There&#39;s so much overhead. I&#39;m always figuring out why a build failed, taxes, how to triage issues, responding to support, designing UIs, responding to Apple&#39;s complaints, and more. There&#39;s so much that goes on behind the scenes. There&#39;s no way a single person can possible do this alone, especially as a side project.&#34;This is the part that resonates a lot with me even though I have been able to build a small business that is reasonably successful with a small team but it takes a toll. It is a frikin slog and there are days when you feel like jumping off a cliff. Also the cost of doing something so small can add up when you can have a cushy tech job making 200K relatively easy. To do your own thing requires a very different mindset and incredibly hard.There is a HUGE difference between building a quick side project for fun VS turning it into a real business (no matter how small). I have full sympathy for the owner and totally understand where they are coming from. No judgement and I wish them all the best."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see it going open source! I hope Actual can keep development going with the community support.Similarly, a local-first (PouchDB) budgeting app I built[1] went open source[2][3] a few years ago. It&#39;s worked out well, I love seeing what everyone does with it in their forks. Unlike Actual however, I maintain a paid subscription service while being open source.It&#39;s worked out quite well. Luckily it&#39;s not a huge time commitment as a side project, probably due to no native apps. I&#39;ve also shifted from active development to maintenance, with sporadic updates every now and then. For example, I recently moved everything from Gitlab to Github[4] and upgraded a bunch of dependencies under the hood to get everything compiling on Apple Silicon. (For example, I now run AngularJS tests with Jest, hehe.)[1] https://financier.io/[2] https://github.com/financier-io/[3] https://blog.financier.io/financier-is-now-open-source-bdfe9...[4] https://blog.financier.io/weve-moved-to-github-4617239b9fa3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a lot of tools like Actual (YNAB, Monarch, Mint, Aspire google sheet etc). All are focused on budgets and mostly managing cash accounts.I&#39;ve always wanted an equivalent but for investments. I know you can sync investment accounts to some of these, but that only reports the balance generally.I&#39;d love to have the equivalent for investment accounts that answer these questions:What is my sector exposure?How much, across multiple accounts and brokerages, of Apple (or any stock/etf/mutual fund) do I own as a total percentage?How much money are in retirement accounts vs non retirement accounts?What is my IRR (rate of return) in aggregate and per account?And of course things like projections, safe withdrawal rates, analysis in the form of charts and graphs like what Actual and the rest offer.etc"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author writes well and makes compelling points. His &#34;I want to get off Mr Golang&#39;s Wild Ride&#34; post is good too.But I don&#39;t find myself agreeing with his position, which is &#34;you shouldn&#39;t use Go for production services&#34; (he explicitly says this in one of his Go posts, I forget which one and don&#39;t have time to look right now).The better alternative to Go is Rust. Okay, sure, I&#39;m willing to admit that in the examples presented, Rust handles things better. But Rust isn&#39;t a panacea. Rust is complicated and hard, and often it&#39;s not worth taking on that burden just to theoretically handle cases that rarely occur and even more rarely cause any problem. Programming is a means to an end, and the cost of using Rust (hiring, increased development time) is often not worth it.The reason Go is successful is because it&#39;s easy for companies to use to solve production problems with teams of varying expertise. Its stdlib is well-featured, its ecosystem is good. There&#39;s generally one correct way of doing things. The same doesn&#39;t appear true in Rust. For example, an _incredibly_ common thing to do in production code is to make a web request. In Go, there is no need for debate, you use the stdlib. In Rust, you have to use a crate, which requires a decision to be made. Even worse is the async story, in Rust you have to decide whether to use Tokio or whatever. That burden is just not present with Go.Btw this article should not be flagged and it&#39;s pathetic that people have flagged it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Flagging this post strikes me as shameful censorship of an unpopular opinion.You may say it&#39;s the snark/anger/frustration that got flagged, but I suspect it would not have been flagged if the topic were different.Presuming the author is making bad-faith arguments for internet blog points goes against the spirit of HN. I prefer to draw my own conclusions, thank you. I normally expect HN to take the higher ground with calm and reasoned counter arguments of the content but not today I guess."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used Go and Rust professionally and in side projects, and I had used Go first before Rust. When I first used Go, I was like &#34;oh wow, this is so simple and easy&#34;, and I didn&#39;t realize that I was putting up with the language. Learning Rust was relatively harder, but once I did and wrote some non trivial programs in Rust, it was like a pathway in my brain opened up and was previously blocked, and then when I went back to Go, I was painfully aware of issues that I the programmer had to keep in mind (or write a LOT of boilerplate code to keep track of). Issues that Rust&#39;s type system just solves.The way `nil` can seep into your codebase in Go and how bad the FFI is in Go will prevent me from ever choosing it for a project going forward. And I personally would not feel confident modifying Go code written by someone else, and would not feel confident accepting PRs into my Go codebase unless I understood every line inside and out.Rust is a breath of fresh air in that regard.All that said, I think the author here is idealistic in a certain sense. In the scale of &#34;solving a problem by hand (or using Excel/a proprietary tool etc)&#34; to &#34;writing a computer program to automate it&#34;, both Go and Rust are very close to each other. And once someone learns Go and knows it well enough, the incremental cost of learning Rust or even thinking about the problems Rust solves for you becomes not worth it. I think that it&#39;s sad that this is the way it works, but that&#39;s just how it is. It&#39;s easy for settle for a local optima like Go when taking into consideration family, pets, salary, time, effort etc.I do think on a long enough timescale, programmers will eventually move to a &#34;better&#34; language. But in my opinion, that time scale exceeds the lifespan of a human :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great, but removing the info from Google does nothing to remove it from the source. People search data brokers are one of the most common sources of unwanted posting of home address, phone number and email. If that&#39;s the info you want to remove, you can use Google as a tool for discovery to figure out who is posting the info, and then opt out at the source to have it removed. For more coverage you can use Optery&#39;s free crawl / scrape / scan of the people search data broker sites for you, and use that to have the listings removed from the source. Wherever possible, removing the info from the source is much better than just removing it from Google."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everything is not falling apart, though certain institutions may be falling apart.In America, there&#39;s definitely been a breakdown of belief in its own institutions.  Far more people are skeptical of things like journalism and Silicon Valley; it really wasn&#39;t that long ago that the former was constantly salivating over the latter, but now it&#39;s more of an openly vulture-carrion relationship because that caters to public sentiment.  People who I would consider &#34;normies&#34; even don&#39;t trust law enforcement and the FBI anymore (not that they ever should have).  Even the education system from K12 to college is increasingly being seen as a joke and an outright racket.  We also went from the President being a more respected position to one deserving of relentless tabloid gossip.  Even if one&#39;s &#34;guy&#34; is in office, I don&#39;t think we feel the same about it the way we did even as recent as Obama, and his administration was when we really began to see the social cracks forming.Civilization ebbs and flows, but I think the current sentiment is unprecedented in my lifetime.  This is not a high point by any stretch of the imagination, and while I see &#34;everything is collapsing&#34; to be hyperbolic, it seems inevitable that many things we thought were rock solid are in a transition period where either they will reform or one day be replaced with force of some kind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Things collapsing has been a predominant sentiment in every modern generation. It&#39;s unprecedented because of our collective amnesia, that regards the familiar as a stable starting point rather than a random moment in a volatile reality.Journalism was a tawdry, un-respectable business since its conception, but experienced a brief period of valor around the mid-twentieth century when industry concentration, Cold War ethics and regulation collectively reworked its incentives. The education system has always been in a position of scrutiny since universal education become the norm. Presidents have been the stuff of tabloid gossip since the founding fathers with the media mercilessly opting to promote scandal and controversy over respectability. Our conception of President as moral arbiter is a function of the reworking of journalism mentioned above.The difference in peoples attitudes reflects an increased diet of emotion inducing media that accelerates fears and expectations, rather than some great pivot in volatility. Yes there are things to worry about but there always are (let&#39;s remember the twentieth century had two world wars, the Great Depression, and an even worse pandemic)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d argue that the greater risk of things falling apart is economic rather than political. We&#39;ve built our society on two near-ponzi schemes that are in danger of falling apart. The first is pension funds which are paid into by current workers to pay out for past workers. Pension funds inherently depend on population growth to avoid shortfalls. They rely on the fact that more people pay into them then take out from them at any one time.  This literally meets the definition of a ponzi scheme and it will be heartbreaking when it comes due.The other near-ponzi scheme is the real estate market.  In my city of Toronto, average real estate prices have gone from 2x average income in 1972 to 16x average income today. To continue growing at this pace they&#39;d have to reach 128x average income by 2072. Those prices are absurd enough that it&#39;s clear there will be a slowdown in real estate prices before then. But much of our society is built on real estate growth and we aggressively encourage people to own real estate assets worth more than the entirety of their net worth. When these assets stop going up, or even worse start going down there will be major complications for society.  I&#39;m not talking about the adverse effects of a temporary market correction, I&#39;m talking about a new normal in which real estate is flat or downward trending.  When real estate is no longer an incredible investment opportunity it will have significant adverse effects on society.  For instance, homes are currently a large part of people&#39;s retirement plans and selling a home is often used to pay for an extended stay in a nursing home (which is quite expensive).  For many people the home represents over 60% of a retirement plan. In my parents lifetime, their home value increased to roughly 10x what it was worth. If my home increases 4x instead this is a substantial adverse impact. If my child&#39;s home increases 0x this is disastrous.The things we fundamentally depend on to provide things as important in society as retirement are breaking badly.  Meanwhile we&#39;re so obsessed with political differences that we barely talk about or work towards solving the slow economic crisis we are facing."</p>

All their results seem to rely on skills being used.
There is indeed a need then for Amazon to prevent user tracking in skills (like for example Apple does and requires consent by the user).
But to come to the conclusion that Amazon shares the data with advertisers I would have expected an experiment with eliminating skills as a reason and just having personas interact with Alexa core services. I guess just from shopping questions or general knowledge questions a lot of information for ad targeting could be inferred. If that’s however not influencing ads served when no skills are used, then it’s not necessarily Amazon directly sharing the information, but the skills being able to do so using Amazons provided tooling.That’s a difference at least for my interpretation how “evil” company xyz is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Investigative journalist Scott Stedman … said Broeksmit “supplied me and other journalists with Deutsche Bank documents that highlighted the bank’s deep Russia connections. It is very sad. I don’t suspect foul play. Val struggled with drugs on and off. Waiting on further info.”Stay away from sources of fentanyl folksAnybody 45 and under randomly dying these days is most likely from exposure to fentanyl. Doesnt matter what other stuff theyre up to, how much you respect them or if would find it “disrespectful” to say they used certain drugs. Most people arent intentionally using it.https://www.abc12.com/news/fentanyl-number-one-cause-of-deat...Anyway just a PSA. Curious about the toxicology report just like everyone else in the article said, but understanding how it occurs lets you read between the … lines... even when the report comes out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is probably a good reminder to anyone reading: if you can, get yourself naloxone and keep it with your first-aid supplies. You can get it without a prescription in most places, and there are many programs that will give you a few doses for free. It is easy to administer[0], and it has no effect on people without opiates in their system[1]. You may never need it, but having it handy it can mean the difference between life and death.[0]: https://www.health.ny.gov/publications/12028.pdf

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why would facebook block an open source initiative, considering that they&#39;ve contributed a ton of open source software (react, graphql, pytorch, etc)? The more simple explanation is that an automated detector misclassified the link because it shares patterns with spam links."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook is fighting against the &#34;huge target on its back&#34; effect. The bigger of an audience you are, the more interest there is in posting abusive content, whether it&#39;s spam, trolling, or something else.The result is usually that you end up digging a bigger and bigger moat around your submission and curation process, so that your service is not completely flooded with crap.I think this is what you are seeing here, rather than censorship of this specific link or cause.I once posted a URL to a forum site I was developing for a community to Facebook, and somehow it set off the spam detector. For the next several months, I would get regular notices that a comment I left on another group&#39;s discussion was marked as spam, and was not visible to anyone else. I was posting regular comments, without links, apolitical, not critical of anyone, just adding to the discussion.The notices have since stopped, but I still rarely get any response to my comments, and anything I post to my profile&#39;s feed usually gets &#34;ignored&#34; completely, while in the past I&#39;d get a pretty stable number of likes from friends (in the low double digits or high single digits.)As someone who has moderated a decent size sub-reddit in the past, I understand that there&#39;s no malicious intent on Facebook&#39;s part in this. They are just so much bigger than this one individual that they simply cannot see me, the same way I cannot see a bacteria, and may not notice a tiny gnat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Update: I&#39;m now able to post the link, I&#39;m totally sure it has NOTHING AT ALL to do with this making HN frontpage, just a funny coincidence."</p>
