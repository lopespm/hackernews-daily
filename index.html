								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I hope this article will inspire people to look at e-bikes as potentially commuter car replacement, to send Bosch and other e-bike technology manufacturers a message that if they won’t supply what people need that they are going to have to live with people hacking their stuff and to get people to comment on the way the thing works, what they would do with it and how it could be improved or how I could work better/safer on stuff like this.i bought a Onewheel-XR+ a few months ago and then found a lot of reddit threads about how the mfg DRM&#39;d the controllers to prevent people from adding longer range batteries and buildig their own apps to do diagnoatics over bluetooth. they sent cease/desists to several prominent modders.it&#39;s super sad. the modding community was very vibrant until they kneecapped it via firmware updates.their android app is bloated 42MB crap with social features that requires an internet connection and google&#39;s framework to connect over bluetooth to the board under your feet to read battery levels, change riding modes, control headlights, etc. previously there were third party apps &lt; 1mb that could be used offline for this, until they crippled everything via firmware updates.now they released their new GT boards a month ago with extended range (and much heavier). the new Pint GT looks really compelling, so really torn about giving these sh*theads more of my money :(https://old.reddit.com/r/onewheel/comments/l2vhra/future_mot...https://old.reddit.com/r/onewheel/comments/kcl816/4209_or_ne..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome project Jacques! I saw a comment of yours on an article a day or two ago and was hoping to see this pop up soon.I&#39;ve found the most difficult thing about riding an e-bike is the other motorists have no idea how to react to you. You&#39;re not really a regular bicycle anymore due to your speed, but you&#39;re also not a motorcycle that deserves its own lane. I have at least one car turn in front of me almost every trip out just because they&#39;re misjudging my speed. I get honked and yelled at when on the road because folks get frustrated when I&#39;m using the left-hand side of the right-turn lane as a bike path.Sidewalks/bike paths tend to be a lot less safe in residential areas as well, since cars coming out of their driveways really don&#39;t expect an e-bike to come rolling through. I&#39;ve learned to dramatically reduce speed in areas like this.Aside from those things, I love it! I ride the e-bike whenever I&#39;m going somewhere in range (I live in Florida so things tend to be spread out) and the weather permits. My bike gets about 80km which is more than enough for anyplace I want to go on a bicycle anyway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What bugs me is so much of our (Australia&#39;s) government&#39;s policies over time have increasingly deferred to some ISO standard or another. These days most agencies / departments are stipulating some form of ISO27k compliance from vendors, a standard that can only be purchased from ISO.Given we pay our taxes to the government, and I would have thought defining policy standards was one of the services we pay tax to have (what better thing for governments to do than what they&#39;re naturally geared towards - bureaucracy?), at the very least they would be able to directly and in detail outline the standards they expect and not simply handball the entire definition and auditing off to an international organisation and myriad consultancies with the stroke of a single bullet point requirement in the RFx.The quagmire of ISO consultancies are often charging exorbitant rates to deliver essentially a set of Excel templates, when the hard work of adopting a standard really is all in-house and any company with a copy of the standards and the templates can pretty much get it all done internally then get certified.And ultimately when it comes down to it, the standard doesn&#39;t really do much to improve quality outcomes, especially for an organisation that doesn&#39;t give a fig. A well intentioned company that&#39;s on the ball will already be following best practices, a shady company that plays cowboy will do the bare minimum to get the badge.Anyway, just an axe I tend to grind. Standards definitely are needed and have their place but holy hell is it a mess ATM. There needs to be an independent open source standards body, ISO is a farce IMHO - the standards as they are written are actually decent but their business model and hands-off approach to auditing and verifying standard adherence is a big issue across multiple sectors I think."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did recently discover that the Estonian standards agency makes ISO standards available, not for free, but significantly more cheaply than other sources I found when trying to locate standards (although I didn&#39;t end up using it so don&#39;t know any more than is on the public Web site): https://www.evs.ee/en/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"100% agree!I am very angry that standards that were paid for by taxpayers around the world were then given by governments to the ISO who then charge for very minimal work done afterwards.For example, BS3939 was created by the UK Government for electronic symbols and as far as I know, has not been updated since 1991 when an ISO document took it over. Why would they, therefore, be charging $250+ per copy for it?I think there should be a phrase like &#34;immoral bureaucracy&#34; which pertains to the extraordinary amount of money a quango burns through compared to what they actually produce. Since most ISO docs are produced by experts and not by the ISO themselves and since many of these do not change frequently, the cost is immoral imho."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are a ton of little errors in this post (at the time of my leaving this comment, of course): the variable delimiter example is missing the close _, the first word example is missing the open &#39;, and the except line 5 example is missing a space; meanwhile, these snippets will cause bad habits, such as thinking about &#34;words&#34; as &#34;things involving letters&#34;, using -r instead of -E, and a massive knowledge gap with respect to appropriate use of semicolons... I&#39;m also really confused as to why sed is suddenly &#34;s&#34; in one of the examples. This just isn&#39;t a very good reference, and I&#39;m not sure if the author thinks about how &#34;c&#34; works, but it really needs a \ afterwards, no matter what the one specific version of sed you are using might allow :/. As someone who loves sed so much he nigh unto regrets how much he uses it: &#34;beware&#34;.FWIW, I&#39;d argue that the path to true sed mastery eventually goes through the hold space, which isn&#39;t mentioned here. For some real fun, and an exercise that might change how you mentally model what sed is capable of, check out SedSokoban.https://aurelio.net/projects/sedsokoban/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really dislike sed, awk, and all these utilities because I just can’t remember how to use them. Every time I want to use one of these tools I have to relearn the stuff, and then after a while I forget how to use it. If I don’t use it all the time I just forget. I really don’t think non-interactive CLIs are a good way to do complicated tasks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice descriptions, but some of them need changes to match the command. For example:    sed &#39;1~2p&#39; file.txt #needs -n option

    s &#39;1,$ s/foo/bar/&#39; file.txt #s --&gt; sed and 1,$ --&gt; 5,$

Many commands using `-r` do not need the option for the command used (for ex: `sed -r &#39;/start/q&#39;`). Also, using `-E` is preferred instead of `-r` since some of the other implementations support this option but not `-r`.---I wrote a book on GNU sed with plenty of examples and exercises: https://github.com/learnbyexample/learn_gnused It is free to read online and there&#39;s a detailed chapter for learning BRE/ERE regex flavor as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am so happy to see the quick progress of Linux on the ARM-Macs. In the 80ies and 90ies, there were several competing processor architectures on the market, but for the last 20 years for PCs it was x86 only. With the Apple Silicon, there is now a real contender, actually surpassing the current x86 offerings in many aspects. And that is, why competition between architectures is so important. And of course just interesting from a software development perspective.With Linux becoming a viable option on those machines, they become interesting for a far wider audience than just the MacOS users. Thanks to the great work by Alyssa, GPU acceleration should be close too.Then lets see when Linus gets himself a Mac, he already indicated that he would be interested to do so as long as he doesn&#39;t have to port Linux himself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was surprised by glxgears/OpenGL running, but in a later tweet I read this:&gt; It&#39;s been running the glxgears demo (60% all-core CPU usage)Looks like it&#39;ll be a while before this thing runs Linux with anywhere near acceptable performance if glxgears still runs in software at 60% CPU."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only motivation for me to own Apple hardware in 2021 is the ability to use FOSS software in the natural habitat of Linux.I don&#39;t trust Apple&#39;s software and &#34;ideas&#34; of computing at all.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve tried to incorporate some of the ideas of the &#34;second brain&#34; and it didn&#39;t really give me that much. My lessons:1. It&#39;s always super helpful to write things down. Taking notes from what I read/learn is a great way to verify that I understand it. It sharpens my thinking.2. However, maintaining the &#34;second brain&#34; is a lot work. It&#39;s not only about &#34;linking&#34; together notes. You also need to maintain some consistency between them. I ended up spending a lot of time thinking about the structure instead of actually thinking about the content.3. Most of my notes/thoughts fall into two categories: (1) Either they are critical for something I&#39;m actively working on or (2) it&#39;s just loose concepts that I&#39;m toying with. For (1) I immediately end up playing with it in code — which is far more concrete and tangible than notes. And for (2) it was rarely important to retain the knowledge accurately many weeks/months later.What I&#39;ve ended up with is taking a lot of notes, but I hardly focus on organizing them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use textfiles...Some are lists, like todo.txtSome are individual topics, brainstorms, etc.For organizing them, I put hashtags like #food inside.Even thousands upon thousands of textfiles (which I&#39;m nowhere near) grep quickly, archive and backup quickly, and transfer to other systems quickly, without lock-in or putting my eggs into someone else&#39;s basket.I can even build my own UI on top of it... First, index them into a SQLite, then generate some HTML from it, and have a form which puts another textfile back into the directory. Best of all: the UI never changes without my consent.After getting burned repeatedly by third-party systems with stupid UI changes, data migrations, just plain shutting down, leaking my data, your version is out of date, and your OS is not compatible with our new version, and your device is not compatible with the new OS version, etc., there&#39;s no way I&#39;m using a third-party system for this ever again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently read &#34;Getting Things Done&#34;[0] and began incorporating what I learned into my simple second brain. And the results are kind of ridiculously good for me.I built my whole system on a Google Sheet, but I&#39;m experimenting with building myself an App instead- something I would never have been able to accomplish or even been willing to start if I didn&#39;t have this second brain helping me.The lessons I&#39;ve learned from this:1. Being pro-active on things instead of reactive makes everything easier. Each action takes less work because there&#39;s no worry or guilt associated with it. Just a small amount of planning to make myself pro-active is a worthy investment.2. Putting things I need to remember into a system and then forgetting about them, trusting that my system has it under control, removes a huge cognitive load from me. I have more energy to use elsewhere.3. Building a system that evolves to fit my needs, being flexible with myself, rather than trying to jam myself into someone else&#39;s system has made it work at all. That&#39;s why Google Sheets is awesome as a prototype tool for this.[0]https://gettingthingsdone.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was definitely written by a pythonist!  If I tried to write it, as a rubyist, I&#39;m sure I&#39;d get some things about python wrong.  (I find it notable how few people there are that are actually familiar with both).The standard alternative to `for` in ruby does involve `each` and blocks... but definitely doesn&#39;t involve defining a custom `each` method on your class... That is a specialty thing that most developers have probably done rarely.  Let alone defining it in terms of `for`, which is just weird!But the basic principle stated &#34;Instead of passing data back to the for loop (Python) you pass the code to the data (Ruby)&#34; -- is more or less accurate.blocks -- syntactic support in the language for cleanly passing a single in-line defined lambda/closure object as an argument -- are possibly the thing that are most special to ruby.&gt; Python builds on for-like constructs for all kinds of processing; Ruby pushes other kinds of data processing work to methods.OK, maybe, although not totally sure what you mean.&gt; Ruby keeps going with its methods-first approach, except instead of each we have a new set of methods commonly implemented on collections, as below:Um. I&#39;m not sure where the author is getting this. It is certainly possible, as shown, but definitely not common to implement `select` or `map` or other methods provided by Enumerable directly on your custom class. It is a bit more common to implement `each` alone and let the `Enumerable` mixin provide the rest.  But even that I&#39;m not sure how &#34;common&#34; I&#39;d call it.&gt; Ruby, however, inverts this. Ruby puts object-orientation as the foundation of the pyramid. Ruby contains the messy procedural world in blocks, letting objects work with those procedural blocks.OK, true. The author is getting the details wrong, but I guess their overall picture is still right?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While people have pointed out that this is not idiomatic:  class Stuff
    def initialize
      @a_list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    end

    def each
      for item in @a_list
        yield item
      end
    end
  end

I haven&#39;t seen anyone point out the deepest reason why: unlike in many languages, “for” is not a basic, low-level construct in Ruby, it is  syntax sugar. That is:  for x in y
    x.stuff
    more_stuff
  end

is sugar for:  y.each do |x|
    x.stuff
    more_stuff
  end

(Also, for quite a long time, for...in also had runtime overhead , so it was slower syntactic sugar.)for...in is rarely used (it is syntactic sugar that is neither more concise bor more specific in intent, but more familiar to people with experience in non-Ruby languages), and mostly on scripts that consume but don’t implement collections. If you are getting deep enough to be implementing an #each method for a custom collection, that&#39;s an odd place to use for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For me, its the explicitness in Python that is killer.  I can see a name and match that to an import and match that to a package.  Grabbing a function pointer works exactly as I would expect.Stealing from Krister Stendahl&#39;s laws for religious discourse, Ruby&#39;s composable iteration is one area I have holy envy, particularly after I got used to it in Rust.  I&#39;ve used Python&#39;s generators many times just to have to switch to an explicit for loop.  Things are generally better with a composable iteration model but occasionally I find myself switching to explicit loops in Rust.Unlike Ruby, Rust does pull-iteration like Python, though there are experiments with Ruby-style push-iteration [0] [1].[0] https://github.com/AndWass/pushgen[1] https://epage.github.io/blog/2021/07/pushgen-experiment/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting, but always calibrate their claims against the fact this is about the tenth time this movement has come around. This movement literally goes back to COBOL. That is not a typo. It&#39;s not only likely older than you are, but probably much older than you are.I recognize COBOL may not seem like &#34;no-code&#34;, but that&#39;s just because &#34;no-code&#34; is a stupid label. &#34;No-code&#34; doesn&#39;t mean &#34;no code&#34; just like &#34;serverless&#34; still runs on a server.I would say the main problem with the no-code hype is the idea that it is a leader. It is not. It is a follower. &#34;Normal&#34; code goes out, hammers things out over the course of literally decades, and then, when it has finally settled what the best couple of ways to do something is, it&#39;s finally time for the &#34;no code&#34; solutions to come in and systematize that for a larger audience. Nothing wrong with that. Power to the people and all that.It just goes wrong when no-code advocates put the cart in front of the horse and make grandiose claims about replacing all developers or something. That&#39;s not the direction the stream flows in. No-code can&#39;t operate without the &#34;normal&#34; developers doing immense amounts of work charting the territory and building the infrastructure to get there. There is no chance of them displacing &#34;normal&#34; software developers; they are structurally incapable of it. Woe unto the no-code startup that doesn&#39;t understanding this dynamic, and foolishly tries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an imperfect analogy, but consider for a moment the role Microsoft Excel plays.Excel allows non-coders to do many useful things, and provides a relatively gentle on-ramp to actual code via formulas. If you take that on-ramp and keep going, towards VBA and add-ins and other pieces of Microsoft technology, you might wind up becoming a full-time software developer, leaving Excel behind and using “real” tools.Now, there’s a happy path and an unhappy path here.The happy path is that you use Excel for what it’s good at, but recognize when you are operating at its limits, and at that point pivot into “real” software engineering tools.The unhappy path is that you stick with Excel too long and become mired in the world of VBA and advanced formulas and attempts at shared workbooks, and build pseudo-database application-contraptions.No-code can be like that early Excel usage: it can grant some limited but useful powers to non-developers. But no-code can also evolve to become like those contorted, unmaintainable spreadsheet monstrosities that stretch the technology far beyond the point where some “real” software engineering would have been the right answer.Short version: use the right tool for the job."</p>

I probably still suck.Having said that, I have been working with Microsoft PowerAutomate for the past 1.5 years and while it has saved a lot of time and been overall a good experience, there are times when the no code/low code gets in the way and I wish I could just &#34;drop into code&#34; to get something done. Examples are things like data validation. 
This technology is not going to replace coding, the paradigm shift is really happening for people in the marketing and sales operations parts of the business. For these folks, this tech is life changing.
In a lot of ways, this tech felt like when you try a new framework in your language of choice; at first it&#39;s super easy and you get hyped, and then you hit a requirement where the nocode/lowcode environment really gets in the way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"He leaves behind a complicated legacy. It&#39;s important to note that credible allegations of domestic abuse lead him to sell SA in the past year, and this can&#39;t be set aside.At the same time, SA&#39;s influence on the modern internet can&#39;t be understated. The &#39;image macro&#39; of early SA (maybe created by Lowtax himself, from what Fragmaster says in his video in the link) is the direct ancestor of today&#39;s common meme image--impact font text over a silly image, easily accessible to anyone who wants to post it.Many of today&#39;s well-known internet comedians and writers grew up with the site. And it&#39;s hard to estimate how big the impact (positive or negative) of things like ADTRW leading to 4chan have been, not to mention things like the rise of Let&#39;s Play videos, or the creation and eventual shutdown of BitTorrent Barnyard (and its ensuing spinoffs).The site itself still remains one of the last vestiges of the old internet--one of the few sites that both survived and managed not sell out and go headlong into monetization--and as a result, is one of the last sites on the modern internet that (maybe ironically) is not entirely awful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t a joke; I had actually scheduled a lunch with Lowtax for this Saturday.  Despite a (let&#39;s call it) checkered past, I was extremely excited to meet him, since he&#39;s been a huge influence to my sense of humor and Something Awful was really important to me as a teenager.-------I had found him on LinkedIn a few weeks ago, and simply sent a message explaining that I&#39;m a fan, would love a chance to buy him lunch and chat about Something Awful and Gaming Garbage.  To my surprise, he responded back with &#34;sure, I&#39;d be up for it&#34;.I responded back with &#34;How does early December sound to you? something on the order of December 11?&#34;His response was &#34;shit I dont even know if I&#39;ll still be alive then&#34;.  This response was a little weird, but this isn&#39;t exactly &#34;off brand&#34; humor for Lowtax, so I ignored it.I then say something to the effect of &#34;how about something along the lines of November 13?&#34;, which he said was better. He then said &#34;and you have my permission to stab me&#34;.  Again, not off brand for Lowtax.I bought a plane ticket to Kansas City, was ready to fly out this friday.  But I had this deep feeling in my stomach that what he was saying wasn&#39;t just a joke.  It&#39;s pretty well documented that he&#39;s been depressed, and I dunno, upon re-reading his messages a hundred times I got a dark feeling that these might be kind of bad omens. What exactly do I do with this?  I discussed it with my wife and a friend, who weren&#39;t sure what the best solution was, and I ultimately decided not to say anything.  I figured I&#39;m just some dork who stalked him on LinkedIn, and I was afraid that if I said anything he would think I&#39;m weird and cancel our lunch date.And now this shit happened. He finally did it, and now the thought keeps playing in my brain of &#34;what if I had said something a few weeks ago?&#34; I know I don&#39;t owe him anything, but I can&#39;t help but have this repeated feeling of &#34;I valued an opportunity to meet my man-crush more than I valued someone showing suicidal tendencies,&#34; and it makes me feel downright rotten. That&#39;s not the kind of person I want to be, and it makes me feel legitimately sick that that&#39;s how my brain decided to work.At some logical level I know none of this is my fault really; realistically even if I had said something, I doubt much would have changed, and I doubt I had enough there to get him committed or anything, but there&#39;s a difference between logically knowing something and feeling something.As it stands, I think there&#39;s a reasonably good chance that I will feel partly responsible for this for the rest of my life.  This sucks.--------RIP Rich.  I know you had a rough last couple years, you were the definition of a &#34;complicated person&#34;, and despite everything you will be missed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to visit SA regularly. A lot of the humor was tasteless, but nowhere near the level of the chans. I avoided the forums, and only read the front page stuff.What kept me coming, was that they were amazing writers (it wasn’t just him -or he wrote under several nom de plumes).His essays, done in the style of famous writers, and deadpan humor, where a story seemed serious, up until the point that you suddenly realize you’re being punked, were masterful.But it sounds like his personal life was a disaster. I have known a number of folks like that. In most cases, I always hoped that, one day, they would “come out of the cesspool,” and start to realize their potential (I have also known a number of folks that did that, too). In my experience, these people were absolutely miserable, and difficult to be around. I only ever saw his creative output, so had no other stake in his personal life.I wish his exes and children the best. It sounds like they may need it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This seems to be kind of a complex topic, with a number of variables.
Here is a study:How physical text layout affects reading from screen
https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220208446_How_physi...A quote from the Discussion section:
&#34;Most of the studies on line length report faster
reading with longer lines, and point to the number of
characters as the variable responsible for the differences, rather than physical line length (visual angle).&#34;The OP thinks that humans read thinner columns faster. Generally, this seems not to be the case, so maybe we should treat his main conclusion with some skepticism. In any case, it&#39;s probably best to refer to the scientific literature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thinner columns allow for more of a &#34;Z&#34; pattern of reading, where you can kind of scan-read backwards when your eye scans back to the left, as opposed to the standard &#34;E&#34; style of reading of reading an entire line, returning to the left, then moving to the next and repeating.Writing in thin columns allows you to keep an eye on what you just wrote more easily as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Column width has always affected my writting. The line breaks can hide some flow issues where punctuation might be necessary. For this reason I write on three emacs windows with different widths: one as narrow as suggested by OP, one more or less at target printer width, and one in between."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Hook with sites like Reddit, HN, etc is that they ARE addictive. Actually addictive in the sense of gambling. In gambling addiction the gamblers aren&#39;t addicted to winning, they are addicted to losing, or &#34;almost winning&#34;. Now if they never ever won the addiction wouldn&#39;t form. If they ALWAYS won the addiction also wouldn&#39;t form.The old thing was email that people were addicted to checking because you MIGHT get an interesting email. It&#39;s the same way with training a dog. You don&#39;t always give them a treat for behavior. If you only randomly give them a treat they are more likely to perform the behavior because they don&#39;t want to miss the reward. If they know they will get the reward then they know the exact opportunity cost and can weigh that against performing the behavior.That&#39;s how social media and more specifically sites like reddit and HN are addictive.I think we all feel that we occasionally get some beneficial information from them. I know I do, and even this very post I feel has some benefit. But we also see it as time wasting because the majority of the time, that&#39;s what it is.But we are compelled to continually check because of the fear of missing out on some piece of beneficial information. If we were always presented with good information then we could more easily delay checking the sites."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you have such a hard time not reading reddit or hackernews maybe the correct conclusion is not that you&#39;re &#39;wasting&#39; time but that there&#39;s something enjoyable about so called low quality or idle activities and that they&#39;re normal part of a healthy life.I think it&#39;s deeply ironic that people will judge videogames on that basis but then to proceed to gamify and min-max their entire life because of this rat race mentality. If you think that kind of stuff is meaningless when it turns up as a hobby the correct conclusion is probably to not structure your entire personality that way.Just be less judgmental with yourself. things don&#39;t need to be highbrow or particularly meaningful to be a good use of time. It&#39;s mostly just a cultural artifact of our time that puts ripped busybodies and entrepreneurs, and celebs and intellectuals on pedestals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facing a very similar issue and trying similar things unsuccessfully, I&#39;ve found out lately with my coach that a more promising way to break out of the cycle of &#34;wasting time&#34; and beating myself up over it might be very counter-intuitive: Self-acceptance.I&#39;ve found that acknowledging my need for relaxation and satisfying my curiosity was a solid first step in helping cure my addiction on a more fundamental level.Changing my own internal reaction to realizing I spent the last 30 minutes on Reddit from self-punishment to &#34;Oh, interesting. Looks like I needed a bit of a pressure vent from the complex work I&#39;m doing. I&#39;m worth that. Is there anything even better I could do to myself so I can relax more effectively with quality time off?&#34; at least to me was a way better way to deal with it.I wouldn&#39;t say I&#39;m &#34;cured&#34;, but I spend way less time with these things, more time I would define qualitatively highly (like playing some piano, walking or just dozing a few minutes).Stopping the internal conflict from the other end might be worth a try for you too, even if it sounds weird."</p>
