								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who grew up in Eastern Europe in the early 2000s, with a a taste for Western media, especially movies, and the Internet becoming a widespread thing, it was infuriating waiting for movies to come to theaters months behind the rest of the world. Not to mention the horrible country specific posters and advertising, limited availability and titles. Piracy was the only option.It felt like the Internet would solve all these problems, like you&#39;d be able to experience culture from any part of the world however you liked and at the same time as the rest of the world. Sadly that never happened. It&#39;s much better now but it still feels like the media is crippled by old local distributor deals. The fact that e.g. Netflix offers different movies for every country is something that honestly does not make any sense yet everyone accepts it.When I got my first Kindle 12 years ago my Amazon account was registered with my local European address so the books available in store were all complete trash romance pulp novels. Once I simply changed my home address to some random location in New York I suddenly had access to hundreds of thousands more titles. The Internet never delivered on its promise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was born and raised in an African country. My father had a salary of 500$ a month. I could never afford a 50$ book about resiliency engineering or about Java Concurrency when I was 17 years old, neither could my father.The reason I love computer science and tech and excel at some parts of it, is simply because I could access any book, pirated. I have a huge will to learn, and piracy was quite literally the only means to learn. Once I worked and got on my feet, I started buying a lot of the books that marked my learning (because nostalgia and also great resources), and if and when I can, I always buys the books.Let&#39;s not talk about movies. My town STILL has no cinema. Nearest one is 100Km away, and costs about 15$ for a ticket. So if it wasn&#39;t for piracy, I would&#39;ve probably never watched Iron Man, and never dreamed of having my own Jarvis, and hence never taking up speech recognition and deep learning. Again, now that I can, I had periods where I watched 3 to 5 movies a week in the cinema, because I have the means to.I believe people are more likely to buy books/movies when they can. But for those who can&#39;t, I believe it&#39;s almost always a net positive to society to give them access to those resources."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I grew up poor in Eastern Europe. Very poor, in fact. Without piracy I probably wouldn’t ever have been able to learn English, find my passion and make it in life. And not just for monetary reasons but due to access as well. Ironically enough the Internet never mattered too much because we were able to get what we wanted hand to hand. The 56k modem was completely useless when your friend had a zip drive with the games you drooled over. But it taught me to appreciate things. Even today I love physical copies of things, it is like a little trophy to the thing I love.My biggest problem nowadays is not that I can’t afford the things I love but that there is hardly anything I actually want. But when I do I often get multiple copies, whether it is on different platforms or to share the joy with friends.That being said the effects of piracy are both severe and negligible due to the quality. While it probably doesn’t affect big corporations at all, the small indie people sometimes suffer catastrophically from it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been in the aquarium hobby in the past, so when I started looking into hydroponics, for me the natural outcome was to also look into aquaponics[1].What I like the most about aquaponics (and recirculating hydroponics) is the sustainability aspects, it is an almost completely closed-loop system, with relatively small external inputs compared to other farming methods, and extremely small water requirements (due to the fact that water is continuously recycled).Two bits of info about aquaponics that not many people know:1. it is possible to have aquaponics systems in a vegetarian context: in many cases the fish is not for human consumption as food (in large commercial systems this is usually koi that is sold as ornamental fish[2a], in smaller systems goldfish kept as pets[2b]).2. there are aquaponics systems that don&#39;t require access to electricity, in particular the iAVS system (a.k.a &#34;sandponics&#34;) was developed with subsistence farmers that had no electricity access in mind, it doesn&#39;t require water to be pumped continuously, rather you are only required to manually recirculate the water a few times a day which can be achieved with a bucket or other low tech solutions[3].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aquaponics[2a] https://www.pvrkoicentre.com/pages/aquaponics[2b] https://farmingaquaponics.com/caring-for-goldfish-in-aquapon...[3] https://garydonaldson.net/home/iavs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hydro doesn’t taste as good as organic, and it needs to be flushed or you ingest a lot of nitrates, which is likely carcinogenic. Flushing requires careful planning and a system designed for it. You can’t just treat it like a fridge full of food. With soil you can just leave stuff in the ground until you want to eat it.I’ve poured a lot of time and money into the hobby, and have settled on organic soil with some simple drip for indoor growing.The water use is about the same. As long as you’re indoor the water has nowhere to runoff/evaporate to.IMO the benefits of hydro/Aquaponics are nonexistent. Also, the whole system is a pile of plastics. The tote and drain pipe in the linked article are not food grade plastic, which would scare me away from this system.The automation is way way way overkill. Hydro is very easy to tweak. The nutrient profile is a tiny percentage of the labor, and a $3 battery operated temp/humidity display is plenty for keeping things nice for the plants. They show the high and low since last reset, which is all you need.If I had any outdoor space with good sun I would set up a greenhouse, but since I don’t have that I run leds directly off of solar panels on my roof (dc-dc step ups and downs as needed).Kind of cool to see them rise and set with the sun."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is obviously nothing less than astounding. I can’t start to describe how incredibly knowledgeable and skilled this person is.Because the topic of hydro and growing food and all that is on HN here, I wanted to leave the following comment on a higher level.Ten years ago I was super dedicated to problems surrounding water, which of course include food and all the issues we have with our food systems. At the pinnacle, I was working with a half acre aquaponics greenhouse in Watsonville, CA. We had 8000 striped bass and produced and incredible amount of fresh produce. It was pesticide free because of you put chemicals on the plants it would get into the water and hurt the fish.It was more “natural” than hydroponics. You weren’t using fertilizer imported from all over, everything in the system could be produced on-site. The more biologically diverse the system was, the more resilient and productive.Both hydro and aqua phonics - the latter of which has been practiced for thousands of years, definitely save a ton of water. But I think aquaponics has a massive chance of being mainstream, especially as automation and all the advanced tech and robots get better.It’s about ecological engineering on a local scale - you are maxing out the ecology to human and nature’s benefit, and there are so many relationships to learn and exploit.It’s strange how impactful this could be on a grand scale - see some Dan barber Ted talks [1]Just really need to get some investment on this on a big scale, like the hydro houses in Canada. No one has, from all that I know, really built aquaponic systems on a grand scale that are economically viable. But I see it coming and after I wrap up my current company, I’m jumping right back in to working on this.We are just going to be doing what nature did best before we murdered all of it…but maybe Mac it out super hard and super quick compared to what it could do.Lastly, with all the climate stuff: Don’t forget, you can’t put a price on the systems that produce the food, water and clean air we breath, cuz you know, we’d be dead. Well maybe we can, but we sure aren’t trying.[1] https://www.ted.com/talks/dan_barber_how_i_fell_in_love_with..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently bought a set of 360 watt panels from LG and not more than a couple months later they came about with 400 watt panels in the same form factor (40” x 66”).  Even though that can be frustrating, I am glad the tech is improving at a good clip.While we wait for sorely needed battery cost reductions, it’s good to look at areas where we can ‘make hay while the sun is shining’.  For example, train ML models during sunny days.  Other industries might be aluminum, desalination, ice making (i.e. cooling), and other production (ideas welcome)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope these get cheap enough that every house in the tropics gets them on their rooves. AC is going to become essential as temperatures rise, the grid can&#39;t support the load, and we can&#39;t afford to power all those ACs with fossil fuel. Solar powered AC seems like the most reliable way to survive a severe heatwave like the one described in the opening chapter of The Ministry of the Future: https://www.orbitbooks.net/orbit-excerpts/the-ministry-for-t...You can&#39;t rely on the underprovisioned grid in a scenario like that, especially since the heatwave will likely drive the power plants themselves out of their operating range. Solar seems like the only way. Its intermittency is a problem on general, but clouds that would disrupt the power would also stop the heat."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;Big Pharma&#34; in the eyes of the public is two related but separate issues; 1) the weird employment-insurance-hospital loop that has developed in the US, and the terrible second-order-consequences of all the open-high/settle-low insurer&lt;-&gt;carer system it led to, and 2) the medicine advertisements, and all the terrible consequences thereof.The second one seems like a much easier thing to get rid of using hard government power, and should be the low-hanging fruit.The first will require a decade of masterful leadership, co-operation from competing interests, and delicate undoing over time that I don&#39;t think any country in the west has right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A company which only hires junior developers is not a company that values quality development practices and it cannot expect to get stuff done on time, let alone with high quality and industry&#39;s best practices... not that junior developers cannot be good (with proper guidance they can be awesome), but without experienced people around to guide them, and without them having experience of their own, they are bound to make every possible mistake in the book no matter how smart.The people running the company were playing with fire and they must either be too junior themselves to understand that, or they were just knowingly doing so and hoping to get whatever product MVP they had planned as quickly as possible with the minimum amount of expenses possible.Don&#39;t feel bad for being fired from such a company. It might have been the best thing to happen to you because now you get the opportunity of getting a proper job where you might actually have experienced people to mentor you and  help you become a great developer and professional.With that said: next time a CTO asks you to create something in a month for a demo, just go ahead and implement a mock (no DB, no error handling, just happy path code) that&#39;s just about enough for the demo, nothing else. Make it clear to the person who is going to run the demo that this is not the real deal, and arrange for only the happy path to be followed in the demo (add a few safeguards just in case so if the person does something unexpected you just ignore it, never crash!). You could have probably pulled that off in a couple of days :D but yeah, you probably thought you needed to have the real final product ready otherwise it wouldn&#39;t be demo-able... Trust me, that&#39;s almost certainly not the case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a similar story but since it wasn&#39;t an internship and I had about 5 years experience in far better companies, I reacted with relief that I got out. I only stayed in the company for 2 weeks in which the CEO and his wife, who was the COO, yelled at me multiple times. I was yelled at for not understanding the code base and delivering a feature within 3 days of joining, trying to relax in my chair when they were talking, using their stash of tissue paper cause they didn&#39;t bother keeping some in the bathroom for wiping your hands etc. In retrospect I wonder how I even got through those 2 weeks without quitting on the second day. I just stopped showing up and the CEO came to my house, banged on my door to try and get me to delete their crappy code written by a mountain of interns from my personal laptop. I pretended I wasn&#39;t home and we later had a call where I deleted it all. I also wasn&#39;t paid for the time I worked there. Everyone who wasn&#39;t me was pretty much an intern writing awful code because they really didn&#39;t know any betterUnlike here I have no qualms about naming and shaming praktice.ai"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem is really simple.I know this may sound contentious, so read carefully.Junior developers, BY DEFINITION, cannot be trusted with important projects. If you do, you are responsible if something fails, not the developer.By &#34;important&#34; I mean anything that may significantly impact company. If you would fire for it then it is important.By &#34;cannot be trusted&#34; I don&#39;t mean they can&#39;t do it. Maybe they can, maybe they can&#39;t. You need to have somebody experienced to make sure there is no technical surprises, that you are getting what you think you are getting and that you will get feedback if something is not happening right.My personal distinction between senior and junior developers is whether they can be trusted with important projects. A senior person is somebody who is experienced enough, intelligent enough and mature enough to recognize something is not right and come back to you for direction.I work with a lot of people who get a label of &#34;senior&#34; but are not. This is a problem.It is interesting, that at one known company people who can be trusted with important projects are called &#34;officers&#34;. So basically you have junior developers, senior developers and officers. I guess &#34;senior&#34; is given just to pacify developers who would be called junior with a lot of years of experience but &#34;officer&#34; as a real recognition of maturity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been programming since 1977/78, and sometimes for work, but most of the time for fun. As someone who does technical work at heights with rope access, and many years of technical diving on hydraulics, pneumatic, and electrical equipment, I can say it all depends on your ability to shut out interruptions and get to a good stopping point. I get frustrated when I am programming and I am interrupted, but my most frustrating experience was troubleshooting a technical issue at heights, underwater, or on the deck during a show with almost 2000 patrons getting impatient, while a COO/CFO wants an estimate on when you will solve the as-yet-unidentified issue. They call the show off if you can&#39;t get an estimate to repair or resume after 15 min. and they expect you to hold to your time-to-repair or resume estimate. Oh, and half a million to one million USD are at stake! You might be standing in front of a controls cabinet with hundreds of wires and devices and some indications of where to look, or 10m underwater trying to find a source of the fault. I think interruptions suck for any person who is focused on doing a good job - bus drivers, pilots (yes, I know - autopilot!), soldiers in combat, air traffic controllers, chefs, almost any job. This is why I never took a job coding full time. It is always secondary to my actual job even if it is important. And, I like J and APL for the very reason that you are looking at a few lines of code vs. a few pages of for loops ;)I code in C and other languages as well, so no offense to those who work mainly with scalars ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The example I like to use is sudoku. Often, after a day of programming, it takes me a while to &#34;come out of it&#34; and I explain that to my SO as if she&#39;d been doing hours of sudoku and then had to jump into a social situation.Similarly, if you are interrupted in the middle of a &#34;solve&#34; it may be difficult to jump back in - especially if the puzzle hasn&#39;t been created correctly and you are trying to &#34;debug&#34; which numbers conflict. Some puzzles are harder than others. At times you don&#39;t have a pen and paper so you have to keep a mental model of the whole puzzle in your head which makes an interruption that much more jarring.Not a perfect analogy, but close enough to get me a 15 minute buffer at the end of the day and fewer knocks on the office door :D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interruptions are very challenging with any deep work that takes hours. This is true.What I am facing however, is a related issue. Perhaps because I have not been doing much programming lately, I find it increasingly difficult to actually get and be in the zone. When I go in, I go all in, and enter a kind of fugue state where the hours slip away. While for some this may sound advantageous, in the past, it has been associated with some bad physical and psychological health outcomes. Now, I actually have anxiety about going into such a state, and try to piece meal my problems, and focus on the non-programming work and thinking.Situations change, and I am about to be in one where I do really need to perform a lot of coding myself. I suppose I am answering my own question, but I need to split up my work and take notes to reduce the numbers of abstracted layers upon which I am working. Take more breaks with confidence I can return.I suspect this technique can help ease the burdens of interruptions as well, but it does come at a cost in time. For me, the severe crunch time requirements and gained insane last minute skills should still be less necessary for some time. This is likely called being in a startup and getting older and, well, recognizing long-term limitations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We really need an alternative to YouTube. But&gt; When you publish with Streambus, you create a website, on your own domain name. Reach your audience over RSS on the podcast apps they already have on their phone.This is the problem with most other current alternatives: no discoverability. YouTube has no serious competitors because it has significantly more viewers and creators. If I use Streambus, how will I get others to see my content? If I want to find new stuff on Streambus, where do I see others&#39; streams?IMO any serious contender for YouTube would need:- People using it
- Decent recommendation algorithm - for all the hate YouTube gets, I&#39;ve seen worse
- Decent moderation. YouTube is too severe, yes, but you really don&#39;t want hate speech and shady stuff on your site, and especially recommended. It will scare everyone away. And copyrighted stuff will get you into legal trouble"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure how well known it is, but YouTube itself has an RSS feed for each channel (well, Atom feed, most feed readers treat them interchangeably).https://www.youtube.com/feeds/videos.xml?channel_id=XXWhere XX is the channel ID (the last component in the URL when you go to a channel).It&#39;s actually how I consume YouTube these days.  It&#39;s a slightly orthogonal problem to the solution posted here, since it doesn&#39;t follow the RSS &#34;enclosure&#34; spec.  Though my feedreader knows enough to call youtube-dl on these URLs, which is fragile at best, but works for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yep, &#34;vodcast&#34; used to be a word in regular use, referring to RSS feeds of videos/eposides often provided by TV channels for episodes of their content.Now that RSS has been effectively killed, this word/concept has disappeared without trace."</p>
