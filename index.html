								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Almost all children are born hypermetropic (far-sighted). The growth of the eyeball is calibrated by the amount of defocus (blur) experienced. More defocus, more growth, which reduces hypermetropia.My hypothesis is that less sunlight means wider pupils and more defocus (contrast to a pinhole camera), so more eye growth.Even with perfect eyesight, there&#39;s a 2-diopter difference between focussing blue light and red light due to chromatic aberration. Only narrow pupils can reduce this blur in white light.I&#39;m also curious whether older TVs with big blurry pixels (or low res images upscaled and smeared onto newer screens) trigger the same mechanism. These days I certainly feel physically uncomfortable looking at media like that, like my eyes aren&#39;t focussing quite right.The other problem is that once eyes have grown too long and are myopic (near-sighted) they experience even more defocus and grow more. See for example [1] which discusses how under-correction of myopia accelerates progression.[1] https://reviewofmm.com/does-the-undercorrection-of-myopia-in..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wore glasses for a few years in high school because I had trouble seeing the blackboard from anywhere but the front row. I started hiking and kayaking every day, especially in places where I could see for many miles. I also migrated from CRT to LCD to LED screens, and more recently to e-ink devices when possible. Very fine print in a dark space is hard to read, but I can read a moving US license plate from six blocks away. Yesterday I recognized a friend a mile and a half away by their paddle-stroke. I am able to differentiate a bald eagle from an osprey at two miles based on the shape of the wings, and see a fish in talons at about a mile. (Friday I observed an osprey dive, catch a fish, head towards the nest, then get chased for thirty minutes by a bald eagle. Nasty, opportunistic birds, bald eagles. I get why Benjamin Franklin held them in such contempt. I lost the pair when they went behind a mountain about three miles away.) In speaking with ophthalmologists, there is wide support for my hypothesis that the near-daily outdoor activity and frequent change of focal distance–from a nautical chart on my foredeck to the bow wave of a tanker eight miles out–has preserved and likely improved my vision. The data: 20/20 in primary school, 20/23 in high school, 20/20 during my higher education, and 20/13 and improving as I approach retirement. A fun trick is to describe an approaching vessel before others have seen it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My child is following in my footsteps and has been prescribed glasses for nearsightedness. Her optometrist told us she should be watching TV rather than reading books. This was both surprising and upsetting, especially since she loves reading.This lead me on an interesting  deep dive into existing research. What surprised me were the massive gaps in understanding. Scientist have at best established correlation between close up work and nearsightedness, and a negative correlation with spending time outside. The actual mechanism in play is unknown, for example the theories about sunlight are still untested. The specific types of close up work that cause issues is unknown. Some scientists have proposed that it&#39;s the contrast between white pages and black text that actually causes issues with reading.My conclusion was that anyone who confidently asserts that $x causes nearsightedness is wrong (this thread is a case in point)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is kind of cool, but I&#39;m skeptical that these sort of planes will ever be practical as much more than rich people toys.  The power density of even speculative near-future batteries favors small airplanes and short flights.  This doesn&#39;t really mesh into the existing aviation industry, so proponents of these small electric planes usually propose creating new markets entirely; e.g. Uber for Helicopters.  But I&#39;m pretty skeptical that laws will allow regular operation of these in residential neighborhoods for long, if at all.Also, where is the vertical stabilizer and rudder?  I assume they&#39;re using differential thrust in powered flight, but what if they lose power?  Can this plane be controlled in a glide?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m skeptical.They&#39;re claiming they&#39;ll be able to store 300kWh of energy on board. That&#39;s the equivalent of about 4 Tesla Model Y cars. Even if they could pack this much energy on board, flying that much weight 200km is almost certainly going to take more than 300kWh, especially with 7 passengers.Lilium is very proud of their ducted fan designs and their power usage profiles -- and they should be! -- but they&#39;re counting on advancements in battery tech that are unlikely to happen in the timeframe they need. It&#39;s much more likely they will be limited to 100km range or 30-minute flights at a maximum when reserves are factored in.This says nothing about how fast they can recharge those massive batteries. If they have the equivalent of four Tesla superchargers available they can probably recharge completely in 40 minutes or so, which is probably good enough. But that charging infrastructure needs to be in place at virtually every pad where the plane lands, so the &#34;ordinary helipads&#34; they brag about using are not going to work without roughly a $million of power infrastructure upgrades at each. If they try to go cheap on this, they will have to live with multi-hour recharge times."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fortunately this is a bit less relevant today as Windows loses market share in database and server applications, but:UUIDs have historically massively screwed up endian handling. While this new draft discusses sorting UUIDs as strings of octets (bytes) and the text of RFC4122 is fairly explicit about most significant bytes coming first, the C UUID structure in RFC 4122 appendix A is entirely misguided:    typedef struct {
        unsigned32  time_low;
        unsigned16  time_mid;
        unsigned16  time_hi_and_version;
        unsigned8   clock_seq_hi_and_reserved;
        unsigned8   clock_seq_low;
        byte        node[6];
    } uuid_t;

Those aren’t bytes — they’re integers of various sizes. (Hint: do not use integer types in C code for portable data structures. ntohl, etc are a mess. Just use arrays of bytes.)I don’t know the whole history, but MS somehow took this structure at face value and caused problems like this:https://github.com/uuid-rs/uuid/issues/277So, if you want to do anything (e.g. sorting) that depends on the representation of a UUID (or even depends on converting between string and binary representations), be aware that UUIDs coming from Windows may be little-endian.  In my book, this is a Windows bug, but opinions may differ here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to be a big proponent of using UUIDs for database PKs but I&#39;ve found them inherently difficult to work with.  It&#39;s much easier to remember/recognize an integer based PK when troubleshooting a data problem.This isn&#39;t to say you shouldn&#39;t use UUIDs at all, but I much prefer to use an &#34;ExternalId&#34; column of UUID type if you don&#39;t want to expose your integer based PKs externally."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using ULID for a while now, which analogous to UUID v7 but with a different (better IMHO) string representation. They&#39;ve been awesome for using as sort keys in dynamo for instance, since they&#39;re lexicographically sortable as strings.But one thing I&#39;m still wary about is exposing these IDs with millisecond-precision time components to end users, since I&#39;ve seen multiple discussions here on HN about the potential for timing attacks.How worried should I really be? Do people have useful heuristics on the kinds of data where it&#39;s safe/unsafe to expose timing information, or should I just only expose a separate UUID v4 externally across the board just to be safe?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello. I made this. I&#39;m a bit shocked at how many people are getting things wrong and taking things out of context, so perhaps I could answer some questions.To clarify: I have not been with MIT in years. I was paid the minimum hourly rate (roughly $14 an hour) to work on a related project during my undergraduate years, which eventually evolved into this project years down the road. (In fact, I had to pay for my own compute to get my work started - MIT never offered me any credits.) Everything else has been paid out of pocket since then. Yes, it does indeed cost several thousands of dollars a month - that is not an exaggeration. This has been optimized so many times that the technology needs to improve first before I can cut down on costs.The timer in the &#34;TOS&#34; was put there in hopes that people could understand where I was coming from in regards to misappropriating this kind of research. I did not expect people to get this riled up over a 10 second timer. (Especially not on Hacker News, of all places...)Edit: I suppose it makes sense to include other information in this post so that others don&#39;t have to go hunting for my comments in this thread:- &gt;This is unrelated but what&#39;s with the fascination with HN users and My Little Pony? I&#39;ve noticed this on a lot of posts in the past few months.- Twilight Sparkle&#39;s voice is indispensable in getting emotional contextualizers to work properly. The logo and profile picture is an homage to that fact.- &gt;But seriously: how did you get the domain `15.ai`?- I purchased it. It was definitely not cheap.- &gt;They named their tts &#34;Deep Throat&#34;? Why would you?- It was a suggestion from a Twitter user, and I found it clever.- &gt;I heavily doubt it&#39;s &#34;several thousands of dollars&#34;...- It is indeed several thousands of dollars a month. I can show you AWS invoices, if you&#39;re skeptical. Just send me an email and I&#39;d be happy to show proof.- &gt;The disclaimer is a little ironic considering the site owner doesn’t own the model (MIT does) and doesn’t own the training data (the various shows and games do)- I&#39;m sorry to tell you that I do, in fact, own my own model. I have not been with MIT in years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; DeepThroat (/ˈdēpˌTHrōt/): Natural emotive high-fidelity text-to-speech synthesis with minimal viable dataShut up and take my money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool. It&#39;s a text-to-speech and the gist seems to be that they synthesize it from only a little audio.The results are clearly synthetic and need work. However what&#39;s cool is that there are a ton of characters (from popular shows and video games) and there are useful statistics like inferred emotion (which is also in the output).Honestly it&#39;s a big problem how a lot of AIs are like &#34;black boxes&#34; where you really can&#39;t customize or see anything. Yeah we have DALL-E and GPT which can generate text images but the lack of customization or fine-tuning the image afterwards severely hinders what&#39;s possible with them. Ultimately what you want is something interactive, where you can control how much or little the AI generates, and give it really specific criterion.But seriously: how did you get the domain `15.ai`?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to work for an expert witness who testified on valuations in IP infringement cases. I really lost faith in the way the US handles IP infringement in that job. I know patents are contentious in tech, but sometimes I think copyright is just as bad. I know it&#39;s not a popular opinion, but seeing how things actually play out really made me feel for defendants in those cases.Regardless of what you think of the effectiveness of IP protection, the way damages are calculated (and ultimately determined by courts) is just awful. I haven&#39;t looked at the specifics of that $65M calculation, but if the real number were closer to $650k I wouldn&#39;t be surprised-- 2 orders of magnitude was a pretty typical spread between plaintiff and defendant expert witnesses&#39; valuations in the IP cases I worked on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry for the somewhat obvious reference, but I thought that The Right to Read by Richard Stallman [1] would probably have predicted something similar. Of course, it had:    There were ways, of course, to get around the SPA and Central
    Licensing. They were themselves illegal. Dan had had a classmate in
    software, Frank Martucci, who had obtained an illicit debugging tool,
    and used it to skip over the copyright monitor code when reading
    books. But he had told too many friends about it, and one of them
    turned him in to the SPA for a reward (students deep in debt were
    easily tempted into betrayal). In 2047, Frank was in prison, not for
    pirate reading, but for possessing a debugger.


People may quibble about the specifics here &#34;It&#39;s a game, not a book&#34;, but to me it honestly sounds like we are firmly on the trajectory to this horrific reality.No one should ever go to prison for a lot of things, but &#34;allowing people to play computer games&#34; sounds like it should be pretty high on those lists. I have never owned a Nintendo device, and will continue to avoid them now that I know about the terrible consequences of their profit-seeking.----------------------------------------[1] https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/right-to-read.en.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just can&#39;t really feel any animosity toward Gary Bowser (or his business partners) here.  The amount that Nintendo &#34;lost&#34; is probably a couple orders of magnitude less than the damages that Nintendo claims.  An illegally-obtained copy of something does not equal a lost sale!  It&#39;s of course not surprising, but is ultimately gross, that rightsholders keep trying to claim that every unauthorized copy is one that the recipient would have paid for if it hadn&#39;t been available illegally, when we know at this point that&#39;s far far far from the truth.  The vast majority of people who obtain illegal copies would never pay in the first place.I think it would suck if a small creator got screwed over to this degree by a group of infringers like this.  But the true loss to Nintendo here is far less than it costs them to litigate, and is a rounding error when compared to their total revenue numbers over the years involved here.  It&#39;s only profitable for them to litigate because they&#39;re able to obtain awards in such ridiculous excess of their actual damages.I don&#39;t think I&#39;m really strictly in favor of this sort of organized copying, especially for profit.  But I just can&#39;t get even a tiny bit riled up about it, either.  I think, up to a certain point, companies should be forced to just accept this sort of thing as a cost of doing business.  Sure, figuring out what that certain point is might be really difficult to agree on.  But I think this particular case falls well below that point.  Remember that copyright is a social and legal construct.  It&#39;s up to the public to decide what rights it confers, and what remedies are available to rightsholders who feel harmed by infringers.  There&#39;s nothing inherently &#34;correct&#34; about the rent-seeking behavior our current laws enable."</p>

He was one of the most humble people and was happy to share all his wisdom. I am so grateful to have had the opportunity to work with him. To be specific, I built out purple numbers for Doug. I remember demoing it to him, it was hacky, and the joy he showed made my soul smile. He was a very special man. I have many other stories, but that is for another day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And yet we still haven&#39;t learned enough from it.The fact computers have been so isolated from one another (even with internet apps) is a complete tragedy. Even sending large files is a pain in the butt to this day.The demo had multiple people working on the same computer remotely, with their own cursors and ability to do things on the system at the same time.Best we have now is web-browsers syncing data silos, or a one way &#34;let this person control my mouse + keyboard&#34;.It feels like building a bridge by everyone making parts in isolation then expensively shipping it to the work site that only has one crane to assemble them.Usually it&#39;s way easier to have multiple people work on something. Like carrying something heavy, or having a line of people walk the bridge with the right tools/verification to install the rivets right, or even the opportunity for someone to speak up present unique ideas to the group.Even just a few basic OS primitives early on could have jump started so much collaboration tools and techniques that mirror how we all work together everywhere else in real life.As an aside, the whole &#34;meta-verse&#34; craze might pull these ideas through to the mainstream again.I see lots of demos of avatars standing at a table working on stuff together, and I&#39;ve been on VR chat before drawing 3d images with crayons at the same time with other people.It&#39;s incredibly fun to try and draw an elephant together and work on different parts at the same time to hilarious results."</p>

Nobody would fund him.  Apple probably should have just given him a lab with a couple of employees and a modest budget.  Who knows what he might have invented?  He had that rare ability to see into the future.  The world lost a good thirty years of his genius and not being a Valley insider I am left wondering why?"</p>

This data can be used to track you or reveal your location.Most extensions that provide anti-fingerprinting features rely on content scripts to inject script tags into webpages. There are many limitations to script tag injections which you can read about here: https://palant.info/2020/12/10/how-anti-fingerprinting-exten...Vytal utilizes the chrome.debugger API to spoof this data. This allows the data to be spoofed in frames, web workers and during the initial loading of a website. It also makes the spoofing completely undetectable.You can test and compare Vytal and other extensions on https://vytal.ioUnfortunately it doesn&#39;t work on Firefox since Firefox doesn&#39;t support the debugger API. Works on Brave tho."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m using these FF addons CanvasBlocker and Spoof Timezone to spoof UA and timezone. I checked vytal.io and it shows those addons can&#39;t fully spoof web worker method. I usually use https://browserleaks.com/javascript to test spoofing addons."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article had 2 very noticeable features.1) It was incredibly full of fluff. The actual content was actually not unuseful, it made me want to start practicing handstands, but the whole thing could have been quite brief without all the memes and marketing.2) The gifs of the exercises (not the memes) were far superior for a reader compared with embedding, or worse linking, youtube videos. They did both here but I was already in skimming mode from all the fluff. I&#39;ve  read a lot of articles on gym stuff lately and it&#39;s pretty annoying having to repeatedly scan through 20 min videos for a 5 second demonstration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My days are always better when I start them with some handstand pushups against the wall.  It&#39;s better than coffee at waking me up and is an excellent source of feedback on body weight status.  Also takes very little time.I highly recommend incorporating at least a static hand stand against the wall into your morning routine, then try work up to turning it into full blown handstand pushups just a little bit at a time.Used to just do pushups daily, then my friend&#39;s girlfriend who did acrobatics and crap talked me into doing handstands with her one day.  Never looked back, material QoL improvement ever since, thanks Stefi!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was a little bummed that a site called nerdfitness was full of memes and cliches. I was hoping for something more along the lines of defining a model of the world; defining a goal to achieve; explaining how to build a system that applies the model to solve the goal.But the exercises do look useful."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sorry to say, but these hit close to home for me.   A lot of the synchronization paradigms in Go are easy to misuse, but lead the author into thinking it&#39;s okay.   the WaitGroup one is particularly poignant for me, since the race detector doesn&#39;t catch it.I&#39;ll add one other data race goof: atomic.Value.  Look at the implementation.  Unlike pretty much every other language I&#39;ve seen, atomic.Value isn&#39;t really atomic, since the concrete type can&#39;t ever change after being set.   This stems from fact that interfaces are two words rather than one, and they can&#39;t be (hardware) atomically set.  To fix it, Go just documents &#34;hey, don&#39;t do that&#34;, and then panics if you do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This definitely matches my experience using Go at my previous organization.1. Closures and concurrency really don&#39;t mix well. The loop variable capture in particular is very pernicious. There&#39;s an open issue to change this behavior in the language: https://github.com/golang/go/issues/20733.2. Yep. I&#39;ve seen this problem in our codebase. I&#39;ve grown to just be very deliberate with data that needs to be shared. Put it all in a struct that&#39;s passed around by its pointer.3. This issue is caught fairly easily by the race detector. Using a sync.Map or a lock around a map is pretty easy to communicate with other Go devs.4. This should be documented better, but the convention around structs that should not be passed around by value is to embed a noCopy field inside. https://github.com/golang/go/issues/8005#issuecomment-190753...
This will get caught by go vet, since it&#39;ll treat it like a Locker.5 &amp; 6. Go makes it pretty easy to do ad-hoc concurrency as you see fit. This makes it possible for people to just create channels, waitgroups, and goroutines willy-nilly. It&#39;s really important to design upfront how you&#39;re gonna do an operation concurrently, especially because there aren&#39;t many guardrails. I&#39;d suggest that many newcomers stick with x/sync.ErrGroup (which forces you to use its Go method, and can now set a cap on the # of goroutines), and use a *sync.Mutex inside a struct in 99% of cases.7. Didn&#39;t encounter this that often, but sharing a bunch of state between (sub)tests should already be a red flag. Either there&#39;s something global that you initialized at the very beginning (like opening a connection), or that state should be scoped and passed down to that individual test, so it can&#39;t really infect everything around it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is pretty cool. 50 million lines of code is quite a large corpus to work off of.I&#39;m surprised by some of them. For example, go vet nominally catches misuses of mutexes, so it&#39;s surprising that even a few of those slipped through. I wonder if those situations are a bit more complicated than the example.Obviously, the ideal outcome is that static analysis can help eliminate as many issues as possible, by restricting the language, discouraging bad patterns, or giving the programmer more tools to detect bugs. gVisor, for example, has a really interesting tool called checklocks:https://github.com/google/gvisor/tree/master/tools/checklock...While it definitely has some caveats, ideas like these should help Go programs achieve a greater degree of robustness. Obviously, this class of error would be effectively prevented by borrow checking, but I suppose if you want programming language tradeoffs more tilted towards robustness, Rust already has a lot of that covered."</p>
