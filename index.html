								<p class="story__comment_others">"Second preimage attacks are trivial because of how the algorithm works. The image goes through a neural network (one to which everyone has access), the output vector is put through a linear transformation, and that vector is binarized, then cryptographically hashed. It&#39;s trivial to perturb any image you might wish so as to be close to the original output vector. This will result in it having the same binarization, hence the same hash. I believe the neural network is a pretty conventional convolutional one, so adversarial perturbations will exist that are invisible to the naked eye.This is useful for two purposes I can think of. One, you can randomize all the vectors on all of your images. Two, you can make problems for others by giving them harmless-looking images that have been cooked to give particular hashes. I&#39;m not sure how bad those problems would be – at some point a police officer does have to look at the image in order to get probable cause. Perhaps it could lead to your Apple account being suspended, however."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neuralhashes are far from my area of expertise, but I&#39;ve been following Apple closely ever since its foundation and have probably watched every public video of Craig since the NeXT take over and here is my take: I&#39;ve never seen him so off balance before as in his latest interview with Joanna Stern. Not even in the infamous “shaking mouse hand close up” of the early days.Whatever you say about Apple, they are an extremely well oiled communication machine. Every C-level phrase has a well thought out message to deliver.This interview was a train wreck. Joanna kept asking: please, in simple terms, to a hesitant and inarticulate Craig. It was so bad that she had to produce infographics to fill the communication void left by Apple.They usually do their best to “take control” of the narrative. They were clearly caught way off guard here. And that&#39;s revealing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is laughable that &#34;tech giants&#34; are going to great lengths these days in cahoots with elected politicians and warlords (equally), to crack down on &#34;misinformation&#34; and yet when their own algorithm and callous management propagate damaging misinformation, no one can crack the whip on them, so to speak.As others suggested, this needs to hit the court and be brought to the notice of regulators too. What if one day this deceptive &#34;knowledge box&#34; gets someone lynched? Am sure this has already happened if the lens is broad enough. Nevertheless they cannot be allowed to associate random photos with unrelated content without repercussions. At the very least they should have a channel where the general public can reach them and they take prompt action based on the merits of the case.It&#39;s laughable how feudal, unaccountable, unreachable and unregulated the tech industry is, while they have a deliberately cultivated oversized impact on society."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"    “We, and I personally, believe
    very strongly that more information
    is better, even if it’s wrong,” 
    said Eric Schmidt, executive
    chairman of Google[1]

I am reminded of this quote over and over when I encounter those things that are (TIL) absurdly called &#34;knowledge panels&#34;. They often confidently present completely wrong information about even trivial things (like the weight of a specific camera or lens).It is distressing (but not really surprising) to hear they are having disastrous consequences about more complex and obviously ambiguous queries, queries that no so-called &#34;AI&#34; should ever be answering, without a prominent disclaimer that the information was generated by a fuzzy-logic computer program without the ability to actually comprehend the topic at hand, and that therefore the information may be completely and utterly incorrect. (Such a disclaimer would obviously destory this &#34;feature&#34;, though.)I&#39;ve always charitably assumed that Schmidt was trying to make some point that is less insane than the quote first sounds, like &#34;correct information will eventually triumph over incorrect information if you just give people all the &#39;information&#39; you can&#34;. But Google increasingly offers me information in ways that seem like he and they just, like, literally meant that quote as it reads.(Also, even if that was the point he was trying to make, it&#39;s been thoroughly disproven over the past several years.)[1]: https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/17/google-eric-schmidt-cyb..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The quote from the Apple executive is misleading to outright dishonest.&gt; “Security researchers are constantly able to introspect what&#39;s happening in Apple’s [phone] software,” Apple vice president Craig Federighi said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. “So if any changes were made that were to expand the scope of this in some way—in a way that we had committed to not doing—there’s verifiability, they can spot that that&#39;s happening.”Apple uses complex cryptography to shield themselves and their list providers from accountability.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s completely unrelated, but it reminds me of the Metasploit UAC bypass for Windows, called &#34;ask&#34;.Metasploit just pops up a UAC prompt asking for escalation. Yes or no. Over and over and over again.On any machine logged into by a local administrator user, if they&#39;re the standard kind of careless user, they&#39;ll just click yes without thinking and they&#39;re owned. If they&#39;re cautious, and on a box where UAC presents as a modal dialog, as per its default config, this essentially locks the user out of the OS until they click &#34;yes&#34;... and they&#39;re owned.On an assessment we did at a local 200-seat business where they ran with admin rights on their local boxes, we got about a 90% escalation rate. The other 10% of people got up from their desks and went to ask the IT guy, which we considered a &#34;pass&#34; in that scenario.Interesting stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The last paragraph hits the nail on the head, it&#39;s impossible to prevent developers from elevating privileges unless one spends much more time and effort than almost any business is willing to on creating a true zero trust internal environment.Developers have little RCEs throughout the entire system, it&#39;s how they do their jobs. If even system with millions of dollars worth of design and security reviews regularly get hacked by people with no internal access to it or its source code, how can you hope to stop someone who already has a foothold and can see into the system, including a bunch of its config files?The real answer is not to stop developers from doing so. That&#39;s a never ending uphill battle. You implement very good logging and RBAC systems instead. Now everybody could hack the system if they wished to, but they would be sued into oblivion if they tried to do it for nefarious reasons.IMO the main purpose of RBAC is not really to stop developers from doing malicious activity, but to stop the stupid ones from breaking the system. The smart ones will be able to get around whatever safeguards you put in, as some of them will undoubtedly be designed by those not so fortunate or experienced. Not every developer has a good understanding of infosec and its many, _many_ ways of circumventing what seems to be an impossible defence. Unless you know all the tricks in the book already, whatever you write is most definitely gonna be swiss cheese."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That last paragraph is hard to argue with:  Maybe this is our version of the &#34;infinite monkeys&#34; thing: given enough software people, enough computers, and enough time, someone at a company will eventually grant universal remote root access to anyone who knows how to read some source code.

At one job, way back in the day, I had a dream that a shared web-hosting installer framework could give you root on whatever server hosted your stuff. Went to work the next day and indeed... it was true and trivially easy to exploit.Sadly, it was a custom wallpaper upload feature that ended up being the actual source of shenanigans. You get 3 guesses on what happened and probably need just one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Neural hash generated here might be a few bits off from one generated on an iOS device. This is expected since different iOS devices generate slightly different hashes anyway. The reason is that neural networks are based on floating-point calculations. The accuracy is highly dependent on the hardware. For smaller networks it won&#39;t make any difference. But NeuralHash has 200+ layers, resulting in significant cumulative errors.This is a little unexpected. I&#39;m not sure whether this has any implication on CSAM detection as whole. Wouldn&#39;t this require Apple to add multiple versions of NeuralHash of the same image (one for each platform/hardware) into the database to counter this issue? If that is case, doesn&#39;t this in turn weak the threshold of the detection as the same image maybe match multiple times in different devices?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now that the model is known, I wonder how hard it is to create &#34;adversarial collisions&#34;: given an image and a target hash, perturb the image in a way that is barely perceptible for a human, so that it matches the target hash."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those studying MacBook alternatives, I think the most underrated “serious” notebook computer in the world is the Panasonic Letsnote SX/SV.Matte screen that actually works outdoors, removable long-life battery, unassuming vintage design (“let’s not rob that guy, he can’t even afford a new computer”). I haven’t investigated the Linuxability of this thing yet, but it’s super-light and impressive as a mosh terminal (especially with built-in 4G LTE!). Tough magnesium body, super comfy keyboard that’s easy to swap out if you beat it up. Made in Japan!I have a fully loaded MacBook Pro, and couldn’t imagine doing design work on anything else, but I somehow end up getting lots of work done on the Letsnote. It’s at a point where I don’t think I’ll be excited about the long-awaited new 14-inch MacBook Pro, as I doubt it’ll have a matte screen and a durable exterior (and, I much prefer to look like a sad worker stuck with a dorky computer from 2006, than a moneyed tech guy)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Desktop - Ubuntu 20.04. Everything works and my requirements are quite advanced - bunch of games on Steam, pro level audio production studio just to mention a few things.Laptop - Dell Precision 7750, Xeon CPU, 64 GB RAM, bought with Ubuntu pre-installed. Beast of a laptop, superior thermals, wipes the floor with a mac.Phone - Google Pixel. I consider that a lesser evil choice to Apple&#39;s walled garden. It&#39;s rooted, I don&#39;t see any ads, etc.Tablet - Google Pixel Slate. High end tablet with 16 GB RAM running Chrome OS which supports native linux apps for a while now.These were all more or less state of the art devices at the time of buying, I have absolutely no need whatsoever to to even think about Apple or Microsoft."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t care anymore. Actually I do, but I’m exhausted.However if I buy a new laptop, with or without CSAM, it won’t be a Mac. I would wish for a Framework kinda thing here (with local service), but since that’s not gonna happen - ASUS it would be most probably, with ElementaryOS on it (or some distro like that - non ugly and kinda simple looking).It feels like WhatsApp —&gt; Signal brouhaha all over again. After trying to get my contacts on Signal for 7-8 months and having deleted WhatsApp I’m back to it after my own struggles with Signal.So no, not again. My next phone (if my iPhone 7 dies on me) will be an iPhone 12 Mini (or a 13 variant that’s around same size and cost) probably. Because that’s the only new phone that still bloody fits in my palm. After that? I’ll see."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"  We are perhaps the only public company that shares financial results internally in the weeks before the quarter is closed. We announce these numbers at a quarterly business review meeting with our top seven hundred or so managers. The financial world sees this as reckless. But the information has never been leaked. When it does one day leak (I imagine it will), we won’t overreact. We’ll just deal with that one case and continue with transparency.

The CEO of Netflix says this in Ch 5 of his book No Rules Rules. The leak is a predictable result and will happen again. He believes the tradeoff in openness is worth it. If this $3 million is the only incident, maybe he is right."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Sung Mo Jun, Joon Jun, and Chon allegedly used encrypted messaging applications to discuss their trading in an attempt to evade detection. According to the complaint, Sung Mo Jun, Joon Jun, and Chon made approximately $3 million in total profits from the illegal scheme. The SEC Market Abuse Unit&#39;s Analysis and Detection Center uncovered the trading ring by using data analysis tools to identify the traders&#39; improbably successful trading over time.&#34;I&#39;m curious which messaging app they used. I also wonder if someone tipped off the SEC or they just uncovered this in their own analysis work - it doesn&#39;t seem like making $3m off Netflix stock trades over a couple of years is particularly alarming on the surface, but idk I&#39;m not an expert... maybe the timing of the buy orders and also looking into what other trades they were making (if any) was easy to spot."</p>

As others have commented, at this point all you need is someone willing to sell you the CSAM hashes on the darknet, and this system is transparently broken.Until that day, just send known CSAM to any person you&#39;d like to get in trouble (make sure they have icloud sync enabled), be it your neighbour or a political figure, and start a PR campaign accusing the person of being investigated for it. The whole concept is so inherently flawed it&#39;s crazy they haven&#39;t been sued yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The README (https://github.com/anishathalye/neural-hash-collider#how-it-...) explains in a bit more detail how these adversarial attacks work. This code pretty much implements a standard adversarial attack against NeuralHash. One slightly interesting part was replacing the thresholding with a differentiable approximation. I figured I&#39;d share this here in case anyone is interested in seeing what the code to generate adversarial examples looks like; I don&#39;t think anyone in the big thread on the topic (https://github.com/AsuharietYgvar/AppleNeuralHash2ONNX/issue...) has shared attack code for NeuralHash in particular yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me the most interesting findings from this fiasco were:1. People actually do use generally publicly available services to store and distribute CP (as suggested by the amount of reports done by Facebook)2. A lot of people evidently use iCloud Photo Library to store images of things other than pictures they took themselves. This is not really surprising, I&#39;ve learned that the answer of &#34;does anybody ever?&#34; questions is aways &#34;yes&#34;. It is a bit weird though since the photo library is terrible for this use case."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “The terrorist watchlist is made up of people who are suspected of terrorism but who have not necessarily been charged with any crime,” Diachenko wrote. “In the wrong hands, this list could be used to oppress, harass, or persecute people on the list and their families. It could cause any number of personal and professional problems for innocent people whose names are included in the list.”I’m curious how many journalists are on the list. Now that we are pulling out of Afghanistan, we should reevaluate the other actions we took after 9/11. The patriot act deserves another look and possible edit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wikipedia says the no fly list only had 47k people on it. The terror watch list had about 1.9M though, so this must be the terror watch list.1.9M people is a massive number of people&gt; The No Fly List is different from the Terrorist Watch List, a much longer list of people said to be suspected of some involvement with terrorism. As of June 2016, the Terrorist Watch List is estimated to contain over 2,484,442 records, consisting of 1,877,133 individual identities.https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Fly_List"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You know, I can understand why the Terrorist Watch List is secret ― but not why the No Fly list is. If there is a list that governmental agencies and/or commercial companies are obliged to check you&#39;re not on before providing you with their service, then surely such list must be public or at the very least, one should be able to easily inquire about whether he/she is on it or not.For a related example, Russian government maintains a list of banned Internet resources. The list is not public — at least in theory — but there is an official web site where you can input an URL or a domain name and it would response either with &#34;no, it&#39;s not on the list&#34;, or with &#34;yes, it&#39;s on the list, here&#39;s who ordered it and when&#34;."</p>
