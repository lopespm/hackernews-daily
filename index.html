								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe police should default to assume swatting and develop techniques to evaluate actual risk prior to storming in based on an anonymous phone call? It would be nice to know the stats on false alarms vs actual threats in SWAT deployments. Having a prior would help a Bayesian analysis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was a victim of a swatting in July 2019. Someone called 911 and said a man was threatening a woman with a gun at my address. Police showed up, told me to put my hands up at gunpoint, cuffed me, searched my house and then left like nothing happened.There needs to be a better process for handling these calls.  Just call the person at the address, or approach and use a loudspeaker or something. Walking out my front door to a bunch of guns pointed at me was the worst experience of my life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"TI is Telematik Infrastruktur. So TI-Messenger is just a messenger running on the VPN used for patient-data.It&#39;s good to see this happening. One of the biggest German healthcare contractors - famous for terrible code - had managed to creep their S/MIME demo implementation derivative code as a standard for secure communication in the healthcare world. With a MITM at each Kassenaerztliche Vereinigung(i.e. the people that represent the doctors and that charge ~2% per transaction for charging the public insurance companies). So it&#39;s unaudited &#34;E2E&#34; with a MITM by design. Given the complexity of this codebase, I do hope that they just use it unmodified.EDIT: one of the reasons why the KVs rolls/ed their own is because of inherent distrust between the physicians or the institution representing them and the governments health ministry getting that data. They believe that the government is incentivizing hospitals to take over physicians share of the cake. I wouldn&#39;t say that the distrust is misplaced, but unfortunately these crappy half baked own solutions born out of nepotism don&#39;t help their case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cool. Does anyone have a paper comparing all the neu-fangled IM tech? I find myself a bit confused.BTW my favorite Matrix feature from the concept paper: &#34;Integrität dank hohem Out-of-the-box-Sicherheitsniveau&#34; - dank, hohem out-of-the-box Sicherheitsniveau sounds pretty great. (Wonder why they didn&#39;t say &#34;aus der Box&#34;?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy to hear there apparently are people that can make sensible technical decisions in German government.Realistically there weren&#39;t a lot of choices other than Matrix though, looking at what the law demands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People love to pooh-pooh &#34;complicated&#34; things like unit tests, type systems, Kubernetes, GraphQL, etc. Things that are solving a specific problem for LARGE SCALE ENTERPRISE users.I will quote myself here: A problem does not cease to exist just because you decided to ignore it.Without Kubernetes, you still need to:- Install software onto your machines- Start services- Configure your virtual machines to listen on specific ports- have a load balancer directing traffic to and watching the health of those ports- a system to re-start processes when they exit- something to take the logs of your systems and ship them to a centralized place so you can analyze them.- A place to store secrets and provide those secrets to your services.- A system to replace outdated services with newer versions ( for either security updates, or feature updates ).- A system to direct traffic to allow your services to communicate with one another. ( Service discovery )- A way to add additional instances to a running service and tell the load balancer about them- A way to remove instances when they are no longer needed due to decreased load.So sure, you don&#39;t need Kubernetes at an enterprise organization! Just write all of that yourself! Great use of your time, instead of concentrating on writing features that will make your organization more money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So the basic problem with *nix is its permission model.  If we had truly separable security/privilege/resource domains then Linux wouldn&#39;t have needed containers and simple processes and threads could have sufficed in place of Borg/docker/Kubernetes.There&#39;s a simpler and more powerful security model; capabilities.  Capabilities fix 90% of the problems with *nix.There&#39;s currently no simple resource model.  Everything is an ad-hoc human-driven heuristic for allocating resources to processes and threads, and is a really difficult problem to solve formally because it has to go beyond algorithmic complexity and care about the constant factors as well.The other *nix problem is &#34;files&#34;.  Files were a compromise between usability and precision but very few things are merely files.  Devices and sockets sure aren&#39;t.  There&#39;s a reason the &#39;file&#39; utility exists; nothing is really just a file.  Text files are actually text files + a context-free grammar (hopefully) and parser somewhere, or they&#39;re human-readable text (but probably with markup, so again a parser somewhere).Plenty of object models have come and gone; they haven&#39;t simplified computers (much less distributed computers), so we&#39;ll need some theory more powerful than anything we&#39;ve had in the past to express relationships between computation, storage, networks, and identities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two amazing quotes that really resonate with me:&gt; The industry is full of engineers who are experts in weirdly named &#34;technologies&#34; (which are really just products and libraries) but have no idea how the actual technologies (e.g. TCP/IP, file systems, memory hierarchy etc.) work. I don&#39;t know what to think when I meet engineers who know how to setup an ELB on AWS but don&#39;t quite understand what a socket is...&gt; Look closely at the software landscape. The companies that do well are the ones who rely least on big companies and don’t have to spend all their cycles catching up and reimplementing and fixing bugs that crop up only on Windows XP."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on engineering productivity research and measurement at Google for two years until about a month ago. (Opinions my own.) Compared to my former colleagues, I&#39;m an infant in this area, so take this with a heaping of salt.In general, I think the author&#39;s cynicism about productivity research is justified, but I think it could have been directed more productively. (NB: the following comments say nothing about areas of software engineering research outside of productivity.)Commercial software engineering is a creative endeavor; it is not a science, nor is it a manufacturing process. It does not have natural, universal laws. What makes a team &#39;productive&#39; varies massively based on constraints imposed by business model, product, customer expectations, leadership values, and of course the individuals of which it consists.I do not believe in the possibility of a &#34;General Theory of Productivity.&#34; I&#39;m highly skeptical of attempts to quantify the precise relationship between error discovery stage and cost in a way that is generalizable, although I think it might be possible given a large group of engineers using a highly homogenous process, tools, and accounting. Google is pretty close to this (common dev infrastructure across tens of thousands of engineers), and even across Google this kind of generalization would be extremely difficult.There is no universal physics of software engineering. As a result, academic research into productivity can be difficult to generalize (which is why, I think, you often see researchers twisting themselves into knots). Instead, my rec is to focus on a few key metrics that are aligned with your business&#39; or team&#39;s goals (search for DORA for a good starting set) and to reflect often on what you feel makes your team work well and what doesn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went into this software engineering productivity research rabbit hole a decade ago and came away similarly depressed with the lack of rigor in our field.What I’ve come to believe:- Software engineering is not an engineering discipline, it is a craft. It may or may not one day become an engineering discipline, I find this impossible to tell.- The difference between a feature and a bug is largely one of semantics, not of substance. A defect is a mismatch between expected behavior and actual behavior. A bug is when the expectation was that of the programmer that wrote the code. A feature request is when the expectation was that of a user. There is no real difference for the user between a missing feature and a broken feature. Hence why we so often get side-tracked into fruitless “bug or feature” discussions and why users don’t care when we say it is by design.- Errors will happen. People are flawed and produce errors at a more or less set average rate for each person (unless they’re tired or enjoying a ballmer peak). Errors in every step of the process, from design to deployment, are inevitable. We can however catch these inevitable errors, with automated error detection tools, or by having a fresh set of eyes look at the work. The consequence is that making high quality software necessitates taking a look at the whole process and introducing error detection steps in every part of it, whether they be automated like linters and unit tests, or human like design and code review or mentoring and pair programming.- Errors in design are more costly because they cause entire features to need to be written or rewritten, which is the most costly kind of defect to resolve. We do not need research to know this to be true. We solve this by having short feedback loops with real users, which is the only real form of agile development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was reading this thesis the other day[0], which is on precision machine design. It got me comparing precision machine design to  software engineering.A big part of why we&#39;re able to design extremely precise machines (the author worked on a lathe used for machining optical parts for the National Ignition Facility) is because we can characterize exactly where errors will come from (e.g. structure isn&#39;t rigid enough, temperature variation causes parts to expand by different amounts, parts not round or flat enough, etc.). Once we know what errors we need to control and their rough order of importance we can start improving the machine design to control them better.In theory, something similar could be done in software engineering (formal methods are part of this, but not a full solution). Rather than an error budget, you&#39;d have some sort of bug budget, where you tracked what sort of bugs were caused by what sort of constructs, and design your program in such a way to minimize their chance of being introduced. I&#39;ve never heard of anyone except Dan Bernstein[1] actually doing anything approximating this. Probably because the perceived level of effort is too high.I actually don&#39;t think it would take that much effort, but it would require quite a bit of organization to track where bugs are introduced and what their root causes are. This is probably why Bernstein, an individual, is able to do this, while no large team (that I&#39;m aware of) has done anything similar.Of course, just like your toaster doesn&#39;t need to use precision machine design techniques (an over-engineered toaster is a bad toaster), most software doesn&#39;t need the effort/expense of a rigorous design process either, but some would benefit from it.[0]: https://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/9414[1]: https://cr.yp.to/djb.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"See the section titled “What the Magnuson-Moss Act Does Not Require” of the FTC’s “Businessperson’s Guide to Federal Warranty Law”[1] to understand why this is not even close to “enforcing right to repair”. Aside from the fact that the FTC can’t enforce a right to repair law that doesn’t exist, the promise to enforce the Magnuson-Moss Act doesn’t even scratch the surface of what right to repair aims to accomplish. For example, farmers who have famously campaigned for right to repair for years (decades?) aren’t covered by the Act because their equipment is for commercial, not consumer, use.Edit: Even though I think it’s beyond ridiculous to paint this as “right to repair” I am absolutely going to report Microsoft’s Xbox to the FTC for their egregious Magnuson-Moss violations. Maybe that stupid sticker will finally disappear.[1]https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/bus..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;First, the Commission urges the public to submit complaints and provide other information to aid 
in greater enforcement of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act and its implementing regulations. 
While current law does not provide for civil penalties or redress, the Commission will consider 
filing suit against violators of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act to seek appropriate injunctive 
relief.&#34;&#34;Second, the Commission will scrutinize repair restrictions for violations of the antitrust laws. For 
example, certain repair restrictions may constitute tying arrangements or monopolistic 
practices—such as refusals to deal, exclusive dealing, or exclusionary design—that violate the 
Sherman Act.8 Violations of the Sherman Act also violate the prohibition on unfair methods of 
competition codified in Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. &#34;We&#39;ve had these laws on the books for a long time. I&#39;m not confident that they&#39;re going to be effectively applied, unless the FTC has significantly increased in size and capability recently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s say there is a right to repair and it gets perfectly enforced, doesn&#39;t this change the current business model of certain products which heavily relies on repair to profit? Wouldn&#39;t it just make those products more expensive to purchase?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I bombed an interview at a game company because I gave a right answer that I couldn&#39;t get them to understand.I don&#39;t remember the exact problem they wanted me to solve, but the answer involved a dynamic collection and they wanted it to grow with constant time complexity. They were probably looking for a linked list. But I said I&#39;d use a dynamic array because those have constant time when averaged over a series of appends.I don&#39;t know if I remembered the term &#34;amortized complexity&#34; or not, but it was clear that they had never heard of doing amortized analysis across a series of operations and they absolutely did not get my answer. They got hung up on the idea that some appends force the array to grow and get copied. I tried to explain that that was only true for a predictable fraction of them, but they were stuck on the idea that this meant dynamic arrays had O(n) worst case performance. They clearly thought I didn&#39;t know what the hell I was talking about.I&#39;m pretty sure that was the point where they decided to pass on me.But now I&#39;m a senior software engineer at Google and I just finished writing a textbook that explains dynamic arrays including their amortized analysis, so joke&#39;s on them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can&#39;t really comment on whether that was the correct way to handle the situation, given that passing the interview was the goal. However, I would have a hard time giving an incorrect answer on purpose. I also consider an interview as an opportunity to learn about the company I&#39;m going to work for, and especially my future colleagues.I would probably try to give a full answer, such as &#34;there&#39;s a widely-held concept X, but my understanding is that this is not completely correct, and in fact a better model is Y.&#34; A technical lead that can&#39;t work with an answer like that is one I probably don&#39;t want to work with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s not a lot of context given about the behaviors exhibited in this interview, but as many others here have said, red flags abound in this anecdote.&gt; But the problem was, that this guys manager was sitting next to him. If he didn’t know, I would totally humiliate him in front of his boss. So either he would stick to his guns and refuse the correctness of my answer, to save face. Or he needed to agree that he was wrong, and lose face.I would love to ask the author if their team lead ever confirmed these suspicions. I would doubt it, but happy to amend my position if wrong. Regardless, to me this sounds like the exact type of culture I wouldn&#39;t want a new hire bringing in. I don&#39;t need to be managed or protected, especially from my own manager. I need honest answers, not what I want to hear. I wasn&#39;t in the room, I can&#39;t read the vibes like the author did, but I&#39;ll consider the omissions here telling-- there&#39;s no description of an anxious or frazzled team lead, or an imperious manager peering down. It seems like the only thing the author saved the team lead from were problems in their own head."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The other peril of M1 ownership is the lack of alternative operating systems. The other way I reinstalled an older Macbook through &#34;internet recovery&#34; and it downloaded the version it was originally shipped with - macOS Mojave.The UI was a breath of fresh air compared to Big Sur. Despite the screen being smaller than my M1 the information density was higher and it felt more like a tool than a toy. The lack of bullshit apps such as Apple TV, News &amp; co and useless &#34;widgets&#34; was also good (for all of iTunes&#39; flaws, it&#39;s still better than its modern successors), and it somehow felt faster despite being less than half the processing power of the M1.I now wish I could run this on my M1 but alas I can&#39;t. At least with PCs and older Macs you could always switch to Windows or Linux, but with the M1 you&#39;re currently screwed - if Apple drops the ball or decides to take their OS in a direction you don&#39;t like you currently have no alternative (and all the &#34;security&#34; around locking out the user from their own machine doesn&#39;t bode well for alternative OSes)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow I&#39;m so happy I&#39;m moving away from Mac administration. I currently manage a big userbase but we still don&#39;t have M1s in our environment as our antivirus solution (Cylance) is really slow in supporting it.Apple is introducing more and more mechanisms in the name of security but they keep access and information very close to their heart. All us Mac admins have struggled with SecureToken in combination with AD accounts and it took two major releases for Apple to actually introduce a way for us to manage these properly through MDM. In the mean time most information had to be gathered through blogs such as this one.Another issue is that more and more enterprise management features are becoming dependent on managed (federated) Apple IDs. But Apple requires that the email and identifying account address (UPN) are the same which will never happen in our 200k user environment. So we&#39;re stuck with more and more things to work around.This is really something that should have been considered from the start. And this owner key thing sounds worse. Security is good but the end user or corporate admin should have the keys to every lock. Not just the vendor. Now my successor can deal with this stuff.I used to be a big fan of macOS personally too but I moved over to FreeBSD 2 years ago and I&#39;m glad I did. I really want an OS that answers to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems like these changes have good intentions (i.e. improved security), but introduce a lot of complexity that can have unintended consequences for end-users. This reminds me somewhat of my process setting up UEFI Secure Boot on my Windows PC that wasn&#39;t originally configured for it. Not in the exact steps, but in that there is a ton going on behind the scenes and the UX is horrendously bad.Unfortunately, vendors haven&#39;t really thought about how to explain these changes to end-users. They are trying to make them fairly transparent, which probably works at least 95% of the time, but for a small percentage of people, becomes a big PITA."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fire up the throwaway!Not 100% related to the article, but directly related.I worked as developer for a product in the same niche (&#34;democratizing adult content&#34;). I spent almost 2 years working on the frontend, devops, and building out the  analytics engine (all pre-covid).Anyway, on to the comment at hand.We had a small number of users compared to OnlyFans (when I left, there were about 20K active content creators). The average monthly payment was $5000 (skewed massively by the top 5%).We had phone support for our larger creator. One very common request was to instantly delete all data and stop processing future orders. Usually, the requester was in a pretty agitated/distraught state (I&#39;d occasionally get escalated calls to &#34;confirm&#34; that all data would be deleted ASAP and no copies would be kept).I spoke to a few of our creators and most would be desperate to scrub all of their content form the internet because:a) A parent/relative found out.b) A fellow employee at their 9-5 stumbled on their account.c) A &#39;fan&#39; went nuclear and was waging all out digital war. One creator had a former subscriber sending data dumps to all their Facebook and Instagram friends (they also spammed every public email address at their &#39;normal&#39; workplace, which was a local government).We would occasionally get demanding letters requesting the removal of content from third party sites (Pornhub, Reddit, etc). The creators would somehow be surprised when they realised we couldn&#39;t remove content from other websites.The experience was very depressing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So our kids are getting older so I&#39;ve been paying more attention to popular social networks and it&#39;s wild how many YouTubers, Twitch&#39;ers, TikTok&#39;ers, Instagram&#39;ers have OF content directly linked from their non-porn bios.I don&#39;t like it, but I&#39;m not sure what a good solution is. I mean, people are free to do what they&#39;d like, but it&#39;s hard to police screen time 100% of the time and their peer group has a lot more access than they do so even if I can block it 100$ they&#39;ll be exposed to it somewhere else. We&#39;ve talked about it and I feel like that&#39;s all I can do now. I just hate how normalized it feels when many of their social media &#34;role models&#39; turn to porn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not anti-sex or anti-sex work, but I think onlyfans is evil.  They have a business model, that is perfected to extract as much money from whales as possible.  Performers appear to have ‘relationships’ with their subscribers, encourage them to tip, buy ‘customs’, and ‘engage’ with them.These sad lonely sexless men spend all their money on this shit.  It consumes them, until they are out of money, then it destroys them.  It warps their expectations of relationships further impacting their datability, driving them even more towards onlyfans.Now, this is only a minority of their users, but makes a large proportion of their revenue.  For healthy people, only fans can be great."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It continues to strike me as a little odd that (AFAIK) there&#39;s no mention in The Guardian&#39;s reporting of this story of the parallel technology[1] sold by Gamma Group[2] and licensed for export by UK to several suspect regimes[3].Extensive (40G) information on this was leaked via reddit in August 2014[4], and the leaker noted[5]:&gt; I assumed the hacking would be the hard part and once I got the data it would just kinda go viral on it&#39;s own or something. But it turn&#39;s out without any media access or idea how that shit works, getting people to notice or care is actually kind of hard.------1:&#34;FinSpy Mobile. Version 4.4, released in of Q4 2012, has the ability to collect data through Skype across iOS, Blackberry, Android, and Windows Mobile platforms . An updated Version 4.5, released in Q1 2013, included the ability to target emails, calendars and keylogging of Windows Phones, and an updated ability to collect data through the camera of a Blackberry or iOS phone.&#34;-  https://privacyinternational.org/blog/1522/six-things-we-kno...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2019 I filed my (Dutch) taxes on my phone, while I was on a bus somewhere in the north of Argentina after previously having traveled for 20 something hours. It took me about 15 minutes to check if the numbers from the government were correct (they were) and I was done. Americans are being duped by these predatory companies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TurboTax recently tricked me using some dark UI patterns into spending 30+ minutes painstakingly filling out my tax forms in a way that made it seem like it was for the free filing.Only at the very end, did they reveal that it was in fact for the paid version, with no way to change it to the free version and also keep the work. Essentially holding my work hostage.So I had to redo it again in the hard-to-find free version. I am now anti-TurboTax for life."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I don&#39;t understand is, if I make a mistake (e.g. missing a schedule or wrong number) in the form 1040 and send it to IRS, I&#39;ll be guaranteed to receive a CP notice from them later asking me to pay the missing tax and penalty. Clearly IRS has their own algorithm to calculate everything based on what they got (which is exactly the same as what I have, W-2, 1099, etc., for most Americans) anyways.If IRS already know precisely how much tax I owe, and whatever I &#34;claim&#34; has no power, why do I need to play the game of &#34;cat and mouse&#34;, every year? Why not just send me a pre-filled 1040 that their internal algorithm calculates and ask for my approval, like those Europeans do? How is this more &#34;prone to raise tax&#34;?"</p>
