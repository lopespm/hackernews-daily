I can&#39;t even begin to fathom the immense bravery of these divers - and that of the boys. 
I didn&#39;t really follow the Musk bit of the story, but the fact that he had the audacity to shitpost about any of these guys make me think vastly less of him (and I&#39;m usually in the Musk-respecter camp)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great! Unfortunately, it hasn&#39;t been updated since 2016 and isn&#39;t suitable for applications outside Terminal.app. But apparently someone else took up the mantle and rebuilt it to solve those issues and published it as creep2:https://github.com/raymond-w-ko/creep2&gt; I love romeovs&#39;s creep font, but I think you could only use it well in Apple&#39;s Terminal.app because it has negative line and character width spacing, which the font requires to be spaced correctly. The root cause of this appears to be because some glyphs are bigger than the 5px by 11px bounding box, causing most terminals to think a much bigger box is necessary for the general ASCII glyphs.&gt; In order to fix this issue, I manually hand painted all the glyphs from the &#39;creep&#39; font in fontforge.Awesome! I just wish creep2 added some of those sweet demo photos that are in the creep README."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi everyone, quite unexpected to see this on the frontpage of Hacker News!I made this so many years ago but I&#39;m not using it myself anymore and I haven&#39;t been maintaining it.I was (and am) also very inexperienced making fonts so the result was &#34;good enough for my own limited use case&#34; but too broken for general use, so it&#39;s good to see other people taking it and running with it, fixing my oversights and improving things.Questions or suggestions are more than welcome."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fun. As I’m working on my little hobby project that is custom air quality meters I am using 128x64 screens that are about an inch on the diagonal. I ended up having to create a custom pixel font that would work for both 6pt and 8pt height plus some icons in each. It’s been a really fun experience and rewarding too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I read on many different sites that AMD’s current CPUs beat Intel’s CPUs in terms of performance per watt. We can better achieve goals 2 and 3 (low noise and low power usage) by using fewer watts, so we’ll pick an AMD CPU and mainboard for this build.Unfortunately many reviews are very misleading here. Zen 2/3 CPUs have good performance per Watt, that&#39;s true. But for a machine like this, which will be mostly idle, this is not the interesting metric and Zen 2/3 systems show that you can combine good perf/W with poor idle power consumption (which is not true for their monolithic APU brethren, which are used in laptops).One of the biggest idle power hogs for these is the IO die, so make sure that XMP is disabled and the memory uses one of the slow JEDEC timings. This should be fine for a router. Check that the SoC/NB voltage is set to 1 V or less. Some boards set this higher. In the AMD CBS section of the board firmware there should be an item &#34;SoC OC Mode&#34; somewhere. Disable it. Some boards allow you to set a new PPT (package power target), but it&#39;s worth pointing out that values which are too low will make the CPU very slow because it essentially forces all cores to very low power states in order to meet the PPT since the CPU can&#39;t influence the baseline power (due to fabric and I/O die). The upside of using a reasonable PPT of e.g. 50-60 W is that you reduce power consumption if some errant task hogs the CPU.These settings make a big difference, but only if the CPU is really idle. Even fairly light loads (e.g. on a desktop, moving the mouse on the background) has everything rev up. In deep idle (nothing running at all, no user interaction on a desktop) you might get a Zen 2/3 CPU down to around 20 Watts, but as soon as anything is happening at all we&#39;re straight back to the 40-70 W region.Using an Intel system for this would have likely saved 10-20 W."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Our network cards need PCIe 3.0, so that disqualifies 5 chipsets right away: only the A520, B550 and X570 chipsets remain.No, the linked Wikipedia page only shows the PCIe lanes connected through the chipset and doesn&#39;t account for PCIe lanes provided directly from supported CPUs. X470 supports CPUs which have PCIe 3.0 and a board with x8/x8 mode like the ROG Strix X470-F https://www.asus.com/microsite/motherboard/AMD-X470/ should work just fine (and has no fan)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think the problem of this essay is that it&#39;s overly technical: only those versed well enough in SQL will really care to read the whole thing, and if they are already at that level, either they accepted that &#34;SQL will get the job done in the end&#34;, or they learned to live along it and now even kinda embrace it, and are happy to write about how the examples are very poor and dismiss the critique based on that, when the essay kinda explains it main point pretty well:&gt;&gt; The core message [...] is that there is potentially a huge amount of value to be unlocked by replacing SQLTo me, a lot of people defends SQL saying that &#34;perfect is the enemy of good&#34; and that SQL simply works. Not the favourite of anyone, but everyone kinda accepts it.And yeah, it&#39;s true. People use SQL because it&#39;s good enough, and trying to reinvent the wheel would take more work (individually speaking) than just dealing with SQL as it is right now. For large organizations where the effort could be justified, all your engineers already know SQL anyway, so it&#39;s not so great either.But for something so relevant as relational databases, perfect is not the enemy of good. We do deserve better. We generally agree that SQL has many pitfalls, it&#39;s not great for any kind of user (for non-technical users, a visual programming language would work well here, more like what Airtable does, closing the bridge between spreadsheet and hardcore database, and for technical users, it does feel unwieldy and quirky). We should be more open to at least consider critiques and proposals for better. We might find out that people, from time to time, are making some good points."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like most frustrations with SQL boil down to fighting against a shitty schema.When you are sitting in a properly normalized database, it is a lot easier to write joins and views such that you can compose higher order queries on top.If you are doing any sort of self-joins or other recursive/case madness, the SQL itself is typically not the problem. Whoever sat down with the business experts on day 1 in that conference room probably got the relational model wrong and they are ultimately to blame for your suffering.If you have an opportunity to start over on a schema, don&#39;t try to do it in the database the first few times. Build it in excel and kick it around with the stakeholders for a few weeks. Once 100% of the participants are comfortable and understand why things are structured (related) the way they are, you can then proceed with the prototype implementation.Achieving 3NF or better is usually a fundamental requirement for ensuring any meaningfully-complex schema doesn&#39;t go off the rails over time.Only after you get it correct (facts/types/relations) should you even think about what performance issues might arise from what you just modeled. Premature optimization is how you end up screwing yourself really badly 99% of the time. Model it correctly, then consider an optimization pass if performance cannot be reconciled with basic indexing or application-level batching/caching."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how much of the limitation are necessary in order for the query optimizer to have any chance at finding a good execution plan. As you add more and more abstractions and more and more general computations in the middle of your queries, it will probably become harder and harder for the query optimizer to understand what you are actually trying to do and figure out how to do it efficiently. Are you not running the risk that the database will have to blindly scan through entire tables calling your user defined functions as black boxes on each row?I would also guess that we could have a better SQL but I do not think it could and should look anything like a general purpose programming language because otherwise you might get in the way of efficient query execution. Maybe some kind of declarative data flow description with sufficient facilities to name and reuse bits and pieces.And maybe you actually want two languages which SQL with its procedural parts already kind of has. One limited but well optimizable language to actually access the data, one more general language to perform additional processing without having to leave the server. Maybe the real problem of SQL lies mostly in its procedural part and how it interfaces and interacts with the query part."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t use Instagram much, but I am on Facebook too often. The limitations of the advertising algorithms are very interesting to me. For example: I participate in ex-evangelical groups because of my childhood experiences. Also follow pages which discuss American Christianity from a secular or journalistic perspective, and in Christian groups which interpret their beliefs from a left-ish ideology. &#34;Liking&#34; any post from those groups will trigger an onslaught of ads almost exclusively for conservative churches and conservative organizations.The algorithms can&#39;t differentiate between &#34;pro&#34;, &#34;anti&#34;, and &#34;observer&#34; on a particular topic. Nor does it seem to have any awareness of ideology. It&#39;s very rare when I see progressive churches advertise.I understand that the algorithms are going to have difficulty with subtleties. But I&#39;d think they&#39;d still have some rough awareness about &#34;anti&#34; vs. &#34;pro&#34;. And thus not flood people who dislike a thing with ads promoting the thing.At any rate, I suppose it&#39;s oddly reassuring Facebook is so inaccurate. Judging by the high number of critical comments on the religious ads, there are many uninterested people being targeted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I get great ads on Instagram. Generally, they’re niche products related to my interests from small companies I’ve never heard of before.Yes, there’s a few misses, but it’s way better than the absolute scum-sucking garbage I see elsewhere on the internet from other ad networks. “Doctor shares one weird trick for emptying your bowels every morning”, “Alan Greenspan tells you what to buy instead of Litecoin”, and similar.However, I don’t really use Instagram to connect with people I know. I follow a bunch of accounts related to my hobbies and interests. That probably primes the ad-targeting pump a lot better than if I was just following my friends and family on there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Before I completely dropped social media, I had a f—k the algorithm attitude towards the ads. I made a point of clicking through everything that was completely uninteresting to me. That road led to a non-stop flood of class-action lawyer ads."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sadly the most interesting CSS percentage mechanic is missing there:    background-position

Unlike all other cases, here `background-position-x: [25]%` means:&gt; &#34;Place image so its inner left [quarter] boundary matches inner left [quarter] boundary of its container.&#34;So 0% = align left edges, 100% = align right edges, 50% = align centers (= center) etc.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just a little correction: percentage values are computed based on the element&#39;s _containing block_, not parent.Most of the time, an element&#39;s containing block is its parent, but not always.For more on this: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Containing_..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wait there are sooo many more edge cases of percentages! When this article finished I think it should be half way through or even one third of 100% weirdness.Examples: with flexbox and/or tables, 100% behaves differently. What about 100% vs 100vh/vw? This would be very nice to show here as well. As others note, background-position or background-size. Collapsing margins might be interesting, but probably not the best fit for this example. How other types of `display` interact with the 100% (e.g. `inline` just ignores it). As it&#39;s just very briefly touched, but how box-sizing affects the height/width. SVGs viewBox, canvas, hiding navbars on mobile, body&#39;s default width/height, the trick of `width: 100%; max-width: 1200px; margin: 0 auto;`, etc. there&#39;s such a vast amount of topics relating/breaking the concept of 100% in CSS that it&#39;s mind-numbing."</p>

I am really honored to be on HN front page and I would like to straighten some misconceptions about this app.The version that is available and its trailer has little to do with the current state of the application.New release brings voxels, lowpoly and sprites together to create 3D animated game objects and export them as 2D spritesheets. It&#39;s purpose is not to replace your favorite software (Aseprite, MagicaVoxel, PicoCAD...) but to bind them all together into something even more useful from a 2D gamedeveloper point of view. So it can import - a lot of things.Please check this post/video that is more accurate about what SpriteStack is than the 2019 trailer https://www.patreon.com/posts/spritestack-2021-53317888"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on this problem for just over a decade before moving onto other things. It’s a tough problem to solve.The biggest problem I ran into is that the largest segment of user growth were too fickle. They wanted all kinds of magic in new optional features for their personal preferences that took incredible effort. I lacked the analytics to see who used which exotic features. Most of these people just wanted a beautifier more that a diff tool and would drop you in a heartbeat for more popular tools that wouldn’t do what they wanted but were popular.The tool I wrote did have a strong following mostly around markup language parsing that was not at all exotic but solved problems other tools refused to approach.My guidance is don’t become a code beautifier. In the languages I was supporting during the time frame I was supporting this code beautifiers were all the rage. Nobody seemed to want a diff tool with extra capabilities. Stick to being a diff tool. The people that are intentionally looking for intelligent diff tools tend to be more engineering focused and make for a loyal audience. People looking for code vanity are just the same as window shoppers walking down a street."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surely far from being as elaborate as the linked tool, but I use the following git command a few dozen times daily:  git diff --word-diff=color --word-diff-regex=&#39;\w+&#39;

I added two aliases to my .gitconfig, one for diff and one for show:  [alias]
    word-show = show --word-diff=color --word-diff-regex=&#39;\\w+&#39;
    word-diff = diff --word-diff=color --word-diff-regex=&#39;\\w+&#39;

Those small things improved development and reviewing a lot for me!If stuff moved around or got it&#39;s indentation changed I either add `--color-moved` and/or `-w` (ignore whitespace changes) flags to filter out extra noise.Sometimes I need to use another regex though, e.g. a simple dot `.` for match all with no greedy +"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Been hoping for more of this for years. We stare at diffs all day yet we have to accommodate the computer by understanding that the parenthesis it claims was changed wasn’t actually changed, there was just another set of parentheses added. There’s of course limits to how much a diff tool can extract meaning from two pieces of content, but structure and perhaps even heuristics like “new function was added here, maybe the curly brace belongs with that and not the old function” would certainly help."</p>
