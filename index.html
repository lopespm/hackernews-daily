								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Again, it&#39;s just insane to me that we don&#39;t even much have a meaningful discussion of:&#34;Hey, wait, literally everyone could have the entire library of Alexandria in their house for a couple hundred bucks per person. Like, all the knowledge ever. Maybe that should be considered the good default of things.At least one in every town that everyone could use, for free, forever, without restriction to ANY of the knowledge anyone desires.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, if I get it right. First there was Libgen, which is mirrorable. Then, some Z-Library copied Libgen and added some more books, without making it mirrorable. The goal is to make these new books, which are not mirrorable — mirrorable (i.e. to &#34;preserve&#34; them).So, why not just re-upload them to Libgen, then? I guess somebody will do that now anyway, but you could easily done it in the first place, without making your own mirror, which is not a mirror of Libgen. Just upload them to Libgen and make a mirror of Libgen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see things like this, and I wonder why the following software doesn&#39;t exist:I want a piece of software to which I can add a collection of files, say multiple TB. The software will then behave a bit like a BitTorrent tracker, and know which peer has which files. A peer joining this swarm will be able to say &#34;I want to donate X GB of space&#34;, and the tracker would tell it &#34;OK, then download and seed these files, which are the least seeded&#34;.The peer would download the files from the rest of the swarm and make them available to it. Then, a request layer on top of the swarm could be used to request a file from the peer which had it. Adding/removing files to this collection would also need to be a feature.Does anyone know if anything like this exists? If not, how easy would it be to make something like it out of BitTorrent? I might give it a go."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It gave me a pause to think about how it came that I can never really tell what am I looking at anymore. Forget the HN title, which is stupid — what does this landing page tell me? Well, that it&#39;s… next gen, and it apparently can catch up with me, which is not much, since I&#39;m not really catching up with what&#39;s going on anyway. Also, that it&#39;s &#34;tooling&#34;. Like IDE, or framework, or maybe a chainsaw. Can&#39;t tell.&#34;Getting started&#34; page tells me that &#34;Vite&#34; (pronounced as &#34;veet&#34;) is &#34;quick&#34; in French, then it proceeds with quite wordy installation guide. It also quickly mentions that it&#39;s a &#34;build tool&#34;. Finally. So, like gulp or grunt, I guess? But it doesn&#39;t even mention those, or any other build tools it supposedly replaces. And it seems unlikely, since everybody uses some script that comes with angular or vue or any other framework of your choice nowadays…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working with front end for 5+ years have nearly made me switch careers. 
There&#39;s an absolute onslaught of languages, frameworks, patterns and now also &#34;tools&#34; that never really work in you editor, and you never really grasp before moving on to the next thing.I think me and my team have spent 90% of our time working with tooling, and all creativity and joy has gone out the window - because you never become a master, an expert og know your way around the codebase before you&#39;re suddenly 2 years behind.It&#39;s a shitshow and no one really seems to know what the hell they are doing - even the teachers of this stuff - they just know &#34;how&#34; rarely why.Way, way too much complexity and abstraction for simple tasks. Some things &#34;should have&#34; become easier with quick scaffolding, auth templates or whatever, but they always only work 95% and you use an endless amount of time fixing the last 5% instead of building creatively.Vite was the same thing, faster yes, but my VSCODE broke because of the myriad of build tools and plugins on top of each other from older projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Incredible amount of negative comments. It takes more time to type all that negativity out than it takes to read about what Vite is and what it does.Frontend dev here. Vite is amazing. It doesn&#39;t take long to get what it does if you try it out (you can avoid reading about it that way).I won&#39;t bother summarizing what it does, the website literally covers it. Reading really became superpower in this day and age."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love how they&#39;ve said &#34;constrained to C space&#34;.Many people say speed of light is the absolute speed limit of anything or information can travel. Sure it is, which is easily proven by physics. But the physics we know of applies to what we know. There might be something completely different to what we&#39;re seeing/observing/theoritising with our smartest people and best equipment.I&#39;m not saying we can just go faster than C by advancing technology: I know it&#39;s limited by relativity and is not a matter of advancing tech.What I&#39;m saying is that there will probably be advancements in physics and technology so that C limit will of course stay the same, but it will be the physics inside the box whereas a complete new understanding of reality outside the box would be discovered, where things can travel &#34;faster&#34; than C using other dimensions or something that we even haven&#39;t thought of yet &#34;outside the box&#34;, while still being perfectly compatible with the &#34;regular&#34; &#34;inside the box&#34; physics we love and use today, without violating and relativity rules of our classical physics.Then they&#39;ll probably look back and just laugh at the people who thought C was the absolute limit to everything."</p>

With teeth in the form of regular detailed reporting, close scrutiny, and immense personal and financial penalties starting at the top. Since trafficking people is worth a 20-year sentence, then each death must certainly match that. $100,000 a day, up to 100 days, after which the business and all of its assets are forfeit ... as well as all of the assets of the principals.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; As soon as Sphero completed the acquisition, bringing Kelsus in as an app developer, two things happened: 1) Sphero told us they needed fully revamped iOS and Android apps six months later with no schedule wiggle room. 2) Sphero spent the first two of those six months organizing a team on their side and hashing out requirements for the new apps.This exact pattern has preceded every mismanagement disaster I&#39;ve ever seen:1) Management gives an unreasonable deadline to developers before defining the deliverables. Clock starts ticking.2) Management then fails to settle on the requirements for months and/or continuously moves the goalposts while people are trying to work, turning an unreasonable deadline into an impossible deadline3) Developers start realizing that they&#39;re going to receive the blame when impossible deadline isn&#39;t achieved, despite not having any control in the matter. They start leaving for new jobs, and the death spiral begins.It&#39;s the universal pattern of a management team that doesn&#39;t know how to do anything other than make demands and then apply pressure. Unless you can get someone in charge who has real leadership and planning skills, it&#39;s not recoverable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As soon as someone hands you the check it&#39;s no longer &#34;your&#34; company and you should stop thinking of it as such. Only misery lies on that path.I see this on a smaller scale where ICs leave a company and take a copy of &#34;their&#34; code (ask Sergey Aleynikov [1] if that&#39;s a good idea). It&#39;s not yours. If you ever use it you could face legal consequences. And there&#39;s no code I&#39;ve ever written that I wasn&#39;t convinced I could write better from scratch the next time if it ever came up. Side note: it never has.Don&#39;t be that guy who takes the check and then expects control. Don&#39;t be that guy who is convinced the new owners are messing it up and then goes out and does the exact same thing..Move on.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sergey_Aleynikov"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve seen this twice. First time the PE firm installed their CEO who came in and immediately started talking about cleaning house. A bunch of developers left fearing a layoff. That was bad enough, but what he really meant was sales. He gutted the sales team and brought in his guys. Sales tanked, company growth stopped, hard. Features dwindled and bugs grew. This clown and his cronies were gone after two years and the company still struggles today.Second time. A $10B company acquired a $4B company. The parent demanded high margins from the company that had been running on low margins and legacy, near end of life applications. Layoffs ensued and the parent was choking on the acquisition. They’d been sold on a bogus modernization effort that ended as soon as the acquisition closed. That acquisition is a drag on their earnings today, six years later.Getting to see these type of disasters first hand is pretty cool imo."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually gave away a Porsche 911. This was not a mall giveaway but a marketing experiment for my new startup: Flat 6 Club.Yes, we wanted something in return, in this case, we wanted you to buy a t-shirt or start a subscription (merch+content+events), which gives us essentially all the same info, which would enter you in a sweepstakes to win the car. We also wanted to promote the club, which we did.We researched it and contracted a sweepstakes company who helped us run the sweepstakes legally.In the end, we gave away the car to a very nice man and his wife, who we flew in from Minnesota to San Diego for the giveaway event.Some people did think it was a scam.But there are several operations that actually do give cars away such a Omaze, Diesel Brothers and many more.There’s a model there based on the new post-search world we live in that has to do with high engagement increasing Return On Ad Spend and other AdTech voodoo.No doubt there are lots of scams but there are also real winners out there.We’ve only given away 1 car. We learned a ton.I decided to kill the monthly subscription after we gave away the car because we grossly underestimated the amount of up-front ad spend required to achieve a good ROAS and I knew we wouldn’t be giving away another car for a long time.The biggest surprise to me was hearing from people that were sad that we killed the paid membership/giveaway program.This was $9.11/mo for membership and occasional swag drops and automatic entry into our next giveaway —whenever that might be. I communicated personally with some of these folks.The gist of what I learned was that for $9.11/mo, people enjoyed the hope that they may one day win a 911. We literally had people beg us to bring it back. This is probably the same happiness that a lottery ticket brings to many people. It’s not really that they expect to win. As long as someone wins, they’re buying some hope, some excitement… a dream."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned in a meeting at my last job that many weather apps solely exist to collect and sell location data.  Don’t have specific evidence but it seemed to be par for the course.  So I’m glad to see this API, hopefully it’ll help more privacy focused weather apps thrive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A quiet note of appreciation for Adam Grossman, one of the co-founders of Dark Sky. It&#39;s one thing to have an idea about a weather app, quite another to pursue it successfully within a small design agency and then make it polished enough over the years to sell it to a giant corporation like Apple. Even during that acquisition, Grossman went to bat for DarkSky&#39;s users, making sure that the API was kept live (for 2+ years running now). Post-acquisition, he has evidently become comfortable enough in a corporate environment to help evangelize the API&#39;s transition to an Apple-native SDK and Swift API. The creation of the REST API with a full mapping guide means that Grossman continues to bat for DarkSky API developers. The use of the native Swift API to create brand new Apple weather apps also appears to be well done. All-in-all, it has been a remarkable journey from a small, independent agency to a large corporate while keeping core values alive, a journey where many others have flamed out. An inspiration to all. Hats off to you, Grossman!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m wondering if the last sentence from the abstract is more of a holy grail than the conversion of methane to methanol:&gt; ... The confinement of mono-iron hydroxyl sites in a porous matrix demonstrates a strategy for C–H bond activation in CH4 to drive the direct photosynthesis of CH3OH.https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-022-01279-1Selective C-H bond activation (of which this paper is an example) is extremely difficult. It has been the focus of intense research for decades. Having a tunable catalysts system that performed this transformation would be a game-changer for the production of just of about every organic molecule. The authors just focused on methane as the hydrocarbon feedstock, so it&#39;s hard to know how general the process might be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Paper: Direct photo-oxidation of methane to methanol over a mono-iron hydroxyl site by An, B., Li, Z., Wang, Z. et al.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many don&#39;t know this but the most important thing to know about solar is that it is so far the only method of direct power generation that exists. Nuclear and various fossil fuels create heat that boils water to generate steam that turns a turbine to generate power. This adds cost and complexity that you can never get away from.But solar by virtue of being direct avoids all of this so has a lower bound in cost that other methods of power generation will find it hard to compete with. Solar cells can be small so solar power is highly flexible. Plus it has no moving parts (other than sometimes solar cells are moved slowly to face the Sun as it moves through the sky) so it&#39;s upper bound for reliability is hard to beat.I actually think solar is and will be the most important method of power generation in the coming centuries that will culminate in space-based solar power collectors.So solar has the potential to be extraordinarily cheap, reliable and require no expensive infrastructure like power lines. Creating methanol is essentially a way of storing excess energy so this could be a real game-changer for developing nations that lack such infrastructure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a great write up. I&#39;ve already sent it to a few people.On the question of what happens if a file&#39;s contents change after the initial checksum, the man page for rsync[0] has an interesting explanation of the *--checksum* option:&gt; This changes the way rsync checks if the files have been changed and are in need of a transfer. Without this option, rsync uses a &#34;quick check&#34; that (by default) checks if each file&#39;s size and time of last modification match between the sender and receiver. This option changes this to compare a 128-bit checksum for each file that has a matching size. Generating the checksums means that both sides will expend a lot of disk I/O reading all the data in the files in the transfer (and this is prior to any reading that will be done to transfer changed files), so this can slow things down significantly.&gt; The sending side generates its checksums while it is doing the file-system scan that builds the list of the available files. The receiver generates its checksums when it is scanning for changed files, and will checksum any file that has the same size as the corresponding sender&#39;s file: files with either a changed size or a changed checksum are selected for transfer.&gt; Note that rsync always verifies that each transferred file was correctly reconstructed on the receiving side by checking a whole-file checksum that is generated as the file is transferred, but that automatic after-the-transfer verification has nothing to do with this option&#39;s before-the-transfer &#34;Does this file need to be updated?&#34; check.
For protocol 30 and beyond (first supported in 3.0.0), the checksum used is MD5. For older protocols, the checksum used is MD4.[0]: https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice write up. rsync is great as an application but I found it more cumbersome to use when wanting to integrate it into my own application. There&#39;s librsync but the documentation is threadbare and it requires an rsync server to run. I found bita/bitar (https://github.com/oll3/bita) which is inspired by rsync &amp; family. It works more like zsync which leverages HTTP Range requests so it doesn&#39;t require anything running on the server to get chunks. Works like a treat using s3/b2 storage to serve files and get incremental differential updates on the client side!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really glad there&#39;s advanced open-source tools like darktable and RawTherapee.I&#39;ve switched back and forth between RawTherapee and darktable for a few years now.I prefer the UI and workflow or RT, but dt has better performance on my machine.  And RT has this strange longstanding bug where the image is extremely blurry during editing, and only becomes clear after exporting.  According to a github issue, a workaround is to disable lens correction (and anything else in the &#34;transform&#34; tab) but this didn&#39;t work for me, prompting my most recent switch to dt.current biggest grip with dt... why are those damn arrows at the edges of the screen so tiny???  Expanding and retracting the side panels requires pixel-perfect accuracy on a ~20px target.  I know I could use keyboard shortcuts, but my brain isn&#39;t wired for them yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let&#39;s see if this changed anything.But my previous experience with editing Sony RAWs on Rawtherappe and Darktable wasn&#39;t good.The color science is missed up in Darktable and in Raw therappe, I just couldn&#39;t get something decent out.I would be editing for an hour and end up with a weird looking image, while in lightroom I would be done in 10 minutes.People might say that I&#39;m just used to lightroom but I&#39;m not, I was using Capture one, then didn&#39;t shoot anything for multiple years, then just went pack to Lightroom and could edit photos without major frustrations and get decent results quickly.Creative apps in general are a very weak point of the Linux desktop, and when they exist, that have many weird requests and problems that just using them on windows is easier(Davinci resolve requiring the crappy closed source AMD drivers)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"darktable has a pretty steep learning curve and it introduces concepts from cinema (the scene referred workflow) that may be known to video editors and colorists, but that are surely alien even to seasoned still image editors and retouchers.For anyone that wants to learn darktable I wholeheartedly recommended the forum at https://discuss.pixls.us/c/software/darktable/19The darktable developers frequent this forum and it&#39;s an indispensable resource."</p>
