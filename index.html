								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A great response, in my opinion. Succinctly and effectively points out what was wrong with the NYT article, then tries to move on. Somewhat more of a sober tone than Scott&#39;s typical writing, but still with a dash of his typical wit:&gt; I don’t want to accuse the New York Times of lying about me, exactly, but if they were truthful, it was in the same way as that famous movie review which describes the Wizard of Oz as: “Transported to a surreal landscape, a young girl kills the first person she meets and then teams up with three strangers to kill again.”I have only gained respect for Scott, and lost respect for the NYT, throughout this while saga. Hopefully this is the end of it.Edit: in the spirit of moving on, here are two of my favorite articles since his return, one enlightening, one funny:&#34;WebMD, And The Tragedy Of Legible Expertise&#34; -- https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/webmd-and-the-tragedy-...&#34;List of Fictional Cryptocurrencies Banned By The SEC&#34; -- https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/list-of-fictional-cryp..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Steven Pinker maybe says it best, in a thread where he links to some notable SSC posts:A typical essay by Scott Alexander is deeper, better reasoned, better referenced, more original, and wittier than 99% of the opinion pieces in MSM. It&#39;s sad that the NYT can see him only through the lens of their standard political &amp; cultural obsessions.Perhaps Alexander&#39;s ultimate virtue is epistemic humility: His pieces are long, sometimes inconclusive, and accompanied by diverse commentary because he&#39;s committed to his own fallibility and lack of omniscience.  We should all live by such standards.https://twitter.com/sapinker/status/1360787817459253251"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The NYT article[1] can hardly be called a hit piece at all, considering how little &#39;dirt&#39; it actually contains.What is telling however is the lengths to which they went to connect Scott to anything negative at all.Look at how they &#39;connect&#39; him to Peter Thiel for instance: Scott is a prominent figure in a loose group of &#34;Rationalists&#34;. Some rationalists are concerned about AI. Some people who are concerned about AI also donated to MIRI. Guess who also donated to MIRI? Peter Thiel!The author then goes on to rattle off a bunch of other names who are in turn connected to Peter Thiel in some ways.Like... really?I just can&#39;t figure out why that paragraph should even be the article. Speaking of which, what is that article even about? If there&#39;s supposed to be some story or thread stringing it together, I can&#39;t see it.It&#39;s essentially:1. He deleted his blog.2. Here&#39;s a list of unrelated things people he may know have done.3. He now has a new blog.Cool story, NYT.[1]: https://archive.is/b1tyQ"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Neat concept.  Exploring the difference between what successfully compiles vs. what won&#39;t seems like a great way of getting more familiar with the language.I&#39;ve written a little over 1,000 lines of Zig at this point and I really like it.  I think its key feature is a rich compile-time imperative programming environment (&#34;comptime&#34;).  If you can have full compile-time imperative code execution, you can get a lot of the benefits of more complicated language features (like C++ templates) &#34;for free.&#34;In C++ templates are &#34;a language within a language&#34;, but even templates with all their complexity cannot solve all of the problems you might want to solve at compile-time, so C++ has been gradually expanding its compile-time code execution features so that more and more of the language is available at compile-time (constexpr, consteval, etc). Zig jumps straight to the finish line by making most of the language available at compile-time from the outset, and in doing so avoids the need to add the complexity of templates in the first place.Having &#34;slices&#34; as a first class type feels like a general and powerful solution to the problems that std::string_view and std::span are trying to solve.I am comparing Zig to C++ a lot, which many Zig fans would probably take exception to as Zig does not aspire to be a better C++, but rather a better C.  Indeed many key C++ patterns like RAII are explicitly out of scope.  But to me Zig bridges the gap between C and C++ by solving many of the problems that make C feel too spartan without jumping to the incredible complexity of C++.There are a few things about Zig that give me pause.  I&#39;ve noticed that compile-time feels like a very lazy environment, meaning that functions do not seem to undergo full semantic analysis unless they are called from somewhere.  You can write a function that compiles successfully, leading you to believe the function is syntactically and semantically coherent, only to find that when you add an actual call to that function, the compiler now flags errors inside that function.  This adds some friction to development, because the act of writing a function is no longer a self-contained activity.  Writing the function feels more like sketching it; later when you actually call it you have a new set of compile errors to contend with.I also miss tools like ASAN to catch memory errors.  I&#39;m guessing things like that will come with time.Overall I feel very positive on Zig."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Heh fun: this was inspired by Rustlings, which in turn was inspired by NodeSchool.Mozilla Berlin used to host NodeSchool and the Rust Hack &amp; Learn evenings. It became a bit of a hang spot, and at some point we had a pretty consistent group of folks who&#39;d go to both. Marisa realized Rust could use something similar to NodeSchool, and started hacking on Rustlings during these evenings — which now a few years later has really taken off!It&#39;s really cool to now see other languages in turn be inspired and follow from Rustlings ^^"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember when GTA 3 came out on PC and I found just a simple human-readable text file you could edit to modify all the settings for all the cars.We turned the Karuma into a physics defying monster. It was 1000x heavier than the tank, so as you drove down the road other cars just bounced off and flew over the horizon, or exploded on impact.Yet it still did 0-100 in 0.1 seconds and could drive up walls.One time we jumped it from the third island, over the middle island and landed on a skyscraper roof on the 1st island.From there we spent about an hour dropping grenades on police cars and the army who had no way to reach us up there.Fun times. Shame Twitch or YouTube didn’t exist back then to tell anyone about it!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe this site is the best place to ask. There are two major things we could use help with:- the games do not run particularly well on the raspberry pi (any version really) and I have a feeling it&#39;s at least partially due to the OpenGL layer. We could really use someone with how to optimize OpenGL (especially on the pi).- physics have always been wonky beyond 30fps.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am not surprised that the cost of context switching due to I/O readiness can often be roughly equal between async tasks and kernel threads. Normal blocking I/O can be surprisingly efficient because of various factors, such as a reduced need for system calls.Think about it this way—if you have a user-space thread which wakes up due to I/O readiness, then this means that the relevant kernel thread woke up from epoll_wait() or something similar. With blocking I/O, you call read(), and the kernel wakes up your thread when the read() completes. With non-blocking I/O, you call read(), get EAGAIN, call epoll_wait(), the kernel wakes up your thread when data is ready, and then you call read() a second time.In both scenarios, you’re calling a blocking system call and waking up the thread later.Of course, there are scenarios when epoll_wait() returns multiple events, which reduces the number of context switches. But the general result is that it’s not always easy to beat blocking I/O and kernel threads."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; People often see that there&#39;s some theoretical benefit of async and then they accept far less ergonomic coding styles and the additional bug classes that only happen on async due to accidental blocking etc... despite the fact that when you consider a real-world deployed application, those &#34;benefits&#34; become indistinguishable from noise. However, due to the additional bug classes and worse ergonomics, there is now less energy for actually optimizing the business logic, which is where all of the cycles and resource use are anyway, so in-practice async implementations tend to be buggier and slower.I disagree with this. I feel like using Async programming is actually much more powerfull and expressive than theaded programming, especially with Rust combinators on streams of futures (for examples: futures_unordered), which allow to trivially express complex concurrency patterns (such as: wait for the first two requests to return something and discard the third request&#39;s response, and btw also cancel that request). Async programming also allows for structured programming, where each task is an owned resource of a parent tasks, which means that lifetimes of tasks can be controlled and runaway threads can&#39;t exist (if one is avoiding tokio::spawn). I&#39;ve been developping [Garage](https://git.deuxfleurs.fr/Deuxfleurs/garage) for some time now (a simple distributed object store that implements a subset of S3, not ready for production!), and I&#39;ve been in awe about how easy it was to write these complex patterns using async Rust."</p>

So why should someone&#39;s education be tied to their school district or teacher quality?I would love to have the local school system provide lab space, athletics, support services and one-on-one tutoring as necessary.But the bulk should be delivered online.  Sal Khan is comprehensive and brilliant, but perhaps someone out there is better at chemistry or art history.  Regardless, every kid should be exposed to the &#34;best&#34; teacher of the subject.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fundamental challenge of GUIs is that they have state as a core concern. Unlike most systems, state is not an implementation detail that can be refactored away. It is central to the problem domain. The end user sees and cares about having a stateful system.The hardest part of dealing with state in a complex system is maintaining consistency in different places. Some instances of this this can be avoided by creating single-sources-of-truth, but in other cases you can&#39;t unify your state, or you&#39;re dealing with an external stateful system (like the DOM), and you have no choice but to find a way to keep separate pieces of state in sync.I should probably write a blog post on this"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is my personal opinion on it (not sure if it&#39;s the right one, though): Write the GUI independently of the model, let the GUI components update and communicate among each other as they like, and perform some validation in these GUI components. Translate between model and view only at one well-defined point at which there is also a final validation at the model side, and make sure model and view are only loosely coupled.Good GUIs have way too many requirements to be controlled (via a controller) by the model. As a typical example, the fact that a button should only be activated if there is data in a textbox has usually nothing to do with the underlying model. The model should only ever contain valid and consistent data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great discussion on the challenges of designing UI for complex applications.In the aggregate, what ends up being most effective for me, is rapid prototyping, and “paving the bare spots.”[0]I find that I do a terrible job of predicting user mental models.The rub with prototypes, is that they can’t be lash-ups, as they inevitably end up as ship code. This means that a lot of good code will get binned. It just needs to be accepted and anticipated. Sometimes, I can create a standalone project for code that needs to go, but I still feel has a future.So there’s always a need for fundamental high quality.What has been useful to me, is Apple’s TestFlight[1]. I write Apple software, and TestFlight is their beta distribution system.I start a project at a very nascent stage, and use TestFlight to prototype it. I use an “always beta” quality approach, so the app is constantly at ship quality; although incomplete.It forces me to maintain high quality, and allows all stakeholders to participate, even at very early stages. It’s extremely motivating. The level of enthusiasm is off the charts. In fact, the biggest challenge is keeping people in low orbit, so they don’t start thinking that you are a “WIZZARD” [sic].It also makes shopping around for funding and support easy. You just loop people into the TestFlight group. Since the app is already at high quality, there’s no need for chaperones or sacrifices to The Demo Gods.I like that it keeps development totally focused on the actual user experience. They look at the application entirely differently from me.[0] https://littlegreenviper.com/miscellany/the-road-most-travel...[1] https://developer.apple.com/testflight/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks really neat, it&#39;s amazing what an animated gif or video can do for a README to help to understand what a thing is meant to do.If I were more of a hacker and hadn&#39;t already paid the best 25 bucks I&#39;ve ever spent on CleanShot X [0] I&#39;d be all over this.[0]: https://cleanshot.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On windows shareX is king. I&#39;d say a good bit better even (miss it on my linux machine where I use flameshot)https://getsharex.com/A few things it does:https://i.imgur.com/FMMrVml.png- uploads text from your clipboard to pastebins and images to your image hoster- ftp upload (copying the http path to what you uploaded, full control over file naming ect). I built something to upload markdown via ftp and copy a url with the filename as an argument to the clipboard. That url leads to a js renderer for markdown.- doing mp4 videosOnly downsides: a bit complex in the settings, wants to update often.- numbering tool to quickly ad step 1, 2,3 to screenshots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great tool! But be careful though. In the default config there is a button next to the save local button which uploads your image as a public image to imgur without asking for confirmation.Fortunately you can remove the button via the settings menu though I do think it is a rather dangerous button to have there by default."</p>
