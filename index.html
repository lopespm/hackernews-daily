								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is informative.  I have found that databases in general tend to be less sexy than the front-end apps...especially with the recent cohort of devs. As an old bastard,  I would pass on one thing:  Realize that any reasonably used database will likely outlast the applications leveraging it. This is especially true the bigger it gets, and the longer it stays in production.  That said, if you are influencing the design of a database, imagine years later what someone looking at it might want to know if having to rip all the data out into some other store.  Having migrated many legacy systems, I tend to sleep better when I know the data is well-structured and easy to normalize.  In those cases, I really don&#39;t care so much about the apps.  If I can sort out (haha) the data, I worry less about the new apps I need to design.  I have been known to bury documentation into for-purpose tables...that way I know that info won&#39;t be lost.  Export the schema regularly, version it, check it in somewhere.  And, if you can, please, limit the use of anything that can hold a NULL. Not every RDBMS handles NULL the same way.   Big old databases live a looooong time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"#1 thing you should know, RDBMS can solve pretty much every data storage/retrieval problem you have.If you&#39;re choosing something other than an RDBMS - you should rethink why.Because unless you&#39;re at massive scale (which still doesn&#39;t justify it), choosing something else is rarely the right decision."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great post. Also highly recommend Designing Data-Intensive Applications
by Martin Kleppmann (https://www.amazon.com/Designing-Data-Intensive-Applications...). The sections on &#34;Storage and Retrieval&#34;, &#34;Replication&#34;, &#34;Partitioning&#34; and &#34;Transactions&#34; really opened up my eyes!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve had to deal with this with e-mail verification links and Auth0. 
The user clicked the link after getting it in their mailbox but then Auth0 throws up an error page because the e-mail address has already been verified (by Outlook scanning). 
The problem becomes worse if for some reason the mail ends up in the junk mail folder so the user thinks they&#39;ve never received the mail but when you check it looks like the e-mail address was verified successfully.
That has caused a lot of annoying back and forth trying to figure out what the hell is going on. We ended up adding a custom page to handle e-mail validation so we could handle the situation where the user lands on the page and the address has already been verified. Super annoying."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Microsoft does this because they&#39;re security scanning / checking all links in every Outlook email for known phishing and malware attacks. If Bing has not seen the web page  before and it&#39;s not in the Bing dangerous web page index it first needs to check it to make a determination of if it&#39;s a phishing/malware page by scanning/indexing  it before returning that outcome back to Outlook to flag the email as dangerous."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Outlook will only send GET requests, which are idempotent unless you&#39;re ignoring the spec. A message saying &#34;this code has already been used&#34; after sending a GET request is a bug.I don&#39;t see the problem here, all services need to do is add a page that&#39;s says &#34;welcome back, $Username, click here to log in!&#34; that sends a POST request to do any serious confirmation without breaking any specifications.Microsoft claims the visiting not is BingBot but it&#39;s probably just SmartScreen system checking for malicious links/downloads/etc. like many cloud integrated security products do these days.I can set my browser to pretend I&#39;m BingBot, you can&#39;t derive anything meaningful from the user agent. Unless you find your secret URLs in Bing&#39;s search results, your secret links aren&#39;t actually being monitored by a search engine."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m going to ignore the security angle and post my big fear.Chrome has dominance similar to IE at the height of its popularity.Whatever you think of their decisions, Apple is the only thing stopping a 90%+ Chrome web. (Note: not why they’re doing it, just a side effect)People keep arguing Apple is being anti-competitive. But no one seems to recon with the possible consequences of what they’re asking for. And I fear we may get a pyrrhic victory if these groups/governments keep pushing.No, I don’t know a good solution. But I don’t think letting Chrome totally own the web is a good outcome."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Comparing CVE counts is a bit nonsensical. For instance, Chrome and Firefox don&#39;t individually assign CVEs for internally reported vulnerabilities.For instance, in these patch notes Chrome lists &#34;Various fixes from internal audits, fuzzing and other initiatives&#34; and doesn&#39;t even look to have a CVE:https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2022/05/stable-channel...Or for Firefox, there&#39;s a dozen or so bundled together in a single CVE under &#34;Memory safety bugs fixed in Firefox 101&#34;:https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/security/advisories/mfsa2022-2..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not just in megaprojects either. In my large, fairly dense US city, basic, easy-to-build, local infrastructure like adding a 1-mile bike lane to a straight street is impossible because a handful of NIMBYs are constantly taken seriously by local politicians.My city has many bike lanes that are popular and well-used, as well as a bike-share program that is extremely popular. It also has a large number of cyclist deaths - including children! - due to the spottiness of existing bike infrastructure and overall lack of protected bike lanes. It seems like improving that infrastructure would be both easy, cheap, and popular, given the popularity of cycling and its existing infra, and the cheapness of plopping a concrete barrier onto a street. But no - the second anyone mentions protected bike lanes, a handful of NIMBYs write in with &#34;but muh cars&#34; and the politicians throw up their hands and surrender.I don&#39;t understand why NIMBYs have been taken so seriously in the US in the past 50 years. It seems like at any point in history, any local project will be opposed by somebody, no matter who they are or what the project is. But previous generations seemed to be able to get over that in favor of building. For today&#39;s generation it seems like doing nothing has become better than doing something. If this were the 1900s, government would have told the NIMBYs to get bent, we&#39;re building Thing X because it&#39;s good for society and if you don&#39;t like it, tough. That&#39;s what living in city means sometimes!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the things I love about Palladium (and closely related, Samo Burja&#39;s newsletter) is the depth of research.Like the detail that one of the most egregious episodes from California HSR involved a Spanish company that performed excellently on rail projects in Spain. Overall, this piece makes a strong case that the problem is specifically NIMBYism and loss of government institutional capacity.I think the million dollar question is how government organizations can hire and retain better. The current situation looks dire. Obviously a charismatic leader with a broad anti-NIMBY mandate would go a ways at getting competent people to want to work in government. You saw that succeed on a small scale with orgs like US Digital Service.The elephant, after that, is merit-based pay and promotion. Someone needs to sell this to the public. RN literally random cops and plumbers make mid six figures thru overtime while the directors of $100b mega-project are low-energy lifers making less than that. That&#39;s not gonna work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A friend has worked in construction project management for almost 40 years, mostly in Texas. A few years ago, he moved to San Francisco to work on the Van Ness project, which was approved in 2003, began construction in 2017 (!), went $40 million over budget, and finally completed this year. The project essentially added a median and some bus lanes to a two mile stretch of road through San Francisco and took 19 years.During his time in SF, no construction took place—so he told me he would essentially go into the office and do nothing while waiting for various city hearings to happen. After 8 months, he quit in frustration and moved back to Texas."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I always have mixed feelings when someone is warned about the riskiness / foolishness / stupidity of a course of action, and then suffers for it.On the one hand, there&#39;s a certain satisfaction or Schadenfreude in the sense of vindication. And it&#39;s pleasant to feel like my own wisdom or self-control has been validated.OTOH, I know that everyone has limited wisdom / self-control / intelligence, including me.  So it seems hypocritical to mock someone who trips, knowing that I&#39;m just lucky to sometimes avoid the hazards that would trip me up.In the end, about the only conclusions I&#39;m really confident in is that trouble besets us all, and usually it&#39;s good to default to kindness and sympathy.EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: I&#39;m not saying that I want swindlers to succeed.  I want such predation crushed into dust.  My comment is about the people who don&#39;t intend harm to others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Prominent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has defaulted on a loan worth more than $670 million. Digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital issued a notice on Monday morning, stating that the fund failed to repay a loan of $350 million in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDC, and 15,250 bitcoin, worth about $323 million at today’s prices.In other words, the $670 million that 3AC defaulted on was ~50:50 USDC and bitcoin.Then later:&gt; Zhu [3AC founder] is known for his incredibly bullish view of bitcoin. He said last year the world’s largest cryptocurrency could be worth $2.5 million per coin. But in May this year, as the crypto market began its meltdown, Zhu said on Twitter that his “supercycle price thesis was regrettably wrong.”This seems odd. How does a person convinced that bitcoin exchange is headed to $2.5 million take out a loan of 15K bitcoin if he actually thinks he&#39;ll be paying back it back at a higher exchange rate? Either the founder was bullish in principle but bearish in practice, or didn&#39;t have the first clue about what he was doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really don’t understand the business model of making massive fiat loans to “firms” to buy bitcoin. If crypto goes up, you get a small amount of interest. If crypto goes down, you lose everything. What? Lol. Just spend a fraction of the sum on bitcoin and do something safe with the rest. What was the plan?Edit: I guess when someone has “20 billion dollars” a 700mm loan doesn’t seem like a big risk."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised that none of the examples on Github or the website deals with join. I eventually found some in the &#34;book&#34; here: https://prql-lang.org/book/transforms/join.html    from employees
    join side:left positions [id==employee_id]

turns into    SELECT
      employees.*,
      positions.*
    FROM
      employees
      LEFT JOIN positions ON id = employee_id

I would love to see joins worked into the main learning examples. Without join, the examples lack a bit of the &#34;relation&#34; part; we could just as easily be compiling a DSL to a chain of `array.filter`, `array.reduce`, `array.map` calls. Joins are what makes relational modeling interesting!I would love to see Datalog/SPARQL-style implicit joins to make graph traversals like &#34;which users have edited documents I own?&#34; less verbose."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good overview, but even by 2014 we weren&#39;t calling hlt - there&#39;s a few problems there. Imagine the situation where you fork() a process on one CPU, and you have another CPU that recently called hlt. Ideally you&#39;d schedule it immediately instead of waiting for the next scheduler interrupt, but sending interrupts from one CPU to another (to break it out of hlt) is kind of expensive. The replacement is an instruction called mwait, which will (like hlt) wake the CPU up on interrupts, but will also wake up the CPU on a write to a specific memory address. If you want to wake up an idle CPU, the working CPU can just do that memory write and then the idle CPU will wake up back into the scheduler and figure out it has work to do.(Edit: there are still actually some circumstances in which hlt is called rather than mwait, but this is very CPU dependent and is based on vendor recommendations. Also, before mwait showed up, switching to deep CPU power saving states tended to involve performing magic IO port accesses rather than calling hlt, and yes the world was worse back then)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’ll just say. Since about 3.6/3.8 the language has been growing huge. Like C++ huge.I liked f-strings. Asyncio has its place but is waaay overused. Typing was a cool idea, but so awkward in practice.All of it has really turned me off, personally. It’s getting to where reading libraries is just painful.  The simplicity of the language was really beautiful and when I wanted type safety, etc. I’d use something else.  I can still write simple Python, but it’s more all the other code I need to grok.I find myself going to Go more and more for stuff I used to use Python for. It’s easier to set up a dev environment for other people, easier to distribute code, and gives me type safety and concurrency as first class citizens while being a very small language.I miss dictionary comprehensions and other shortcuts from time to time. But it actually feels more ergonomic now.All personal opinion. I’m fine shifting languages.  I still write C from time to time to bang bits.  I play with various LISPs to exercise my brain.  I never used Python for performance critical code.  I guess ML is changing that need.But I know others that want Java to have functional features and Python to have this stuff.I’m not saying I’m “right”, just uncomfortable in a place I used to love to hang out in."</p>

It improves users lives by more than almost everything else besides correctness. It’s been great to see the improvements in python."</p>

I feel like this would definitely get stopped and inspected, where a block of multicoloured plastic or resin might not be."</p>
