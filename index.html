								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m one of those people who is entirely bemused by violent videogames and films (I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people who would be bemused by my pastimes too). I&#39;m not trying to argue to stop anyone doing it, but I would really like to understand it better.Many video games are essentially simulators of things that we&#39;re prevented from doing in reality, because of the laws of nature or society. Whether that&#39;s dropping blocks into place, building a city, chasing and eating ghosts, flying a plane, performing magic spells, or engaging in physical violence.And there&#39;s a never-ending push to make experiences more photorealistic, to make simulator even better. From that I can only conclude that people want to get as close to the experience of perfoming the prevented act as possible.Chopping someone up is heavily frowned upon in real life, but perfectly acceptable to emulate in someone&#39;s living room. Somehow the simulation escapes the taboo. And that escape seems to be absolute: In the range of violent acts you could commit, from a gentle nudge to grisly murder, simulation of the most extreme extent is permitted.But if that&#39;s the case, why is the realistic simulation of some societal taboos (e.g. physical violence to the point of murder) mainstream, but others (e.g. sexual violence in any of its forms) not? They are both very serious offences, but somehow one gets a free pass to let anyone pretend to do it, but the other not.Is it a reflection on the ultimate limits of those taboos in the society that produces most of these games? Or is my logic broken somewhere?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of when I was at grad student in that area. It was really frustrating to read all of the studies from e.g. Anderson and Bushman asserting the links between violent media and aggression.These publications were headline-grabbing, but some of the study design was laughable. The whole state of affairs led me to leave the discipline (which led me to a career as a software engineer). I&#39;m glad that I did, because the reproducibility crisis hit hard within a few years of me deciding to do something else with my life.Some of the studies that I read made me think that there was a link between frustration (caused by e.g. undesirable outcomes in videogames, or performance issues like high latency) and aggression, but of course the researchers assumed it was the violence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last time I play Assassin&#39;s Creed:Origin, I have to stop halfway because I&#39;m tired of all those senseless killing. I feel bad and sad for those virtual Roman soldier I&#39;ve killed, how can that even happened? (P.S. I&#39;m not the only one)I think part of it is because videogames graphics and animation these day is so realistic(and it will keep getting more real) All the blood and gore and violence and how you kill someone are realistically depicted. Or maybe its objective clashes with my identity and values(I&#39;m not okay running around and killing people in real life, of course)Note that I can &#34;kill&#34; hundreds of infantry in Dynasty Warrior game (which is much less realistic) and doesn&#39;t feel a single thing.I believe that what you consume, whatever it is, effect you one way or another, despite &#34;researcher&#34; tell you otherwise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love how there were people in the upper floor just walking by without even looking. &#34;Oh, the robots are dancing again.&#34;In between the advances in &#34;holographic&#34; displays (not quite as sci-fi as we would want, but they are progressing), commercial space flight, cybernetic prosthetics, CRISPR and this... we are living in the future. It&#39;s amazing.It makes me a little sad more people are not aware of the ridiculously cool technical advancements going on lately. Many of my relatives and friends in my home country haven&#39;t even heard about any of these. They&#39;re not mentioned in the news or magazines whatsoever. Granted, they probably don&#39;t have any use for this information for their daily lives... but I do believe learning about this keeps alive my sense of childlike wonder, and it&#39;s sad to know others are missing out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I didn&#39;t know who Boston Dynamics was, I would have said that this is just CGI. The animations look so fake. I think the issue is that they&#39;re aggressively smoothing the motion since mechanical systems don&#39;t have the ability to accelerate &amp; jerk as fast as biological systems. Cheap mocap animation has the same problem because the frame rate of the capture system is too low. They interpolate between captured keyframes which results in the wrong velocities in the end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of commments on military applications, but bipedal robots are inferior to wheel vehicles, planes, and aerial drones, in terms of speed and maneuverability.Everyone&#39;s so afraid of Terminators hunting them down, when in reality, mostly invisible , and mostly silent, Predator drones from a mile away that will kill you with precisely targeted missiles should be your real fear. Or commercial quad-copters carrying anti-personnel mines.The expense, complexity, power, etc to build bipedal assassins is higher than wheeled RC vehicles, quad copters, and missiles.The weapons that exist today are much more scary than these robots."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The writing style is awesome, I literally laughed out loud.Beyond that, the article reminds us that in every industry there are powerful actors that protect their monopoly, and will coerce the government into helping them.I read an article about import taxes on sugar that were created to keep out competition, and as a result everything uses corn syrup. Other examples abound.Unfortunately, the solution of government oversight of itself (such as FBI breathing down the neck of the NSA), has  obvious circular drawbacks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At the beginning of the article I was thinking surely there are more important things to write about, but it dives down a pretty absurd rabbit hole. Especially funny is when the pasta spokesperson begins commiserating that the reporter is making more work for them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Semi related: there was a major shift in pasta market during 2004 EU extension. To comply with EU regulations, companies from newly joining countries had to invest large sums to switch to a different type of wheat to keep producing. Malma (biggest Polish pasta company) took a big credit for this, unfortunately they took it in a subsidiary of an Italian bank, whose CEO was also a chairman of Barilla. The bank soon demanded instant full repayment of the credit, which bankrupted Malma.Big Pasta is as bad as any other big industry.Edit: as the comment below says, there were other factors at play around same time (reduced demand from Russia and interest rates spike) contributing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at a company that heavily used the maps API in 2018. The 1,400% price hike really was an eye opener. It wasn&#39;t just the money involved, which was large, but the fact that it came so suddenly and with so much magnitude.Google&#39;s choice to bump these prices made me realize that they could do the same thing with their compute cloud pricing or other APIs, again with little notice. That, in turn, led to the realization that we needed to remove our reliance on Google&#39;s entire stack, and quickly, or we&#39;d be in a terrible bargaining position later.This one choice by the maps team likely cost Google significantly in the medium to long term, if any other companies realized the same things we did."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really want to use Apple Maps full time on my iPhone, just because of how much clutter Google Maps has accumulated on the screen.If anything tells me Google is losing the ability to innovate it&#39;s the newly added pill buttons for pre-set searches and branded POIs on the map. I remember when this was added to MapQuest circa 2010, and was the transition from trying to have an excellent mapping experience to just adding revenue focused features.Google is still operating from an extremely strong position, by nature of having nearly infinite budget and owning their mapping and search dataset. It&#39;s concerning that the iOS app seems to be suffering from the same issues that preceded the gradual downfall of MapQuest from a product perspective."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great article, but I think the conclusion about Google Maps languishing because it’s a low margin product is wrong.While Google Maps as a distinct product has a bottom and top line I think the author underestimates the value that the underlying places data has for Google’s core search product.The local place data is _massivley_ important to search. I don’t see any foreseeable way Google let’s the product that generates it languish. It’s far too strategic for them. Not to mention the amount of brand value maps has for them as an ecosystem.My view is that as Google’s Maps advantage dwindles, they’ll do more and more strategic acquisitions of places data sources. Tying more data into their closed ecosystem. Whether the new tech anti-trust landscape in the US and EU allows this is another question."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In-person social organizations.Social isolation is probably the biggest cause of unhappiness in advanced countries. Having a strong social network has lots of advantages including providing better romantic and career opportunities, as well as improving physical and psychological health.Humans have a long history of dishing out lots of money to be parts of strong communities too--country clubs and fraternities have high fees. Church goers regularly give up 10% of their (gross) income to be part of that group. Cult members might even hand over ALL of their possessions to join.The camaraderie and experiences that go along with being part of a strong, long lived community tends to be the thing people value most in life. Yet finding those communities has become increasingly difficult in the modern era. People move away to different cities, or just don&#39;t run into the same set of people everyday. With the rise of remote work, social disconnection is only going to rise. I think there&#39;s a lot of room to create new social organizations with pretty minimal technology, and make a pretty profit from doing so. Humans are still human--they want those connections--they mostly just need an introduction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Premium-feeling laptops that aren&#39;t Apple machines.Yes yes, I get the economical barriers. I&#39;m past caring. It is so incredibly frustrating to look outside the Apple ecosystem and feel like the entire PC industry is content to sell the bare minimum of quality (outside of Gamer hardware, which looks obscene - but I get that it&#39;s subjective).It&#39;s a horrible business idea on the numbers and nobody would do this, but if some lunatic out there wants to blow the money, build and sell a laptop at whatever price point you want that:- Supports CoreBoot- Isn&#39;t a rebranded Clevo shell and has close enough fit and finish to a recent MacBook. Read: No. Plastic. Case.- If there is ever the phrase &#34;panel lottery&#34; uttered about your machine, you&#39;ve messed up.- No logos, or throw them on the underside like Purism.- The screen has to be relatively close to the MacBook in brightness + viewing angles. Give me an option for a glossy screen.- Trackpad must be glass. You won&#39;t get close to the MBP trackpad on the first or second pass, but try.- Go for some crazier vertical integration ala the M1. I don&#39;t care if it blocks upgrading certain parts, since I consider the industry to move fast enough that I won&#39;t _want_ the machine anymore in 4-5 years.- There is no need for touch of any kind, nor the ability to flip the screen or anything. Just make a damn laptop.- Edit: high quality boutique feeling support. I don&#39;t need an Apple Store equivalent, but at least invest in this.I get why Apple can do all of the above. I would pay literally twice what I pay Apple for a competing product. Currently, every laptop that I try feels like stepping back a few years.The upcoming Purism Librem 14, in terms of images, feels like it could _feel_ close - but I&#39;m not impressed with their other products so I&#39;ll believe it when I see it. I remain shocked that System76 hasn&#39;t bothered with this.End my rant about this industry, I guess."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Standardized interchangeable packaging for consumer goods.Ever been to a book store in Japan? Practically every book is the same size. As a result, bookshelves also are designed to be the right size to optimally fit books. This allows people to fit more books in small homes. It makes books easier to transport in book-sized boxes and book-sized bags too. You can get perfectly-fitting reusable cloth covers to protect your library books.American bookstores are a war between publishers to stick out from the shelves as much as possible. There&#39;s not much that a bookshelf designer can do except guess and have adjustable, oversized shelving.That also describes the state of today&#39;s packaging. With more shopping happening online, the need for items to stand out on a shelf is lower, and the need for them to fit nicely in boxes is much higher.Nobody would force you to design your products to fit the closest available standard package size, but companies would tend to do so more often because of the efficiency gains. Logistics companies like Amazon or Fedex could offer incentives."</p>

I want a consumer-grade backup medium that can provide at least a 100 years of lifetime.That said, I was able to recover 90% of the voice recordings my father made between 1959-1963 on reel-to-reel tapes 60 years later.

Good work!)[1] https://openinframap.org/[2] https://www.openrailwaymap.org/[3] https://opentopomap.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"OP, terminology nit: a thru-hike is a way of completing a long-distance hike, not a type of hike in itself. It just means completing the entire trail in one continuous go. You can section hike (do pieces over the years) any of these long-distance trails, and that would not be a thru."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice list! Noticed a few decent US hiking trails that aren&#39;t on it though. There are tons more of course, especially if you include BDR stuff.Ice age trail - https://www.iceagetrail.orgSuperior hiking trail - https://superiorhiking.org/John Muir trail - https://www.johnmuirtrail.org/Long trail - https://www.greenmountainclub.org/the-long-trail/Pacific Crest trail - https://www.pcta.org/Hayduke trail - http://www.hayduketrail.org/Arizona trail - https://aztrail.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bit off-topic but related to the intro in this readme..&gt; Why?
&gt; I&#39;m super bored in lockdown. Add a Raspberry Pi 400 and a few tiny displays...I feel like there are two distinct kinds of lockdown experience. One, you have kids, and you have absolutely no free time because now your kids are home and you&#39;re working from home. Two, you don&#39;t have kids, and you&#39;re super bored every day. Seems like not much in between."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These 240x240 IPS displays are awesome and dirt-cheap. The best &#34;application&#34; I&#39;ve seen for them is a tiny retro game console [1].[1] https://www.funkey-project.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lotta cool/interesting applications for a tiny display like that. Thanks for sharing. :)."</p>
