								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People use centralized systems because they actually like the convenience that comes with it. And with that, comes the decentralized system changing in such a way that it changes to almost NEEDING centralization. The problem is that engineers and cybersecurity people all think that everyone else thinks like they do, when in actuality the complete opposite is true.The biggest example is the internet itself - the internet is a completely decentralized network until it wasn&#39;t, with website certs becoming required. People use popular web hosting because it&#39;s easier and just better than what they could do. Email is completely decentralized, and it&#39;s very easy to set up your own web server - as long as you want every single spam system to immediately block all of your messages.&#34;Decentralized&#34; systems will all go the exact same way. And it&#39;s because people don&#39;t want to spend time setting up their own shit, they are very happy to pay in either money or data to have someone else do it for them. Yeah, it&#39;s very easy to say &#34;well just set up your own thing&#34; but once you get to a critical mass of everyone using Gmail instead of their own server then the system becomes unusable without centralization.Decentralization is a fantastic idea, and it works great in theory, but it fails to actually consider any of the practical problems that come with decentralization and doesn&#39;t consider what people who aren&#39;t programmers actually want to do with their time and money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; A lot of Web3 platforms are in fact centralized. Your wallet (MetaMask), marketplaces (OpenSea), APIs (Alchemy) are all central platforms. Sure, they use a distributed database (blockchain), but before that it’s still a Go app on AWS, meaning its centralized.&gt; Your wallet (MetaMask)Run your own node. This is lazy reporting to reach the end point about fawning over FreeBSD (its in the article, literally an article about having fun staying poor), when you can just as easily inspire and teach people how to use custom RPCs. There is an opportunity to inspire people with the tools to know what to look for, even if it&#39;s absurd to suggest people actually compile and run a node themselves. Tell them why the default behavior is a convenience and if they are interested in the decentralized parts then here is what to do.&gt; marketplaces (OpenSea)Yep. It is a GUI ontop of their smart contracts (public access backend code). You don&#39;t have to use their GUI. You should inspect their smart contracts for centralized control, or at least look to see if anyone else has. There is an opportunity to inspire people with the tools to know what to look for, even if its absurd to suggest people actually do all the analysis themselves.&gt; APIs (Alchemy) are all central platformsa fine example. don&#39;t use Alchemy or Infura as your RPC endpoints? Why not just make blog posts about that?This kind of energy could just as easily be steered into &#34;how to improve the concept of Web3&#34; which lots of people are actually doing. It could just as easily be &#34;This isn&#39;t decentralized! Let me fix that!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some platforms like Ethereum are completely decentralized. You forfeit some of this decentralization bit by bit when using MetaMask, OpenSea or Alchemy, but the platform itself is still decentralized. The Web is completely decentralized, by you forfeit some of this decentralization bit by bit when using Paypal, Facebook, or AWS. The trend in technology has always been to trade control for convenience. This doesn&#39;t stop you from writing your own browser and pushing packets out of your own HTTP server.The (now infamous) Andre Cronje had a whimsical tweet reminiscing on his days as a lawyer: &#34;The contracts aren&#39;t for when everything is going right. They&#39;re for when everything is going wrong.&#34; Some network wide catastrophe is seemingly inevitable for any sufficiently large system. When these occur it will be the decentralized blockchains like Ethereum with failsafes in place to survive, and it&#39;s the centralized blockchains like Binance that will implode."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Self-hosting is something that we should be constantly iterating on making easier; it&#39;s really the path forward for privacy centric folks. The main challenges are managing workload scheduling (SystemD is complicated for a layperson). Networking is another challenge; for instance, if you wanted all or part of these services to remain offline or on a Mesh VPN there&#39;s a lot of knowledge required.There&#39;s some projects trying to tackle the workload orchestration piece; CasaOS (https://www.casaos.io/) being one of my favorites but there&#39;s also Portainer (https://portainer.io). TailScale and and ZeroTier are great for Mesh VPN networking, where you may need to run some workloads in the cloud but want them networked with your home applications (or just to keep them offline). They also allow you to access applications running on a home server that doesn&#39;t have a static IP. Cloudflare Access is okay; I haven&#39;t tried it because it deviates from the mesh VPN model significantly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why I&#39;m building Timelinize [1]. It&#39;s a follow-up to my open source Timeliner project [2], which has the potential to download all your digital life onto your own computer locally, and projects it all onto a single timeline, across all data sources (text messages, social media sites, photos, location history, and more).It&#39;s a little different from &#34;self hosting&#34; but it does have a similar effect of bringing all your data home and putting it in your control. We have to start somewhere, might as well start with bringing in all the data we&#39;ve put out there. (It&#39;s not a replacement for self-hosted media servers, for example.)The backend and underlying processing engine is all functional and working very well; now I&#39;m just getting the UI put together, so I hope to have something to share later this year.[1]: https://twitter.com/timelinize (website coming eventually)[2]: https://github.com/mholt/timeliner"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Self hosting is hard. You need to take care of security, backups, software updates, software installation and so on.Even on something like a QNAP (which can be compared to managed hosting) this can be hard. Flip the wrong switch and you expose something to the world. Missed a security update: your device is now vulnerable.While I host a lot of things myself I can understand self hosting is not for everyone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First of all, it is amazing that the author managed to analyze the patch in so much details, it probably is an effort comparable to the bug fix itself. Still I think the article is missing some bits. I would expect any core migration to require barriers (either implicit or explicit) on both the old and new core otherwise the process would risk seeing its own stores and loads out of order.But in this case the barrier is predicated on the execution of some cache manipulation instruction, so I suspect things are more complicated. Maybe these specific cache manipulation instructions do not respect the usual architectural memory ordering and require some different set of barriers. Possibly they bypass cache coherence completely and require an actual flush of the cache. That is going to be very expensive and it make sense that it is only done only if the process was actually fiddling with these instructions. &#39;jmgao&#39; else thread reported that tegra has coherency issues on migration, so it might be related."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Makes you think, do Linux, Windows and Mac handle this properly? Honestly, I doubt it!Context switches, idle state transitions, etc tend to be fairly delicately handled as a common cause of CVEs and Heisenbugs.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s still plenty of bugs but more attention ends up being paid to these things on general purpose operating systems.  More eyeballs on the code, more security researchers, more hardware variants to expose things that were thought to be fine.  Also fuzzing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And how do you even find / debug a bug like this?As someone who has worked on cache code, I suspect it&#39;s quite possible they were just reviewing this code again and realised the potential hole. Or they were trying to track down some horrific bug and fixed this along the way (whether or not it caused it), reviewing anything to do with caching is probably worth doing because it&#39;s notoriously difficult to get right, especially with context switching involved.Another possibility is that the bug is more deterministic than it looks, under the right conditions, and they managed to replicate it and analyse it in a debugger."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve spent a long time with folding bikes over the years. My advice: bite the bullet and buy a Brompton[1].Yes, Bromptons are expensive.  But they ride like a bicycle, have gears, a stiff enough frame, luggage racks etc.  There&#39;s very little compromise.  The fastest I&#39;ve done on mine is 45 kph and I&#39;ve ridden 70km in a day. I carry it on and off buses and trains multiple times a day without issue.In the past I had an A-bike[2].  It&#39;s a fun and cute little design but the wheels are absolutely tiny and has no gears.  You feel like you&#39;re riding a folding contraption rather than a bicycle. The build quality was rather plasticky too.  I like the idea of an A-shape with telescoping tubes. It&#39;s quite an ingenious fold.I&#39;ve also ridden (but not owned) a Pacific CarryMe[3].  The ride experience again suffers for the short wheels and no gears, but it could be useful for some.  The fold still leaves you with quite a long package.I&#39;d love to try the Kwiggle bike.  I don&#39;t think the strange seat will cause as many problems as people think, but I suspect the overall ride experience to be a bit bouncy and flexy. Maybe it&#39;s worth it for the small fold.For a more out-there design I think the Halbrad/Half-Bike[4] could be quite nice but it never really got past the prototype stage.  Under-seat steering is a bit of an adjustment too.[1] https://www.brompton.com/[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A-bike[3] https://pacificcarryme.com/[4] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TQIC138vmlE"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thank you for having us here to discuss Kwiggle. I am the inventor and owner of Kwiggle and would like to give you some insights:We have been developing Kwiggle for 10 years and producing Kwiggle for almost 3 years.Every detail has been carefully designed to create a 10kg lightweight folding bike that can even be folded into hand luggage and still go as fast as a normal bike. We have selected materials and manufacturing processes for the drive unit and rims with the highest wear resistance in the bicycle market. We use high-strength aluminum and stainless steel parts for the frame and have extensively tested the stability of the frame and drive unit dynamically and statically.Our 35 suppliers for material, components and parts manufacture according to our requirements with highest precision, because precision is another important factor for stable and durable components of a folding bike.In the meantime, our greatest motivation is the many enthusiastic feedbacks from our many customers, who at the moment still come mainly from Germany. We are already shipping the Kwiggle all over the world and Kwiggle already is ridden on every continent.So we are happy if you take a close look. Please assume that we have already thought about almost every little critical detail that is discussed.So if you are looking for a very compact folding bike, feel free to take a close look.The movement on the Kwiggle is new, but very close to your natural walk. And when even a 85-year-old man writes to us, &#34;I can only do two things: ride a rollator and ride a Kwiggle, but I enjoy the Kwiggle more.&#34; Then you can assume that you can ride the Kwiggle very well, too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks absolutely amazing, but calling it &#34;affordable&#34; at €1600+ is a stretch. You can find non-electric folding bikes for under €200 that are quite sturdy and dependable (although not that small when folded).A few months ago I bought a used folding bike for €100, equipped it with a motor and battery that cost less than €400, for use on train trips.Nothing feels better than getting out of a long-distance train trip, unfolding your bike and going about your way in a different city... No taxis, no complex public transport map to understand, nothing but freedom."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The comments on this thread seem to be quite wildly missing White&#39;s point. Many of the arguments taking place here seem premised on the idea that Ken White has attempted to solve, once and for all, the &#34;cancel culture&#34; problem --- or somehow write a dispositive argument that &#34;cancel culture&#34; isn&#39;t real.He&#39;s not doing any of these things. He&#39;s responding to a specific NYT staff editorial.White agrees with many of you that disproportionate responses to speech happen, are harmful, and are occurring regularly. He cites several instances, from both sides of the American political spectrum. You don&#39;t have to come up with an elaborate argument about how White is wrong about how harmful &#34;cancel culture&#34; is; White almost certainly agrees with you (at least in a general sense; maybe not in your particulars).His point is that you have to discuss something more particular than &#34;the right to speak your mind without fear of shame or shunning&#34;. You&#39;ve never had that right. You can&#39;t have it. To be free of shame or shunning is to be free of other people&#39;s speech. If you&#39;re saying something provocative, you are almost certainly responding in a sense to something someone else said; if you think you have the right to speak without shame or shunning, so does the person you&#39;re effectively responding to. At best, you&#39;re arguing for what White has in the past mockingly referred to as a &#34;replevin of feels&#34;; at worst, what you&#39;re asking for is totally incoherent.This Substack post would be bigger news if Ken White had, Solomonically, worked out the whole problem of disproportionate responses to speech. He has not, and I think he&#39;s probably much too smart to try. He&#39;s just critiquing someone else&#39;s bad argument. That&#39;s all you really have to engage with here; you don&#39;t have to let cortisol trick you into believing this is an amassing of the forces of &#34;cancel culture isn&#39;t real&#34; that you must mobilize against."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&#34;Our failure to have a serious discussion about defining “cancel culture” encourages this. When some people vaguely complain about “cancel culture” in a way that lends itself to promoting this constant partisanship, other people not unreasonably see it as partisan.&#34;Popehat seems to be falling into the trap of thinking the precisely defining something will lead to clarity. It rarely, if ever, does. Each one of us has our own conception of a term - wordfeel, if you will - and virtually no one actually knows or holds to the literal dictionary definition. We hear words and apply them if they seem right to us. Even if you managed to precisely define cancel culture, people would easily try to claim that some alleged cancelling event it is actually something else, &#34;accountability&#34;, &#34;showing you the door&#34;, etc.. Never underestimate someone&#39;s ability to lawyerly redefine what something is or isn&#39;t.Additionally, I think Popehat is dead wrong here:&gt;&#34;Saying we should “end cancel culture” means we’re saying some people should refrain from some exercises of speech and association to promote other people feeling more free to speak.&#34;No rights are actually being infringed by this. It is possible to have cultural mores that are in the spirit of free speech. The opposite stance, not calling on people to end cancel culture, is also accepting a reduction in speech. Even so, by Popehat&#39;s own worldview, because the government is not restricting cancel culture this shouldn&#39;t be seen as some infringement of liberty.  I don&#39;t know what Popehat actually wants here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with the debate on &#34;cancel culture&#34; is a lack of specificity. The fact is that there are certain occasions where &#34;canceling&#34; seems fine, and others, where it does not. And I think a problem with the progressive argument is the refusal to acknowledge that there can ever be any excesses.For example, there is the case of Dorian Abbot, who was disinvited from an MIT lecture after he wrote an op-ed criticizing affirmative action [1], even though the MIT lecture had nothing to do with affirmative action. I just don&#39;t see how allowing him to speak about climate science significantly impinges on the free speech of the members of the MIT community who found his views objectionable. I think it&#39;s also significant that 73% of the US population agrees with Abbot (I support affirmative action for the record). Basically the message that I get from MIT&#39;s behavior is that if you have a thoroughly mainstream opinion, you better not mention it in public if you want to have a successful academic career. This is chilling for science. If I were still a practicing social scientist, I wouldn&#39;t touch any hot button social issue with a ten foot pole. Or at least not if I wasn&#39;t prepared to p-hack a socially acceptable result.I also think that shutting out views that you disagree with is terrible for personal intellectual development. Only hearing views that correspond to your priors is a recipe for group-think and intellectual laziness. I make a point of trying to read a wide range of opinions (National Review to Jacobin) because I believe having my ideas challenged makes them stronger. I don&#39;t see how you can have an informed opinion about anything without doing the same.Lastly, if the polls that nytimes cite are true, &#34;cancel culture&#34; is a huge political mistake for progressive. It risks making the democratic brand toxic so that electoral victory, and any real change is impossible.[1] https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/20/us/dorian-abbot-mit.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; (I found it while looking for information about dbus)The first place I search for tech related commentary is on https://hn.aloglia.com/ to see what articles were shared and who commented what on a particular topic on news.yc. It has served me well.Many &#34;experts&#34; have taken to twitter instead of commenting here (kind of self-censored themselves from entering the discussions here) which is a shame, as twitter is an endless pit that is nigh on impossible to filter for quality opinion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the first time I&#39;ve heard of HN described as &#34;warm&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would like to echo this. I found HN during my first internship, I was pre-med, but got a job imaging laptops.They had a fully manual setup, so I built a PXE server and automated it. Using the extra time, I browsed HN and taught myself Python (off of someone here&#39;s recommendation).I went back to schoool in the fall and ace intro to programming, fail Organic Chemistry, and the rest was history.I&#39;m 25 now, starting my own company coming off of a few years in the industry and I have no idea how I would&#39;ve done it without this community. You all were the anonymous angels and devils on my metaphorical shoulders."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a user, why would I choose this?I only see a benefit to developers for this, but from a user prospective going with another system is a downgrade.Assuming google works like Apple (correct me if I am wrong), disabling a subscription should be able to happen from a central location with a click or 2.If I instead go with the billing through a company not only do they now have my credit card information, but I have to go through them to cancel. Meaning they can send me through screen after screen trying to convince me to stay (dark pattern) or even worse forcing me to call to cancel.As a user, if you want to offer this fine. But as long as the ability to subscribe through Google or Apple is not removed I will be fine. But if this starts a trend of more and more apps having their own billing that then uses dark patterns to keep me subscribed... I will just end up spending less money on subscriptions than I currently do, and I have quite a few subscriptions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Over the coming months, Spotify will work with Google’s product and engineering teams to build this new experience&#34;It&#39;s so absolutely bizarre to announce something at this stage. I wonder what is prompting it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do see one potential customer benefit: rather than increasing your attack surface by giving two companies your CC info you just give one (google).  In theory Google is going to have more security than a bunch of smaller companies.I use Apple Pay whenever possible for this precise reason.  I don&#39;t want to trust Target with my CC info.Of course since under this scheme the company I&#39;d be sharing my card info with is the largest dossier assembling company in the world, so I wouldn&#39;t be comfortable with it.  But presumably they will collect the info anyway (even though they aren&#39;t subject to the same regulation as the credit bureaux or credit card networks), so perhaps going directly through them doesn&#39;t make things worse and at least eliminates one risk (spotify themselves)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand how they can say &#34;unsuccessful attempt to compromise the account of a customer support engineer&#34; . then can say &#34;Following the completion of the service provider’s investigation, we received a report from the forensics firm this week. The report highlighted that there was a five-day window of time between January 16-21, 2022, where an attacker had access to a support engineer’s laptop. This is consistent with the screenshots that we became aware of yesterday.&#34; and the screenshots of the attackers looking at Okta&#39;s support portal."</p>
