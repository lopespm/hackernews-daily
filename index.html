								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First of all, this is a very cool web hack, I like it very much.I have a question. It&#39;s a 668.8MB database file. What does actually happen if the query has to scan 300 mb before finding the right answer? Wouldn&#39;t it be better to do the work up front and deliver the answers as static json files? Sure you loose the flexibility of dynamic queries, but do you really have that flexibility in non trivial cases (e.g. 300 mb search)?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man you are a frickin genius, seriously. like how you put all this together all the depth of knowledge of different topics this would require the low level and the high level and the way you explain it simply confidently and with impact. Your work is really an inspiration. You computer scienced the sheet out of this thing.this achievement, and this blog post, to me is on par with blog posts that you would see from a major company where they solve some significant business critical technical challenge in-house. for example: the GitHub blog post about how they created their spinning globe of commits on their homepage, or a Netflix blog post of how they optimized their Network infrastructure to serve so many customers.you&#39;re work is truly incredible. You&#39;re next level of next level."</p>

    order by rowid desc limit 100

It fetches just 54.2KB of new data (across 49 small HTTP requests) to return 100 results - from a statically hosted database file that&#39;s 668.8MB!I have an animated GIF demo of this here: https://twitter.com/simonw/status/1388933800445452290"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My $1200 7 year old Miele dishwasher stopped working a few months ago, with the “Intake/drain” light on red when starting a load. Dishwashers during the pandemic were sort of scare due to massive home remodeling demand, and the professional repair people would have cost $300 just to diagnose, so I went to try to fix it myself.It turns out the water intake valve solenoid was jammed or gummed up somehow, as applying 120V to it directly had no effect. I went to find an OE replacement online only to find that they are $580, sold by only 2 places, and sold out. You need to be a certified Miele technician to buy them.Given I knew the specifications from the model number and the printing on the solenoid itself wrt voltage and flow rate, I bought the cheapest replacement I could find on Amazon, spliced the wires into the existing harness and boom, it worked perfectly.One thing I didn’t understand was why there were so many different inlet valves that all did the same thing. There were 120V AC and 12V DC versions but other than that the only difference was the water connector/dongle/bracket. It seemed absurd there would be so many but the reality is that actual solenoid is super generic and should only cost $20 and should be made to fit them all. Of course nobody really repairs things these days but I think this is the reason why. Even when the part could easily be standardized and replaced/repaired like a light bulb, companies want you to buy a whole new one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actual news about hacking! It is interesting that this is in the UK ... i&#39;m fairly sure most rents come with a full-sized dishwaster when furnished and all properties have the plumbing for one. I&#39;m not sure what the market is. Especially that one of the main value adds was &#34;no mess&#34; when our dishwashers all accept pre-form tablets for detergent.Anyway, I adore these kinds of blog posts. Tinkering, naughtiness and a big dollop of technical knowhow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Loved the obsessiveness! FWIW the entire beer-brewing industry runs on NaOH for cleaning and sanitising. Disposing of it is not quite as environmentally-friendly as the dishwasher manufacturer seems to want you to believe -- in most places you&#39;d be in serious trouble if you poured any significant quantity down the drain.eta: I&#39;ve just looked up the constituents of the dishwasher tablets we&#39;ve been using, and yes, indeed, they&#39;re mostly NaOH, an inert carrier (Na2SO4) and a variety of water-softeners, packaging films to keep everything in tablet form (but soluble) and a small number of helper enzymes, perfumes and whiteners. Looks like a teaspoon of NaOH might work justabout as well. :D"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A common one is fake consent popups for system notifications.Websites need to ask for consent before sending system notifications via the Notifications API. If a user declines, that website is blocked from asking again (for obvious reasons)But many websites cheat this by showing a fake consent popup designed to mimic what the browser would show. If a user clicks &#34;Decline&#34; on the fake popup, the website won&#39;t show the real one to avoid being blocked. So the next time you visit the site, they&#39;ll be able to show you that popup again as many times as they want.If a user finally clicks &#34;Accept&#34; on the fake popup (out of frustration probably) then they&#39;ll show the real popup. To most people, seeing two popups might seem like a glitch, and will just mindlessly click &#34;Accept&#34; twice.The only way to circumvent this is to click &#34;Accept&#34; on the fake popup, and then click &#34;Decline&#34; on the real one. 99% of people aren&#39;t going to know how to do that....I&#39;d post this myself as a comment, but I don&#39;t like that it&#39;s asking for so much personal information (full name, email, state, city, phone, etc)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;hold-your-offline-device-hostage-until-you-attempt-to-connect&#34; pattern. It goes something like this:When setting up a new unlinked kindle device, Amazon tries to trick you into connecting to the internet by showing a wifi setup screen that cannot be skipped. The only way to skip it is to supply the device with bad credentials and let it attempt to connect and fail. Only when it fails will it allow its owner to skip that step.Microsoft has also started employing the same strategy in windows 10. Within the first year of setting up windows 10 locally, the user will be presented with a screen they can&#39;t dismiss until they link their local user account with an online microsoft account. Again, the workaround here is to let windows try to connect with bad credentials. Once it has failed to login, it will allow the user, a child who urgently needed to get to her online classes in my case, to skip this step.Words can&#39;t describe the contempt I have for companies who engage in these patterns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TrustArc is a company used by major brands that utilizes dark patterns to FAKE opt-out time for GDRP compliance.  Major companies employ lies.  It will hold your browser captive for 2 minutes in hopes that you cancel or accept all.  If you don&#39;t, it shows &#34;We are processing the requested change to your cookie preferences. This may take up to a few minutes to process.&#34;.  Not even incompetence could make this an honest process."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The speedup is very noticeable. Like others I&#39;m running the &#34;native-comp&#34; branch of Emacs, since months, without any issue.It&#39;s now been merged into trunk and it&#39;s going to be the default:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26935401The only drawback I saw is that compiling Emacs itself takes 3x to 4x longer when compiling the native-comp branch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think that nativecomp represents a huge leap forward for emacs. I continually give kudos to Andrea Corallo and the entire team for making this a possibility.I think that the next major leap for emacs needs to involve the garbage collector and allocation logic. I think that a large class of performance optimizations would be possible with an improved GC, including improvements to emacs existing threading capabilities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"gccemacs is amazing!  I&#39;ve been using for more than a year on macOS and NixOS, and it&#39;s been superb (though from time to time I clear downloaded packages and the native cache just in case).  It&#39;s definitely an impressive feat of engineering as well. If you haven&#39;t seen the developer&#39;s website on it[0], you should definitely check it out.For Nix users on macOS, see[1].  Here&#39;s how I used it in my home-manager config[2].  For Nix users on Linux and NixOS, see the Emacs overlay[3].  There&#39;s even Emacs nativecomp + wayland support (emacsPgtkGcc) there.[0] https://akrl.sdf.org/gccemacs.html[1] https://github.com/twlz0ne/nix-gccemacs-darwin[2] https://github.com/siraben/dotfiles/blob/8161e1b72965b48f822...[3] https://github.com/nix-community/emacs-overlay"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent years working on the Ubuntu phone. It was a fully convergent device: by default it would present a phone UI, but plugin an a keyboard and screen and it presents a full desktop UI. The UI was designed by a team of brilliant professional designers and it was a technical success.Why isn&#39;t it around any more?(1) The carriers. Many people get a free or heavily subsidized phone from their carrier, who makes money from the data charges. Carriers were just not interested in phones from smaller manufacturers, and it&#39;s not entirely clear that there is no backflow of cash involved at higher levels. There is also the issue of controlling access to user metadata, always a profitable exercise.(2) The manufacturers: why would they put a third-party OS on their phone when they control the entire stack from the silicon to the end-user&#39;s metadata through their in-house Android fork? They can sell hardware at a negative margin if they can profit from selling access to metadata, or possibly data.(3) The apps. Developers want to target the biggest, most lucrative markets so they target Android and iPhone which already have a critical mass. You could provide a container to run Android apps on Ubuntu, but then you end up with no differentiating factor except your Android apps look like crap in desktop mode. Running in a container can also restrict the kind of data collection many apps rely on for monetization.Another problem with apps is that many web services check to see whether the device is iPhone or Android and respond accordingly. Like the browser checks of yore (&#34;you need at least IE 6 to use this site, try updating to a newer browser!&#34;) this gives a less satisfactory experience to end users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t understand the desire for a Linux phone as so described in the article as a daily driver.The Android platform represents an enormous amount of work that encompasses a more secure base kernel, an unparalleled selection of applications designed for mobile usage and written in a memory-safe language, fantastic sandboxing and user privacy features leagues ahead of any desktop operating system, and great diversity in the hardware market.While it&#39;s apparent that Android has significant downsides - de facto proprietary drivers, an environment of mostly closed-source applications, some Big G integration, and a general lack of long-term updates occasionally countering the work put into security (thanks, chip manufacturers: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26593274), these are problems that can be solved. It doesn&#39;t make sense to throw the baby out with the bathwater.Closed-source applications are more a moral problem than a security one thanks to Android&#39;s sandboxing, and a vibrant ecosystem of high-quality free-and-open-source Android applications (https://f-droid.org - Amaze, Notally, QKSMS, and Tasks are some of my favorites) makes them all but optional. Google&#39;s presence in the AOSP codebase is rather limited (mostly around notifications) and taken out altogether by custom ROMs like Lineage and GrapheneOS. Proprietary drivers remain as Android&#39;s biggest problem, perhaps alongside the manufacturers that ship locked-down phones with bloatware (looking at you, Samsung).Why go the desktop-Linux-to-mobile route when you could fork Android, write drivers for the Pinephone / Librem 5, punch a hole to the base system for privileged applications, and have the best of both worlds with an order of magnitude less effort?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be shocked if it took off. The FOSS development paradigm seems to be allergic to good UI design, and this is far more important for people on mobile than desktop."</p>

It&#39;s an open platform and it&#39;s one of the only places you can access all streaming services (I think?).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I consider myself a very politically informed person. I&#39;m not a politically active person however, largely for the reasons mentioned in the article.I considered myself a liberal by the standards of the time I grew up in. My views on some social issues, particularly &#39;free speech&#39;, are considered a conservative now. I am one of the people the article is concerning who will not publicly voice their political opinions in the workplace for fear of potential repercussions. One thing that particularly upsets me, is how willingly other people bring up politically sensitive issues in the workplace. I regularly hear woefully uninformed diatribes on geopolitics and American domestic politics (I do not live in America) in the workplace. Even correcting people who are clearly misinformed on clear matters of fact can cause offense. As a result, I do not enter into such discussions.I feel as though I am more open-minded than many others. I am always ready to be corrected if I am wrong, and I am always willing to discuss my views with people subscribing to other political ideologies. However, I fear the repercussions of offending others who do not have an open mind. I also feel as though many politically active people are not acting in good faith. I feel that the safest option I will not regret is not to engage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Only nine percent of the British adults we surveyed described politics as “very important” to their sense of identity, and only 22 percent had shared any political content on their social channels in the previous year&gt; When it comes to speaking their minds at work, one of these tribes—home of the “Progressive Activist”—is not like the others.  “A powerful and vocal group for whom politics is at the core of their identity,” as More in Common describes them.i see this more and more. the loud few make a lot of noise, the majority just want to do their jobs. companies have to cater to everyone... but at some point there’s too much virtue signaling at work"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#39;For two-thirds of the population, talking politics sincerely, on the job, is uncomfortable. People who hold certain, commonplace views, stay silent believing that expressing those views will carry penalty not reward. &#39;This sounds like a recipe for disaster for any company. When I worked in the UK no part of my job description was about &#39;talking politics sincerely&#39; or sharing my &#39;commonplace views&#39;. I did that in the pub afterwards.&#39;Ethical Systems&#39; appear to be a great way to stir up rancor and division with the usual cocktail of racialisation (the new segregationists) and genderisation of everything. I can&#39;t see how this would help productivity or enhance people&#39;s work lives in any shape or form. It reminds me of the first frame of a Dilbert cartoon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Notarization has been a nightmare of a solution to a problem that isn&#39;t effective. You can get practically as much security by pushing malware signatures to the client without the massive privacy overreach of having Apple archive each and every bit of code that you generate for distribution.This is just Apple&#39;s overreach extended to the desktop. Excessive control that makes developer&#39;s lives hell while adding barely any security on top."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote a little sh script to notarize HandBrake two (or maybe three) years ago, and that&#39;s was it. It&#39;s not rocket science. But like every new thing, it required a bit of time to read the documentation and to understand what&#39;s going on.The plugin issue described in the article is probably related to the hardened runtime, so it&#39;s unrelated to the actual notarisation process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The initial setup is a bit of a pain (and the documentation is a bit lacking - though much better than most Apple documentation - particularly for edge cases like mine, distributing a screensaver), but to Apple&#39;s credit the process is pretty solid and is now consistently quick. I&#39;ve notarized dozens of builds of Aerial since the requirement was announced and I think only once did I have to wait to release because their service was stuck.Minor tip: Stapling, while optional, should be recommended (and might as well be mandatory) to everyone that notarize (you staple a certificate signed from Apple that avoids the call home when the user tries to open your software).The only thing that slightly irks me is the contract situation, if you have a &#34;paid&#34; developer account, you absolutely need to sign any update to the &#34;paid app&#34; contract from the App Store even when you want to notarize an &#34;out of store&#34;, open source app.Plus it breaks my script every time..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Backstory: https://www.vice.com/en/article/epndnz/the-bizarre-case-of-s...Including this gem:&#34;After Snowden’s abrupt exit from the interview, Tulsiani paused the meeting for several minutes, during which a hot mic led to an exclamation of a “wasted fucking day” and someone ordering a medium iced coffee over an intercom. &#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s just awesome what a keen sense Snowden has for this kind of operation. He has an intuitive understanding that information is only one component of power - the other is the spectacle of how you present it.Blowing the whistle is not effective when you simply publish a blog post somewhere. It requires theatrics to establish credibility, interest, and to reach the right audience in a way that can&#39;t be ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;After Snowden&#39;s appearance, one of Tulsiani’s “millionaires,” Angelo Mylonakis, suggested “legal action” unless Snowden publicly apologized for his criticism.Some people just don&#39;t get that presenting factual information showing the unsavory history of some person is not criticism nor is it illegal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Slightly off-topic, but... am I the only one who is troubled by the fact that the explanations of &#34;fork and exec&#34; are almost never, ever, discuss the rationale for picking this design instead of &#34;CreateProcess()&#34; a.k.a. &#34;just_launch_this_exe_file()&#34;, or even acknowledge this alternative design? A student would probably expect that to launch an app, there is a system call that would do exactly that: you pass it the name of the application/executable file, and it launches. Instead, there is a small dance of duplicating itself and then re-writing one of the copies--try not to get tangled up in the legs while doing that!The fork+exec has many unobvious advantages over CreateProcess, but also disadvantages, and one of them is that it&#39;s, in my opinion, a completely unexpected approach: I can&#39;t think of any other system object that can only be created by first copying another already existing object and then overwriting the newly created one if needed. Files of any kind (folder/pipe/socket/etc)? Memory mappings? Signal handling? Process groups/sessions? Users/groups? The processes seem to be unique in this regard. How did people come up with this approach? That would be an interesting discussion, I think.Instead, it&#39;s just described as the completely self-justified, with description of &#34;zombies&#34; thrown in the end for boots: and the zombie processes are pretty much an accidental artifact of early UNIX design; if the fork was returning not only globally visible (and therefore unstable) PID but also an fd associated with the child process, neither wait/waitpid syscalls nor reaping duties of PID 1 would have been necessary."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This seems highly focused on systems; I wouldn&#39;t call it representative of &#34;Computer Science&#34; as a whole. Only maybe 2-3 of the classes in my computer science degree were focused on this kind of stuff.Still seems like a good resource, just perhaps mislabeled."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As much as I appreciate such material, but this is not &#34;computer science&#34;. Maybe &#34;computer engineering&#34;, or some mix of &#34;software engineering&#34;, &#34;systems engineering&#34;, those things.Computer science is about algorithms, complexity, possibly foundations of programming languages, cryptography, database theory, those things. Not about Unix or file formats.Those are important too, but not &#34;computer science&#34;."</p>
