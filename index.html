								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an awesome question. I hope someone has good strategies for you. Life should be spent doing the things you find worthwhile, and the fact is, not all of those things are monetizable.Given how esteem- and success driven HN as a platform is... you might not get too many ideas since I suppose people want to maintain their &#34;hireable&#34; status.Success and &#34;loving your job&#34; are more or less empty phrases unless you are actually a professional moving your field forward or learning a highly complex subject matter - or you own a stake in a company.Beyond that you are toiling, and if you like your job, it&#39;s glorious toiling like gardening (pleasing, but not important, but you love it, so it&#39;s great) or terrible toiling for living that eats your soul.I&#39;m basically in a job that is quite important for my org, I get compliments for good job, but I hate most aspects of my daily work since the tech stack is complex and fugly. I probably _appear_ motivated but I&#39;m just a neurotic who hates failing. If I didn&#39;t need to feed and house my family I would have moved to a lower paying position long ago that is intrinsically more motivating.Success and &#34;loving your job&#34; have nothing in common in my experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want my advice, it is simply this: look for dysfunctional companies. They&#39;re easy to recognize, because they look like pretty much the opposite of those companies everybody really want to work at.Take everything you see from a website like Elastic[1] for example and invert it:- It should NOT be clear what the value proposition is.- The website should NOT adhere to modern design standards, or at least do so very poorly.- Bonus points for lots of unnecessary, buzz-heavy text that does not give any further indication of what the product/service offers.Just look for any remote developer job via linkedin or any other place recruiters frequent and just invert what seems to be a &#34;good&#34; job and look for that instead. Approach it with your current attitude (maybe not in the actual interview) and assume that you probably won&#39;t even want to add it to your resume.I think you won&#39;t have any problem finding a role where you can get away with this: how it will affect your mental health is another question, but that&#39;s for you to find out. If you ever want to bail out, you can just drop it and fill this gap period with something else in your resume, like whatever hobbies you were busy with.For the record, I think the incredulity in some of these responses is pretty hilarious. 99,9 % of companies do not care about your well being as a person, by choosing this attitude you&#39;re really just treating them the way they are already treating you: a disposable business partner that will be removed from the equation as soon as they are no longer beneficial for you.[1]: https://www.elastic.co/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You just described my job to a T. I&#39;m a systems analyst at a university.This was a big, demanding job when I first started. But after being here for 2 years, I&#39;ve automated a lot of the complicated stuff. So now most routine tasks that took the other guy a week takes me about 15 minutes. To be fair though, the other guy was *really bad*. Like, couldn&#39;t even open IIS manager and restart a single website, bad.The pay is not fantastic / FAANG, but it does offer a decent salary in a mid/low cost of living area. Combined with my wife&#39;s salary we make more than enough.Also I get a free master&#39;s degree out of it. So that&#39;s awesome."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I refused to be an FBI informant once. They threatened to make up false charges on me. I held my ground.They harrassed me at home twice, talked to my employer and made a huge stink trying to create pressure.I didn&#39;t cave and they eventually went away, because I committed no crimes and they knew it.As a security researcher I sometimes make contact with controversial people in order to get information, like a journalist might. They wanted those contacts. Too bad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was a similar, much more terrifying, story was in the New Yorker about six months ago.An Iranian physicist, Sirous Asgari, visited some US universities. On his next entry into the US he was detailed by the FBI as he entered and handed a completely-invented indictment of numerous crimes, and they demanded that he become an informant.He refused, since the indictment was completely phony. The FBI, furious, ensured he was charged with everything under the sun.Even though the government lost its case against him (due to clear lies by the FBI), he was then thrown in an ICE jail, through utter Kafkaesque bureaucratic hand-offs. Had to endure near-prison revolts as the inmates tries to keep themselves free of Covid. A judge almost granted him release due to the dangers of getting ill, but then he caught Covid and nearly died, so his petition was rejected. He was finally swapped as part of a  prisoner-swap deal with Iran. And yet he seems to be persona-no-grata now in Iran, as the assumption is that he must now be working for the FBI.https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/09/21/the-man-who-re..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happy that the ACLU is taking this on.  It shouldn&#39;t matter, but if you look at the filed complaint[1] Ahmad is a US citizen. This treatment seems clearly unconstitutional to me.Also, this excerpt from the complaint:&gt;In response, the agents pulled out two newspaper articles about Hezbollah and told Mr. Chebli, “We know you are a Hezbollah agent and were sent here by Hezbollah.” What a couple of assholes.[1] https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/chebli-v-kable-complaint..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi from the Pages team! This was such a great find and can&#39;t thank you enough for helping ensure Private Pages is as secure as possible.This report helped uncover:- A bug in Openresty where `ngx.redirect` didn&#39;t handle unsafe characters [1]. While the fix is now in the latest version of Openresty, a quick patch was to build the URL safely before using it in the redirect.- You should check for case sensitivity when reading `__Host` prefixed cookies, and verify the values against your expected format. It&#39;s possible for both `__HOST-Foo` and `__Host-Foo` cookies to exist, and only the `__Host` prefix requires the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` attributes [2]. In our case we strip all cookies at the edge using Varnish (VCL) to ensure no user-supplied cookies make it to our origin, and now we also ignore any &#34;Secure&#34; cookies that don&#39;t appear to have been set by our servers.[1]: https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/pull/1654[2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Se..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;That’s because .github.io is not on the Public Suffix List.&#34;*I&#39;m confused because I remember github.io always mentioned in explanations of the public suffix list and as rationale why the list exists.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I definitely agree with the article that it felt a bit like a betrayal. I&#39;ve pushed some friends and family to use it over Telegram despite significant usability issue, and now I see that instead of implementing some IMO basic features like proper message sync and easy backup when you get a new phone, they prefer to implement a... micropayment system? Based on some niche altcoin which doesn&#39;t even exist on mainstream exchanges?It goes beyond the usual issue with cryptocurrencies. Let&#39;s assume that they integrated with Bitcoin or Litecoin or some &#34;mainstream&#34; CC, would it still be a good idea? You can already send wallet addresses over signal if you care to do it.I&#39;m willing to give the Signal devs the benefit of the doubt and assume that they meant well and aren&#39;t actively trying to benefit from the move (even though I&#39;m not completely dismissing this possibility) but at the very least it&#39;s just showcases a very strange way to lead the project and prioritize issues. I can think of a dozen things out of the top that would do more to drive Signal adoption than integrating with some &#34;literally what?&#34; cryptocoin.This is going to drive the adoption of this niche cryptocoin, it&#39;s not going to do anything at all for Signal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article mirrors my feelings toward this announcement well. I spent a significant amount of time trying out different messaging apps and convincing my friends and family to move over from Telegram and WhatsApp. I used my reputation and their trust in my expertise.The whole blockchain industry is just too mixed with scams that I feel comfortable to have my non-tech relatives dealing with it. It&#39;s enough that I have to educate them on &#39;investments&#39; in random coins (it&#39;s gambling) and cure their FOMO regarding NFTs. Now the technology will be integrated into the messaging app that I endorsed, well-packed together with the smelly involvement of Moxie with the currency.What now?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was recently pulled onto Signal by a non-techie who values his privacy. I talked to him about Matrix/Element and he had no idea what that was, but was very happy with Siganl. I must admit, the app is very nice. All I had to do was give it access to my contacts and bam, I am now able to chat with all my contacts.By comparison, Element is much more like a chat program than a phone messenger. It&#39;s good for &#34;I want to connect with that person from GitHub&#34; instead of &#34;messaging the cute girl I met last night&#34; or &#34;messaging my grandpa&#34;. And yet, it feels to me like Matrix/Element is the platform less likely to pull something like this. Then again, Keybase seemed that way as well..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, the author has a pretty miserable company :(.That said, I share most of the opinions even though I quite like the office environment of my company.I abso-fking-love choosing where I work (and to some degree, when).  Being able to take my laptop and go sit under a canopy in my back yard when the weather is nice, seeing my rabbits hopping around the yard, my cats avoiding the aggressive she-rabbit, hearing the birds, etc., while working, is just about as happy as I can be while also working on stuff that doesn&#39;t really matter much.As I begin to form my own company, one of my priorities is to allow my employees to have at least some of their time completely at their own discretion.  They choose when and where they work as long as they can attend some important anchor meetings (and obviously be productive).  And for the social aspect, weekend or week-long dev retreats are ideal.  4 hours of intense serious work, plus a couple of hours of colleague social interaction, and the rest left to the individual to spend however they like, is the kind of situation I would have not even been able to dream of when I was younger.And from a bean-counter owner perspective, do not underestimate the employee loyalty and overachievement motivation you can get by giving some nice free trips, nice free food, and quality equipment.Big companies lack this freedom to treat their creative talent not because they cannot afford it but because the people in charge tend to not be creative thinkers.  This is why most interesting things happen in smaller companies (and ultimately tend to get bought by the laggard big companies)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What kind of office was this person working in? Having to breathe jet exhaust fumes while suffering through 85 degree indoor temperatures and drinking algae-filled water is nowhere near normal.The company he’s describing is  severely broken if everything he’s describing is true. Most of what he describes are not normal office problems. Some of them are even health and safety violations. Working from home will only distance him from those problems, but it can’t fix an inherently broken company that doesn’t care about employees. He should be searching for another remote job ASAP"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Things I miss:- interacting with my colleagues, going out to lunch- the very high-speed and reliability of being on the network wire- dedicated work-space outside of my home where home-chores don&#39;t press on my mind while I&#39;m trying to work- my commute: I cycled into work, and the daily exercise was great- a clearer separation of work and home lifeThings I don&#39;t miss:- interacting with my colleagues, when i don&#39;t want to (group office, oy)- having my boss pop in over my shoulder (my bosses are great though)- my commute: I cycled into work, and the daily ride was sometimes a grind, in cold or wet weather. And it takes a lot of time- not having my work at home when I need to work late (I have a work laptop, but still)- having the campus police officer give me the eye when they see me working at 2amI&#39;m considering coming in Thursday/Fridays."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been programming for a long, long time. Went to college for it when I was a pre-teen. The more and more I code the more I see it closer to something like music than something like engineering. Getting a little garage band together isn&#39;t hard. A couple years of practice and you and your friends can play at a little bar or at least at a high school shindig.The same is more or less true for programming. A simple stack of JS, HTML, and CSS is pretty easy to get going. And if you&#39;re content to make marketing sites for advertising companies or similar, then go nuts. That&#39;s your simple jam and you rock out on it as much as you like.Other people want to learn violin or weird keys or timings or cross rhythm. They want to woodshed some African drums and mix them into complex arrangements. And you know what? It is harder than playing a simple guitar for a simple song.We have the same thing with software, and once you&#39;ve put in the years you find a sort of series of specializations that make you stand out a bit more and get you a bit more money.So when people say &#34;programming is easy&#34; what they really mean is that it&#39;s easier than most people expect it will be for the financial incentives it provides. Compared to, say, structural engineering which takes four years of focussed study then a long period of practical understudy, software is easy and it pays more. Almost any structural engineer can become a data analyst or junior data scientist and make around double the salary within a year or two.Yes we&#39;ve all had the frustrating semicolon days, but there are highlights too. Fast feedback, ease of learning new technologies, ease of scaling to millions of customers. There are many advantages and I think they make up for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I said that the programming field is a fertile ground for beginners, and it is. But what’s fertile for grain is fertile for weeds too, even moreso. And we need to talk about these people, taking advantage of the fertile ground.Yikes. What a gross, self-congratulatory rant. The author tries to defend against the term &#34;gatekeeping&#34; by getting out ahead of it, but that doesn&#39;t change how deeply exclusionary the result is.It doesn&#39;t even stick to a specific complaint; it jumps around to different things that emotionally feel related in the author&#39;s mind but aren&#39;t actually. First we&#39;re talking about boot camps, then we&#39;re talking about how StackOverflow is &#34;the scariest thing that happened to the programming community in the past 10 years&#34;, then we&#39;re talking about &#34;diversity&#34; speakers at conferences riling up &#34;mobs&#34; in some kind of conspiracy against the author and people like him?Buried under all of this (literally, at the very end) is perhaps a poorly-executed attempt to tell beginners something of value, that it may not be easy now, but you can push through and it will get better. But I don&#39;t see any actual beginner reaching that part before getting discouraged by the rest into doubting whether they should be in this career field at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is this always discussed only in relation to programming? Is being a doctor hard? How about an architect? Lawyer? Welder? Car mechanic? Airline pilot? Are they all gatekeepers if they say their job is hard?There are different jobs labeled as programming, some easier, some harder.Where does this narrative come from that programming at all professional levels must be easy for everyone, else you are a gatekeeper? Is it anxiety about future automation and the idea that the only remaining jobs will be programming?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The comment from the article echos my own sentiments:&gt; Speaking solely as a person who is really into encrypted messaging, it terrifies me that they&#39;re going to take this really clean story of an encrypted messenger and mix it up with the nightmare of laws and regulations and vulnerability that is cryptocurrency.Moreover, there are three other points I&#39;d add:1. I don&#39;t like &#34;do everything&#34; apps like WeChat or Line. One of Signals strengths was UX that focused on it&#39;s core competency. Early in Signal&#39;s development they would add privacy features. Lately they have been adding social features. This, however, feels especially out of left field and likely to hurt the UX.2. This smells like dev resources will be spent building and maintaining something not related to messaging.3. I&#39;ve always had a &#34;don&#39;t let perfect be the enemy of good&#34; rationalization that gives Signal autonomy to grow a privacy centric messaging app despite the deficits (e.g lack of federation). In contrast, I personally associate &#34;crypto&#34; with &#34;scam&#34;. There have been so many shady ICOs and pump-dump schemes around crypto. This will taint the product for those of us who don&#39;t think of crypto currency as being anything more than pump-and-dump schemes and a way to buy dab rigs online."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are 250 million units of mobilecoin, and majority of them are owned by the founders. Only 37.5 million have been distributed. With current price ($65), they&#39;re worth $14B already. This makes the project a scam and impossible for it to work as a reliable money that holds value. Bitcoin had no pre-mine and has been fairly distributed from the start."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a terrible decision.Feature bloat is one of the worst things for a security conscious product. The more features, the more attack vectors. Nobody asked for payments in Signal. Where did this idea come from? It was never put forward prior to this, it was never on the road map. That only makes me even more suspicious of this decision, which leads to my second point...MobileCoin has all the appearances of a scam. 85% of the coin is owned by the creators. The price rapidly shot up at the end of March. The social media of the developers was posting rubbish for a long period of time. There was no mention of this collaboration beforehand. This has all the hallmarks of a pump and dump. Have the Signal devs been duped? Or are they wanting to cash in on Signal&#39;s rising popularity?Anybody at all with an interest in Signal needs to let the foundation know that this Beta needs to be scrapped, and that payments should never be added."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem I have always had when building elaborate home server setups is the &#34;set it and forget it&#34; nature of the systems I&#39;ve installed bites me in the ass.  Since it&#39;s not my full-time job to manage these systems, I&#39;m really not familiar with them the way I might be with the systems I manage at work.  These systems cruise along for years, and when something finally does go belly-up, I can&#39;t remember how I set it up in the first place.  Now I have a giant chore looming over me, ruining a perfectly good weekend.These days, I design everything for home with extreme simplicity coupled with detailed documentation on how I set things up.Docker has helped tremendously, since you can essentially use an out-of-the-box Linux distro with docker installed, and you don&#39;t really have to install anything else on the hardware.  Then if at all possible, I use standard docker images provided by the software developer with no modifications (maybe some small tweaks in a docker-compose file to map to local resources).Anyway, my advice is to keep the number of customizations to a bare minimum, minimize the number of moving parts in your home solutions, document everything you do (starting with installing the OS all the way through configuring your applications), capture as much of the configuration as you can in declarative formats (like docker compose files), back up all your data, and just as importantly, back up every single configuration file."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The diagram alone is more than enough of an argument to dissuade me from giving this a shot right now - it&#39;s simply too complicated and too much to manage for the amount of time I can dedicate to it.BUT - I&#39;m really thankful for people who keep posting and sharing these sorts of projects; they&#39;re the ones iterating the process for the rest of us who need something a bit more turn-key.I&#39;m excited to see this eventually result in something like the following:- Standard / Easy to update containerized setup.- Out of the box multi-location syncs (e.g. home, VPS, etc.)- Takes 5 minutes to configure/add new locationsI want this to be as easy as adding a new AP to my mesh wifi system at home: plug it in, open the app, name the AP, and click &#34;Done&#34;.(Edit - formatting)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, I’m SUPER into self hosting, but this article? No way.
1) Duck out isn’t a thing, just stop it.
2) Half the articles cited as examples of corporate abuse were later revealed to be mistakes by the user or easily avoidable pitfalls.
3) Self hosting still requires trust (software you’re running, DNS, domains, ISP, etc...) The line of who to trust and how far is a tough one to answer, even for the informed.How I solved it:
1) I use well vetted cloud services for things that are difficult/impossible to self host or have a low impact if lost. (Email, domains, github, etc...)
2) I self host things that are absolutely critical with cloud backups. (Files, Photos, code, notes, etc..)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; What is ThreadSanitizer?  ThreadSanitizer (TSan) is compile-time instrumentation to detect data races according to the C/C++ memory model on Linux. It is important to note that these data races are considered undefined behavior within the C/C++ specification.TSan, ASan, UBSan - if you are writing code and your toolchain supports these, you should use them.  Over the past 6-7+ years I&#39;ve used them, I have never seen a false positive (I&#39;m sure some have occasionally existed but they seem rare in practice).&gt; However, developers claimed on various occasions that a particular report must be a false positive. In all of these cases, it turned out that TSan was indeed right and the problem was just very subtle and hard to understand.Yes, I have seen this phenomenon!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two pieces of information that I found interesting:* Rust had poor support for sanitizers (&#34;Rust, which has much less mature support for sanitizers)&#34;. Work was done to improve this, but it&#39;s not clear how well it works now - it would be worth a blog post in itself IMO. This was surprising, because at least I assumed that it works flawlessly thanks to clang.* Rust / C++ bridges are predictably problematic and weaken Rust&#39;s guarantees (&#34;races in C++ code being obfuscated by passing through Rust&#34;). 
This is the problem to solve for most companies working in a traditionally C and C++ oriented domain, as the C* code will dwarf the Rust code. Because of the shared memory space any problems in that code will be just as critical as if the entire code was unsafe. It would be quite awesome if Rust were able to isolate unsafe code not just at compile time, but also at runtime, by e.g. offering the option of executing the unsafe code in a separate address space. This would require some manual work for moving the data back and forth, but it could offer the tools to support such a work mode e.g. unsafe blocks could take parameters.I wish Mozilla would be more transparent about the absolutely normal and typical difficulties they must be encountering in a mixed code base. I have the feeling that there&#39;s plenty of them, but they don&#39;t want to emphasise them in order not to discourage Rust adoption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Overall Rust appears to be fulfilling one of its original design goals: allowing us to write more concurrent code safely. Both WebRender and Stylo are very large and pervasively multi-threaded, but have had minimal threading issues. What issues we did find were mistakes in the implementations of low-level and explicitly unsafe multithreading abstractions — and those mistakes were simple to fix.&gt; This is in contrast to many of our C++ races, which often involved things being randomly accessed on different threads with unclear semantics, necessitating non-trivial refactorings of the code."</p>
