								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"PowerToys Run is fantastic as an app launcher. Not quite as good as Alfred on MacOS but then nothing is. There&#39;s a bunch of similar apps for Windows (I used to use Hain) but none ever worked quite right for me, PowerToys Run does though.FancyZones is awfully nice too for just putting a window somewhere at a reasonable size and location.As other folks have noted SysInternals is another similar rogue Windows product by Microsoft. Process Explorer from there is indispensible, as is Autoruns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of one of my favorite features from the Mac: Quick Look — press space to instantly bring up a big contextual preview window of the selected document in the Finder.You can bring it to Windows with this useful open source tool: https://github.com/QL-Win/QuickLook"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use PowerToys just for the easy key remapping, which I wish was a built-in feature in more keyboards. Works very nicely as a simple alternative to AutoHotKey. My RSI has gotten a lot better by just remapping Caps Lock to Ctrl.If any PowerToys feature deserves to be added to Windows, it&#39;s gotta be the Keyboard Manager."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Welcome to the automated account suspension age of the internet, where companies shoot first and don&#39;t care later, as the amount of false positives is not worth putting any meagerly (if there&#39;s any already) real, physical support to resolve. This can apply to smaller companies too, for other but equally pricey reasons. The amount of fraudulent activity attempts online may warrant those aggressive measures from their business perspective (that are also not limited to passive data collection, but taking active steps such as scanning targets&#39; ports [0]).
Unfortunately, if you live in certain areas or are forced to use mobile networks, with IPs constantly refreshing multiple times a day, major services can be almost unusable, and the user may not even realize the reason why. Some—for reasons I&#39;m not knowledgeable about—do it better than others, but it may simply be about the resources put into it and the amount of risk a miss could amount to.0. https://blog.nem.ec/2020/05/24/ebay-port-scanning/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is every company that deals with fraud of some sort. They collect evidence. Once evidence is damning enough, they ban, without giving any information. If they were to give out their evidence, then their evidence collection methods would become known and would no longer be effective.Furthermore, even when they get it right, people who were banned correctly come on to the internet to complain.But sometimes they get it wrong. And the only recourse seems to be a public shaming online."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess this was posted after someone saw this come up on HN yesterday: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31295427I&#39;ve been planning (for 2+ years now so it probably won&#39;t happen) writing a large blog post about this matter, which would be called “Tries, Packed Tries, and the Bentley–Knuth–McIlroy story”:• Part 1 would introduce the trie data structure both abstractly (the tree structure) and concretely (how exactly to represent the children of a node), with the trade-offs: as a linked list (space-efficient, slow lookup), as an array (fast lookup, takes space), or as some more nontrivial tree structure itself (“yo dawg…”). Then we&#39;d discuss the really cool idea of “packing” the array, as nicely described in Frank Liang&#39;s thesis https://tug.org/docs/liang/ (also mentioned in TAOCP Exercise 6.3:4 and answer, which incidentally refers to the CACM Bentley–Knuth–McIlroy article that we&#39;re talking about). We&#39;d also illustrate how hyphenation is done in the TeX program using packed tries (maybe this can be a separate post).• Part 2 would go into the Bentley–Knuth-McIlroy story:• Part 2a (&#34;Before&#34;): Bentley&#39;s thesis/book on writing efficient programs, and the Programming Pearls column. Knuth writing TeX first for himself in SAIL in 1977–78. The instant interest and ports/rewrites it led to. Knuth responding by rewriting TeX into its current form in 1980–82, and how the goals of portable software (thus Pascal, and its limitations! see BWK rant) and of eventually publishing it as a book led him to the idea of literate programming, which he still considers the most important outcome of his years into the TeX project. Meanwhile, at Bell Labs, McIlroy&#39;s invention of Unix pipes, and the instant excitement of &#34;pipe day&#34;. (“It was absorbed instantly into one&#39;s outlook on programming. And by the end of the week secretaries were piping the output of NROFF into the printer”) The Unix philosophy, and how it took a while to spread. How these three threads came together in 1986, when Bentley read Knuth&#39;s TeX, wrote about LP in his Pearls column, and published one program of Knuth&#39;s (the random-numbers one) and asked him to write another (the frequent words one).• Part 2b (the program): How Knuth ingeniously combined the idea of packed tries with that of hashing with linear probing, to create the data structure especially for this problem (maybe we can call it a hash-packed trie?). Another look at his very nice idea/program, presented differently (maybe some illustrations of how the data structure works), and some design choices he made.• Part 2c (the review and later): How Bentley got McIlroy to review it, a close reading of the review: its actual content and points about LP and Knuth&#39;s style, and finally the (first sentence and) last part where McIlroy used the review to advertise his own Unix philosophy and the short shell pipeline version. The further reactions to this, including Bentley&#39;s remarks in the same column, and later articles and reactions like the &#34;prefabs&#34; comment (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22406070). The short-lived LP column in CACM that it spawned (https://shreevatsa.net/post/programming-pearls/) and how it fizzled out, how it turns out everyone wants to do LP in their own system. How the story got bastardized over time (the misleading &#34;More shell less egg&#34; blog post for example, and some other examples of people misunderstanding the history entirely).• Part 3 would compare the two approaches (even though they are not meant to be compared!), mention how at https://codegolf.stackexchange.com/questions/188133/ I simply translated Knuth&#39;s program into C++ and beat the then-fastest Rust solution (since beaten again by translation from C++ back into Rust: still based on the trie idea though!), some words about cache misses and 32-bit “pointers” in a 64-bit world (and Knuth&#39;s rant about it).Something like that: it&#39;s probably too long for me to ever get around to writing it (or for anyone to be interested in reading), though…"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there more discussion about the &#39;framed&#39; part? I mean how was the counter perceived. The whole &#39;setup&#39; looks like:- show how to write a spreadsheet application- here you go, couple of hundred pages it is though- ahh, silly person, why not type &#39;excel&#39;So what happened next? Everybody rolled eyes, or people said &#39;yeah, typing excel is pure genious&#39;?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am super excited by https://observablehq.com which has made an out-of-the-box literate programming environment for Javascript zero configuration (like Knuth&#39;s it has a non-linear execution order). Since switching to literate programming I have found myself adopting a documentation-driven-development methodology, where I ponder about the purpose of the notebook in the introduction, and because I reread it every time I open the notebook, the clarity of the software goes up, which also feedbacks into the ongoing development process too.It takes a little while before habits change, but I think I have learnt more in the last year at age 40 than I did in my first year of undergraduate aged 19.An aspect of Observable which is particularly compelling since Knuth is the fact that inter-notebook dependencies are hyperlinks, so these are not standalone literate programming artifacts, but they are a graph of explanation too. You can learn a lot by surfing notebook dependencies. Bundling code with documentation is such a win.The other thing about Observable is the cells are reactive, so your documentation is not necessarily static either. You can provide animated interactive explanations too.More info on the different types of content you can embedhttps://observablehq.com/@observablehq/cell-modesMore info on the spreadsheet like execution ordering:https://observablehq.com/@observablehq/observables-not-javas...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"about JavaScript, CSS, and HTML basics...and this is where it goes off the rails; teaching JS before HTML is how we will continue to have the ridiculous proliferation of app-sites that shouldn&#39;t require a single line of JS instead needing the latest version of $browser (you have a choice of browser - pick one ...) to even show any content at all. Forms don&#39;t need any JS to work, yet the impression this gives to beginners is that they do.https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25915313But then again, this is Microsoft, which is now firmly in bed with Google in contributing to the Big Browser monopoly, so I suppose I shouldn&#39;t have expected anything else. The agenda is obvious to anyone who cares to look."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note: I&#39;ve had to help train a bunch of Java/C++ devs about web dev over the years. I&#39;ve also talked to a lot of new devs. One thing I noted is that there wasn&#39;t a good resource that tried to explain the key pieces of web dev concepts, terms, and technologies, and how they fit together. So, I ended up writing a &#34;How Web Apps Work&#34; blog series to try to fill that gap:https://blog.isquaredsoftware.com/series/how-web-apps-work/The series provides an overview of HTTP and servers, client dev, browsers / HTML / CSS, JS / DOM, and AJAX.A number of folks have told me they found the series particularly helpful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an experienced backend developer but always struggled with learning modern web development.I understand all the core well (html, CSS, JavaScript, etc.), but struggle with choosing the right high level abstraction/framework/technology for ideas I want to implement.E.g. should I make it a single page app or not? Should I be using ES6 imports? Which build tool? Would I want React or Vue or something simpler here? Should I use SSR? NPM vs. Yarn? Do I need a CSS compiler? Maybe I should be using TypeScript? Wepback?Basically I&#39;m overwhelmed with choices, but struggle to find useful docs on why a lot of these tools came about, what problems they solve, tradeoffs for using them, etc.Asking the web devs I know in person doesn&#39;t help much (“just use React for everything, it&#39;s fine&#34;)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Several were veterans of the company, with more than six years of experienceI think it&#39;s sad that we have an industry, where someone with six years&#39; experience, is considered a &#34;veteran.&#34;But it sounds like Amazon is sending a message to managers of other warehouses, to go as low as possible, to fight unionization.Expect things to get ugly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me a more reasonable explanation than any in the article is that after losing the vote, Amazon looked into the warehouse and decided part of the problem was that the managers were making the situation worse. This could have been that the rsi injury complaints were true and unaddressed promptly. Or that the managers came off as cold in communications. Or 5 other things they could have done better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The managers were told they were being fired as part of an “organizational change,”Nit: That language implies that they were laid off, not fired. The timing is a stupid move from Amazon, and these employees will likely be able to make a good case in court.Being from Europe I have mixed feelings about unions here in the US...On the one hand I think they are essential to tilt the uneven power dynamic between employer and employee towards the employee, and are thus dearly needed!On the other hand, unions seem to often go overboard with impractical demands and are more political than in Europe, which damaged their reputation - I think - and contributed to their demise over the past few decades. Which is truly a shame!
(I&#39;m reminded of alleged cases where only a union worker is allow to plug a power plug into an outlet at exorbitant prices. But this might a rumor too.)Any opinions here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a forefront issue that Buddhism tries to address, both modern pragmatic Buddhism and fundamentalist Buddhism. It&#39;s why right speech, right action, and morals is one of the first things they drill into you. Most pragmatic practitioners will refuse to teach you if you indicate that you have some mental problems or moral deficiencies that should be addressed by a professional first, as mindfulness may end up doing more harm than good. It&#39;s one of the flaws of teaching secular mindfulness, far from its Buddhist roots. I&#39;ve experienced all these interpersonal deficits after meditating seriously 2 hours every day for 2 years straight. Just need to have the self-awareness to address them, despite the goal of no-self.I saw a Dr. K video in another comment, and one of my favorite quotes he uses to describe meditation is that, &#34;if you run for 5 miles a day, there will be changes to your body that will definitely happen&#34;.More here:- https://www.mctb.org/mctb2/table-of-contents/part-i-the-fund...- https://eudoxos.github.io/cfitness/html/index.html- https://themindfulgeek.com/ plus a talk he gave at Google https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s2xxsA9Bn-4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bound to happen. Why do you think Buddha has to leave all his wealth and kingdom before even starting the journey of mindfulness, leaving everything behind?The western adaptation is reducing meditation and mindfulness to a &#34;tool&#34; of relieving stress and better ones mental well-being. As easy as downloading an app and stay calm for few minutes.Unfortunately, this is not ideal. The traditional way is to seek a guru who asks the disciple to cleanse their heart first. Put them on the spiritual path of purifying the soul. Meditation is a part of ones spiritual journey. Some even leave everything and go to forest or mountains to practice for years.Fortunately, for those who want to live in a society closely, they should practice &#34;Raja Yoga&#34; which is also a spiritual path where one raises their spiritual plane by helping others and following ones duty with high-integrity.However simple breathing exercises still work for the body and can be easily incorporated into every day lives. There are so many apps helping with the patterns of different breathing techniques.But don&#39;t expect you or anyone to become a better person just by doing some mindfulness exercises. When one goes to discover/amplify their inner core, you will just highlight whats inside you more. I.e. if you are bad, you will get worse. Mindfulness has nothing to do with it but just amplifying what is already there as you discover yourself more through mindfulness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This would line up with a broader trend I&#39;ve noticed and would be interested in reading more about: the use of pop psychology to justify antisocial behavior.Ten years ago, telling a distressed friend you don&#39;t feel like hearing about their problems would be incredibly rude. Now you can find NYT articles explaining how to couch the same sentiment in more acceptable terms like, &#34;I don&#39;t have the bandwidth to perform that kind of emotional labor right now.&#34;Same thing here. Telling a person you wronged to &#34;get over it&#34; is unacceptable. Telling them that you&#39;ve been working on letting go of negative feelings about the past and being more mindful of the present, and you hope they can do the same? Well if anyone has a problem with that, you don&#39;t need that kind of energy in your life!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very interested in visual ways to explore ebooks, papers, articles.A physical library helps discovering new stuff or occasionally bumping in something. With files you need to be much more deliberate and I feel like you can accumulate a lot without really knowing what you have.Even if this is a simple visualization it already gives ideas on how much more information you could convey with something similar. Like number of pages, color of the cover, to remind you of the book, different font, etc. A set of cues that can help you navigate in the list of books, at least I suspect :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Look at a chart of the S&amp;P 500 from 1920 to 2008 and you&#39;ll notice something rather curious: the stock market has gone parabolic ever since the financial crisis. What made this period so unique? Tremendously low interest rates coupled with quantitative easing dissuaded capital from financing the real economy and instead encouraged herding and levering up in the financial economy for returns.At ever dip, it was an open secret the Fed would cut rates and ease again.At least for now, that game is over. We&#39;ve had moments in the past when the markets had a similar panic (see 2018), but this period is unique due to the inflationary backdrop. Since 2008 we&#39;ve never seemed to be able to create significant economic growth or inflation greater. The COVID fiscal canon blew growth and inflation skyward. The fed can&#39;t just turn on the printers again or cut rates until we hit proper a proper recession.That&#39;s when you buy the dip.[0]: https://www.macrotrends.net/2324/sp-500-historical-chart-dat..."</p>

The thing is, we always think that. We always think this time is different. We always think this might be the end. When Covid struck? It was different because the world economy was shut. When 2008 happened? It was different. 2000? Different. 1987? Different. 
Markets will eventually recover. It will not take you 4 decades to recover. Sure, it could take years. But buy good companies, dollar cost average, and realize your loss isn’t realized until you sell. 
Also realize that the best time to buy stocks is always, but especially when people are flooding forums with negativity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Technology robbed workers’ of what had been highly valued physical knowledge about a job: the precise way to jimmy a stuck gear, the sound a machine makes when something’s about to break.There&#39;s an experience that lives rent free in my mind as well. As a teen, I worked at a bait shop that was on the Gulf coast. They sold mostly live shrimp but had other live stuff for bait as well. Salt water was pumped from the nearby innercoastal canal by two heavy duty swimming pool type pumps. From there, the water was split through several different pipes and manifolds and dumped into the live bait tanks. The overflow ran back out to the canal.There was this one customer I was getting bait for and he meandered around the bait room randomly (customers weren&#39;t supposed to be in there but I didn&#39;t feel like saying anything). He ended up way in the back of the room where the pumps were and I could see him touching them. Figuring I needed to get him out of there politely I walked back there pretending to check on stuff. Before I could say anything, he says &#34;You will need a new pump soon&#34;. Um &#34;What?&#34; I say. &#34;Put your hand on this one&#34;. So I did, I felt nothing. &#34;Now put your hand on this one&#34;. And that one had a really high frequency vibration coming through it. &#34;The bearings are shot, it will lock up soon&#34;.I was impressed. Granted for two more years I&#39;d regularly &#34;feel&#34; the pump again, the vibrations were slowly getting worse. But then a hurricane came and flooded everything anyway so we got new stuff.But still, anytime I see a high RPM electric motor running, I got to &#34;give it a feel&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Diminishing returns on productivity is obvious (eg working 80 hours a week outputs productivity somewhere between 1 to 2 times the productivity of 40 hours a week).However, rewards for work is also highly nonlinear, and usually rank based. For example, Usain Bolt is not twice as fast as the second fastest runner but Bolt is rewarded many multiples more than the second fastest runner.What is rational is to think of the payoff or reward space, and think how even a tiny incremental increase in productivity (which compounds) can result in disproportionately large payoffs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t find anything wrong with being addicted to getting things done if the productivity gains are shared amongst the labor force. Specifically, increase in productivity can be used to eg shorten the workweek even further and demand protections against work encroachment on personal life. I see that this is happening with some companies embracing 4 day workweeks, others adopting remote from anywhere etc. We need to accelerate this trend, possibly enshrine them in labor law.To be honest, the greediness of the managerial/investor class is kinda dumb. I keep thinking about how Amazon/Starbucks could have worked with their employees rather than exploiting and harassing them so relentlessly that now the labor movement is growing rapidly to their detriment. It was really stupid to think they could get away with being shitty forever. Incentive structures should be created that don’t bias so heavily towards the short term."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With JavaScript, these kinds of optimizations in an engine make sense due to the web being limited by it and thus speed is a huge factor. With Python, however, if a Python web framework is “too” slow, I would honestly say the problem is using Python at all for a web server. Python shines beautifully as a (somewhat) cross platform scripting language: file reading and writing, environment variables, simple implementations of basic utilities: sort, length, max, etc that would be cumbersome in C. The move of Python out of this and into practically everything is the issue and then we get led into rabbit holes such as this where since we are using Python, a dynamic scripting language, for things a second year computer science student should know are not “the right jobs for the tool.”Instead of performance, I’d like to see more effort in portability, package management, and stability for Python because, essentially since it is often enterprise managed, juggling fifteen versions of Python where 3.8.x supports native collection typing annotations but we use 3.7.x, etc. is my biggest complaint. Also up there is pip and just the general mess of dependencies and lack of a lock file. Performance doesn’t even make the list.This is not to discredit anyone’s work. There is a lot of excellent technical work and research done as discussed in the article. I just think honestly a lot of this effort is wasted on things low on the priority tree of Python."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"During Perl’s hegemony as The Glue Language, I feel like the folk wisdom was:“Performance is a virtue; if Perl ceases to be good enough, or you need to write ‘serious’ software rewrite in C.”And during Python’s ascension, the common narrative shifted very slightly:“Performance is a virtue, but developer productivity is a virtue too. Plus, you can drop to C to write performance critical portions.”Then for our brief all-consuming affair with Ruby, the wisdom shifted more radically:“Developer productivity is paramount. Any language that delivers computational performance is suspect from a developer productivity standpoint.”But looking at “high-level” languages (i.e. languages that provide developer productivity enhancing abstraction), we can rewind the clock to look at language families that evolved during more resource-constrained times.Those languages, the lisps, schemes, smalltalks, etc. are now really, really fast compared to Python, and rarely require developers to shift to alternative paradigms (e.g. dropping to C) just to deliver acceptable performance.Perl and Python exploded right at the time that Lisp/Scheme hadn’t quite shaken the myth that they were slow, with Python/Perl achieving acceptable performance by having dropped to C most of the time.Now the adoption moat is the wealth of libraries that exist for Python—and it’s a hell of a big moat. If I were a billionaire, I’d hire a team of software developers to systematically review libraries that were exemplars in various languages, and write / improve idiomatic, performant, stylistically consistent versions in something modern like Racket. I’d like to imagine that someone
would use those things :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great read, and it&#39;s fantastic to see all the work being done to evaluate and improve the language!The dynamic-nature of the language is actually something that I had studied a few years back [1]. Particularly the variable and object attribute look ups! My work was just a master&#39;s thesis, so we didn&#39;t go too deep into more tricky dynamic aspects of the language (e.g. eval, which we restricted entirely). But we did see performance improvements by restricting the language in certain ways that aid in static analysis, which allowed for more performant runtime code. But for those interested, the abstract of my thesis [2] gives more insight into what we were evaluating.Our results showed that restricting dynamic code (code that is constructed at run time from other source code) and dynamic objects (mutation of the structure of classes and objects at run time) significantly improved the performance of our benchmarks.There was also some great discussion on HN when I had posted our findings as well [3].[1]: https://github.com/joncatanio/cannoli[2]: https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/theses/1886/[3]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17093051"</p>
