								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the biggest tragedies isn&#39;t just that the childhood is wasted, but that many people never learn to have agency once it is available. I&#39;m not saying you need to start your own business or anything like that, but it seems like most people live their lives never questioning the scripts that are given to them.The basic life script we all seem to have in western society seems pretty awful when you think critically about it. Essentially we waste all out vitality and youth making other people rich, so that one day when we&#39;re old and infirm, we can finally do the things we like with the short time we have left. I think most of us never even think about it because it&#39;s too bleak of a reality. I feel somewhat fortunate in that the work I do is something I would generally enjoy doing even if I wasn&#39;t being paid for it, but I still have a nagging fear that what I could be is much more than what I am yet I lack the proper tools and perspectives to become that person (and I don&#39;t think that just starting my own business, like a lot of people here want to do, is really sufficient, it&#39;s just a small part of inventing your own life script)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article did a great job of articulating something I&#39;ve always felt strongly about but haven&#39;t been able to put into words.I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only one who felt like my schooling was mostly a giant waste of my time and energy.I was waaaay ahead in subjects I liked, because those things I learned myself out of innate interest. Rather than the system accommodating and encouraging being ahead, in those subjects I was held back and forced to sit through material I already knew, because &#34;in year x we learn this and in year y we learn that&#34;. Don&#39;t get ahead. Zero agency.In other subjects that didn&#39;t interest me, I was forced to sit through stuff only to forget everything I &#34;learned&#34; soon after.It really begs the question, what&#39;s the point? And while I&#39;m no genius at anything, surely a system like this will kill many, many actual geniuses, just like the article says."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with the article is that it only uses examples of extra ordinary people.Most people are not geniuses, they are average. 
You are not a genius.Most people who flunk out or drop out of school
do not become billionaires and neither will you.Most people who decide to give it their all and become
various forms of artists will never be famous, noticed 
no wealty or admired (Though on a nano scale you may have people who do)By a large margin most restaurants / startups fail.
You are not going to create the next unicorn.yes this is not 100% accurate because it does happen.
Much like buying a lotto ticket. 
People do win.But you will not. (Almost entirely certain but again some do win).People like Lonardo da Vinci are 1 in a billion. 
Maybe one in 2 billion.People like Jobs and Zuckerberg are a lot more common. 
There are maybe 1000? 10.000? 
If we say 100.000 that is about 0.0013% of the world
population. 
You are not in the 0.0013% (2019 estimate)(Though you really need take into account the privilege accorded people based. on where they live, where they were born, family. If you win the lottery and grow up in a wealty educated country, you have a HUGE advantage.Much like buying 1 lottery ticket drastically increases you chance of winning.The point being nearly all people fail to be special. 
They will not be remembered by the grater society after their death. They will have made no huge impact on the world.  They will never make it big.Thus we should not focus our choices in life my making a few of the same choices that are advantageous for 1 in a billion.We should not set our goals to achieve what they did.We should focus on having a nice life, a good set of friends, enough money to live ok, having interesting hobbies
Having a job that is ok. A safe and dry place to live.
Have some love.We should expect and respect that we will be average
That is not a failure. That is what most likely will
happen.So set out to make the most of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"See also the leak[1] of big oil PR maestro Rick Berman&#39;s 2014 speech to oil execs, pleading for funds to combat rational debate and reliable information about fracking.“Think of this as an endless war,” he told them. “And you have to budget for it.”&gt; He said the industry needs to dig up embarrassing tidbits about environmentalists and liberal celebrities, exploit the public’s short attention span for scientific debate, and play on people’s emotions.&gt; “Fear and anger have to be a part of this campaign,” Berman said. “We’re not going to get people to like the oil and gas industry over the next few months.”&gt; Berman also advised that executives continue to spend big. “I think $2 to $3 million would be a game changer,” he said. “We’ve had six-figure contributions to date from a few companies in this room to help us get to where we are.”&gt; But always cover your tracks, he suggested, adding that no-one is better equipped at doing so than his firm. “We run all this stuff through nonprofit organizations that are insulated from having to disclose donors. There is total anonymity,” he said. “People don’t know who supports us. We’ve been doing this for 20-something years in this regard.” [2]Plenty more in the transcript at [1], and the article at [2]!1: https://www.nytimes.com/2014/10/31/us/politics/pr-executives...2: https://www.desmog.com/2014/10/31/oil-and-gas-industry-s-end..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many years ago, I got to see an Exxon &#34;Legislative Affairs Coordinator&#34; speak to a group of small landowners about how they could make their own lobbying efforts more effective.In less than 10min this lady had the crowd ready to burn her at the stake.She told them things like &#34;your voice doesn&#39;t matter,&#34; urged them to donate all the money they could to Exxon&#39;s lobbying efforts (with unspecified goals), on the basis that at least it would get something done, even if it wasn&#39;t what they wanted. &#34;Donate to our people, and our people will take care of you.&#34;Then, she told them that actual grass-roots organizations like theirs were socially dangerous, because they wouldn&#39;t stick to their original mission but inevitably became cults, essentially. Something like &#34;the best thing this organization can do, today, is vote to dissolve immediately&#34;All this was in exchange for a several thousand dollar speaking fee, which was the largest expense behind the venue for the event."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Where&#39;s the accountability? We&#39;re facing a global crisis. Once again, the rich are insulated from the consequences of their greed, while the poorest suffer the most. It&#39;s high time those who sold us out should have to answer for their actions. Something on the order of seven billion counts of reckless endangerment should do it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think i’ve got a slightly different take - i’m not saying my take is any better though.If we’re talking engineering principles, not team dynamics, then it’s:  1. Use immutability by default, even in languages that make that harder than it should be
  2. Understand how liberating idempotency is
  3. Divide and conquer, use abstraction to make hard problems manageable
  4. Delete code, delete tests, re-write stuff, re-write it again. Painful? Keep doing this till you get to the other side and feel liberation and empowerment, took me years to get past wincing at the idea of re-writing that thing AGAIN
  5. Pay attention to your build tooling - to do any given task, it should always take exactly 1 command. How do i run the tests? Run the test command. How do i deploy to non-prod? Run the deploy command. Etc

If we’re talking softer stuff:  1. Don’t block collaboration - e.g. if there are 5 people don’t work on 5 tasks concurrently. Work on 1, maybe 2 in some cases
  2. Accomodate 2 types of work: work that needs collaboration &amp; synchronisation (brain storming, planning, why are we even doing this, that kinda thing) work that needs focus time - sometimes that’s focus as an individual, sometimes that’s a mob focussed on one task and saying no to every other distraction in the world no matter how “urgent”
  3. Change what you’re doing throughout the day, don’t try to code all day, you’ll get in a rut, you won’t write your best code after a while. You can optimise this step, e.g. if the team is low energy after lunchtime, use that to your advantage and schedule the easy boring work then, don’t be afraid to use humour or burn low energy time just getting to know each other better
  4. Make sure people are being heard in the team. Hardest point to get right."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like a lot of these principles but there is a crucial element missing from this presentation and that is time.As a company grows the importance of each of these principles changes. As a project within an established company grows a similar maturation happens.If you tried to adhere to all &#39;best practices&#39; (principles or not) from day 1 of a project you&#39;d be carrying a lot of weight that could crush otherwise good ideas.Some principles, when presented without a timeline, seem contradictory and that can lead to fights on teams where developers are well meaning but less experienced.I&#39;m encouraged that this presentation includes dimensions along which you can slice the principles, but I encourage the authors to adopt a &#34;stage&#34; dimension as well that helps focus devs/learners on principles appropriate for 1. The stage they are in and 2. The immediate next stage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh wow, author here - I wasn&#39;t quite expecting this to appear here today. I&#39;ve only really just start talking to people about it.That said, my mission is to make software engineering better for everyone. By capturing the best principles from the best in the world at what they do. And to organise and share that knowledge, freely.It&#39;s currently missing features to organise principles well, but I&#39;m working on it (discussion here: https://github.com/PrinciplesDotDev/principles/discussions/2...)You can reach me through my profile or following me on @princples_dev (twitter) - I&#39;ve only starting pushing this, but a lot more will be coming soon.It&#39;s an open source project and it needs your principles to make this a reality so if you&#39;ve got some to share, please do. Or if you have feedback, leave it here. I&#39;m building it for you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When it comes to the problem of targeting, one interesting and promising tech is photochemical internalisation [https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochemical_internalizatio...], where you put the mRNA inside photosensitive molecules (and not lipids) and then shine some light on the tissue/organ where you want the mRNA delivered. Where activated by the light, the molecules then enter the cells, dissolves and deliver the mRNA.
The Norwegian company PCI Biotech has a tech they call fimaNAc for doing this with naked mRNA.https://www.pcibiotech.no/nucleicacidsThis presentation has a lot of illustrations and explanations:https://www.pcibiotech.no/s/PCI-Biotech-SMi-RNA-Therapeutics..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote a long essay about the same topic and came to similar conclusions as Derek Lowe: https://trevorklee.com/are-mrna-therapies-the-future-of-phar...One thing that I&#39;d like to emphasize is how unbelievably tiny mRNA therapeutics have to be. It&#39;s probably around 30 mg, and it&#39;s hard to do it more than once every few weeks, at least judging by siRNA therapeutics (which have similar immune issues).30 mg is really tiny. It&#39;s hard to come up with a meaningful therapeutic in such a small amount of material. People have been hyping up self-replicating mRNA as a solution, but that&#39;s still in its infancy, and has its own problems regarding the &#34;compilers&#34;/polymerases that need to be packaged with it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This sort of mRNA work isn’t immune-driven at all, in theory, and if you need your target cells to keep producing your desired protein, you’re going to have to keep telling them that by sending them more mRNA. Once a day? Once a week? Who knows? That’ll need to be worked out by experiment.This doesn&#39;t seem like a problem from the point of view of those who are in the business of selling mRNA :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting article for two reasons, how the practice originated and what it implies.The practice seems to be somewhat wide spread (in the distance between departments case). That might be because it came from a Facebook group or forum where Law Enforcement officers exchange tips. The second is the choice of artist (Swift) who has been in a pretty visible battle with ownership of her music. I suspect that if the officers who use this technique thought about it, they might find that using Disney tunes would be more effective in terms of triggering DMCA takedowns.What it implies, and is explicitly stated in the referenced video, is that a law enforcement officer is explicitly attempting to deny you your 1st Amendment right (as adjudicated by the courts). While the doctrine of qualified
immunity would likely shield them from prosecution, it is still a violation of your civil rights and should certainly merit disciplinary action on the part of the police department."</p>

You could do a lot better (and I would never want to have to use the sink proposed in that clip on a day-to-day basis).

What?Meanwhile you have like... storage for plates for 20 people as if you could ever feed more than 3 people at once. And that double-door fridge... I imagine that if you&#39;re in a more rural area it&#39;s more necessary but there&#39;s a lot better choices here if you are actually trying to make a livable space, instead of a place that offers good shots.
This looks a lot like a &#34;set up your own AirBnB&#34; thing. So much so I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if AirBnB made a strategic investment in this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another, less serious issue in the memoization example for JS:  (cache[key] = cache[key] || fn(...args));

Will not memoize results that equal 0 or an empty string.I guess it goes to show that copying answers from stack overflow might not be the best idea, whether it&#39;s done manually or using ML."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This points to a general problem. Think of all those top-voted but wrong or bad StackOverflow answers, and how many people copy paste them verbatim. Now you’ve got an AI ingesting and reciting those answers to a wide audience, and they will make way into (even more) new code which is then fed back into the training corpus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just imagine how many bad coding practices are going to be promoted to junior developers relying on &#34;helpful&#34; suggestions from this tool which is operating from an AI model and doesn&#39;t really understand what the programmer is trying to do.This whole thing just sounds like a bad idea from the start. Code should be written by humans. If you find yourself repeatedly writing the same boilerplate code, use or create a library, framework, or higher-level programming language, don&#39;t rely on an AI tool to attempt to guess what you want.Dijkstra must be rolling his grave right now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I purchased one of these computers for my child. It made a loud buzzing noise and turned off last week. I discovered the locked BIOS for myself when I tried to boot from a USB to diagnose the problem. Acer wants $619.99 to diagnose it at their repair center, since it is 2 weeks out of warranty."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; He explained that all computer vendors do this to one extent to another, such as Apple with iPhones, and refused to provide me any means to unlock it no matter how technical I am.I bought a Razer Blade 15 two weeks ago during Amazon sales - once arrived I opened it and upgraded the SSD from 256GBytes to 1TBytes without any issue, and it works really good on Arch...So, Acer, not all computer vendors are doing this shit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;but was told that Acer locks the BIOS on all computers shipped through Amazon in order to &#34;protect&#34; customers from changing things that might break the computer if they don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing.That doesn&#39;t make any sense.  Why would you lock it because it was sold through Amazon?Is it accessible if you buy it direct from Acer?Sounds like a customer support person just made up a reason."</p>
