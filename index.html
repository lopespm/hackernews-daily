								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Considering that Stripe was originally known for letting websites accept credit card payments without seeing your credit card number, one might assume that Stripe Identity only allows websites to see the verification result, and not your selfies and scans of your identity documents.That would be an incorrect assumption.  Per https://support.stripe.com/questions/managing-your-id-verifi... customers of Stripe Identity have API access to &#34;captured images of the ID document, selfies, extracted data from the ID document, keyed-in information, and the verification result&#34;.Thus, when you use Stripe Identity to verify your identity, you have to trust that:1. The website doesn&#39;t download, retain, and later leak your selfie and identity information.2. The website&#39;s Stripe API token isn&#39;t compromised and exploited by identity thieves to access your selfie and identity information.Stripe appears to be leaning heavily on their claim that they don&#39;t disclose &#34;biometric identifiers&#34; to websites and that these &#34;biometric identifiers&#34; are deleted from their systems within 48 hours. This is extremely deceptive considering that biometric identifiers can be reconstructed from the selfie."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The landing page contains logos for clubhouse, discord, and shippo, which are presumably companies use the service. Does anyone find those usages to be unnecessarily intrusive? Maybe it&#39;s just me, but a chat app or shipping site asking me for a drivers license scan + selfie would make me never want to use the service again. It&#39;s appalling how this sort of stuff is getting normalized, eg. google asking for id scans for age verification."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Smart. Banks haven&#39;t been allowed to monetize their KYC data, but this new non-bank class of payments companies have this opportunity. Interac has been trying to do this for many years.Some years ago I worked on a system let banks do identity assertions with proofs via SAML attributes instead of sharing customer PII. It is now a federation of banks in wide use for govt services in Canada. The use cases were really limited because the federation partners were too conservative to extend the identity services to relying party consumer applications real people actually wanted to use, and institutional sales cycles meant product feedback was glacial, so it has existed for over a decade in this relative backwater of gov-tech. I think identity companies have mostly failed to get traction because of a terminal lack of consumer sexiness, whereas Stripe has the jelly.Other companies in the identity space have been working on protocols and platforms, but none of them had a user base to extend an identity federation services into, which means they have never been able to make a real or viable product, just interesting techs. An internet payment provider with young consumer traction getting into identity is a Very Big Deal.It&#39;s going to position Stripe to knock out a lot of retail banks who can&#39;t offer similar services. Imo, this could make them bigger than Apple."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Surveys show anywhere from 25% to upwards of 40% of workers are thinking about quitting their jobs.This number is meaningless without previous year trends. In my circles, everyone from 25-35 is simultaneously preparing to FIRE and no-one that&#39;s 35+ has actually changed jobs despite being &#39;financially independent&#39;. Expressing intent to resign, and actually resigning are completely different things. (edit: to clarify, I mean changing jobs specifically in the context of making inroads toward the retire early portion of their goal. Changing jobs to increase compensation is as strong as ever)Real Translation: Covid has made people miserable in their jobs. The only way people can keep going is idle fantasies about a nondescript future date where this suffering ends.&gt; Workers have had more than a year to reconsider work-life balance or career pathsIMO, over the last year, people have only dived deeper into their delusions and relative sense of privilege. Suddenly, having good health insurance, WFH &#39;flexibility&#39; and a stable jobs are now being viewed as things to be grateful about rather than the norm for well educated and employable adults.&gt; &#34;Hopefully we’ll see a lot more people in 2022 employed and stable because they&#39;re in jobs they actually like,&#34; she says.Press &#39;X&#39; to Doubt"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They want us back in the office July 16... I&#39;m going to pass so found a new remote role with higher salary and equity. I will be part of this wave. I didn&#39;t realy even try with how insane the market is especially if you are specialzed in the current hotness.Moreso, the rise of fully remote role has opened up our ideas about our current living situation. The real estate market in our city is shattered and broken. So we will also move 60 miles south to a different city... before the pandemic I was remote and missed the office. Post pandemic... fuck the office and 1+ hour commutes purely because the city, state, and country have mismanaged infrastructure for 20 years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can tell you all the market for devs is white hot at the moment. I mean it was never cold, but right now seems to be insane.If the work-from-home thing has given you thoughts about what you like, now is the time to go. I see very few firms insisting on onsite work though, having interviewed with quite a few over the last few weeks. Even guys that I know would rather have people in the office and would pay them very well are feeling forced to let people work from home at least a couple of days.Salary wise it seems like it&#39;s breaking upwards too, though of course all I have is my own offers and the word of some recruiters. There&#39;s also just a lot of firms out there who are happy to create roles for people they like, or discuss new ventures with new people.Also, don&#39;t forget if you&#39;re going to look, absolutely everyone is interviewing remotely. You can sit at home at interviews all day until you find the job for you, something you might not be able to once more firms go back in the office."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Gooey is a brilliant bit of software.We use it in combination with Python Fire [0] to easily convert python code to something that users can interact with. Python fire converts our python code into a CLI without all the manual parameter parsing, and Gooey turns the CLI into a simple GUI.[0] https://github.com/google/python-fire"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used this to provide simple UIs to scripts for consulting projects where something more complex wasn&#39;t justified.It mostly works great. If you have a complicated UI with multi-selects, validations and default selections, it probably isn&#39;t for you. But if you really just need a desktop UI for a script, it does what it says. You can make a UI in a few minutes.There&#39;s also Wooey - a web-based take on the same idea if you need a Django web app to queue up and run your scripts. That implementation is a little more janky, but it also mostly works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, it looks really cool, but it requires wxpython, which in turn seems to be an issue installing on Linux.  Which, since I&#39;m using Ubuntu 20.04 (not an exotic flavor of Linux) and python3, was surprising to me, but it appears to be a common issue (lots of blog posts saying lots of different ways to get around this).  Might be useful to make some docs on how to install on the most common flavors of Linux?  If this already exists, my apologies, I didn&#39;t see it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This appears to actually go significantly beyond enforced password disclosure.  From the text ( http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Gen_Scheme_of_AGS_(Powers)_Bil... ), on Head 16 (p 28):- An officer can use these requirements on anyone who &#34;appears to him or her to have access&#34;.  They don&#39;t appear to need any evidence beyond that.  The person does not need to be a suspect or, it appears, the subject of a warrant, just a person present at the location subject to the search warrant.- It applies not just to access to information on the device, but information &#34;which can be accessed by the use of that computer&#34;, and thus presumably includes information that is on other machine, or potentially not even in Ireland or the EU.- It allows officers to freely operate computers on site during a search (this seems like horrible forensic practice?), and use passwords found on the site to try to access any information accessible from the computer.- It does not just include disclosing passwords.  It includes &#34;any password or encryption key&#34;, and anything &#34;to otherwise enable [the officer] to examine the information accessible by the computer&#34;.- It even appears that it allows officers to compel people not just to disclose passwords but to actually operate the device for them so as to enable information access, and &#34;to produce the information in a form in which it can be removed&#34;.- It is not clear to me that there is any restriction on the scope of information, so long as it is in some way accessible.- Head 17 appears to allow even legally (or otherwise) privileged information to be seized, so long as &#34;the confidentiality of the material can be maintained pending the determination by the court of the issue as to whether the material is privileged material&#34;.Combining these powers would seem to be able to result in ridiculous situations, for example, forcing a person to take data from a US server using an SSH key on their laptop, potentially violating US law by doing so, and for the person to do all the work necessary to do this themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly, such a law does nothing against proper criminals. People that know they have incriminating evidence will either not carry it on their phones or uses some form of steganography to hide it perfectly. In the worst case, they will have some form of wipe-me passphrase that cleans the device before unlocking.Normal people, on the other hand, do not have these kind of (mental, time) resources. They will be forced to unlock their phones and something incriminating (for instance regarding &#34;hate speech&#34; or &#34;intellectual property rights&#34; or just &#34;traffic violations&#34;) will be found. I consider this approach one step more in the direction of keeping every citizen an on-demand criminal. There are so many, sometimes incomprehensible, laws nowadays that pretty much everyone is not compliant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s a fun fact! If you appear to the police officer to have access or passwords, and don&#39;t give it to them, they can charge you with obstruction and jail you for up to 5 years!So if you can&#39;t prove that you don&#39;t have the password, you&#39;re in a bit of trouble!-------------------------------------16 (1).(e).(v) to require any person at that place who appears to him or her to have access to or to have under his power or control the information held in any such computer or which can be accessed by the use of that computer—(I) to give  to  him  or  her  any  password  or  encryption  key  necessary  to operate it,(II) to otherwise enable him or her to examine the information accessible by the computer in a form in which the information is visible and legible,(III) to produce the information in a form in which it can be removed and in which it is, or can be made, visible and legible67 (2).(d) A person who fails to comply with a requirement under Head 9 (1), (2) or (3), or Head 16 (1). is guilty of an offence and is liable—(i)  on  summary  conviction,  to  a  class  A  fine  or  imprisonment  for  a  term  not exceeding 12 months or both, or(ii) on conviction on indictment, to a fine not exceeding €30,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 5 years or both"</p>

Which programs work for me? Or, I have {goal} and n days per week, what should I do? The programs would be populated with exercises from the DB, programs could be exported, etc.3. As much ELI5 info as possible - the barrier to exercise for a lot of people (myself included despite my experience) can be not knowing wtf something is, or why to do it, and generally what the benefits are.4. Treat warmups like any exercise - a critical part of the routine. Include lots of warm up exercises, whether it&#39;s something you make quantifiable progress with or not. Everything from skipping rope and light jogging to dead bugs. Include these as part of program generation.Maybe something does this, but my favourite tracker (Strong) doesn&#39;t cover all of it and I&#39;d switch in an instant if something did. I like the idea of switching programs every year or so, experimenting with warm ups, having convenient access to understanding programs and lifts better, etc. As it is, working out requires a crazy amount of research.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was wondering if https://musclewiki.com/ was going to pop up. My wife had just sent it to me earlier this week.It lets you pick gender, muscle group, exercise type (stretch, bodyweight, barbell, dumbbells, kettlebells) and has detailed instructions and videos. (It does not have sets/reps like the shared site.) Perhaps they would be good to use in tandem.Personally, I think for sets/reps, it follows most exercise advice. Choose what you&#39;ll actually do. If that&#39;s 3 sets of 5 reps, fine. Do that. If you can get yourself to consistently do more than that over time, you&#39;ll benefit from the increase in volume. (When I&#39;m active, I follow Starting Strength style - increase warm-up weight while decreasing reps; then a bunch of working weight sets.)"</p>

What dopamine rush can i hope to get by contributing to your database :( ?Or at least comments."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Social and Economic Effects of the [Bubonic] PlagueSince it was so difficult (and dangerous) to procure goods through trade and to produce them, the prices of both goods produced locally and those imported from afar skyrocketed. Because of illness and death workers became exceedingly scarce, so even peasants felt the effects of the new rise in wages. The demand for people to work the land was so high that it threatened the manorial holdings. Serfs were no longer tied to one master; if one left the land, another lord would instantly hire them.https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Italian_Studies/dweb/plagu..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By “quitting” they mostly mean getting new jobs or career changes. Not necessarily refusing to work in an office. The headline is misleading.It’s also still a relatively small number in absolute terms:&gt; In April, the share of U.S. workers leaving jobs was 2.7%, according to the Labor Department, a jump from 1.6% a year earlier to the highest level since at least 2000.The higher turnover is expected in a booming economy like the one we’re in.These articles with hyperbolic headlines and underwhelming actual data are very common right now. It feels like the journalists want us to believe some sort of revolution is happening, be it WFH or remote work or people quitting in droves. I’m beginning to think the reality is mostly a boring return to pre-pandemic normalcy, though, given how hard these articles are teaching for something noteworthy to share."</p>

Obviously somebody thought they found a gold mine, but in their tunnel vision is so focused on &#34;owning&#34; something that they never owned, that they&#39;re willing to burn the whole place down to keep &#34;owning&#34; it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why doesn&#39;t the new Freenode staff just shut down the IRC servers? That would be a lot less work than killing off each channel individually."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is one of the reasons I love the emergence of the &#34;Gravel&#34; category of bikes. They look and have geometry similar to a road bike, but they have enough clearance for nice fat gravel tires.I ride in Chicago (shitty roads, potholes &amp; construction are everywhere), and love that I can put nice 38mm+ GravelKing Slick tires on the bike, and still have no problem keeping up with most road bikes. I&#39;ve gotten funny looks from folks who&#39;re unfamiliar with the concept, but it&#39;s such a great setup.Comfy/soft ride too.Edit: Cannondale Topstone if anyone is curious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ok, so i&#39;m curious how people feel about this, but i believe, for road riding, wider tires actually do make you faster, to a point of diminishing returns around 32c, because of cadence.when you hit a bump with high PSI / road tires, your wheel bounces, you&#39;re momentarily unweighted from the pedals, and that means your cadence is interrupted.  anyone who has raced cyclocross knows; there&#39;s a LOT of skill involved in applying pedal strokes at just the right times to absorb bumps while also continuing to apply power, and it&#39;s way less efficient than just riding clipless on a freshly paved road.  every bump &#34;resets&#34; your muscle contraction cycle, and after a bump, you&#39;re often not at the right crank position to apply a hard, sharp pedal stroke to try to catch up.i believe a ton of efficiency is lost through this biomechanical effect on cadence alone, and that&#39;s saying nothing of how much energy you lose in the transfer of forward momentum to an upward bounce impulse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think folks might be interested to consider some of the other myths and tests in the series, such as:* Titanium is ligther than steel* Fenders slow you down* Stiffer frames are faster* Disc brakes work better than rim brakes* Higher tire pressure is faster* Bigger wheels roll fasterhttps://www.renehersecycles.com/category/myths-in-cycling/For more nuanced tire testing and results, check out these two more recent articles* https://www.renehersecycles.com/how-we-test-tires/* https://www.renehersecycles.com/bq-tire-test-results/"</p>
