A year later, when the archive was still available from umpteen hosts.For all I know, it still languishes on who knows how many old hard drives..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey everybody! I&#39;m David, the creator of YouTubeDrive, and I never expected to see this old project pop up on HN. YouTubeDrive was created when I was a freshman in college with questionable programming abilities, absolutely no knowledge of coding theory, and way too much free time.The encoding scheme that YouTubeDrive uses is brain-dead simple: pack three bits into each pixel of a sequence of 64x36 images (I only use RGB values 0 and 255, nothing in between), and then blow up these images by a factor of 20 to make a 1280x720 video. These 20x20 colored squares are big enough to reliably survive YouTube&#39;s compression algorithm (or at least they were in 2016 -- the algorithms have probably changed since). You really do need something around that size, because I discovered that YouTube&#39;s video compression would sometimes flip the average color of a 10x10 square from 0 to 255, or vice versa.Looking back now as a grad student, I realize that there are much cleverer approaches to this problem: a better encoding scheme (discrete Fourier/cosine/wavelet transforms) would let me pack bits in the frequency domain instead of the spatial domain, reducing the probability of bit-flip errors, and a good error-correcting code (Hamming, Reed-Solomon, etc.) would let me tolerate a few bit-flips here and there. In classic academic fashion, I&#39;ll leave it as an exercise to the reader to implement these extensions :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Before broadband was widely available, TiVo used to purchase overnight paid programming slots across the US and broadcast modified PDF417 video streams that provided weekly program guide data for TiVo users. There&#39;s a sample of it on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VfUgT2YoPzI but they usually wrapped a 60-second commercial before and after the 28-minute broadcast of data. There was enough error correction in the data streams to allow proper processing even with less-than-perfect analog television reception."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey folks. Iâ€™ve had Starlink (standard service) mounted on my van for the last three months travelling around Australia with roaming off. Has been a game changer for working remotely and helping build Gitpod. It works just fine even when driving [1] or at techno bush doofs [2].[1] https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSdXwqGrP/?k=1[2] https://vt.tiktok.com/ZSdXwbq2b/?k=1Happy to answer any questions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From their ToS:
Best Effort Service for RV Users. Network resources are always deprioritized for Starlink RVs users compared to other Starlink Services, resulting in degraded service and slower speeds in congested areas and during peak hours. Stated speeds and uninterrupted use of the Service are not guaranteed. Service degradation will occur most often in &#34;Waitlist&#34; areas designated on the Starlink Availability Map during peak usage hours. See the Starlink Specifications for expected performance of the Starlink for RV Services."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been waiting patiently for almost two years to get it the old-fashioned way.  Just canceled my longstanding deposit, and ordered Starlink for RVs.  It helps that I really wanted it for my RV anyway, and just assumed all along that at some point in the not-to-distant future they were going to allow that.Fairly expensive, but it will allow me to work remotely from a very beautiful, remote location, and I intend to take full advantage of that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been using CAT phones for a few years. They really are tough, work pretty well with gloves, do not care much about water, etc. Can recommend, and the infrared sensors are worth it just for the wow effect alone :). From the downsides - some of the smaller things break faster than you&#39;d like (e.g. laser meter, or rubber covers for the USB port, or the painted/glued layer on the back in one of the older models). These downsides do not invalidate the main purpose(s) of the device. Also the phones rather quickly fall out of the supported Android version range, but this seems to be a common problem with all Android phones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We have push-to-talk, group chat, and live video software for similar devices:
Kyocera DuraXV https://kyoceramobile.com/duraxv-extreme/
Sonim XP3 Plus https://www.sonimtech.com/products/devices/xp3plus/Both flip phones are based on AOSP (https://source.android.com/) and we&#39;ve had to deal with custom implementations of soft keys, and push to talk headsets. Even Kyocera&#39;s implementation varies between the ATT version (https://kyoceramobile.com/duraxe-epic/att/) and the Verizon one.This phone is made by https://bullitt-group.com/ and they very smartly license the CAT brand. We have not worked with them yet, but I&#39;m guessing it would be relatively trivial to support the phone.Without good soft-key support, these phones are unusable. Any questions, please LMK."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m currently reading Digital Minimalism from Cal Newton and have started preparing for a 30-day digital declutter. So I was really excited to read this title and immediately disappointed after clicking - the Cat phone has a web browser. If you have access to the entirety of the internet in your pocket, it is hard to limit yourself and no little trick or hack is going to actually help - in my experience.I&#39;ll go ahead and take advantage of this post to ask, what do other digital minimalists on HN use for their phone? I&#39;m looking for something with messages, maps, a camera, and WhatsApp with no access to a browser or an app store. The most difficult item on that list is definitely WhatsApp. Unfortunately, if you travel a lot (which I do) it&#39;s not really optional. Outside of North America, EVERYTHING happens on WhatsApp. I&#39;ve started looking into custom Android ROMS but that feels like an extreme step for what must be a common problem?"</p>

In short: DKSB is not in favour of this. You know, the people that probably know what they are talking about when it comes to the protection of children, unlike the politicians who are trying to force this through.The politicians which only really talked to salesmen of surveillance software [3] about this and never really consulted any independent people with expertise in tech, privacy or the protection of children [4].Because this was never, at any moment, about protecting children.[1]: https://www.dksb.de/en/home/[2]: https://www.eu-info.de/dpa-europaticker/316232.html[3]: https://netzpolitik.org/2022/dude-wheres-my-privacy-how-a-ho...[4]: https://edri.org/our-work/private-and-secure-communications-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Living in France, the lie is also obvious for a very sad reason : we aldready don&#39;t do anything significant in case of a majority of &#39;obvious&#39; child abuses (sex related or not, that&#39;s not even the point).I know a fair amount of social worker whom sadly report that in a lot of child education place they know about A LOT of abuse, and a non negligible (and mental burden inducing) part of the work is to do triage, because they know they get (the number are made up) 50 report per week, but they only can &#39;investigate&#39; about 20, and even if the 20 are really worrying, they can only launch action for 3 to 5, any more would overflow the dedicated services.And that&#39;s not they are lazy, investigating is really complicated (and often not even worth, the main goal is to help the victim, no chasing culprits) and acting worse. You are pretty sure some girl in bad social context is being abused ? with whom do you send her living ? the maybe abusing father ? The probably violent alcoolic uncle or the nice but drug dealing older brother (who maybe is not ready to support her education even with a little financial help) ? That can seems parodic but I&#39;ve seen real conversations like that.The idea public services who cannot aldready read all the professionally redacted reports will suddently became omniscient because they can read my discord server private channel is funny.Hope some representative will jump on the occasion to request more social worker founds to treat the case we aldready know about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a very well written article that justifies its criticism of the EC&#39;s proposal with facts and numbers. Based on this, it really does look like child abuse is merely used as an excuse for more general surveillance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I hope some experienced people in the industry can give some hope and advice. Is demoralizing to find out I spent 4 years in school just to get into a really harsh job market. First pandemic, then recession? F...Overall, I&#39;d say relax a bit. You&#39;re still in a good situation. Recessions are hard for many, but software engineers were among the best off during the last one and I expect will be this time also.&gt; I wanna know if during recessions recruiting slows down even for big profitable companies.I remember Google&#39;s recruiting slowed down in ~2008. [edit: 2009? Maybe not right at the start of the recession.] [1] So sometimes yes. On the bright side, it&#39;s rare for profitable large tech companies to lay off software engineers, so if you get in, you&#39;re pretty safe.Even at startups, I don&#39;t expect a universal freeze. I asked an external recruiter (that is, someone who recruits for a variety of startups) a couple days ago about the present situation. She told me some companies she works with have done hiring freezes, others are still desperate to hire. There are opportunities. I&#39;m not a good enough business person to give you solid general advice about which startups will be most resilient, though.If you are good enough and/or persistent enough, my feeling is there will be a place for you in tech. (Even if, for example, you freeze up during coding interviews. Some companies do these, others don&#39;t. There&#39;s enough variety that you can still be okay if you don&#39;t have your sights set on a particular company.)If you are not, there&#39;s almost certainly still a place for you as a software engineer in a stable, non-tech company or government position. Non-tech typically isn&#39;t as lucrative, but you can be comfortable. My feeling is many of these places have a tremendous need for just basic automation. Arguably more so during a recession, although they may not all realize this.I started my career not long before the last recession. I didn&#39;t have any real existing savings to lose. Then I was earning far in excess of my needs and investing much of the rest in index funds (e.g. VTI) when stock prices were low. The recession ended and stock prices soared. I feel scummy saying this about many people&#39;s suffering, but the recession worked out well for me.[1] Personally I think this was a mistake. They could have hired a lot of great people during this time. &#34;Be bold when others are fearful.&#34; They had solid financial footing for hiring, and if nothing else, they could have put a fair number of folks on efficiency projects that would have more than paid their way in machine costs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Is demoralizing to find out I spent 4 years in school just to get into a really harsh job market.I know it doesn&#39;t make your experience any better, but this is *not* a harsh job market. Yes, some companies are pulling back/slowing down/pausing hiring, but there are still far more software jobs available than people to fill them.&gt; What companies or roles will be more resilient?Those that are or can quickly become profitable. Most startups are NOT profitable because they chase growth at all costs. This may change as cheap and easy money dries up.&gt; And how as a SWE / tech industry professional, specially the ones starting their careers like me, can prepare?Don&#39;t do anything different. You had one company pull out on you. That happens all the time for a multitude of reasons. Don&#39;t be discouraged. Apply for jobs at a range of companies, from start-ups to profitable SaaS companies to companies outside the typical &#34;tech&#34; wheelhouse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Their honesty should be applauded. Imagine they hired you and then had to fire you in 6 months. Keep in touch with the PM if you liked them and see how they perform in the next 12 months."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This title is very misleading (and really should be changed).This is not about search. To be clear, when you load our search results, you are completely anonymous, including ads. For ads, we actually worked with Microsoft to make ad clicks privacy protected as well. From our public ads page, &#34;Microsoft Advertising does not associate your ad-click behavior with a user profile.&#34; This page is linked to next to every Microsoft ad that is served on our search engine (duckduckgo.com). https://help.duckduckgo.com/company/ads-by-microsoft-on-duck....In all our browsing apps (iOS/Android/Mac) we also block third-party cookies, including those from Microsoft-owned properties like LinkedIn and Bing. That is, the privacy thing most people talk about on the web (blocking 3rd party cookies) applies here to MSFT. We also have a lot of other web protections that also apply to MSFT-owned properties as well, e.g.,  GPC, first-party cookie expiration, fingerprinting protection, referrer header trimming, cookie consent handling, fire button data clearing, etc.This is just about non-DuckDuckGo and non-Microsoft sites in our browsers, where our search syndication agreement currently prevents us from stopping Microsoft-owned scripts from loading, though we can still apply our browser&#39;s protections post-load (like 3rd party cookie blocking and others mentioned above, and do). We&#39;ve also been tirelessly working behind the scenes to change this limited restriction. I also understand this is confusing because it is a search syndication contract that is preventing us from doing a non-search thing. That&#39;s because our product is a bundle of multiple privacy protections, and this is a distribution requirement imposed on us as part of the search syndication agreement. Our syndication agreement also has broad confidentially provisions and the requirement documents themselves are explicitly marked confidential.Taking a step back, I know our product is not perfect and will never be. We face many constraints: platform constraints, contractual constraints (like in this case), breakage constraints, and the evolving tracking arms race. Holistically though I believe it is the best thing out there for mainstream users who want simple privacy protection without breaking things, and that is our product vision.Overall our app is multi-pronged privacy protection in one package (private search, web protection, HTTPS upgrading, email protection, app tracking protection for Android, and more to come), being careful (and putting in a lot of effort) to not break things while still offering protections -- an &#34;easy button&#34; for privacy. And we constantly work to improve its capabilities and will continue to do so, including in this case. For example, we&#39;ve recently been adding bespoke third-party protections for Google and Facebook, like Google AMP/Topics/FLEDGE protection and Facebook embedded content protection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just looking at the original title, I knew this was going to be a twitter post by a Brave employee posting either hearsay, or something taken out of context.Private browsing is a small niche, and Brave does their best to drive competitors at every turn, and not by being obviously better at it. Kinda scummy, if Iâ€™m honest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"DuckDuckGo feels like just a front for Microsoft at this point. I once looked into buying search ads on DuckDuckGo, only to discover to my horror that DDG didn&#39;t have its own ad business. DDG is entirely reliant on Microsoft&#39;s advertising system. You have to sign up for a Microsoft account to even put ads on DDG! And it&#39;s difficult â€” maybe impossible IIRC? â€” to specifically target DDG in those ads, without also targeting other MS properties.Until DuckDuckGo separates itself from Microsoft and becomes truly independent, especially in its business model, you have to question why DDG even exists.DDG was founded 14 years ago. I can understand initially bootstrapping on MS ads, but what&#39;s the excuse now? How about separating yourself from Microsoft first, before making a web browser that gives special exemptions to Microsoft?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to work for Nokia Research during the mid 2000&#39;s. I remember how hard it was to get the source code for this back then as internal employees... One of my colleagues was working on a research prototype that needed tighter integration with the system than what you could achieve with a deployed app. So he needed the source code and the build environment for the OS.And for that he needed quite a few people to agree and he had to sign an NDA (again, as an employee, not a subcontractor!). Then, of course the whole thing was pretty hard to make work on his machine.Later on I did some work with the (public) SDK as well. The build system was based on the GNU toolchain. More precisely, a windows port of the GNU toolchain, so it would only work on windows. But even on windows it had a lot of warts (because these tools were build for unix in the first place, so e.g. drive letters and back slashes were problematic). As far as I can remember, a lot of the build tools were written in perl. There was some script to generate makefiles for your project and even that, as far as I can remember had a front end script. (I remember something called MAKMAKE.BAT, but I may be wrong.)The whole thing was a pretty frustrating experience. And we haven&#39;t talked about the libraries, the OS (cooperative multi tasking, everything is a callback) or memory management (&#39;descriptors&#39; that made trivial string operations a pain). No wonder it couldn&#39;t keep up with android and ios. Now, to be fair, the OS was based on a core and concepts created in the mid 1990s to allow software development on devices with 64k of memory or something. But even with several megabytes of RAM (so the early 2000s), that programming model was obviously way too constraining."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is odd to see people talking about how Symbian was so early on, in the smartphone era.It&#39;s considerably more mature than that. :-) (For the avoidance of doubt: this is a good thing.)Symbian was a rebrand of the Psion 5 and 5MX OS, which was called EPOC32. It also ran on some other hardware, including the Ericsson MC218, Oregon Scientific Osaris, and Geofox One.The first EPOC32 device was the Psion 5 in 1997:http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/5300/Psion-Series-5/Succeeded by the 5MX:https://uxdesign.cc/psion-pda-how-does-it-look-today-327e01b...https://thenewstack.io/retrocomputing-in-modern-times-redisc...In other words, this OS was out there in the real world, in use by hundreds of thousands of people, five years before the first Symbian device (Nokia 7650)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are some other dynamics that are worth mentioning here that can stand in the way of undertaking any of the steps the author recommends.  I don&#39;t think they touched on any of these things so I&#39;ll list some of them out:* Technical staff in an organization feel they have no authority or respect within the organization.  This can happen when companies become too sales-driven.* Senior technical staff feel they have no ability to delegate, either because of the previous point or because they don&#39;t trust the technical ability of less senior staff.* Those in an organization who do have authority to delegate lack sufficient understanding of priorities or lack technical knowledge.These things highlight the classic balance between technical knowledge and managerial skills.  If you don&#39;t have people that bring both to the table, you&#39;re in for trouble.  Not sure if I&#39;d go so far as to say this is what it&#39;s all about.  However, reading over the author&#39;s advice, I thought to myself, &#34;None of this could have happened at some places I&#39;ve worked.&#34;  You can come up with a good plan, but if no one will listen to you or take your advice, it&#39;s worthless.The author probably was that person who brought what was needed to the table.  As such, perhaps the plan is not what ended up mattering so much as having someone who was willing and able to push it through.  Also, having the right people from top to bottom.  My feeling sometimes is that effective teams occur almost randomly.  This might be because organizations rarely have the patience or the resources to assemble them deliberately."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After the MVP is found, then the real work begins in building a company. We all understand that if everything is a priority, then nothing is, but often times, business resources don&#39;t. Support wants bugs fixed to keep customers happy and to re-sign. Sales whats features to land their whales. Engineering wants to work off tech debt, refine, and innovate. Etc.. I&#39;ve found that a formal &#34;Intake&#34; process works wonders. Engineering needs an advocate to take these disparate priorities and refine what, when and how to address. It&#39;s really that simple, and that complex. Finding someone to own it. Sometimes it&#39;s impossible depending on the Org and personalities involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who have gone through this there is one Achilles heel: appraisals.Unless the management agrees in letter &amp; spirit on prioritisation this is a disaster.When everything is a priority the message from top is &#34;We want best of both worlds&#34; i.e. we want productivity, quality and less complaining.Now you have prioritized in seq: A B C D... The team who has C or D to deliver will have there deliverables pushed by say 6 months. Guess who will be pissed-off with this?But the team accountable for D will say that this is what was agreed and signed on but the top still had those flawed expectations back of their mind.There is also cross-team impact. The product manager who was championing project D now has his/her appraisal in question. He/She will point fingers to the engineering and complain to his/her boss.In other words: Every one in the chain of command has vested interest. Unless they are aligned to large extent its hard to get out of this situation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t trust this developer.For the last two years or so they tried to retire &#34;Simple Gallery&#34; (which already had no ads or extra permissions required) and move people to its paid version by releasing updates with nag screens and fewer and fewer functions (edit: removals).Every single time someone complained in a review, they would reply a canned answer: &#34;Hey, there are many improvements in the Pro app version, it is definitely worth upgrading&#34;.I have no issue paying for apps I like, but sorry, I won&#39;t reward scummy behaviour."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a heavy user of f-droid and avoid these &#39;Simple&#39; apps.  The high level of nag is not just annoying but borders on begging.  Having pro versions where you can change colors defeats the idea of open source.  I hate bringing the negative energy, but there is a treasure of apps available with f-droid other than these.  I am glad they have their own website and wish they just went and did their own thing there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use the calendar one.Since it went not free, the free version doesn&#39;t generate notifications or alerts anymore. I almost missed appointments or meetings because of this.This is planned obsolescence at best. I seriously despise everything about this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The calls for affirmative action against China had a very low probability of bearing fruit beforehand, but since the Russian invasion of Ukraine I would put them at 0% - no sane politician wants to do anything that will push the Chinese further into common ground with Russia."</p>
