								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of the tweets that are quoted in the article have been removed. For example, Twitter employee Cristina Angeli is mentioned in the story for having tweeted an image of &#34;staff members... flooding an internal Slack channel with blue heart emojis as they wait to learn their fate tomorrow&#34;, but that tweet is deleted on twitter itself because &#34;This Tweet violated the Twitter Rules.&#34;This is ironic if you consider all the complaining that Musk does in the public sphere about &#34;freedom of speech&#34; (I know that the first amendment only applies to government censorship, but Musk likes to pretend not to), but it&#39;s also significant because -Smart journalists are going to stop relying on Twitter&#39;s API now. News and blog sites love to render Twitter URLs as a preview of the tweet; but if Twitter under Musk is going to start removing tweets that go against its corporate interests of the hour (is it against Twitter policy to post screenshots of any corporate Slack channel, or only Twitter&#39;s own?), then people had better take screenshots of the tweets they want to quote, just in case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And so the grand experiment begins. I feel bad for the folks losing their job because that always sucks, and I hope there&#39;s a decent severance package.Now we&#39;ll see what happens to Twitter... I hardly use it, so if it implodes it won&#39;t bother me too much. But I am curious to see if all the &#34;how do you need X people to do Y?&#34; commenters are correct in this case. The app is simple but doing simple things at scale is hard. I wonder if we&#39;ll see more downtime and issues now.I think this is also a great experiment for everyone who either thinks Elon is a genius and the greatest thing to bless this Earth,  or those who say he&#39;s overrated and Tesla and SpaceX were successes independent of him. I think Twitter has been around long enough that we&#39;ve all formed impressions of it. Let&#39;s see what this single change of replacing ownership actually results in.Anyone want to make predictions about the state of Twitter in a few years?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Musk and friends compare Twitter to other tech companies and see that it&#39;s ratio of employees to revenue is lowest. He therefore thinks he must halve the number employees and/or increase revenue to get this ratio up.From the chat log exhibits from the Twitter vs Musk case: https://danluu.com/elon-twitter-texts/#47A VC (Jason Calacanis) does back of the envelope calculations:Twitter revenue per employee: $5B rev / 8k employees = $625K rev per employee in 2021Google revenue per employee: $257B rev2/ 135K employee2= $1.9M per employee in 2021Apple revenue per employee: $365B rev / 154k employees= $2.37M per employee in fiscal 2021Twitter revenue per employee if 3k instead of 8k: $5B rev/ 3k employees= $1.66m rev per employee in 2021 (more industry standard)Elon: &#34;Insane potential for improvement&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author of this article is a public defender in the pacific northwest. He sometimes writes for Jesse Singal, but he also has his own substack.[1] Many of his posts provide a unique window into the criminal justice system. If that sounds interesting to you, I strongly recommend reading more of his writing. In my opinion, his greatest hits are Eleven Magic Words[2] and Death of a Client[3].1. https://ymeskhout.substack.com/2. https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/eleven-magic-words-unlocked3. https://ymeskhout.substack.com/p/death-of-a-client"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PayPal is such a weird company. I was a loyal customer for 20 years until I wanted to convert my account from business to personal (I closed the business) and the site refused to do so. after months of calls with support, it became clear that no one was able to do this (something locked the flow and no one was able to see what; I guess my account was so ancient, it has some db flags no longer used but still checked by their backend?), so I asked just to terminate my account. That also was not possible. It took 6 months to figure out why; my company still existed they said; it most certainly did not. It took 2 months to find out why they thought that; apparently, somewhere in the past 20 years, they searched for my company in the NL company register and attached the wrong company number to my account. So I told them the real number and they said; now all is fine, we can even convert it to personal. 1 hour later I received an email from PayPal that I am permanently banned as I am trading with a business account of which the company no longer exists… Well done!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; the contract you “agreed” to means you are legally not allowed to take them to a real court. Your only recourse is arbitration.americans can sign away their rights to sue at their own courts? That seems wrong.For me, as a german, the paypal contract reads that i can escalate a conflict to the EU consumer protection agency or the french regulatory authority for financial institutions (which signs their banking license). It further reads that the governing body of law and court of of justice should be in Wales, but that this does not limit my consumer right to sue at my local court. No arbitration clause, especially no mandatory arbitration with an agency of the corporations choice.I do understand the idea that private arbitration may be cheaper than court proceedings, but is mandatory arbitration  even legally enforceable, or is that just scary text a court would overrule?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is my &#34;if I won the lottery&#34; dream.  Which it would have to be, since everything about it isn&#39;t cheap. Purchasing a Pullman car then upgrading it to Amtrak standards will cost at least $300k. Any interior upgrades are on top of that (renovating the galley with modern appliances, adding central air since some cars used block ice for cooling). Amtrak requires you add 480v head-end power (but you will likely want a diesel generator too), door control/communication wiring, and to upgrade the braking system.Once you have your car and you have passed your annual inspection, you will need somewhere to park it, which usually means finding a short-line railroad or commercial business with a siding near you, and paying them a fee. Getting the car from there to the nearest Amtrak station will require you to hire a locomotive with crew (some tracks require a second car coupled to the locomotive so crossings &amp; signals work correctly). Amtrak then has a whole schedule of fees they will charge you, from $4.09 per mile, overnight parking, fresh &amp; wastewater servicing, transponder tags, and parking fees.You will want to hire a chef to prepare your meals and perhaps also a steward to serve the meals, make drinks, and take care of the staterooms. I&#39;m not sure if they need to belong to the union since they would be your employees, not the railroads (but probably).For the less than 100 private cars in operation in America, why does Amtrak even offer this service? Like the first class section on an airliner, it&#39;s effectively all profit for them since the train was going there anyway and the extra fuel to haul it &amp; supply power is minimal.  Personally I wonder why Amtrak doesn&#39;t offer a &#34;Presidential&#34; fare, where 6 or so people can book a private car and get truly top tier service.Here&#39;s what a restored Pullman car can look like:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdroQ4JqlYQ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We rode the New York Central 3, a private car built for a Vanderbilt a century ago, cross country, attached to the rear of the Lake Shore Limited, changing in Chicago to the California Zephyr. A great experience, watching the scenery go by for 4 days, with a 270-degree view from the sitting room in the rear.Basically, there are hobbyists who buy and upgrade these cars, and try to break even on chartering trips on them.  They’re clearly never happier than coming along for the journey (you need an official liaison on board anyway to interface with Amtrak staff) and fixing stuff along the way.http://www.nyc-3.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some of you might be interested in The Hacker Zephyr, a cross-country train hackathon with 42 teenagers from across the world.We worked with Amtrak and an amazing team of train enthusiasts to get 3 vintage train cars on The California Zephyr’s route across the US. We started in Vermont and ended in Los Angeles, traveling 3,502 miles over 10 days.Short documentary: https://youtu.be/2BID8_pGuqAPlanning documents and finances are open source at https://github.com/hackclub/the-hacker-zephyr"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve used RSS to follow all media for the past 2 years (FreshRSS+FeedMe, I have a guide here https://soapstone.mradford.com/hn-rss-guide/). It&#39;s been the single best thing I&#39;ve done to reclaim my attention. Here&#39;s a couple of other random thoughts:- Being able to dismiss articles where the headline is the story is really valuable. For example, I just dismissed &#34;Twitter’s mass layoffs have begun (techcrunch.com)&#34;- it&#39;s not worth my attention.- It&#39;s possible to accrue a large backlog of unread &#34;semi-interesting&#34; items that may or may not be valuable. In this sense, there&#39;s still a FOMO aspect to RSS, and you have to be aggressive in dismissing articles. For exmaple, a few 2-week-old backlog titles in my feed include &#34;SHA-3 Buffer Overflow&#34;, &#34;Show HN: Restfox - Open source lightweight alternative to Postman&#34;, and &#34;Five origami books by Shuzo Fujimoto are now public domain&#34;. These are semi-interesting, but really I should just dismiss them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I make heavy use of https://kill-the-newsletter.com/ to convert e-mail newsletters into RSS feeds -- IMO the RSS reader context is way better than an email inbox for consuming newslettery content."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HN is a great place to gather RSS feeds. Any time there&#39;s an interesting site I always look for them. These days I usually see articles that appear on the HN front page a day or so before they hit HN. But HN isn&#39;t the only place I practice this. Back in the 2010s it was obvious reddit was going under so I did the same there till 2015. I have 1000+ RSS feeds now and very little need for news aggregators on the day to day (except finding new feeds).QuiteRSS is an excellent native reader that handles my thousands of feeds well. It is so multi-platform it even has an OS/2 version. https://quiterss.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Linked lists are great. But they have the problem that, almost always, whatever problem you&#39;re trying to solve would be better done with a regular resizable vector.This includes problems that they should be great for, like insert into the middle or the front.The reason is that in practice the way computers actually work is that there is an enormous time penalty for jumping around randomly in memory, and it&#39;s large enough that it&#39;s often worth paying a O(lg n) cost to switch to something that will be contiguous in memory and allow the CPU to prefetch data.There are exceptions when you really should use an actual linked list, but your default should be a vector and not a linked list."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I thought of writing this blog post full of all the things I love about linked lists.The blog post is short, and I think the author covered about everything.Yeah, linked lists are sometimes appropriate, especially intrusive linked lists (the author called them &#34;embedded&#34; linked lists). The hate they get is a backlash against CS programs that introduce people to them early and don&#39;t emphasize enough the reasons you should usually pick something else. If we have to err on one side or the other, I&#39;d rather it be telling people not to use them.btw:&gt; Redis can be wrong, but both Redis and the Linux kernel can’t.Yes, they can, and I&#39;d rather avoid argument from authority altogether."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my experience, the linked lists that are useful are intrusive linked lists where the data you care about has a next/previous embedded pointer as opposed to an just storing an arbitrary object inside a linked list.One example would be if your thread structure has these embedded pointers, you can easily add/remove a thread to a linked list of threads waiting for some resource without any allocation just by pointer manipulation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It compiles a custom kernel for every operation, allowing extreme shape specialization.This doesn&#39;t matter.  Just look at the performance achieved by CuDNN kernels (which back PyTorch), they&#39;re dynamically shaped and hit near peak.  For dense linear algebra at the size of modern neural networks, optimizing for the loop bound condition won&#39;t help much.&gt; All tensors are lazy, so it can aggressively fuse operations.This matters.  PyTorch teams are trying to implement that now (they have LazyTensor, AITemplate, TorchDynamo), but I&#39;m not sure of the status (it&#39;s been tried repeatedly).&gt; The backend is 10x+ simpler, meaning optimizing one kernel makes everything fast.The first part of that sentence matters, the second part doesn&#39;t.  Kernels are already fast and their reuse outside of being fused into each other (which you need a full linear algebra compiler to do) isn&#39;t very high.  If you make sum fast, you have not made matrix multiplication fast even though MM has a sum in it.  It just isn&#39;t that easy to compose operations and still hit 80+% of hardware efficiency.But it is easier to iterate fast and build a seamless lazy compiler if your backend is simple.  You can pattern match more easily and ensure you handle edge cases without insanely complicated things like alias analysis (which PyTorch has to do)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"    &gt; It&#39;s extremely simple, and breaks down the most complex networks into 4 OpTypes:
    &gt;
    &gt; - UnaryOps operate on one tensor and run elementwise. RELU, LOG, RECIPROCAL, etc...
    &gt; - BinaryOps operate on two tensors and run elementwise to return one. ADD, MUL, etc...
    &gt; - ReduceOps operate on one tensor and return a smaller tensor. SUM, MAX
    &gt; - MovementOps operate on one tensor and move the data around, copy-free with ShapeTracker. RESHAPE, PERMUTE, EXPAND, etc...
    &gt;
    &gt; But how...where are your CONVs and MATMULs? Read the code to solve this mystery.

Ok, I was curious, so I read the code. The answer is that it represents a MATMUL as a 1x1 CONV. And it lied about CONV, which is a ProcessingOps.CONV and explicitly represented and implemented: https://github.com/geohot/tinygrad/blob/c0050fab8ff0bc667e40... Quite the letdown of figuring out this &#39;mystery&#39;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I must say they gained instant credibility with the minimalistic website given how fast it loaded.Code looks simple and easy to follow, and I love how the comments are constantly mentioning hardware characteristics, making maxing the hardware the goal. It seems that it’s trying to achieve this by jitting optimal code for the operations at hand rather than hand-optimizing kernels, and betting that the small number of operations will make tuning the codegen tractable.I haven’t kept up much with what’s happening in ML, but at least in the realm of columnar database engines, interpreting a series of hand-optimized kernels seems to be the dominant approach over compiling a vectorized query plan. Are compilers good enough at optimizing ML operations that specializing on input shape makes a difference over hand-tuned kernels?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Web3 is a nebulous term in the tech world used to describe a hypothetical future version of the internet that’s more decentralized than it is today and not dominated by a handful of powerful players such as Amazon, Microsoft and Google.This is not some hypothetical version of the Internet. This was how it worked until the early 2000s. Google and Amazon weren&#39;t evil back then. Microsoft was actively developing IE and had good intentions after it won the browser war. Almost everything was decentralized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Personal data stores have to be fast, cheap and private.&#34;Uh yeah.  That&#39;s called a Personal Computer - &#34;PC&#34; if you haven&#39;t heard of it.The problem is that technology came along and gave us a &#34;PC&#34; in our hand (cell phones) that wasn&#39;t a &#34;PC&#34;.  What we need is an actual &#34;PC&#34; in our hand.  That is: a cell phone that is under the control of the user (and no, a &#34;global single-sign on&#34; sounds absolutely worse than &#34;web3&#34; &lt;- whatever that is)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everyone on HN needs to take a week to actually look into crypto projects. Nothing that makes headlines is ever good, and it&#39;s clear that&#39;s where most of the opinions of it on here are sourced from.You&#39;re doing yourself a definite disservice by not investing a smidgeon of your time.You are looking at a garden and remarking about the rotten veggies on the soil floor."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tesla was one of the first big tech companies to start this cycle, announcing a 10% layoff in June.  Now they&#39;re hiring at a rapid clip.  https://insideevs.com/news/617007/tesla-hiring-boost-after-l..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s an interesting thing: there are other fields too. People tend to forget we need Civil Engineers, Electrical Engineers, Mechanical Engineers, Electronic Engineers, etc... This is not the end of the world. STEM professionals were switching careers because of the money and other amenities tech companies were offering (See &#34;a day in x-company&#34; trend on social media).The way I see it (cynical take) is that there has been a push to get lots of people in this field just to have a bigger pool of workers and lower SWE/Dev Salaries. Heck, small companies can&#39;t compete on salary + benefits when trying to pouch SWEs/Devs. For these companies, this scenario will be a God send since they could offer lower salaries (45k ~ 70k) but with the added value of WFH. My prediction: We&#39;ll see everything ramping up  again in 2024 (Prob. Q1). On the other side, tech companies will start lowering salaries, taking advantage of the uncertainty. Basically win-win for companies."</p>
