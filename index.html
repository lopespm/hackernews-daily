								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We used to call this the &#34;Scunthorpe problem&#34; - how do you filter for obviously rude names while still allowing people to have their actual names? Bearing in mind that some people&#39;s names are actually rude.I worked on the application form processing for the Nectar card launch in the UK back in the early 2000&#39;s, and we had several cases. Luckily we had human data-entry clerks in the loop, so all we had to do was flag when a name contained anything on the &#34;Scunthorpe list&#34; and get a human to look at it. Even then it wasn&#39;t perfect and a few slipped through. One of the early PR messes of the launch was someone getting a Nectar card issued with a rude name, and of course they immediately went to the press with it [0]I&#39;m interested to see they still haven&#39;t solved this [1][0] I never saw the journalistic interest in this: this guy said his name was &lt;rude name&gt;, and then signed the form to say everything on the form was true. Why is anyone surprised or interested that we accepted his name was what he said it was and gave him a card in that name?[1] https://metro.co.uk/2015/02/20/woman-refused-sainsburys-nect..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reminds me of the guy that streamed a talking banana on Twitch, where viewers could make it say things. People submitted variations of the n-word and got him banned, and after trying to filter out all character combinations he could think of he wrote a phonetic filter. That apparently worked much better than trying to think of every permutation of characters that sounds like bad words.https://youtu.be/bJ5ppf0po3k?t=715"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We had to do this for a link shortening system (to make sure random base64 didn&#39;t contain profanity). It was a pretty fun problem. Not just the implementation, but doing the math to make sure it didn&#39;t make our shortened links easily enumerable. The implementation wasn&#39;t too bad, but we set up logging initially to spit out any random strings it decided to block. I demo&#39;d this in front of the whole company and live tailed the logs and the first one that popped up during the demo was a big ole F bomb. It made for an excellent demo."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As much as I loathe the &#34;facebook is a private company that can do whatever they want&#34; argument, I have to admit it applies here. If I owned a store, and some guy kept coming and showing customers how to not spend any money in my store, I&#39;d kick that guy out of my store.I very strongly dislike facebook and can&#39;t wait to watch it die, so I know comparing it to a store is a poor comparison. But at the end of the day, fb is a business, and if someone is using fb to try and hurt their business, they have the right to terminate that guy&#39;s accounts.EDITMy point here is not that we shouldn&#39;t point out bad things facebook does simply because it&#39;s &#34;just business&#34;. I agree that the &#34;they&#39;re a business&#34; argument is just a deflection that derails the conversation into some weird business practice discussion, instead of all the bad things fb does.My point is more that we should try to frame these things so that the headline isn&#39;t &#34;facebook banned me&#34;. They ban people all the time and not that many people seem to care, and in this case, of course they banned this guy."</p>

I wonder how far you can stretch &#34;impairing the intended operation of Facebook&#34;, though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At Kami (kamiapp.com) we had to make a similar transition last year - we&#39;d seen usage grow over 20x in a 6-month period on our classroom product due to the pandemic, and we were storing all our content in a single-primary Postgres database. We had plenty of headroom before but we were suddenly running out of write capacity, even after scaling vertically up to ~150 vcpu. Our workload is super write heavy so scaling out replicas wouldn&#39;t have helped much at all, and I was spending a lot of time manually vacuuming in our daily off-peak as we were burning transaction ids at an astonishing rate, ~800 million per day.I looked at a bunch of options but ultimately managing a sharded database seemed like too much overhead for our small (but expanding!) dev team - so we decided to move our heavily loaded tables to CockroachDB instead, as since it&#39;s mostly Postgres compatible our transition would be easier, and it would be much easier to manage as it automatically balances load and heals. We&#39;re running cockroach on GKE and it&#39;s a really nice fit for running on kubernetes.Ended up working well for us - we still have our smaller tables on PG but we want to move it all to Cockroach over time. There were some teething issues as we learnt what to monitor on it (read amplification is the big one here, though pebble has helped a lot vs the previous rocksdb), and it does need a lot of hardware at high scale (we&#39;re running 50 16-vcpu nodes for it) but overall I&#39;m happy with it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great read and primer for anyone looking to shard and know they need scale. Having helped a ton of people shard their data, my advice still remains don&#39;t do it until you know you have to. The old Citus data blog is a great resource for some guidance around best practices and how to&#39;s even if not using Citus.That said some of the things you can do from day 1 make things way easier when the time comes later. Workspace ID/Tenant ID/Customer ID, having your data grouped that way makes it very shardable and saves you a lot of work later on in the case you didn&#39;t have that in your data model.I&#39;m not sure I buy that Citus/Vitess are magic, both are reasonably clear how they work and you can dig into it. At the same time I&#39;d weigh the downsides of Citus (can&#39;t speak to Vitess) in that the online rebalancer isn&#39;t open source so at that point it&#39;s a proprietary product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Notion seems like an interesting data storage problem. The vast majority of the data is in the `block` entity, which are organized into a sort of nested set, written/updated individually (user edits one at a time) but read in ranged chunks (a doc).Off hand this seems like an almost worst case for PG. Since the updates to blocks could contain large data (causing them to be moved often) and there is one big table; it seems likely that the blocks for a single notion document will end up being non-continuous on disk and thus require a lot of IO/memory trashing to read them back out. PG doesn&#39;t have a way to tell it how to organize data on disk so there is no good way around this (CLUSTER doesn&#39;t count, it&#39;s unusable in most use cases).Arm chair engineering of course - but my first thought would be to find another storage system for blocks that better fits the use case and leave the rest in PG. This does introduce other problems, but it just feels like storing data like this in PG is a bad fit. Maybe storing an entire doc&#39;s worth of block entities in a jsonb column would avoid a lot of this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We did this with FreeBSD several years ago at Netflix. We used to run heavily modified -stable kernels.  Our tree was ahead of FreeBSD-current in a lot of ways (TCP, ktls, VM) but way behind in other ways.  Every year or two we&#39;d rebase to a new -stable version, and that would be months of work. Often, there would be some bug introduced upstream many months prior that took weeks to track down because there was just so much to bisect through.  Because our tree was based on -stable, pushing changes upstream often involved porting them to a substantially different codebase in -current, and being unable to test the ported code at scale in production.Since we&#39;ve moved to tracking -current, we rebase every few weeks.  We catch any newly introduced bugs from upstream almost immediately, since there are only a few weeks of changes, not a few years, to sort through.  Its far easier to contribute code upstream.  In fact, we do most development upstream and wait until the next rebase to pick our changes up (or cherry pick them if it is something urgent).All in all, life is much, much, much better on the bleeding edge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You could have editorialized this title to:Rebasing a Linux Kernel Branch that’s Two Years Old and 9k Commits Deep…but you would have had thousands of us running to the bathroom to revisit our last meal.What a Herculean effort by these two engineers.  When your role is to track down fellow employees from completely different teams and crack the, er, carrot to get them to update their patch from two years ago, you can get very tired very quickly.I’m sure the hardware driver modules are fairly self contained but things like the userspace QoS patch could be pretty hairy.  The kind of thing where, for upstream, you’d spend 90% of your time landing a framework just to even be able to implement your feature with the final 10% patch.Oof.  Bravo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this part of the google monrepo? Not that it matters, but I wondered how far monrepo went, inside the tent.I hate to be a pessimist, and I may be simply ignorant of some realities, but it FEELS like this is setting an impossibly high goal. I think there will turn out to be something significant in 9000 variances, which cannot simply be uplifted into mainstream, and which turn out to be hard to maintain as a continual rebase into the emerging mainstream.I agree that 40 sounds low, but probably is a good indication it can work. 1% is within view, if they maintained pace so even on a 1% if the rebase cost can be handled, they can converge but that assumes there isn&#39;t a showbuster in the 9000."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ah, the many eras of corporate music. Canyon.mid exemplifies the late 80s / early 90s aesthetic - gets me fired up to optimize my multimedia strategy.The current era is mostly inspiring 4 chord repetitions with muted guitar and piano, with B-roll of cinematic nature footage and racially diverse businesspeople shaking hands. Also jaunty ukulele riffs with dance claps and some kind of &#34;oh oh ayy-oh&#34; vocal hook.What creative bounties will the coming decades bring?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was an easter egg in Windows 95 for clouds.mid.[1] You had to create a folder and rename it a few times, and then it would play the song[2]. Even hearing it now takes me back to a simpler time...[1] https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/69883/musical-easter-egg...
