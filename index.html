								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of comments already, but I&#39;ll chime on in.I realized this very late in life, but I have a test for when it&#39;s time to pay attention to a new technology. It&#39;s when technical people look at what seems like a groundbreaking idea, seem unimpressed, and say &#34;couldn&#39;t you just _____&#34;, were the blank is filled with something a nontechnical person doesn&#39;t understand or considers very cumbersome.The web: couldn&#39;t you just transfer a file to an open port and use a rendering tool to view it?Blogs: couldn&#39;t you just update a web page?Wikis: couldn&#39;t you just update a web page?social media: couldn&#39;t you just set up group view preferences and use RSS?youtube: couldn&#39;t you just upload a video and use tags for search?twitter: couldn&#39;t you just not? Isn&#39;t that just a worse version of what we can already do??Honestly, I&#39;ve overlooked almost every one of these things, because I failed to understand how removing small bits of friction can cause a technology to explode.Sure, some ideas are crazy new, but some sound too underwhelming to be revolutionary. but they are, there&#39;s no question about it, all those things I listed above changed the world, in ways both good and pretty damn awful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, I came here to say that this was possibly Paul&#39;s best essay ever. There is so much to learn here. Completely surprised by the negative comments and so many of them :). Specially on an essay that is essentially asking to not being critical right away.In my short startup life, I have had the opportunity of meet many founders, VCs and also get solicited and unsolicited opinions from friends and family. Most of the VCs, friends and family members were critical of my ideas or simply didn&#39;t spend the effort to really listen. I see the same thing happening to other founders and startups. Specially fun is meeting VCs who have never built a startup themselves or coming from a non technical background be overly critical and share their strongly held opinions on how my startup could fail. I ran out of fingers counting how many ways.Ofcourse a startup can fail. Thats why it&#39;s not a company yet. There is a saying that it takes many miracles to make a startup a success. Most founders know that already. We are already scared.Paul is suggesting a different approach. A more positive one. And given the statistics around Paul&#39;s and YC&#39;s success versus other VCs, you would think that the HN crowd of all people would at-least pay attention.P.S: My startup was rejected multiple times by YC. So not a fan exactly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The central thesis&gt; Most implausible-sounding ideas are in fact bad and could be safely dismissed. But not when they&#39;re proposed by reasonable domain experts.Is later contradicted by a discussion on the quality of criticism&gt; The lowest form [of criticism] of all is to dismiss an idea because of who proposed it.So which is it? Judge an idea by who proposes it or not? I think the essay stands without the tangent on ranking criticism, and it could perhaps be discarded entirely.But that&#39;s too easy, and I think the discussion of criticism is a strong (unintentional) counterpoint to the essay. You have gated the hard work of weighing an idea behind the reputation of the person who proposed it. History all too often labels a genius only in retrospect and in their own time were more likely to be considered fringe or even crackpots.In short, I think the essay is boiled down to &#34;find the right people to trust/engage/pursue, and especially don&#39;t discard their implausible ideas&#34;. The tack on of trying to localize to a &#34;smart domain expert&#34; in whatever you&#39;re interested in seems.... uninspired. The tack on of being more open to implausible ideas is more interesting. But the fundamental work is unchanged from basically all of human history- &#34;find (or become) the people who are going to be successful/transformative&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author writes that you can either pay with money or you can “pay with your attention”. What’s left unsaid is the cost of that attention. I believe that cost is very high and it isn’t just ads, it’s the design of countless products including social media sites, games and even the site you’re reading this on right now. It’s all designed to extract as much attention as possible, and the cost is people’s ability to concentrate, learn and get shit done. The cost is, in other words, staggeringly high."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The online ad business generally mystifies me.  While an awful lot of the internet, especially the surveillance advertising part, looks to be the greatest misallocation of engineering (and other) talent in the history of the world, ya gotta ask about the efficacy.The only reasonably accurate targeting I&#39;ve ever run into is the occasional ad for something I just browsed on Amazon.  I&#39;ve never clicked on an internet ad.  Youtube advertising might as well be targeted to an alien race.  What in the hell keeps this whole business afloat at it&#39;s current level?  Am I being programmed to buy that mechanic&#39;s vise because they threw up an after-the-browse ad?No doubt there&#39;s some sort of backend telemetry that proves the value of all this trouble, but I just don&#39;t see it.  Maybe the emperor really is nekkid.edit:  It may well be that the real marketing genius in the advertising industry is not it&#39;s value in increasing sales, whether it&#39;s old school print media/OTA/tradeshows or the newfangled spying-on-you internet variety, but in convincing it&#39;s customers of advertising&#39;s value.  Anything beyond pushing you up a search engine&#39;s ranking strikes me as a sketchy proposition."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As the person who originally asked &#34;why&#34; I feel like I ought to respond, though much of it is covered by other comments. I used to work in more trad advertising, so my question wasn&#39;t so much an objection to working in advertising itself, but specifically Google&#39;s version of advertising, which I see as gross overreach into people&#39;s personal lives.In other comments people have mentioned YouTube subscriptions as being an alternative, it really isn&#39;t - OK, you don&#39;t see any adverts, but they&#39;re still harvesting and selling you. That a privately owned corporation is allowed to read your messages and sell what they find to the highest bidder is vile and honestly makes me wonder how we got here.I quit advertising after only a couple of years because it blackened my soul. If I was helping to harvest people&#39;s personal lives for private profit I can only imagine it would have been worse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For about 15 years I&#39;ve been trying to figure out how to articulate a `Tetris is life` essay. &#34;Things are going good, you&#39;re given an S piece that doesnt fit anywhere. You have to decide where you&#39;ll put that blocking piece so that you can hopefully clear it later. This might be an unexpected car repair bill or a death that you aren&#39;t emotionally capable of addressing ... You&#39;re in control, you have a good job, a great partner, and yall are saving to buy a house -- basically waiting for an l piece to complete your `Tetris`...&#34;Anyway, this game of (ha)Tetris is a lot like a lot of people&#39;s lives, just roadblock after roadblock. While the normal version where you start from zero on level one is probably an upper middle class life. And Id say that the majority of people in the world start on level 6 with the board halfway filled with a bunch of gaps and the pieces move at a speed that is barely controllable (im thinking of the classic gameboy version when I imagine these boards)Hatetris is cool. I couldn&#39;t get one line and I consider myself a damn good tetris player. It kept giving me S pieces and threw a Z in there and then an l"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Open-ended homework for those who are interested: solve the same problem, but with actual Tetris rules.I&#39;ve seen a bunch of those &#34;adversarial tetris&#34; variants, and they all operate under the assumption that any of the seven pieces can appear at any time, and with only one preview.Modern Tetris has 3 previews + hold, and pieces are drawn randomly &#34;from a bag&#34;, without replacement (more formally, if P[i] is the sequence of pieces, each aligned subsequence of 7 pieces must be a permutation of the tetrominos).This would be more interesting to make/play. Note that under such rules there exists a strategy that allows infinite play if the well is at least 17 tiles high."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With all the over-the-top sensationalized news reports, I did not hear an understated humor in a long time and then I saw this in the article! Nice one!&gt;&gt;IBM states that the technology can fit ’50 billion transistors onto a chip the size of a fingernail’. We reached out to IBM to ask for clarification on what the size of a fingernail was, given that internally we were coming up with numbers from 50 square millimeters to 250 square millimeters."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an amazing step and the transistor density chart shows you just how big a deal this is. 1/3B transistors per square mm. Now for &#39;grins&#39; take a piece of paper and make a 2 x 2 mm square on it. Now figure out what you can do with 1.3B transistors in that space. Based on this[1] you are looking at a quad-core w/GPU desktop processor.Of course you aren&#39;t really because you cant fit the 1440 pins that processor needs to talk to the outside world. But it suggests to me that at some point we&#39;ll see these things in &#34;sockets&#34; that connect via laser + WDM to provide the I/O. An octagonal device with 8 laser channels off each of the facets would be kind of cool. Power and ground take offs on the top and bottom. That would be some serious sci-fi shit would it not?[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The table in the article suggests to me that instead of this fictional &#34;feature size&#34;, we could use the achievable transistor area as a more meaningful measure of process scale.IBM achieved 50B transistors in 150mm^2, for a per-transistor area of 3000 nm^2.TSMC&#39;s 5nm process (used by Apple&#39;s M1 chip) apparently achieves a transistor area of 5837 nm^2, while Intel&#39;s 10nm is lagging at roughly 10000 nm^2."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It was obvious at the time. I recall many people reporting that fake comments antithetical to their own beliefs had been submitted using their identities.Why was FCC head Ajit Pai able to get away with citing fraudulent evidence? How can we stop such blatant corruption of the FCC&#39;s policy-making process in the future?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The headline news is that they do so with impunity and achieved their goals at no cost. The corporations (&#34;like AT&amp;T, Comcast and Charter&#34;), their association (Broadband for America), the lobbying firm (unnamed - who is it?), and the FCC, to the degree it failed its duties, suffer no consequences - and indeed the corporations get what they wanted; their plan worked.&gt; The report said investigators had not found evidence that Broadband for America or the lobbying firm it used for the campaign were aware of the fraud. But, the attorney general said, several “significant red flags” had “appeared shortly after the campaign started, and continued for months yet still remained unheeded.”&gt; The attorney general’s office said it had reached agreements with three “lead generation” services that were involved — Fluent, Opt-Intelligence and React2Media, companies that gather customers for clients as part of marketing efforts. Under the agreements, the companies said they would more clearly disclose to individuals how their personal information was being used. The companies also agreed to pay over $4 million in penalties."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t say what&#39;s driving all the playerbase losses but:They stopped development on Diablo 3 a long time ago. It doesn&#39;t have the staying power of more modern online games where new content is added continuously.They stopped development on HotS, which never achieved the same level of pull as League of Legends.Overwatch faces stiff competition from Valorant and other competitive small team FPSes, and also has overlapping audiences with battle royale FPSes.Starcraft 2 is basically dead. WC3 remastered flopped. The RTS genre writ large is definitely in a waning phase.IMO, when a gaming company doesn&#39;t make new games, it is going to see some losses in the playerbase. To me it&#39;s more remarkable that they&#39;ve only seen this much of a dropoff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Do you guys not have phones?&#34; -Blizzard staff in 2018, in response to booing fans upset that Blizzard wouldn&#39;t make a PC version of a game those same fans obviously wanted to play.This company has been contemptuous of their players for years.   They fell into that classic trap of &#34;If we [do something that will alienate all our customers] we can get 10x as many customers from [untapped market]&#34;    As anybody should have been able to foresee, the old customers were indeed alienated and the new customers never materialized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blizzard died the day it was bought by Activision. It has been descending into mediocrity ever since. Many executives left, and many studios/teams inside Blizzard have been shuffled around and between projects, unlike Blizzard&#39;s doctrine of old (tight teams focused on a project until it&#39;s great or must be stopped -- Blizzard&#39;s infamous &#34;Soon(tm)&#34;).World of Warcraft is still being milked till it dries up (and I&#39;m saying that as someone clocking 560+ days in game). Diablo has been abandonned (see the announcement of a mobile Diablo game last year¹, and its reception by the player base). So has StarCraft. Overwatch is stagnant (no new hero for a year) and Overwatch 2 is probably in development hell (pure speculation on my part I&#39;ll admit). Heroes of the Storm is also pretty stagnant (the game went from a hero every month to only two last year, nothing in 2021 so far).In the meantime, there has been a very heavy push for e-sports with Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm (though I have not followed any of those). These efforts seem, to me, extremely centred on American audience, unlike League of Legends which has multiple leagues around the world. I&#39;m sure a ton of money has been poured into this venture, but I&#39;m unsure it has improved the games...Anyway, the last time I launched Battle.net was for Destiny 2... and it has migrated to Steam in the middle of 2019!¹Wow OK, that was in 2018 o_O Time flies, especially with a global pandemic, it seems..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m excited to share that Building Mobile Apps at Scale: 39 Engineering Challenges is out. It&#39;s my first-ever paperback book and one that is free as a PDF for the rest of the month[1].I had worked for years at Uber, first as a mobile engineer, then an engineering manager. Despite being a mobile-first company, I could not shake the feeling that non-mobile engineers and managers consistently underestimated the complexity of large-scale mobile development. I&#39;ve been in so many meetings where an engineer, a PM, or a director would say, &#34;oh, compared to the backend, the mobile part should be simple enough... it&#39;s just another frontend, right?&#34;.I found myself explaining again and again to PMs, engineers, and stakeholders all the hoops the mobile team needs to jump to ship things in production. How mistakes are very expensive - and thus, we need to ship almost all changes behind feature flags. How the build train means that the changes we make today will take at least 2 weeks to get to prod. How devices being offline is something we need to actively support, and anticipate... and so on. I noticed similar &#34;aha moments&#34; each time. Talking with other mobile engineers in similar environments, they were having similar conversations, and battling similar assumptions on mobile being relatively simple.I had been collecting the numerous challenging areas that I planned to publish as a blog post. After I shared the draft on Twitter[2], I got an unexpected amount of interest in people offering to contribute. The contents became too long for a post, and so this book was born. Several people asked for a paperback version[3], and I decided to create the book in print as well, as I felt the contents warranted it.I hope you find this book useful - both if you&#39;re a mobile engineer or if you work with mobile teams. And I&#39;d love to hear any feedback![1] https://www.mobileatscale.com/#pricing[2] https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1335305213394251780[3] https://twitter.com/elevenetc/status/1335595203411972097"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having read the book cover to cover I can say that it is quite a well made, relatable list of challenges and how they are being resolved in the sector. Foreseeing these types of issues is hard especially if you never went through the process, and quite hairy to resolve as such I believe it is a very good resource to have.On another note each section comes with quite a lengthy follow up material, which I found absolutely amazing to use as a starting point as well.Absolutely love it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everything Gergely writes (and he writes a lot! Books, blogs, tweets; and also YT channel) is gold, especially if you&#39;re into mobile dev, interested in growing as a senior developer, or if you live in Europe and are interested by big tech. He&#39;s really filling a huge gap.Re:book, I&#39;ve been an Android dev for 3 years (hybrid &amp; native) and the book really covers the whole spectrum of things (as you can see in the table of contents) that need to be done to have a good app, some of them hard to know in advance. At the same time, it can (and should) be read and understood by non-devs (project managers, directors etc.). Congrats on the launch!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the screenplay of A Scanner Darkly (I don&#39;t know if something similar is in the original PKD story)ERNIE LUCKMAN
... this guy appeared on tv, claiming
to be a world-famous imposter. He
said he&#39;d posed at one time or another
as a great surgeon, a theoretical
submolecular high-velocity particle
research physicist, a Finnish
novelist, a deposed president of
Argentina...BOB ARCTOR
He got away with it? Never got caught?ERNIE LUCKMAN
See, the guy never really posed as any
of it. He only posed as a worldfamous imposter. Turns out he just
pushed a broom at Disneyland, until he
read about this actual world-famous
imposter, and he thought, I can pose
as all those things, then he thought,
hell, I&#39;ll just pose as an imposter.
Save a lot of time, a lot easier.
Made almost as much money as the real
imposter with books and movie rights."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s something hilarious about a guy getting rich and famous for lying and tricking people for profit, when it turns out he got rich and famous by... lying and tricking people for profit in a different way? I mean, complaining about being taken advantage of sounds pretty silly, it&#39;s not like he didn&#39;t tell you he was a liar who tricked people for profit!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Frank Abnagale&#39;s Comments on the movie and book (2002) [0]. I don&#39;t know if his story is true or not. But regardless of his story, his talk at Google is one of the best ones I&#39;ve heard [1].&gt; I was interviewed by the co-writer only about four times. I believe he did a great job of telling the story, but he also over dramatized and exaggerated some of the story. That was his style and what the editor wanted. He always reminded me that he was just telling a story and not writing my biography. This is one of the reasons that from the very beginning, I insisted the publisher put a disclaimer in the book and tapes.[0] https://www.abagnale.com/comments.htm[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsMydMDi3rI"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Considering the high-profile nature of their partnership as it pertains to the Gates Foundation as well as potential down-stream impacts e.g potentially around which projects are picked up by the foundation, strategic philanthropic decisions, etc., this post would seem to be pretty relevant to the HN community.Please stop flagging it.Feel free to downvote me for complaining about the flags, but don&#39;t flag the post. No, I&#39;m not OP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Until we get some other news, I’ll just assume this is a case where sometimes two people were great together at one point in their lives aren’t at another. This happened to my parents when my sister and I were both out of the house, they realized they weren’t the same two people they were decades before. Thankfully, they’re both very cordial with one another and both happily remarried.I have doubts this means anything negative for the foundation, other than maybe a rebrand of the name. I live in Seattle and have a few friends who work there - While both Gates are active in the spectacle of the foundation and pushing the broader mission, neither touch day-to-day operations at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why does this story keep getting flagged on HN? As multiple people have pointed out, regardless of the personal issues in question, this affects a large number of people (such as those at the Gates Foundation)."</p>
