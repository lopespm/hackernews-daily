								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These changes look fantastic.If I may hijack the thread with some more general complaints though, I wish the Postgres team would someday prioritize migration. Like make it easier to make all kinds of DB changes on a live DB, make it easier to upgrade between postgres versions with zero (or low) downtime, etc etc.Warnings when the migration you&#39;re about to do is likely to take ages because for some reason it&#39;s going to lock the entire table, instant column aliases to make renames easier, instant column aliases with runtime typecasts to make type migrations easier, etc etc etc. All this stuff is currently extremely painful for, afaict, no good reason (other than &#34;nobody coded it&#34;, which is of course a great reason in OSS land).I feel like there&#39;s a certain level of stockholm syndrome in the sense that to PG experts, these things aren&#39;t that painful anymore because they know all the pitfalls and gotchas and it&#39;s part of why they&#39;re such valued engineers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PostgreSQL is one of the most powerful and reliable pieces of software I&#39;ve seen run at large scale, major kudos to all the maintainers for the improvements that keep being added.&gt; PostgreSQL 14 extends its performance gains to the vacuuming system, including optimizations for reducing overhead from B-Trees. This release also adds a vacuum &#34;emergency mode&#34; that is designed to prevent transaction ID wraparoundDealing with transaction ID wraparounds in Postgres was one of the most daunting but fun experiences for me as a young SRE. Each time a transaction modifies rows in a PG database, it increments the transaction ID counter. This counter is stored as a 32-bit integer and it&#39;s critical to the MVCC transaction semantics - a transaction with a higher ID should not be visible to a transaction with a lower ID. If the value hits 2 billion and wraps around, disaster strikes as past transactions now appear to be in the future. If PG detects it is reaching that point, it complains loudly and eventually stops further writes to the database to prevent data loss.Postgres avoids getting anywhere close to this situation in almost all deployments by performing routine &#34;auto-vacuums&#34; which mark old row versions as &#34;frozen&#34; so they are no longer using up transaction ID slots. However, there are a couple situations where vacuum will not be able to clean up enough row versions. In our case, this was due to long-running transactions that consumed IDs but never finished. Also it is possible but highly inadvisable to disable auto-vacuums. Here is a postmortem from Sentry who had to deal with this leading to downtime: https://blog.sentry.io/2015/07/23/transaction-id-wraparound-...It looks like the new vacuum &#34;emergency mode&#34; functionality starts vacuuming more aggressively when getting closer to the wraparound event, and as with every PG feature highly granular settings are exposed to tweak this behaviour (https://www.postgresql.org/about/featurematrix/detail/360/)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Haxplore is a little web app I created because I didn&#39;t like to click around the HN interface to read submission and discussions. I also wanted to experiment with different ways of implementing keyboard control in web apps and HN seemed like the perfect test subject. So maybe it&#39;s useful for some of you too. The most important features are:- Intuitive keyboard control- Link detection in comments with hotkeys to open them directly- Better readbility and formatting of comments- Hotkeys for the most common actions- Ability to open stories or comments in an overlay for reading long texts"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great! For stories with 100s of comments it&#39;s nice to start browsing from a collapsed view of top-level comments.- Why is the Comments count shown only for the highlighted story?- On Firefox Windows, pressing the Enter key on an item triggers a popup warning at the top of the page. Took me a few tries to notice what was going on.- Alt + H triggers the Firefox Help menu for me :| Can you change that shortcut key to &#34;?&#34; instead? GMail, Github etc use &#34;?&#34;.- The green background for the comment text is a bit too dark.- Is it just me or is the comment text not showing paragraph breaks?- The zoom in transition when the comment text modal shows up just slows things down. If I&#39;m going to load many comments in that view I&#39;d rather it load instantly. Also, what&#39;s the purpose of this modal? There&#39;s a &#34;Space -&gt; Read&#34; for the comment that I&#39;m already reading. I don&#39;t get it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can you please avoid blurring the prior column (or at least the comment you came from)? It&#39;s useful to see context that way.Otherwise I think it&#39;s really good. Reddit should have aspired to something this well thought out.(I&#39;d also like page up / page down.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One tip I have to make large-ish awk programs readable is to name the columns in the BEGIN section. Then, you&#39;d use $colname instead of $1, $2, etc. for instance:BEGIN{
     item_type = 1;
     item_name = 2;
     price = 3;
     sale = 4;
     #etc
}Now, in place of $1, you&#39;d say $item_type which significantly improves overall readability of the code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of great AWK tutorials in here that are more in depth, but I&#39;ll share another.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Thanks for sharing this. I&#39;m the author.When I wrote my introduction to JQ someone mentioned JQ was tricky but super-useful like AWK. I nodded along with this, but actually, I had no idea how Awk worked.So I learned how it worked and wrote this up. It is a bit long, but if you don&#39;t know Awk that well, or at all, I think it should get the basics across to you by going step by step through examining the book reviews for The Hunger Games trilogy.Let me know what you think. And also let me know if you have any interesting Awk one-liners to share."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In 2017 Cloudflare had an HTML parser bug that caused encrypted HTTP traffic to be leaked. Any website served by Cloudflare was vulnerable to having all of its traffic leaked into the HTML body response of the website that Cloudflare proxied. Given that Cloudflare is the proxy service for 80% of websites that use proxies, this affected a significant portion of the internet.Cloudflare served private HTTP traffic in response bodies, meaning that website results contained cookies, session data, encrypted traffic, all personally identifiable, and because it was served as response bodies, it was *indexed by search engines*, not to mention anyone else who was scraping websites during the time of the incident. It included credit card information, frames from videos, PII, the works, all linked to individual users.This was ongoing for *months.*Anyone savvy could use this information to hijack accounts, scrape personal information, view private browsing habits. Even when Cloudflare publicly announced it (and tried to blame others) when they thought they had cleaned up most of the data, you could still easily use search engines to find people&#39;s personal information by searching for the Cloudflare header strings that started the leaked session information.Many countries have legal policies around data breaches, including required disclosure policies and penalties. In the greatest blind eye turn of the history of the internet, Cloudflare managed to get away with a single blog post, and no other penalties. https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-c...THAT is Cloudflare&#39;s disruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;More importantly, AWS itself is locked-in to its integrated approach: the entire service is architected both technically and economically to be an all-encompassing offering; to modularize itself in response to Cloudflare would be suicidal.&#34;Eh, somewhat. AWS is already modular in a lot of ways. You want S3? You got it, no matter where you are. (We&#39;re talking after them doing some sort of fee drop here.) You want to run exactly one EC2 instance? No problem. You want a message queue? You don&#39;t need anything else. You can integrate it with the notification service but it&#39;s optional.Sure, some of their services are integrated, but a lot of that integration is just &#34;this service pulls from S3 and writes to S3&#34;, not massive integration at every level.There is some stuff that is deeply tied in, yeah. But it&#39;s not like every single AWS service is deeply tied into half the other ones and the moment you open an EC2 instance you also are buying into a dozen other services. (It may feel like it if you put together a network and override the default block storage, but that&#39;s really just giving you knobs that are simply preset elsewhere, not really &#34;lockin&#34;.) A lot of it is already pretty modular."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cloudflare is truly amazing.They almost compete with everyone now.DNS: They eat simpledns lunch
Pages: They eat Netlify lunch
Worker: They eat serverless/lambda as in AWS/GCP lunch
R2: They eat AWS LunchAnd finallyEmail Forwarding: They eat ... my own lunch (I&#39;m founder of hanami.run an email forwarding service)That&#39;s being said, from a user perspective, if my domain is already on CloudFlare, I can just host everything on it.Right now, cloudflare workers is pretty great to add some dynamic stuff. And pages is great for static site."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems like a lot of people here have been in an ineffective large organisation and an effective startup. I&#39;ve worked at an effective large organisation and an ineffective startup, so perhaps I can shed some light on what these kind of processes are for:* You don&#39;t get to be a large organisation without accumulating generations of previous products. Well, unless you&#39;re google and can regularly fire your customers without going bust. but part from them, you start to need processes just to track what&#39;s going on. (The  ineffective startup accumulated previous product attempts too, and is still paying  for a lot of pointless infra because no-one still there knows which ones can be switched off).* At a large scale, it starts to be pretty difficult to maneuver if each dept of 30-50 people has built or contracted all their own infra &amp; services. Some divergence is useful for agility, but a lot of it is just waste and actually slows you down when you want two depts to work together on something - or even prevents useful collaboration. An effective organisation will make the tradeoff consciously.* When you complete dozens of projects per year, it starts to be possible to invest in researching and rolling out best practices in areas where a startup just has to go with the simple/obvious answer.  When my startup employer moved, it was pretty onerous, and there was a bunch of stuff we never found again. The large org had so many offices that it had a full time dept just for moving offices. (They weren&#39;t dumb, each move consolidated offices -but they kept buying other companies). When they moved us, it was like magic - we went home on a friday and went to work on a monday in the new office, and everything was set up. Well, we had to set up the lab ourselves, but"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s hard because it&#39;s meant to be hard.Once you have a large org that&#39;s making money, you don&#39;t really know exactly why it makes money. Sure, there&#39;s annual filings and there&#39;s still the elevator pitch of what the org does. But the actual how of how it works is difficult to describe in causal terms: if team X or Y was not there, the business would do better/worse? How does this team interact with that? It&#39;s really a bunch of informal relationships between different people, and both the people and the relationships change over time.So what you want to do when you know the whole sorta-works and you want to keep it that way is you pour glue all over it. You try to formalize processes, you give people titles and you make hierarchies. That way you attempt to stop the firm from inadvertently slipping into dysfunction.The side effect is of course that everyone who works there can see ways to improve things, but they can&#39;t see a way to get those improvements implemented."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Big mistake in the article to claim that a single engineer could build Amazon, Facebook, or Google. Amazon is the most egregious.&gt; . A software developer could write a simple e-commerce website in a few days; Amazon employs 1,335,000 people [source].Those 1.4 million people are not coding the e-commerce app but making e-commerce happen as package handlers, drivers, finance teams, etc. on top of that Amazon has many non e-commerce related projects: building hardware (Kindles, Alexa, etc) , AWS and support, and on and on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cloudflare will charge per request over a certain threshold, like S3 does for API calls, so it won’t be just 13 cents depending on the rate of requests coming in.“R2 will zero-rate infrequent storage operations under a threshold — currently planned to be in the single digit requests per second range. Above this range, R2 will charge significantly less per-operation than the major providers. Our object storage will be extremely inexpensive for infrequent access and yet capable of and cheaper than major incumbent providers at scale.”Source: https://blog.cloudflare.com/introducing-r2-object-storage/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Now let’s remember that the internet is 1-to-many. If 1 million people download that 1GB this month, my cost with 
@cloudflare R2 this way rounds up to 13¢. With @awscloud S3 it’s $59,247.52.&#34;When I first saw this, my thought was it&#39;s highly misleading since you&#39;d normally be fronting S3 with a CDN, so you&#39;d only have to pay once to transfer a given resource every few days/weeks/months if the CDN is doing its job, and it can be served to millions of people at no or low cost (already been free on Cloudflare for a long time).Then I came to my senses and realised there&#39;s probably orgs who don&#39;t know/care about that and they&#39;re actually paying these fees for every request.Anyway, it&#39;s excellent to see this released. S3 is not just more expensive and tied to a single data centre. It&#39;s also bad DX, e.g. setting up permissions is way too complicated and the console is &#34;brutalist&#34; in both look and function. I hope this spurs some more competition in the area of storage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s amazing how much conversation Cloudflare has created with this without even releasing the product yet.I can&#39;t remember the last time there was this much interest in a new product launch - which gives an indication to the market need for pricing changes on this front. However, AWS re:invent is right around the corner and I suspect this will cause an announcement or two to come from the AWS side."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One important part of the chip shortage is the massive amount of price gouging going on.Every IC is being bought up by new 3rd party distributors to scalp to desperate electronics manufacturers.Take a look at this chip we are just now crossing as an example, click on &#39;Non-authorized stocking distributors&#39;:https://octopart.com/tps2052bdgnr-texas+instruments-699312?r...Win Source has a bunch, but you will pay 6x the cost. We have been quoted even 100x the list price for some ICs on our boards.Luckily as a small company we are nimble and can mostly cross to similar components, and have been for months now, but a whole board assembly run can be stopped with a single component being impossible to find out of hundreds on the BOM.Having scalpers in the mix raising the price for all components worries me that the chip shortage might not end for many years, as they can self-fund by raising their prices to stock up on new supply. Not to mention the higher number of random failures as counterfeits easily find their way into the supply chain without &#39;authorized&#39; distributors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I&#39;ll never understand is why carmakers don&#39;t take advantage of this situation and address a market that&#39;s been literally BEGGING for decades for a new product:A simple, basic car, with the ONLY electronic control being for:- Valve timing
 - Fuel injection
 - Oxygen and throttle
 - EmissionsThere&#39;s a market for budget and privacy oriented customers that all carmakers seem to have ignored for two decades now. Give us a simple car with no GPS navigation, ass warmers, tire pressure sensors, telemetry, backup cameras, USB chargers, proximity detectors, traction control, keyless entry, remote climate control, etc.But instead of addressing this market, these carmakers have decided to throw up their hands and shut down production or pile up unfinished inventory waiting on chips. It makes precisely zero sense.I understand the re-engineering is a cost. But when you&#39;re simply removing existing features, this should be a fairly negligible one.edit: I wasn&#39;t aware any of these luxury features were mandated by governments. Apologies, and disregard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I am not mistaken, Amplitude was the very first SV startup coming up with the idea of the 10-year post-termination exercise window, talked to lawyers who said it cannot be done, persisted and did it anyway late 2015, then open-sourced the approach for others to follow [1].Triplebyte made a splash by adopting a very similar policy months later in early 2016 (also discussed heavily on HN [2]) and all YC companies were recommended to adopt this approach off the back of Triplebyte starting from the W16 batch [3]. The rest, as they say, is history.Many companies on this extensive list of ones with 10-year post-terminiation exercie windows [4] might not have this policy if it was not for this know-how benefitting employees put out in the open - between Amplitude, Triplebyte and it spreading to YC, making this approach table stakes a few years later.Sir, I salute your for doing this not just for doing this for Amplitude employees (who no longer had a &#34;golden handcuff pressure&#34; after vesting their original grant - which is most companies actually see as a benefit, and a way to &#34;leak&#34; less equity thanks to leavers often not being able to exercise), but for a part in moving the tech industry forward.Legend![1] https://amplitude.com/blog/employee-equity-is-broken-heres-o...[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11198991[3] https://triplebyte.com/blog/fixing-the-inequity-of-startup-e...[4] https://github.com/holman/extended-exercise-windows"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats!HN is always saying that working for a FAANG is better money than working for a startup even if it IPOs, so my question to you is: How did your employees make out during the IPO? Is the prevailing HN wisdom correct? Did your average developer employee that stuck it through with you on your journey end up with more or less than what they would have made working at FAANG?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All of this gushing hype for the future of artistry is transparently performative. Nobody in this tech cares about art or artists, any of the useful functions of NFTs have long been possible and many orders of magnitude less expensive using public key cryptography or digital signatures."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This would have been more interesting if the author had traced where all the money being plowed into NFTs is coming from.I suspect that most of it does not come from outside of the current ETH (or whatever) ecosystem. I&#39;d bet that most of the volume comes from people who are either treating it as play money, or trying to pump the NFT scam for their own benefit (real or imagined)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"sorry to be pedantic, but it&#39;s literally not multi-level-marketing? Specifically, it&#39;s missing the multi-level part. Your upline isn&#39;t getting $$$ when you sell a NFT. I suppose you can make the argument that if you then take the money and buy more stuff, then your upline gets paid, but that describes most distributor arrangements. Come to think of it, there isn&#39;t really even an upline. It&#39;s just a network of artists and traders with no set hierarchy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The containership industry is a good illustration of the supply chain mess: as shown in the first chart, more than 70 containerships are stacked up outside Los Angeles/Long Beach ports waiting to unload. Idle containerships are back to just 3% of the total fleet, shipping costs are surging, manufacturing delivery times are extended and rail shipments are declining sharply from their summer peak, illustrating the far reaching impact of the delays.I&#39;m surprised that the article doesn&#39;t take up what happens when that logjam eventually clears.At some point those ships will clear out of LA and there will be no more pile up. All the goods will have been distributed. Meanwhile, the world&#39;s container ship capacity will have increased by some large factor (30%, 50%) to address the shortage.Fast forward 1-2 years and we have a world that&#39;s a mirror image of today&#39;s: surplus everything. Too much oil. Too much container ship capacity. Too many semiconductors. Too many employees.It&#39;s not like COVID increased overall world demand relative to 2019. Rather, it created a log jam getting everything back to normal.The current action in Washington DC around the budget sets the stage for rollback of the massive government transfers and deficit spending of the last 18 months. Eventually, those evictions will happen. Eventually.Demand shocks can work both ways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Advocating for an increase in foreclosures (increase the homeless population) and an increase in “acquired immunity” (read: let COVID run rampant and employ whoever survives) is incredibly ghoulish.It’s made even more shameful by its casual tone and tongue in cheek decades-old pop culture title. This article openly and unequivocally advocates for human misery and death in order to avoid upward pressure on wages."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; For all the clients that have asked me about the political and economic problems associated with the rise of autonomous vehicles and more unemployed truckers, I keep telling them they’ve got it backwards: the US has had a trucker shortage for the last few years, and it’s projected to get worse.In addition to the need to point out that &#34;shortage&#34; just means &#34;I don&#39;t want to pay market rate&#34;, a shortage of truck drivers does not negate the concern of automation causing mass unemployment of truckers.The concern is that the 450,000 truckers will lose their jobs. &#34;We want to have 500,000 truckers who would lose their jobs&#34; doesn&#39;t addresses that issue.To be clear, I&#39;m still very much in favor of automation, but people aren&#39;t &#34;getting it backwards&#34; here. These are two different problems."</p>
