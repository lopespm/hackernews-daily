								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, that&#39;s awesome.  Great work!For a simple test, I searched &#34;fall of the roman empire&#34;.  In your search engine, I got wikipedia, followed by academic talks, chapters of books, and long-form blogs.  All extremely useful resources.When I search on google, I get wikipedia, followed by a listicle &#34;8 Reasons Why Rome Fell&#34;, then the imdb page for a movie by the same name, and then two Amazon book links, which are totally useless."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried a few searches.&lt;&lt;javascript pipe syntax&gt;&gt;: none of the search results appeared to have anything to do with Javascript pipe syntax. (Which doesn&#39;t exist yet, but it&#39;s under discussion.) Google gives a bunch of highly-relevant results.&lt;&lt;hans reichenbach relativity&gt;&gt;: first result is a list of books about relativity, one of which is Reichenbach&#39;s &#34;Philosophy of space and time&#34;; good, but there&#39;s no real information there. Second is about Reichenbach but nothing to do with relativity or even, really, philosophy of science. Third is about philosophy of science and mentions some of Reichenbach&#39;s work but not related to relativity. Fourth mentions Reichenbach&#39;s &#34;Philosophy of space and time&#34;  as part of a list of books relevant to a seminar on &#34;time and eternity&#34;. None of this is bad, but it&#39;s not great either. Google gives a couple of online philosophy encyclopaedia entries, then a journal article on &#34;Hans Reichenbach&#39;s relativity of geometry&#34;, then the Wikipedia article on Reichenbach ... much more informative.&lt;&lt;luna lovegood actress&gt;&gt;: I thought this would be an easy one. It was easy for Google, which gave me her name in large friendly letters at the top, then her IMDB entry, and a bunch of other relevant things. Literally nothing in the Marginalia results was relevant to the query.I guess maybe popular culture is just too monetizable, so no one is going to write about it on the sites that Marginalia crawls? Let&#39;s try some slightly less popular culture.&lt;&lt;wilde &#34;a handbag&#34;&gt;&gt;: First result is kinda-relevant but weird: it&#39;s about a musical adaptation of The Importance of Being Earnest. It doesn&#39;t mention that famous line from the play, but one of the numbers in the musical has the words &#34;a handbag&#34; in the title. Second result is a review of a CD of musicals, including the same work. Third is a bunch of short reviews of theatrical items from the Buxton Festival Fringe, one of which is a three-man adaptation of TIOBE. Next four are 100% irrelevant. Next is a list of names of plays. Last one is actually relevant; it&#39;s an article about &#34;Lady Bracknell through the decades&#34;. Google puts that one first (after, sigh, a bunch of YouTube videos which look as if they might actually be relevant).I really like the idea of this, and many of the things it turns up look like they might be interesting, but it isn&#39;t doing very well at producing results that are actually relevant to the thing being searched for."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"RIP Sir.I was gifted the 48K when I was 6 yrs old - it changed my life. I am here because Sir Sinclair built a machine whose setup instructions said:Now that you have set up the computer, you will want to use it. The rest of this
booklet tells you how to do that; but in your impatience you will probably already
have started pressing the keys on the keyboard, and discovered that this removes
the copyright message. This is good; _you cannot harm the computer in this way._
Be bold. Experiment. If you get stuck, remember that you can always reset the
computer to the original picture with the copyright message by taking out the &#39;9V
DC IN&#39; plug and putting it back again. This should be the last resort because you
lose all the information in the computer.&#34;You cannot harm the computer in this way.&#34;That single sentence started a life long journey. I doubt I would have been bold enough at that age to mess around with one of our most valuable possessions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Spectrum and ZX81 are (rightly) the computers for which Clive Sinclair is remembered. But it was his unsuccessful follow-up, the QL, which inspired a certain Linus Torvalds to write Linux:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_QL#Legacy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The excellent Micro Men docudrama (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Men) has somehow been on Youtube since 2013:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XXBxV6-zamM (1h24m)Micro Men, working title Syntax Era, is a 2009 one-off BBC drama television programme set in the late 1970s and the early-mid 1980s, about the rise of the British home computer market. It focuses on the rivalry between Sir Clive Sinclair (played by Alexander Armstrong), who developed the ZX Spectrum, and Chris Curry (played by Martin Freeman), the man behind the BBC Micro.(Sinclair didn&#39;t exactly like it though.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked at a company that had unlimted PTO when suddenly one day they revoked the policy because they said some people were abusing it. The new policy was still very generous (6 weeks PTO per year) so no one complained. Fast forward a year later and we were hearing things from executives and managers like, &#34;you know you don&#39;t have to use all you&#39;re PTO, right?&#34;. I&#39;d ask, oh, it will rollover to next year? The reply: &#34;No, it won&#39;t. But that&#39;s really the wrong way to think about it.&#34;So it turns out people were taking much more time off now than when PTO was unlimited. They started denying request and making up trivial rules, like 2/3 of your team must be available at any time (regardless of the team size), oh, and those rules weren&#39;t in the official policy. Good luck trying to get specifics in writing.Eventually they changed back to an unlimited policy but secretly told managers they should start denying requests after x number of days have been used. I think it was five weeks, which again is still generous but it bothers me because the intent is to hide that number in hopes that people will use less. I also get no tracking for how many days I&#39;ve already taken unless I go through my requests and count the approved ones myself.The unlimited policy is definitely a scam at many companies. Most of my team has been denied requests for reasons that don&#39;t exist in the written policy, like, &#34;you recently had PTO already.&#34; Honestly I&#39;d rather have a policy that only allowed 3 or 4 weeks with a minimum mandatory that each employee is required to take at least two weeks off per year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll accept that what the author posted is the truth. Atlassian did not give him what he wanted or needed. And now this battle is public, he will never get anything else from them.  The proverbial glove has been thrown down and they will fight you on all fronts.To everyone else, If this happens to you, I implore you to get legal counsel ASAP, and keep it quiet.  Find out all your options and strike a quiet deal with your employer. That is the best you&#39;ll ever get.Almost any large company has much deeper pockets than you do and their reputation is more valuable that their ethics.  You&#39;ll rarely win in the court of public opinion and you&#39;ll probably never get hired anywhere again.  I say this even if you were 100% in the right."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recent ex-Atlassian employee here. No part of this article matches with my experience. It&#39;s one of the better companies I&#39;ve worked for. I usually took 3-4 weeks of PTO a year, it wasn&#39;t a big deal. We didn&#39;t even have to register our time off in a payroll system or anything like that. Yeah you couldn&#39;t take 6 months off and expect to keep your job, but I felt like 3-5 weeks of PTO was the norm there. I also had female managers who took 3-4 months of maternity leave. It wasn&#39;t a big deal. This article complains about being at a job for 2 years without a promotion. That&#39;s the mark of an entitled person. P4 is still a great position with solid pay."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m longing for the return of the mailing lists.Sure, the format is slow and somewhat complex, but then it seems like all the places are devoid of non-immediate conversations.Companies are moving to the Slack, informal groups to the Discord. I&#39;ve been using IRC for years and I still love it but with recent adoption of Slack it seems everyone wants to push all the communication there and I don&#39;t think it works. It&#39;s hard to search for stuff (usually it takes me 3-4 queries to find thing _I know_ is there) and then it&#39;s in lengthy conversational format that takes a bit of time to replay. You might lose window of opportunity to provide important info just because you aren&#39;t present at the moment and since Slack is perceived as a low impact tool, those conversations can happen in late evening hours.And yet all the places that (in my opinion) were better to have more fruitful, thoughtful and searchable conversations are slowly winding down. Newsgroup are long dead, mailing lists are perceived as archaic, forums are closing down one by one. It might be me, but I start to get feeling that even on StackOverflow conversations aren&#39;t what they used to be. Only e-mail is left - in some places at least, because some organization start to have &#34;why send an e-mail while you could send Slack message&#34;. Thankfully those organization usually bless users with capability of installing Slack on their private phones /sToo bad Google Wave didn&#39;t pick up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate that everyone is using Discord not just because of searchability but also because it&#39;s difficult to have multiple identities with Discord. It&#39;s frustrating to be looking for help with using some library and seeing in the readme a link to join their Discord server. I don&#39;t want to join those with the same identity I use in gaming Discord servers so I usually just give up at that point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Maybe it&#39;s just me (30-something year old male, big into gaming), but I love when I see forums on Discord. I think it&#39;s way better to use a system I am already signed up for. I don&#39;t want to sign up again for a million different forums like the old days. I also love the new threads feature by Discord to keep convos more concise and isolated. That has helped forums on Discord a ton. It&#39;s also nice that I can join a server, get my answer, then leave that server with no lingering email sign up for some one-off forum that I&#39;ll never visit again, and then I get bombed with emails after I&#39;m done. And when I leave, it&#39;s worth noting my comments/questions are still on the server for those to find via search if they join after I&#39;m gone [1].I know a lot of people in the comments seem to hate Discord for this, but I personally love it. I guess I&#39;m just saying this as a reminder that there are always others that do enjoy the other side. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯[1] It&#39;s worth noting that I guess this is a Discord server specific setting, so that could vary I suppose."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;If high prices held you back from building, you are in luck, as the tables have now turned&#34;Except... many builders will find some other reason/excuse where prices are high to keep prices high.  We were looking at building a house - talked to builder last November and... looking at $470-$480k range (ballpark estimate).  Lumber was going higher, but we&#39;d reduced the house plan size.  Lumber kept going up... and up... Then... no parts were available (IIRC certain trusses were unavailable for months, that&#39;s just one that stuck out).We regrouped a bit later.  House was now going to be min $620k, but... no guarantee it would be $650k or $700k.  Builder has been working on spec homes in the $700k-$900k range last few months, whereas exact same size houses 1 block away they were building and selling in the mid-$400s 14 months ago.Before we cancelled the project, we asked why we couldn&#39;t build something smaller and target a time in a few months, as lumber was coming way down to where it was 18 months ago.  &#34;Everything else has skyrocketed...&#34;  which... I know things have gone up some in the last 18 months, but I think there&#39;s simply some &#34;get high prices while you can&#34;.When talking to some home finance folks, they&#39;re all saying &#34;watch out for HELOCs in 18-24 months - people will be clamoring for HELOCs as they won&#39;t be able to sell these $700k houses they&#39;re buying, because they won&#39;t have appreciated at all, and the homeowners will be trapped&#34;.There may be &#39;blowout&#39; prices on lumber itself, but around here I&#39;m not seeing any &#39;blowout&#39; prices on new construction in the short term."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been following these prices closely for most of the year and what’s striking to me is just how wrong nearly all the industry experts were throughout the year. I don’t recall reading a single opinion that was anything other than “prices will remain very high for the foreseeable future.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The UniFi Protect integration is awesome. Turn on outdoor lights on motion, disable loud doorbell ding when the dog is sleeping, change privacy zones, send critical notifications to bypass silent mode on iOS devices when a person is detected while away… really amazing stuff.The HomeKit Controller integration is also neat. All kinds of HomeKit compatible devices can just work with Home Assistant. Honeywell Lyric is the best example: PIR sensors with local push for lighting automation or special alerts when gates open to prevent the dog from escaping the backyard.Edit: More useful things!I have my washer and dryer in a garage. Can’t hear the machines inside. The Z-Wave light switches around my house have status LEDs, so one LED is dedicated to the washer and dryer status based on power draw from the outlet. Works really well. The same status LEDs are shared for all light switches around the house, so
it’s a good ambient notification.The Mac app can provide webcam or mic status as a sensor, which turns on a key light when I join video calls and turns on an LED on the light switch outside my office to signal when I’m on a call.I also get a push notification on my computer and a LED light on the light switches when the Roomba is full. It fills up a few times during its typical run while I’m working.I also have the door status (open/closed/locked) from the Lyric as LEDs on the light switches. Very easy to tell if something is unlocked or open at a glance while walking around the house."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice to see HA getting some love on HN. A colleague recommended it to me about 3 years ago as an alternative to Domoticz. I&#39;ve migrated back than and haven&#39;t looked back since. I consider myself a real Home Assistant enthousiast. I&#39;ve contributed some small amounts to the project, created and maintain my own add-ons and love to share my configuration with others.Although most of the things currently just work, especially with the (migrated) UI integrations. Some things still feel very unfinished, like blueprints. Which was a terrific idea, but maintaining and keeping those up to date is an absolute nightmare and you will have to that yourself [1]. Same with battery powered devices. When they work, it&#39;s all great, but having to watch their battery level is just a hassle. You can create your own automation to do that for you, but it seems unnecessary.For me the community also sometimes feels very hostile. For instance, you can have a Portainer add-on, but installing other Docker images makes your system &#39;unsupported&#39;. Same with some blacklisted images [2], which break Home Assistant Supervisor. Or when the maintainer of one of the add-ons completely ignores a breaking issue after a day [3].1. https://community.home-assistant.io/t/reload-automations-aut...2. https://github.com/home-assistant/supervisor/blob/main/super...3. https://github.com/hassio-addons/addon-adguard-home/issues/1..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember that story about Zachary McCoy.
This whole thing continues to get worse quick and will continue to get worse. I know people say we need legislation and regulation on data privacy and tech companies which we do. But before that gets taken seriously (at least in the US) it&#39;s going to take something real scandalous done by tech companies and actually affect the common folk where they actually start to care.Right now the average user does not care at all about security and privacy except the small niche groups of us on HN, Reddit and other tech/Geek forums. The regular average user will continue to still use Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple etc. As long as the average user keeps using their services and vote with their data and wallets I doubt much will change anytime soon.Until we get some real data privacy laws and regulation we just have to matters into our own hands. I don&#39;t use Google search unless I need to, and always have my VPN on (Mullvad).Edit: Then again, once we did get data privacy laws and regulation could we actually trust the companies and politicians and LE. Probably not. That&#39;s why I also feel the laws and regulation needed for tech is more of like a &#34;The public thinks we did something&#34; type of situation. There will still and always will be under the table deals.If the regular user can realize eventually how they feed these companies with their data and what happens with their data it could also hinder or start to hinder data collection at the government level (NSA, GCHQ, Project Raven and so on)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"mullvad has a long history of proving itself as being a good faith actor in the space. it&#39;s also first to step into new technology and infrastructure because they are truly interested and ideologically invested in what they are doing.they don&#39;t use accounts or collect email addresses.they accept cash in the mailno matter what you think about crypto they were probably one of if not the first companies in the world to start accepting bitcoin in 2010 and have always self hosted their infrastructure, not offloading it to bitpay or whatever other company that just funnels right into chain analysis companies. back then bitcoin was on the super fringe and the only people interested and involved in it where people that were ideologically aligned with it&#39;s vision.They started funding wireguard before it was cool and before anyone else gave a shit about wireguard.They are the backbone for mozilla&#39;s vpn.You can never REALLY be sure, but from what I can tell mullvad is the most honest and sincere vpn company in the space and I wouldn&#39;t even consider going anywhere else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been a Mullvad user for a while now and it’s a really great service. Good speeds, good apps for mobile and desktop, and the flexibility to use wireguard yourself if needed.I stopped using privateinternetaccess when their ownership stuff became really sketchy. I’d highly recommend Mullvad to anyone else looking for a good VPN provider.Side note, Mozilla VPN uses Mullvad’s network under the hood."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Mullvad VPN is here to stay, and we are not interested in ever selling itYeah we don&#39;t want another Kape Technologies acquisition[0]. Kape already own Cyberghost, PrivateInternetAccess and Zenmate. If they bought Mullvad, I would immediately stop using Mullvad since Kape is Israeli and could possibly be tapped by Mossad (I keep an open mind about that however).[0] https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/kape-technol..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; One surprising side effect of having a .xyz domain is that the mere inclusion of .xyz inside of a text message will result in a silent delivery failure for many providers.This is wild to me. Tested it out myself and I couldn&#39;t send an SMS with a spot.xyz link to/from Google Voice &lt;-&gt; T-Mobile. And no &#34;failed delivery&#34; notice either, just a silent failure. And yet I still get so many texts that are obviously spam or phishing attempts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was pretty excited when ICANN opened up a bunch of new domain extensions, but it does sometimes feel like &#34;all these extensions are great if you don&#39;t plan on using them&#34;.It was pretty cool that I managed to buy a bunch of domains like &lt;my last name&gt;.&lt;new-tld&gt;, but to be honest I really don&#39;t see myself using my .blackfriday domain for anything.  For that matter, I think that (somewhat ironically) `my-last-name.email` would not be taken very seriously for a primary email address.I use a `.app` domain for my personal email, which has its issues, but if I owned a business, there is no way on earth that I would be using anything but .com."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Windows 11 is half-baked.But it isn&#39;t just half-baked because it was rushed out while ignoring all the feedback (although it absolutely was). It is also half-baked because Microsoft&#39;s management has no particular strategy or plan for what they want Windows to be.So Windows 11 just feels like an &#34;and kitchen sink&#34; where someone picked up an iPad, noted down a bunch of random features without rhyme or reason and then told the people below them to shove them into Windows for some reason.Then you step back and realize that very &#34;101&#34; features on Windows are still incomplete like the migration to Settings, Windows Search being objectively worse than the Power Toys Run (let alone Google Desktop Search RIP or FileLocator Pro), and UI elements that haven&#39;t been updated since Windows 2K.As cliché as this sounds, Microsoft needs someone with a vision for Windows at the helm, someone they trust enough to go hands off and let them materialize that vision. Regardless of what that vision is, at least then Windows would be a something, rather than a whole host of competing ideas and contradictions i.e. a mess.PS - Ironically the &#34;Windows 11 PC Health Check&#34; app symbolizes Windows 11&#39;s problems: Released in a half-complete state, pulled, then re-released as a &#34;Preview&#34; also in a half-complete state. The app to check if you&#39;re ready for Windows 11 is a &#34;preview&#34; less than 30 days before the FULL retail release of Windows 11... It is almost too perfect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have to agree, even though I have plenty of pro-Windows comments.To me Windows 11 feels like Vista, and to everyone that got burned with the rewrites on the WinRT side, just using plain Win32/MFC/Forms/WPF feels liberating.Multiple teams are fighting UI politics over WinUI, MAUI on top of WinUI, React Native with WinUI, and classical UWP is not going away (Windows 11 Store is written in it), then ASP.NET team is pushing Blazor everywhere including on Web Widgets.I will just wait for Windows 12, whenever it comes up, the UI war will be settled by then."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ive been using win 11 on my laptop for a couple months now.I like the new UI, it feels simpler and less gaudy. The drop down menu expansion thing is fine. I also prefer the redesign of the settings app. I find casting my screen and bluetooth works better. Windows has been missing something decent window snapping features forever and although it&#39;s a bit clunky I appreciate that it&#39;s there.The only thing that has annoys me is the taskbar not disappearing when its supposed to, leading to it covering the bottom of maximized applications. Most of the time its not there but sometimes it&#39;ll just stick after coming up.I didn&#39;t know about the android apps feature but I might give it a shot when I go home. Widgets I just haven&#39;t used at all despite being aware of them.I still have win10 on my desktop. I don&#39;t remember the switch being painful when I went to the rolling release windows insider on my laptop. Frankly win10 is fine too, so unless there&#39;s an android app I want to play around with I wouldn&#39;t bother switching."</p>
