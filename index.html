								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The attack was successfully performed in the wild by the virus &#34;Win32/Induc.A&#34;The virus looks for a Delphi installation, modifies the SysConst.pas file, which is the source code of a part of the standard library and compiles it. After that, every program compiled by that Delphi installation will contain the virus.The virus does nothing else, it is therefore harmless if you don&#39;t have Delphi installed.It resulted in many software vendors releasing infected executables without realizing it, sometimes claiming false positives. After all, the executable was not tampered with, the compiler was."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazing to reflect on how much goodwill Fastmail has cultivated with me just by being a reasonably priced, full-featured, competent-support-having service. I&#39;m unlikely to ever do anything with the Fastmail API, but I still upvoted mainly because I&#39;m enthusiastic about the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Started the transition from Gmail to FastMail at custom domain yesterday. Presence of an API was definitely important (though I probably should have tested it out during the free trial).Had some initial buyer&#39;s regret for no reason in particular (did the 3-year plan for the best price and assuming prices will go up over time), but already feeling really solid. The web client is very snappy, documentation is good, able to import my Gmail messages, contacts, calendars, and even filters in a snap (though imperfectly). Looking forward to seeing how the API compares with my Google API scripts. Definitely seems to be more knobs and buttons for power users (more powerful filters, regex, etc.).While not relevant to FastMail per se, also really glad to finally start the painful process of migrating decades of accounts to my custom domain email, where I hope it will stay forever. Growing concern about the (admittedly slim) possibility of losing access to my Gmail account was a big motivator, as was the recent move to force the Google Apps stuff to a paid plan.So far so good."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apart from Fastmail being amazing for email, they’ve been a great source of customer service to me in several ways. I like to point it out in case people are on the fence and considering a switch. My most appreciated instance was this:Many years ago I was broke and going through rough financial strains. My yearly contract with Fastmail was up and I asked for a grace period. They did it, no questions asked, for 2 months.It wasn’t a thing. When I renewed my contract we settled up and it was all good. It’s been quite a while now and I’m still glad to support them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The folks behind Penpot also make a kanban management tool, kind of like Trello, called Taiga: http://taiga.io/ It&#39;s also OSS (Django/Angular), self-hostable, and very pleasant to use.I&#39;m rooting for both of these, and now that they have some funding I hope they&#39;ll dedicate effort on polishing the rough edges (and do something about the gratuitous amount of white space that permeates all of their web presence, and maybe reconsider their color palette to be less muted and more saturated, heavier, and decisive). They seem to be actively working on Figma imports, auto layouts, multi-user edits and more at this moment so they&#39;re on the right track.For both of them, even if the VCs pull the rug from underneath to race for an exit, it being OSS is good insurance. A fork would mean that we don&#39;t have to spend time learning yet another tool. The good will fostered by it being OSS is what encourages some of us to look into their offerings, and in this way what we see is something that seems like a sustainable model for OSS projects."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclaimer - I work for Figma but had no part in the acquisition. My comments are my own and I don&#39;t represent Figma.Technically I&#39;m very curious to see how Penpot evolves with this investment, especially in regards to their choice to base everything on SVGs. IMO this will be their greatest superpower and also greatest weakness. Keeping things tied explicitly to code means exporting the final product is going to be near-perfect translation wise, but it will also mean they&#39;re tied explicitly to the browser&#39;s ability to render the combined html+svgs.Currently Penpot&#39;s performance starts dropping rapidly once you approach around 1000 layers. Most robust design systems I see run around 10-40k layers (with the record I&#39;ve seen being 250k). I&#39;m very curious if they&#39;ll be able to optimize their approach to support those sizes of libraries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Before September 15, Penpot’s CEO and co-founder Pablo Ruiz-Múzquiz said that sign-ups were growing at around 40% per month: after Adobe’s news, that figure ballooned to 5,600%, and has stayed consistent since then. On-premise deployments have also grown 400%.5600%! Good for them. I&#39;m sure a lot of it was folks exploring options but I wonder how many of those new users will stick around -- anyone try it out and decide to make the commitment to use Penpot as a full replacement? Anything it still needs / hesitations?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"First, thank you to the poster for posting this - I haven&#39;t laughed this hard in a while.Second - thank you to the person who actually made this.  This is incredibly hilarious (just based on the project I&#39;m gonna go ahead an assume they have an account here :) )Lastly - I know that this is a joke project, but one thing I&#39;m not understanding: how does the system read the current state of the chess board?  The, er, Bluetooth/WiFi &#39;output&#39; of the system is clear enough, but I&#39;m not clear on how the current chess board is input into the system so that Stockfish can actually compute the next move.(This is a semi-serious question - if you know I&#39;d be curious to find out, but I&#39;m not gonna lose sleep over this and I don&#39;t expect anyone else to waste time on it either :)  )"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Morse code for the classical chess notation is actually pretty inefficient (12ish bits of data). Often times the actual viable moves are vastly reduced. With your own custom entropy code and custom symbol table, you could massively reduce the transmission time.E.g.- 1-4 bits for the piece class to move.- 3 bits for the column of the destination- 1-3 bits left over for disambiguation. E.g. ColumnThat&#39;s perhaps a bit too much optimization for a troll project. But fun nonetheless."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The interesting thing I learned about this is that the big names in chess all agree that they don&#39;t need to be told what move to make. In a recent interview Magnus Carlsen said:&gt;    The people who get caught are those who cheat in a really obvious and stupid manner. The problem was that he [i.e., a player caught in 2016] was not good enough to see what would’ve made sense.&gt;    Had I started cheating in a clever manner, I am convinced no one would notice. I would’ve just needed to cheat one or two times during the match, and I would not even need to be given moves, just the answer on which move was way better. Or, here there is a possibility of winning, and here you need to be more careful. That is all I would need in order to be almost invincible, which does frighten me.So all you need is a buzz or maybe two - &#34;caution&#34; and &#34;opportunity,&#34; &#34;defense&#34; and &#34;offense&#34; or whatever.The difficult part is getting the game state to the device. In streamed games this can be done with a medium amount of trouble but in non-streamed OTB games you&#39;d need the player or a confederate to be silently inputting moves for the engine to respond to. Not impossible but... difficult. Nevertheless, when the prizes are in the hundreds of thousands, people may try to find a way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ll always celebrate stories like this, but I also don&#39;t take some kind of anti-AWS lesson from it.This company saved $800k/year. Perfect time to go in-house with this solution.But when they were 1/10th this size, they&#39;d only have saved $80k/year. Does that cover the cost of the engineering to build and maintain this system? Maybe not. And when they were 1/100th the size, it would have been laughable to go in-house.At the right time, you make the right transitions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"They don&#39;t mention at all what services they were using (other than slight mention of S3) which makes it very hard to respond to this. If you are running everything on EC2 then you are going to have a bad time (especially if you aren&#39;t using reserved instances).AWS (IMHO) shines with the various services they provide (S3, Lambda, CloudFront, API Gateway, SQS&lt; SES, to name a few). AWS is a game of trying to reduce your bill and often that means using AWS-specific services. If you want to stay completely &#34;cloud agnostic&#34; you are going to paying more than buying into a &#34;cloud&#34;, in that scenario then you absolutely should be looking at dedicated servers. AWS is great because you can bring existing software and just run it in EC2 (or their container stuff if your software is containerized) but the AWS magic comes from using their managed services (also spinning up/down EC2 instances as needed, but if you are running them 24/7 then consider alternatives or at least pay for reserved)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dedicated hosting providers.I&#39;m so amazed that somehow people completely forget that for literally decades, web host provided dedicated hosting options at fantastic prices.Yes, loooong time ago - to get your dedicated server might have taken a few hours to provision and the instant server access that AWS brought should not be discredited.But large numbers of web host today allow you to programmatically spin up a dedicated web host instantaneously and at a fraction of the cost."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is my most useful bookmark, I use it everywhere (it&#39;s even practical on an iphone)So many sites have a top banner that disappears as you scroll down a page, but as soon as you scroll upwards even a little bit, it pops up again. This is immensely frustrating because I tend to read at the top of a page and scroll down as I&#39;m reading. So if I scroll down slightly too far and then correct myself, the banner will instantly obscure the bit of the text I&#39;m trying to read. It&#39;s very satisfying to be able to click on the bookmark and fix the site&#39;s crap design!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly I have uBlock set in a way that blocks most of this stuff by default. I have several &#34;steps&#34; of permissivity:1) (default) block all JS completely2) Block 3rd party js3) Permit all js (rare)If the web fails to render in (1) and I do not necessarily need anything on that web I can get elsewhere, I just leave the web. F that web and F that creator. If I have to (webshop etc) I usualy just enable (2) which works most of the time. (3) is basically only for special webs like banking etc which is just PITA to debug as you have to be logging in constantly etc.Websites today are just full of unnecessary crap and are downright unusable when on slower connection like 3G. Most of the webs now require your browser to download 2M of JS to have &#34;slide out menus&#34; or some other stupid stuff. uBlock is a must, because without that you will run out of data plan almost instantly.And to make things worse, Chromium-based browsers will make adblocking much harder with Manifest v3. As soon as this happens, I will go to Firefox. And after that probably Links (unironically).Btw spinning up a docker to shrink 1 JS function to a oneliner is perfectly capturing the essence of what&#39;s wrong with web nowdays :-D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use this all the time, it&#39;s invaluable. I also use it to remove sticky headers, which I find to be deeply annoying because they waste space and often break keyboard scrolling by scrolling the next few lines of text under the header.In Firefox I&#39;ve assigned it a keyword shortcut, so I can type `ctrl + l` to select the address bar, then `ks` `&lt;enter&gt;` to execute the JS without having to click."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The sentiment here on HN is to never connect the TV to the Internet and instead use a digital media player or external streaming device. I wholeheartedly agree. But then several people mentioned wanting to update the firmware. If you&#39;ll never connect it to the Internet, then you should never update the firmware either. It goes against conventional wisdom, but updating the firmware in this situation is more likely to cause problems than to bring you desired improvements.The firmware update might have stricter DRM controls; it could have a tricky new way to exfiltrate data out via your streaming box; maybe the firmware update itself contains some static ads; perhaps in the near future we&#39;ll have public wifi or free Google community wifi, and the new firmware will have the smarts to use that and bypass your wifi.And these days, once you update the firmware, you often cannot revert back to earlier firmware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just give me my Netflix, Disney+, Amazon Prime, HBO Max,...All of which are available on an AppleTV, and I assume other less-intrusive devices. TFA comes to that conclusion in the last paragraph, but just in case anyone didn&#39;t make it that far. And then, as everyone on this page is going to say, never let that TV anywhere near a network connection. Why anyone would go to the effort of dicking with a pi-hole cat-and-mouse game is beyond me. Plug in a box, remove network access to the TV, watch your shows....even if it duplicates all the streaming app functionality in the TV itself.I don&#39;t know, Samsung&#39;s fuckery aside, does anyone seriously think that using the duplicate app on the Samsung is going to be anywhere nearly as pleasant a UX as the AppleTV? IOW, use the AppleTV (or Roku, or whatever) regardless just for the better experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Corporate slogan of the 21st century: Why settle for some of your customer&#39;s money when you can get all of your customer&#39;s money (and monetize their data too)?Microtransactions, ads, selling customer usage data, up-front costs, PPV, subscriptions... I&#39;m shocked we as customers can actually afford to obtain and use any of these devices anymore."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s really amazing how DALL-E missed the boat. When it was launched, it was a truly amazing service that had no equal. In the months since then, both Midjourney and Stable Diffusion emerged and got to the point where they produce images of equal or better quality than DALL-E. And you didn&#39;t have to wait in a long waitlist in order to gain access! They effectively gave these tools free exposure by not allowing people to use DALL-E.Furthermore, the pricing model is much worse for DALL-E than any of its competitors. DALL-E makes you think about how much money you&#39;re losing continuously - a truly awful choice for a creative tool! Imagine if you had to pay photoshop a cent every time you made a brushstroke. Midjourney has a much better scheme (and unlimited at only 30/month!), and, of course, Stable Diffusion is free.This is a step in the right direction, but I feel that it is too little, too late. Just compare the rate of development. Midjourney has cranked out a number of different models, including an extremely exciting new model (&#34;--testp&#34;), new upscaling features, improved facial features, and a bunch more. They&#39;re also super responsive to their communtiy. In the meantime, OpenAI did... what? Outpainting? (And for months, DALL-E had an issue where clicking on any image on the homepage would instantly consume a token. How could it take so long to fix such a serious error?) You have this incredible tool everyone is so excited to use that they&#39;re producing hundred-page documents on how to get better results out of it, and somehow none of that actually makes it into the product?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apparently sign ups are currently down because of a &#34;vendor outage&#34;. Perhaps because of the increased load?Once you&#39;re able to get access, I believe you&#39;ll receive 15 credits per month for free. Each credit allows one generation, and each generation produces 4 images.Rather than using up credits trying to learn how to formulate your prompts, I ran hundreds and uploaded them to https://generrated.com (I posted it a couple of weeks ago as a Show HN) — hopefully they might be useful as a starting point and save you some credits/money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The divide between SD and DALLE doesn&#39;t matter for anything meaningful. The tech is advancing at a breakneck speed. I really cannot emphasize that enough. If SD is behind today, I wouldn&#39;t even be the least bit surprised if it&#39;s ahead in one month from now. Or be where DALL-E is today and DALLE just be that much further.I suspect that even in 6 months from now people will be starting to see consistently good generation from &#34;worse&#34; prompting. The cat is out of the bag on this and running way faster than anticipated. Hold on, because the &#34;AI generating fake media&#34; thought experiment of the last decade has now officially gone live."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; installed desktop web apps are really starting to look and feel like native appsI think we are having the opposite problem: native apps are really starting to look and feel like web apps, and in many cases, they are.The problem: the web has a terrible UI toolkit for desktop apps. It has clickable links and basic forms, that&#39;s all. It was made for documents, not apps. If you want better than that, you have to rewrite it all by yourself, or more likely, import a framework that does it for you. Traditional Windows apps all use system provided common controls, because they are good, and therefore they have a consistent look and feel, even through OS updates. It is even user customizable. Now it is not uncommon to see 10 different styles in a single screen, Windows since 8 is not even consistent with itself, and it is becoming worse every version. And it is not just aesthetics, there are serious usability concerns here, and system-wide customization is gone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually wish programs do not put content in the Title bar area. The title bar area is meant for users to move the Window around.Try opening Microsoft Word, make the window narrow and drag the window. You have to hunt for a small bit of empty space in the title bar or you have to understand you could drag on the Title text, Search box and the Sign in Username, but not the Auto Save text, Upcoming Features icon, or the Ribbon Display Options icon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read comments and articles all the time about the quality of Google&#39;s search dropping. I haven&#39;t noticed it much in practice, but I&#39;m persistent, use copious ad blocking, and my Google-fu is strong, so I usually find what I&#39;m looking for.Image search is another story. I&#39;ve been less and less satisfied with Google Image search results, and visual search has been totally neutered. It only returns low res results that rarely match the original as well as it used to. I used to be able to plug in a 400x400 image and find a dozen copies of it at a usable size. No more. Too many copyright complaints, I assume. I&#39;ve started using Bing for image and visual search now. It&#39;s not as good as old Google Images, but marginally better in some cases than the current iteration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google Image Search is deteriorating in certain areas for years. Namely:* Reverse Image Search (sometimes no matches although image is for sure out there). I wonder if Reverse Image search sometimes broken because of copyright?* NSFW images (I&#39;m really old enough and I don&#39;t need to be protected by Google or anyone else, I think it&#39;s a kind of censorship)* And now also Creative Commons as pointed out by OpThe best alternative (tested them all) is in my opinionhttps://yandex.com/images/Chrome extension for reverse image search supporting Yandexhttps://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fast-image-researc...Android app supporting Yandex for Reverse Image Searchhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.thinkfree....P.S.: I know Yandex is based in Russia, I only use it for specific image searches and I&#39;m happy we have a good alternative based outside of USA... I wished there were more in the World."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The key point here is &#34;... and hardly anyone noticed.&#34;In theory, site reliability engineers and software engineers work together at Google to maintain existing functionality and check for regressions. In practice, regression checks can only cover what they&#39;ve been told to cover, and if breaking a feature doesn&#39;t cause a metric to crash, Site Reliability doesn&#39;t have the information to know something is wrong.The result is that generally speaking, Google prioritizes existing features by how popular they are (i.e. &#34;Maintenance by Popularity&#34;) modulo how much of a stink someone influential can make if they screw it up (i.e. &#34;Maintenance by Twitter.&#34;). If almost nobody uses the CC filter (and I bet, in the grand scheme of things, they don&#39;t), Google may not have enough signal to know they broke the filter unless someone had the foresight to add a metric to check search results on that query separate from the rest of the search result data (and at Google&#39;s scale, you can&#39;t just add a metric for free; in addition to eng-hours to build and tune it, the data has to be stored somewhere and teams have finite budgets for space that can only be grown by negotiation with the relevant teams managing the monitoring services or the project as a whole)."</p>
