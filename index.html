								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I tried Firefox again a few days ago, and it was indeed noticeably snappier. In fact, it felt snappier than Chrome on the handful of sites I tried.With all the things they&#39;ve addressed in Firefox recently and with Chrome&#39;s manifest v3 nonsense, I&#39;m running out of reasons not to switch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This blog post has some good discussion about what makes a good locking primitive. On macOS, os_unfair_lock is generally a good choice for many applications. That said,&gt; At this point, you might wonder if os_unfair_lock – possibly coupled with the undocumented flags – would be a good fit for your codebase. My answer is likely yes but you’ll have to be careful when using it.I would hesitate to give this advice. The overwhelming majority of applications on macOS do not have performance profiles like Firefox does. The system allocator (rather than jemalloc) is the right choice for all but very few use cases. There are a vanishingly small number of usecases where using the undocumented flags is appropriate.The rules are different when you’re a popular browser with an existing relationship with Apple and dozens of smart engineers who can (at least in theory) understand the consequences of using this API, and leverage an existing relationship with Apple to ensure that it doesn’t become a liability in the future as the platform evolves. For pretty much everyone else, this should be nothing more than a “wow, neat” blog post."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Have you looked at `__ulock_wake` versus `os_unfair_lock_with_options`? __ulock_wake is another private darwin API for locking.From some Zig code:        // Darwin XNU 7195.50.7.100.1 introduced __ulock_wait2 and migrated code paths (notably pthread_cond_t) towards it:
        // https://github.com/apple/darwin-xnu/commit/d4061fb0260b3ed486147341b72468f836ed6c8f#diff-08f993cc40af475663274687b7c326cc6c3031e0db3ac8de7b24624610616be6
        //
        // This XNU version appears to correspond to 11.0.1:
        // https://kernelshaman.blogspot.com/2021/01/building-xnu-for-macos-big-sur-1101.html
        //
        // ulock_wait() uses 32-bit micro-second timeouts where 0 = INFINITE or no-timeout
        // ulock_wait2() uses 64-bit nano-second timeouts (with the same convention)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve used Helix for all my recreational programming projects (in Rust) for about 6 months and I&#39;ve written about 10kLOC of code with it. Still using vim at $WORK for a variety of reasons (giant c++ codebase that does not easily plug in to clangd/LSP), but I might be doing the switch soon.Installation was easy and the default configuration is good. Plugging in rust-analyzer still needed a line or two of config file editing, but that should not be necessary for very long. Hint: use `hx --health` to check that all the tools are properly installed and configured (it shows a matrix of programming languages and their associated tooling, with red/green check marks).My Helix config file is about 5 lines long, but my Vim config is in the hundreds of lines.I had very little friction coming from Vim and a little bit of Kakoune.I particularly like the fact that all the important features are built-in and not half baked scripts with unintended side effects (e.g. opening a Makefile in Vim triggers a ftplugin script that messes editor-global config instead of buffer-local, with the default out of the box scripts).Lots of people are requesting a plugin extension system, which is kinda understandable since every editor seems to have one. But I haven&#39;t had a need to add any kind of plugin, and it&#39;s easy enough to fork a shell for an external process if needed.It&#39;s still rough around the edges, but good enough for a daily driver.Thanks to everyone working on the project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I fully expect Helix to replace Vim, Neovim, and Kakoune for most users in the long run.Helix is built from the ground up around Tree-Sitter and LSP. This means you get the best syntax highlighting available, and IDE-like functionality, with zero configuration required other than installing the appropriate language server.Those are by far the most important features for a text editor to have, and crucially, they are fully integrated into Helix, but are an afterthought in (Neo)vim and Kakoune. The quality difference is obvious the moment you try it side by side. Nothing else really matters. Vim&#39;s and Kakoune&#39;s syntax highlighting is terrible, and while Neovim can now use Tree-Sitter as well, there always seem to be some additional hoops the user needs to jump through in order to get it to work. Not so with Helix.Regrettably, Helix has inherited Vim&#39;s worst design flaw, namely being unusable with non-English keyboard layouts, but all other Vim derivatives share this flaw as well so I don&#39;t see that stopping Helix from steamrolling the competition once it matures and the word spreads."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been trying out Helix for the last few months as part of my now 24 year quest to incorporate some form of vi into my daily routine. This time, it&#39;s looking good. What sets it apart are the (zero-conf) built-in LSP and tree-sitter highlighting, and the select-verb modal keybindings instead of vi&#39;s verb-object syntax, where you see what you&#39;re about to do before you do it. Some of the key combinations also show a reminder menu, aiding the learning process, which is a nice touch over plain old vi which has zero discoverability. General performance is also very good, the editor feels a lot snappier than a fully loaded Neovim or Doom Emacs, or a monster like Visual Code.I think there are plans to see if a graphical editor could be built on top of it, which would be an interesting project. As a new Rust graphical tree-sitter based editor, it would probably rival the upcoming open-or-not Zed editor by the Atom folks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think there is more behind SerenityOS that elevates it above being just another OS project. They&#39;ve attracted hundreds of contributors and have instilled a unique sense of culture within their community (as an example, going as far to devote an entire GitHub repository to documenting a list of &#34;yak-shaving&#34; yak emojis[1]).I think that kind of social endeavor isn&#39;t something a lot of maintainers can accomplish, not even those with the skills to work on such a project all by themselves.[1] https://github.com/SerenityOS/yaksplained"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I follow Andreas on twitter and he is a big inspiration for me when I go look at more challenging problems now.I have an addictive personality, so far cigarettes are the only thing that got me and only for 4 years, but I largely stay away anything else now because I see how it effected members of my family and how easily someone like myself could go the same way.Because of that I very much appreciate channeling yourself into something as ambitious as an operating system instead. It&#39;s actually the same way I&#39;ve built any of my best work and how I&#39;ve gotten even this far in my career. The line I say is: programming keeps me sane."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if, at some point, some commercial project adopts a part of Serenity and turns it into a huge hit, even outside of tech.Such things have definitely happened in the past.. Not many (average) people have heard of KDE or its web engine, KHTML, but almost everybody these days uses Chrome, which, through Apple&#39;s WebKit, is descended from KHTML itself.Serenity uses its own libraries everywhere, to the point of replacing C++&#39;s std with their own library, AK, which might make stripping it for parts more difficult, but it&#39;s certainly not unimaginable.If Serenity&#39;s web engine gets good enough, I can even imagine some EU government sponsoring an independent competitor to the Google / Apple browser duopoly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The LWN article &#34;Emulating Windows system calls in Linux&#34; discussed on HN:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24120066 (August 2020, 64 comments)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I&#39;m curious about (and probably there are some good write ups about this somewhere) that how come modern Linux and modern Wine is better to run old Windows applications than modern Windows (7 to some extent but mostly 10&amp;11). Did MS &#34;intentionally&#34; &#34;left behind&#34; certain APIs and system calls to sacrifice it for some greater good? Like I use Windows every day and have no problems at all. And I use Linux every day too for work. But by my experience if I come around an old Windows application (Vista, XP, 2000 or before) then I probably have a better chance to run it as it meant to be on Linux w/ Wine than on Windows 10/11"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In the last year I’ve spent quite some time working on a debugger capable of debugging both the Wine layer and the Windows application running with it.looking forward to this. every attempt i&#39;ve made to debug a misbehaving program in wine has left me extremely frustrated with the debugger"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It seems there is some confusion of what this page is about or why it might be relevant. This is not about an end-user product to run desktop virtualisation, but it is a page for developers in the Apple ecosystem to programmatically make use of OS-native virtualisation to create virtual machines with graphics output.The value in this is not as much that &#34;it is possible&#34; because there are plenty of implementations of this possibility, but it&#39;s more about the vendor-native support, vendor-native documentation and examples and the signal it gives about the current state of support.In the wild, an end-user (that includes developers, it&#39;s not a derogatory term, it simply mens the person the product is intended to be used by) might see applications like UTM, Veertu, Q and others use this under the hood.VirtualBox doesn&#39;t work on ARM by the way, they only release for x86(_64). So it can only virtualise, and only on x86 hosts for x86 guests."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I thought Elon&#39;s tweet was pretty funny, not just because &#34;X&#34; is already taken by X.com which he founded, but also because we already kinda tried an &#34;everything app&#34;. It&#39;s called Facebook, and the reason why other social networks like Instagram and Twitter exist _at all_ is because Facebook could not keep everyone on their network.Lest we forget, Facebook was the ONLY social network people used for a good long while, at least when I was graduating HS and entering college. You had Facebook for actual social networking, band/music pages on MySpace, and everything else was essentially porn bots and pedophiles, aka &#34;spam city&#34;. So you have to wonder, if an everything app actually is a good idea, why couldn&#39;t the one company who had the most opportunity at the perfect time with as much funding as they could possibly need...not be able to do it?Just because something works in China, doesn&#39;t mean it will work everywhere else. Actually, I would say that if something works in China, your best bet is that it _won&#39;t_ work anywhere else. TikTok being a notable exception."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The web is an everything app, and despite capture by incumbents it is still the most open platform we have and it is not illiberal. The reason for that is open standards that are not owned by anyone. We need open identity standards and open payment standards so we can have an everything web that is liberal. But governments have to allow those things to happen. Right now their legislation favors the incumbent monopolies"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish I could go back in time and just curb crypto from growing into the current tumor it has become. Decentralization efforts applied to app servers and services would have been such a better use of time and energy imo.If there was a protocol for cab hailing, and anyone could roll it out for someone to connect to their network (like xmpp), and anyone could offer to become a driver or play another role like customer support, they earn their local currency and are a part of their local economy. The same protocol could be used in Norway and in Taiwan. There might be a gap that’s too hard to fill, and someone else could create another protocol that works in their local economy, maybe like a matrix protocol. They’re completely different but serve to solve the same problem of real time communication.Then Elon’s super app could offer users a platform which tries to implement multiple protocols, or have a in app protocol marketplace which is the sub apps. Apps for buying shoes, or buying groceries, or hiring movers. Users could become consumers or agents, so they can both work for various protocols and spend their money on them. They would be vetted and backed by the super app.It would be fully decentralized, except for the payment part. If you have everyone on your platform you don’t need to issue tokens and other bullshit. Just build something useful and they will come."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Is &#34;cheapest&#34; the right objective? Because if that&#39;s the case, book piracy seems like the clear winner.But maybe we should consider &#34;cheapest with some boundaries&#34;. For instance, we probably agree that bookstores are nice for a myriad of reasons, even if we don&#39;t frequent them. They employ people in the area, they offer curation and recommendations, they invite speakers and host events, and they help local authors get started. They may offer benefits or profit sharing.But a physical space like that costs money. Experience costs money. Curation costs money (indirectly).I&#39;d argue that cheapest as a metric undercuts best as a metric. Cheap is one important input to the purchasing decision, but it shouldn&#39;t be the only one.We have to learn to accept some inefficiencies and some personal inconveniences for the sake of a healthier social ecosystem."</p>

Maybe they got legal threats due to using artists&#39; works and stock images. If so, that would be sad to see it.In a way it reminds me of people who make unofficial remakes of games but get cease and desists if they show gameplay while in development.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s always nice to hear about someone writing a cool program just because they felt like doing so.  Every time I think about writing a forum server, I find I return to the thought that Usenet was better, and that if I wanted a web forum, I&#39;d consider putting a web front end on an NNTP server.  That would among other things let people keep using NNTP clients (I like gnus.el) if they don&#39;t want to use a browser.  There are a bunch of NNTP web clients already, but afaict they all needlessly suck.You might take a look at Fossil (fossil-scm.org) which is not a forum, but is an all-in-one source control system, bug tracker, wiki, and web backend, all implemented as an SQLite client written in C.  Its blurb says a scripting language might sound more attractive than C superficially, but in Fossil, SQLite does all the heavy lifting that would otherwise have been done with scripts.  On my bottomless todo list I want to study its implementation sometime, since I think it would be a good example of &#34;advanced&#34; uses of SQL and SQLite.  That is completely independent of Fossil&#39;s purpose as a VCS application.  I&#39;m ok at basic SQL but not so clueful about sophisticated uses.One thing to watch out for is that since SQLite is an embedded DB, when you make an SQlite query, the overhead is basically a local subroutine call rather than the network traffic that a client/server DB would incur.  That in a way changes the asymptotics of an application: particularly, the &#34;N+1 queries&#34; antipattern of some client/server DB apps is a perfectly ok design strategy for SQLite.  I believe Fossil may rely on this in some way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I commend you for hand rolling it all and not using JS.I miss the days of good ole forum software (e.g. FluxBB/PunBB) before it was superseded with massive JS bloat/clunky forum software like Discourse, Flarum, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That reminded me of the 1KB forum: https://nerdparadise.com/programming/phpforumI actually shortened it, expanded it to add bot detection and published the update also under 1KB: https://gist.github.com/Xeoncross/1503594Such abuse PHP could handle back then."</p>
