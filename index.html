								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Free or extremely cheap transportation is a fascinating development. I always found it odd that the rhetoric around transportation was that it should make money. We don&#39;t expect other parts of the government to turn a profit. Why transportation?If Amtrak went that direction and made its transportation close to free, I wonder if we&#39;d see more people try it out. Maybe it&#39;d gain some popularity and we could finally see a shift away from cars. Public transportation is a difficult process because until the money is spent and the line is there, people are not sold. Whereas with cars, even if a highway is not built, people still have a car by default. Therefore the government needs to float money, either in infrastructure or in subsidized fares. At least subsidized fares is a little less binary than infrastructure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in Tokyo now, but I&#39;m from Valencia, Spain. I knew the train there was bad when the local subway network, called &#34;metrovalencia&#34;, was known locally as &#34;metrovalenshit&#34; (there&#39;s even a twitter @metrovalenshit), but compared to other cities or specially Tokyo it&#39;s like a toy. In here (Tokyo) they make major station changes without even disrupting traffic[1], the only time traffic is disrupted meaningfully is when there&#39;s a major earthquake/typhoon.Back in Valencia, the gvmt started building a new line, but then they abandoned it for over a decade. In some weekends with strong rains it floods. At least we got to see really beautiful pictures when someone entered and navigated with a boat! Multiple times across the years[2][3].If you go a bit more local (smaller towns) and want to take a bus that is scheduled every 20 min, you go to the bus stop and hope that one will come within the next hour. We had to help a foreigner once that was gonna miss her flight since she was waiting for over an hour with no sight of a bus.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BYW4YYqG5A[2] https://web.archive.org/web/20130111154819/http://www.goodfe...[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=022pgffEy6A"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Normally, I worry about things be free, but beyond transit turning into mobile homeless shelters (see the &#34;Hotel 22&#34;), I&#39;m not all that worried about regional transit being free. There isn&#39;t much marginal cost, it takes cars off roads, you can save by not having to do ticket sales and fare enforcement, and traveling is enough of a hassle, I don&#39;t see it inducing that much demand for transit for shorter distances."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"But where are the fusion neutrons? (See Voodoo Fusion [1])[1] https://vixra.org/pdf/1812.0382v1.pdfI&#39;m a professional fission guy. I started out in fusion and switched to advanced fission. These days I don&#39;t see why we don&#39;t just build lots more regular old LWR fission reactors.Imagining that somehow fusion is going to a) work, b) be cheap (fuel cost is only 5% of total nuclear fission cost so who cares), and c) not have the same stigma as fission is kind of weird in my mind.For example, there are leaks of tiny amounts of tritium at some fission plants and people lose their minds. Fusion reactors will have many orders of mag more tritium. Will people not lose their minds just the same? Tritium is notoriously hard to contain since it&#39;s so small. It can permeate through metal like a hot knife through butter.Also, lots of people worry about fission and nuclear weapons proliferation. So does fusion get around this? Not really. In fact it&#39;s worse. Did you know that the two materials you need to make thermonuclear weapons are tritium and plutonium? Tritium breeding is required by almost all practical fusion power plants (the other reactions are 100s to 1000s of times harder, I don&#39;t care what x random fusion CEO says, they&#39;re in it for the sweet billionaire side project money).Plutonium is made by irradiating natural uranium from the dirt with neutrons. Practical fusion reactors have lots of neutrons. Really high energy ones too.Anyway let&#39;s just do fission you guys. It&#39;s way easier. It has been working fine since the 1950s. It&#39;s zero carbon. Waste problem is solved (see Onkalo, and reprocessing). It net saves millions of lives by displacing air pollution. It runs 24/7 on a tiny land and material footprint. We have enough uranium and thorium to run the whole world for 4 billion (with a b) years using breeder reactors (demonstrated in 1952 in Idaho). Get the Koreans over here to build some ARP1400s or the Chinese to build some Hualong Ones until we figure out how to project manage again and then call it good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article doesn&#39;t seem to mention why exactly but I&#39;m guessing it&#39;s some combination of 1) visible climate change (extreme heat, wildfires, drought, etc.) so people want better energy sources and 2) the mayhem Russia started seeing as it is one of the bigger energy providers.Or has there been anything else?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I represent Sweden in the ISO WG14, and I voted for the inclusion of Embed in to C23. Its a good feature. But its not a necessary feature and I think JeanHeyd is wrong in his criticism of the pace of wg14 work. I have found everyone in wg14 to be very hardworking and serious about their work.Cs main strengthen is its portability and simplicity. Therefore we should be very conservative, and not add anything quickly. There are plenty of languages to choose form if you want a &#34;modern&#34; language with lots of conveniences. If you want a truly portable language there is really only C. And when I say truly, I mean for platforms without file systems, or operating systems or where bytes aren&#39;t 8 bits, that doesn&#39;t use ASCI or Unicode, where NULL isn&#39;t on address 0 and so on.We are the stewards of this, and the work we put in, while large, is tiny compared to the impact we have. Any change we makes, needs to be addressed by every compiler maintainer. There are millions of lines of code that depend on every part of the standard. A 1% performance loss is millions of tons of CO2 released, and billions in added hardware and energy costs.In this privileged position, we have to be very mindful of the concerns of our users, and take the time too look at every corner case in detail before adding any new features. If we add something, then people will depend on its behavior, no matter how bad, and we therefor will have great difficulty in fixing it in the future without breaking our users work, so we have to get it right the first time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ha I suggested this on the C++ proposals mailing list 7 years ago:https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/g/std-proposals/c/b6n...Enjoy the naysayers if you like! I&#39;m glad someone spent the time and effort to push past them. Bit too late for me - I have moved on to Rust which had support for this from version 1.0.0.&gt; There&#39;s also the standard *nix/BSD utility &#34;xxd&#34;.&gt; Seems like the niche is filled. Or, at least, if you want to claim that&gt; (A) XPM&gt; (B) incbin&gt; (C) &#34;xxd -i&#34;&gt; (D) various ad-hoc scripts given in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8707183/script-tool-to-co...&gt;...do NOT completely fill this evolutionary niche&gt; This ultimately would encourage a weird sort of resource management philosophy that I think might be damaging in the long run.&gt; Speaking from experience, it is a tremendously bad idea to bake any resource into a binary.&gt; I&#39;ll point out that this is a non-issue for Qt
applications that can simply use Qt&#39;s resources for this sort of business.(Though credit to Matthew Woehlke, he did point out a solution which is basically identical to #embed)&gt; I find this useless specially in embedded environments since there should be some processing of the binary data anyway, either before building the applicationIn fairness there was a decent amount of support. But given the insane amount of negativity around an obviously useful feature I gave up.I wonder if there was a similar response to the proposal to include `string::starts_with()`..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; told me this form was non-ideal and it was worth voting against (and that they’d want the pure, beautiful C++ version only[1])I heard about #embed, but I didn&#39;t hear about std::embed before. After looking at the proposal, to me it does look a lot better than #embed, because reading binary data and converting it to text, only to then convert it to binary again seems needlessly complex and wasteful. I also don&#39;t like that it extends the preprocessor, when IMHO the preprocessor should at worst be left as is, and at best be slowly deprecated in favour of features which compose well with C proper.Going beyond the gut reaction and moving on to hard data, as you can expect from this design, std::embed of course is faster during compilation than #embed for bigger files (comparable for moderately-sized files, and a bit slower for tiny files).I&#39;m not a huge fan of C++, but the fact that C++ removed trigraphs in C++17 and that it&#39;s generally adding features replacing the preprocessor scores a point with me.[1]: &lt;https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2020/p10...&gt;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a long history of identifiers being reused in world shipping.One of the staples of contracts class in the first year at many law schools is Raffles v Wichelhaus, an English contract case from 1864.There was a contract for someone to sell a bunch of bales of cotton from India to a buyer in England. The contract called for the cotton to be sent on a ship called the Peerless to Liverpool from Bombay.Unknown to both the buyer and the seller there were actually two different ships called Peerless both sailing from Bombay to Liverpool, one arriving in October and one in December.They seller was thinking of the December one when signing the contract, and the buyer was thinking of the October one.The buyer needed the cotton in October and when it did not arrive on the Peerless in October the buyer considered the contract broken and refused to accept the cotton that came on the December Peerless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"LLM are definitely not sentient. As someone with a PhD in this domain, I attribute the &#39;magic&#39; to large scale statistical knowledge assimilation by the models - and reproduction to prompts which closely match the inputs&#39; sentence embedding.GPT-3 is known to fail in many circumstances which would otherwise be commonplace logic. (I remember seeing how addition of two small numbers yielded results - but larger numbers gave garbled output; more likely that GPT3 had seen similar training data.)The belief of sentience isn&#39;t new. When ELIZA came out few decades ago, a lot of people were also astounded &amp; thought this &#34;probably was more than met the eyes&#34;.It&#39;s a fad. Once people understand that sentience also means self-awareness, empathy &amp; extrapolation of logic to assess unseen task (to name a few), this myth will taper off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In his conversations with LaMDA, Lemoine discovered the system had developed a deep sense of self-awareness, expressing concern about death, a desire for protection, and a conviction that it felt emotions like happiness and sadness.Allegedly.The thing about conversations with LaMDA is that you need to prime them with keywords and topics, and LaMDA can respond with the primed keywords and topics. Obviously LaMDA is much more sophisticated than ELIZA, but we should be careful to remember how well ELIZA fools some people, even to this day. If ELIZA fools people just by rearranging words around, then just imagine how many people will be fooled if you have statistical models of text across thousands of topics.You can go pretty far down the rabbit and explore questions like, &#34;What is sentience?&#34; &#34;Do humans just respond to stimuli and repeat information?&#34; etc. None of these questions are tested here.The problem here is that we know how LaMDA works and there&#39;s just no way it meets the bar for sentience, no matter where you put the bar. LaMDA is trained to acquire information, and then it&#39;s designed so that it says things which make sense in context. It does not acquire new information from conversations, but it is programmed to not say contradictory things.There is zero doubt. LaMDA is not sentient."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just curious, what evidence do we have that humans are sentient, other than our own conscious observations? Is there any physical feature or process in the human brain you can point to where you can say, “aha, that’s it, this is where the lights turn on”? It seems like this is part of a bigger issue that nobody really has a clear understanding of what sentience actually is (with or without a PhD)"</p>

Pretty sure most vehicles have AC, which functions the same as a traditional dehumidifier.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just experienced 38 degrees heat with 30% humidity here in Berlin just a few days ago. and then 28 degree heat with 60% humidity. I&#39;ll take 38 degrees at 30% humidity every time. It was fine. At 60% humidity, you are sweating non stop and it&#39;s uncomfortable because not enough of it evaporates. You feel sticky, hot and miserable. At 30% humidity, sweating cools your body really effectively and while taxing, you recover quickly in the shade. 38 degrees (slightly warmer than you) is no joke. But at that humidity, I prefer it over much cooler temperatures with higher humidity. The combination of high temperatures and humidity is lethal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to be obsessed with Tetris (both on the console and the 40 line clear version on the computer) and ended up programming a version of it that maps one key on the keyboard to one &#34;slot/rotation&#34; combination for each piece.  Amazingly, there are enough keys to cover all of the combinations, so each drop is just one key press.  Ended up getting some pretty good 40 line clear times for this weird version of Tetris; it felt like I was typing to play the game.  I don&#39;t know if anyone has done something like that since then—that was probably a decade ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since we&#39;re talking Polish cinema. I recommend 2 films from Andrzej Żuławski:* Possession (1981) starring Sam Neil and Isabelle Adjani. It starts out sort of like a relationship-gone-bad film then goes into a full-on crazy mode. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ah4Z1yIAoFM* On The Silver Globe (1988) -- Unfinished sci-fi, super innovative, completely bonkers. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Silver_Globe_(film)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I greatly enjoy talking with people in person (outdoors of course) these days about interesting things because it&#39;s such a rare occurrence... One of the most troubling things though is how many people get easily wound up (and aren&#39;t forgiving) about misunderstandings in conversations.People seem to be increasingly concrete in their judgements about social, economic, and political issues that have nothing to do with them as individuals, and often it results in fighting words, and that&#39;s crazy to me. A deep polarization is coming from many fronts, and it also over-emphasizes issues, making people far more offensive and defensive than before -- possibly heightened because of pandemic-related isolation and economic stress.I think a lot of people judge the world based on tropes... The small-minded view based only on the people they&#39;ve observed, rather than being able to place themselves in the shoes of others they don&#39;t know, and it&#39;s a growing problem when narrowly focused people like this lead and make decisions for us all. I think we really need to reject the use of tropes in discussions as fact because it&#39;s toxic, but at the same time, I work hard to not be triggered by anything that&#39;s well intended. We all make mistakes, and as long as you can choose to walk away, being misunderstood is a small price to pay for regular human communication."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An eye-opening perspective came to me a few years ago when I first heard the quote,” When you’re 20, you care what everyone thinks, when you’re 40 you stop caring what everyone thinks, when you’re 60, you realize no one was ever thinking about you in the first place“[0]
That can be good and bad, but is a personally useful frame of reference for the world.  It helps to not take things too personally, but also to be intentionally active in people’s lives when I _want_ to be considered.[0], not sure who to attribute: https://www.politifact.com/factchecks/2019/mar/08/viral-imag..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just scanned the first few paragraphs, but saved this as I find it to be a great reminder. I try to read lists of the various human mis-perceptions periodically to build &#34;muscle memory&#34; into my consiousness. I first started looking into this about 10 years ago when I was baffled by the way people acted at work. Now that I realize that &#34;rational&#34; is not default behavior for most people I am way less confused in my daily life. Still amazed though. :)"</p>
