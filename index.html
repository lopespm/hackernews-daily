								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m generally anti-regulation, but one potential consideration is to apply the same standards of eviction to cloud hosts as we do to landlords.I think we agree that no private platform should be forced to host a tenant that they object to. Yet a landlord isn&#39;t allowed to arbitrarily throw you out of your house on a moments notice. Even if your lease is on a month-to-month basis, the law requires giving the tenant a reasonable timeframe to let them find new accommodations.Even if the landlord insists on a contract abrogating this, it&#39;s unenforceable. Policy restricts this because 1) landlords generally have very high negotiation power, and 2) tenants rarely read the fine print. It seems to me that both conditions are approximately true for the major cloud providers.If you agree with tenant eviction protections, then you should probably support similar eviction protections for cloud computing. AWS/GCP/Gmail/iCloud could ban you as a customer, but only with 90 days notice. Otherwise, immediate eviction could only occur if it involved legally codified egregious behavior,  and would require a court judgement.I think this would eliminate nightmare scenarios where somebody suddenly finds themselves locked out of their Google Drive and Gmail for some algorithmic mishap. But it would put very little operating burden on the cloud providers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I... don&#39;t understand? You were an unpopular speech platform. I worked in porn for 20 years. I know what it&#39;s like to get kicked out of AWS, so does John Young. Why weren&#39;t they dockerized and prepared to move containers and backups at the drop of a hat? Why didn&#39;t they have hot spares elsewhere? There are literally thousands of hosting companies running the gamut from penny-ante to larger platforms like Rackspace, operating in a hundred countries, many of which don&#39;t know and don&#39;t wanna know what you&#39;re doing. The same is true to a lesser extent of registries. And Apple/Google kicking you out of their stores? You can still bookmark a mobile-friendly web app onto the home screen of an Apple device. You&#39;re not going to lose Qspiracy fans and nazis just because they have to do an extra step to get to your site.Nevermind that maybe, just maybe, if your platform users advocate for violent revolution, you&#39;re going to have a harder go of things. Prior to approximately October, 2001, there was a taleban.com too. I didn&#39;t read any hand-wringing when they got the axe. Newsflash: At least Tor can&#39;t remove you.The simplest explanation is that they saw this coming a mile away (who honestly didn&#39;t?) and this is engineered martyrdom."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article (really it&#39;s more of a press release from the interested parties) seems to confuse the role of DNS from the role of certificate authority, making it hard for me to understand what they&#39;re talking about.These days sometimes the same entities provide both SSL certificates and DNS, but they are different services.&gt; Handshake is “is effectively a decentralized domain name server,” Roquerre said. Instead of using the web-standard certificate authority to authenticate user connections to a server, Handshake stores references to the IP address of the websites registered in its system. Namebase is a platform that offers users access to the Handshake networkThat makes no sense at all. But it sounds like handshake is simply an alternate DNS protocol?  Or does it also serve as a certificate authority somehow?  Is it actually more decentralized than DNS (which is already of course decentralized in one axis, but not the relevant one for keeping a lookup available if the entity hosting DNS decides to remove it).Very confusing.It seems like tor .onion address would be an actually mature solution to this problem, instead of this thing that seems like press release babble?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem with &#34;trying it with my team for one sprint&#34; is that I now need to have a long conversation with legal. How will the service provider handle the content (discussions, screenshots, code snippets) that my team will upload? Do our current customer contracts contain any clauses that complicate the use of external discussion sites? In the unlikely event that the service offers the option to host it locally -- who is going to deploy it, configure it, set up security and authn/authz around it?The real answer is: just fucking use email. Why is email not  one of the options suggested in the TFA? It&#39;s universally available, durable, allows long-form conversation and thoughtful deliberation, doesn&#39;t tell you that &#34;someone is typing,&#34; and offers you the luxury of checking it at a set interval only a few times per day.The way many organizations have collectively abandoned email in favor of instant messaging is a travesty."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find this somewhat incomprehensible. Why the bias for seeing and archiving everything? The implicit model, which is right there in his title, is &#34;talk&#34;, which is not naturally archived.I&#39;ve built products just fine using verbal communication nearly exclusively. [1] We don&#39;t need to create some sort of panoptic archive of every conversation ever had to get things done. If people miss things, they miss things. We can catch each other up on the parts that truly matter.Forgetting and repetition can be negative, but they can also be highly positive. We don&#39;t have to carry with us the weight of every word ever spoken about a project.[1] The main exception being index cards with a few words on each. https://williampietri.com/writing/2015/the-big-board/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t agree with this essay more.In the early days of the Ethereum community a lot of open coordination was done on reddit and a threaded forum hosted on Vanilla Forums. Initially for privacy and convenience, Skype, gitter, Discord, and Telegram began to take hold, and later became the primary place for open, public discussions and some decision-making as well.Threaded forums were still used but not central. It was a difficult era (but a lot of work still moved forward)! There emerged a kind of opacity due to ability to put attention on real-time threads, and IMO sometimes key voices were missing because they could not weigh in effectively.What changed the dynamic was the introduction of Discourse for the critical https://ethresear.ch discussions (set up by Virgil Griffith), and later https://ethereum-magicians.org (something I worked on). I was pushing for threaded at the time because of experiences I had here on Hacker News, reddit, and Slashdot. The person I collaborated with, Greg Colvin, wanted discussions like the threaded emails he was used to from the IETF and c++ communities.We each knew from long experiences dealing with coordinating on tech issue remotely that the quality of the message is the medium.From those successful experiments / re-introductions, many teams then began to adopt and host Discourse instances. Later, DeFi picked it up for their governance / coordination discussions. Of course, real-time never went away, with more gravitating toward Telegram and Discord. But tracing the emerging thinking, hashing out differences on what to do, and re-activating stale discussions improved a lot.Threaded discussions are a core part of the community and work again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Long-overdue legislation and increased activism, including activism by the tech community, and ongoing informing of consumers about dangers of sharing their data, are some of the possible mitigation steps.A simple first step: send an article on digital privacy, that  you like, to your network and invite them to get back to you with questions they have. A possible start: EFF have an excellent privacy hub https://www.eff.org/issues/privacyI have taken a case study with my teen about people loosing careers after facebook flame-wars; and being hauled in by police on face-recognition and geolocation data. We have a discussion at least once a month about the cyber-dystopia we find ourselves in.As I posted before, I&#39;ll just leave this here:1. &#34;It turns out that Facebook also buys data about your offline purchases. The next time you pay for a burrito with your credit card, Facebook will learn about this transaction and match this credit card number with the one you added in Messenger.In other words, Messenger is a great Trojan horse designed to learn everything about you.&#34;[1] https://techcrunch.com/2018/03/23/facebook-knows-literally-e... From 2018!2. &#34;Google now knows when its users go to the store and buy stuff.Google has begun using billions of credit-card transaction records to prove that its online ads are prompting people to make purchases – even when they happen offline in brick-and-mortar stores [...] Privacy advocates said few people understand that their purchases are being analyzed in this way&#34;[2] https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2017/05/23...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not to be negative, but teamspeak and ventrilo represent some of the biggest failures of &#39;getting stuck in your lane&#39; ever. They got fat on hosted server revenue and never iterated. Both of them had years (decade?) on discord and never thought to make their product free, web based or have a better chat. Ventrilo still has no official ios/android app (lol). Both remind me of craigslist, actually- Except that craigslist is still going strong (for now).Both still exist, granted- And many still use them. Its just that discord really shouldnt exist, it should have been one of these players. The head start they had should have been insurmountable.Also, apologies for not really commenting on the subject at hand (TS supporting matrix) - Its just I so rarely hear about TS/Vent that I thought it worth me shouting into the ether my disappointment I am not talking to all my friends on vent/ts in 2021."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m glad to see TeamSpeak is still out there. I totally dropped it as soon as Discord became popular, not because I didn&#39;t like it - but literally everyone moved over, I didn&#39;t want to be left behind.Totally can see how some folks out here value their data a lot more and want to keep things private! That&#39;s where TeamSpeak will always thrive!Here&#39;s a little bit of a story-time anecdote: Back when I was in school, we used TeamSpeak to talk after hours, it was like the equivalent of people double (or 1.5x) my age spending hours and hours on the phone and their parents yelling &#34;GET OFF THE PHONE&#34;. 
It was a win win situation because with ADSL (3mbps lol) I could be connected all day and not hog the phone line, additionally the in-built chat to whisper things was good enough that we could exchange links for funny images/flash games etc.The voice quality was never bad, it took a little server configuration to get it just right, and the ability to record your voice and the conversation made for some hilarious clips compilation throughout the years, sometimes we still share some of those clips to remember what it was like to have a squeaky teenage voice.I spent thousands of hours on TeamSpeak and also tried Ventrilo/Mumble - but I was defo a team TeamSpeak kid...Also I really liked the fact that TeamSpeak had a public servers list that we could just join when someone forgot to pay the bill for our own server. Yep we rotated...so it wouldn&#39;t be the burden of 1 person paying for everyone!Speaking of paying the bill, it was always just a couple of dollars PayPal&#39;d over to someone who had a larger servers, basically sub-renting a whole room and subrooms...made us feel like adults paying our own bills :)Thanks for allowing me to drive down memory lane!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is a more official-looking statement: https://community.teamspeak.com/t/beta-signup/13749/50&gt; We use the Matrix protocol only for the messenger part.
The rest does not require a different TeamSpeak server."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve implemented something very similar at work, this was a nice write-up. Biggest differences we&#39;re doing is to use Welford&#39;s algorithm[0] to calculate a running variance, so we can calculate anomalies in real time, without the need to store logs. It works quite well.[0]: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithms_for_calculating_v..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a nicely done article. One of the issues with using a z-score for count data is it assumes the data are normally distributed. This implies values &lt; 0 are possible. However, since counts are lower-bounded at zero, they’re asymmetric unlike the normal. This means that practically this method would produce too many false positives for most applications. Whatever threshold is chosen, is likely to have too narrow an envelope between false negative and false positive to be reliable for count data. However, for normally distributed data, this would work perfectly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One can also use the sql SUBSTRING function to actually draw horizontal ASCII-art bar-charts in order to eyeball anomalies. Use a WITH sub-query to find the minimum and maximum range to normalize bar width range.For larger data-sets you can group them, such as finding the min, max, and average for each given month, and then graph them using different bar symbols: M=min, X=max, A=average. Once you spot an odd month, you use the original detail version to study that month further. (Make sure you display the bars using a fixed-width font, such as Courier.)    2020-01 MMMMMMMM

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Conclusion:&gt; But, basically if one presses the switch it causes the flip-flops to change state and to then either add or remove power from the microphones.&gt; The  &#39;mute&#39; button appears to be very real and functional.  When the button glows &#39;red&#39; the power is removed from the microphones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yes that is the technical conclusion. But maybe the most important thing is that we have to do an actual teardown of the product in order to have some confidence that Amazon is not lying on it&#39;s Echo capabilities.To be clear, I am not saying we should trust Amazon &amp; Co, I&#39;m saying that if that&#39;s the level of trust we have with home assistance devices, why even bother with the stuff ?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disclosure: I&#39;m an Amazon Devices PE, but not on Alexa devices.Jeff (and others) have spoken publicly about this in the past, and this teardown is correct.  The hardware is designed such that, if the privacy LED is on, the microphone is unpowered.  In order to compromise that, one would need to physically alter/damage the hardware."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can really recommend doing this for your personal finances! Tools like ledger are really powerful, and properly accounting is a great way to save on money. I can very easily go into my personal ledger and (say) get a report on &#34;How much money did i spend daily on groceries last month&#34; or &#34;List all subscription services i pay for and how much they cost each month&#34; or whatever. It gives you a great view into where your money is going and helps you plan for the future. It&#39;s very satisfying to run the command &#34;ledger reg -Mn Assets Liabilities&#34;, which is &#34;show me my net wealth (i.e. the sum of Assets and Liabilities) for every month in the ledger&#34;, and see your personal wealth grow over time.But almost more importantly: if you&#39;re a programmer, it&#39;s really very fun! Like, i have my own system where I download my bank statement as a CSV and process it in AWK together with an org-mode table of payees that map each line on the bank statement to an account, which then generates a ledger file. Since it&#39;s just you using it, you can make it so it works however you like, and it quite satisfying to see it all come together.It&#39;s also a great way to learn about accounting. Turns out, I really kinda like accounting! It has many of the same pleasures of programming or math, and seeing everything balance is very satisfying. In short: if you&#39;re a programmer who feels like they haven&#39;t quite got a handle on their finances, I can&#39;t recommend plain text accounting highly enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I generally only care how much my net worth has increased.  I&#39;ve found that I taking the time to enter every single receipt and expense outside of my personal business accounting is largely a waste of time.For me, the most meaningful info is a markdown doc where I quarterly asses all of my investment accounts / assets and come to a &#34;current net worth total&#34;.I&#39;ve found a personal correlation between trying to minimize and track minuscule expenses and a decline in my mental health or happiness at work.  I&#39;m frugal by nature and trust myself enough to not worry too much about day to day spending."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve been intrigued by plain text double-entry bookkeeping for a while, it looks like fun, but on the second thought I just don&#39;t see any real benefit for a regular person (probably, most IT specialists don&#39;t qualify). You get your salary, you set aside 20-75% to pay the bills, some amount you know from experience you need for groceries and other recurring expenses (like public transport and household goods) and if you happen to have anything left it goes to savings. If you&#39;re privileged, you&#39;ll also have some petty cash left for occasional lunch/night out. When you need to spend some significant unplanned sum you take it out of savings, if you have any. If not, you eat less or go into debt.What&#39;s there to track, how much you&#39;ve spent on potatoes and underwear this month versus the previous?That was the scenario for a disciplined citizen. Most just pay the bills (not necessary all of them) and then just spend what&#39;s left on their debit card until there&#39;s nothing left. It usually happens before the next salary, of course. No accounting software would help there.UPD: I&#39;m not sure it was the right place to spill my negativity, I fully understand the benefits of being organized with your finances."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read things like this and it really makes me sad. I don’t agree with Steve Bannon or Rudy Giuliani on a lot of things. I also don’t agree with their equivalent person on the left. In fact I am skeptical of most “career politicians”. I really wish we could switch what politics is about. Currently we (meaning news channels and Twitter/internet folk) want to dunk on the other tribe and show them how wrong and stupid they are. Can’t we all try to find consensus and compromise? I know that I personally don’t have enough knowledge and experience to know what’s right for all people at all times. Life can be complicated. Let’s have some compassion folks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not even in the US, but all of this banning makes me really curious about what&#39;s being banned and why.Something that some of you may have missed: This banning thing already moved into the infrastructure/cloud services layer (AWS):https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25707959"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think we can&#39;t reasonably be doing front page stories every time one of these things gets reported. It&#39;s going to keep happening. Different people have different feelings about that, but we&#39;ve had thousands of front-page-thread comments on much more important stories than Bannon&#39;s dumb podcast channel. At some point we should just refer back to those threads. I don&#39;t need to see Bannon&#39;s culpability litigated on HN; we&#39;re getting to Politico levels of granularity here."</p>
