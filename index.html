								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A particularly bad instance of link tracking I&#39;ve found is in TikTok&#39;s link sharing feature.If you share a link from the TikTok app, it gives you a vm.tiktok.com/[xyz] link to send/post elsewhere. It gives you no indication that this isn&#39;t a generic link to the post, nor does it give you an option to expose the generic link to the post.Instead, when you share that link and someone clicks on it and does not have the app, it opens with a header saying &#34;[First Last] is on TikTok.&#34; On the other hand, once you do click on that link (if and only if you don&#39;t have the app installed), you get redirected to the static link to the video and finally obtain it.This is an anti-pattern that enables further tracking and potentially unknowingly exposes user data when links are shared publicly. And there&#39;s no indication to the user that this is happening, since the link is structured as if it does not contain any tracking. Ie a tool like this wouldn&#39;t be able to &#34;strip out&#34; the tracking since it isn&#39;t tacked on in any way, but embedded as the generated link itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d love if Firefox&#39;s built-in Tracking Protection did without an addon the job ClearURLs does, so two months ago I createdBug 1697982: &#34;Firefox Tracking Protection should protect against URL/queryparam-based tracking (like ClearURLs/NeatURL addons do)&#34; , https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1697982Please vote for the bug if you&#39;d like it too.Also, I see a few interesting comments in this HN thread; this evening when the dust settles, I&#39;ll aggregate &amp; bring them to the bug for consideration if/when fixing this bug is considered."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would love to see an &#39;educational&#39; mode on this - rather than just removing the tracking elements, put some info on-screen that shows what was removed and why, so people can use this as a tool to learn more about what types of tracking exist online and how common it is. Hopefully that would lead to a more knowledgeable end user community online and we can have more nuanced discussions in the future about where tracking is benign, and where it is not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you want to treat climate change as an existential threat, then you do whatever it takes to keep all existing nuclear running until fossil fuel plants are gone from the entire continent. And you put a little money to subsidize/stimulate new nuclear on the off chance some of the advanced nuclear concepts work out (or as a backup in case renewables improve slower than we think).You don’t have to stop or even slow renewables deployment to do this. They are fairly different industries with different workforce’s, so there are resources to do both simultaneously without significant interference. And you’re not going to get “too much” electricity as cheap abundant electricity will help accelerate decarbonization of other things like building heat and transport and industrial processes.Existing nuclear ESPECIALLY must be protected. And existing hydro. Number 1 and number 2 (tied with wind) clean energy sources.Nuclear power produces as much energy in our country as coal. We can phase out coal twice as fast if we at very least keep nuclear around a few years longer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A broad carbon price that starts small but rises gradually over time would be better than passing a hodge podge of half measures.  Virtually all economists say this would be more economically efficient (cheaper) and it doesn&#39;t create distortions by favoring politically popular projects over less sexy but more effective solutions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I support nuclear power and oppose subsidies for it. A better approach is to remove subsidies from their dirtier competitors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been noticing the impact of excessive multitasking on myself lately, and I am now actively trying to avoid it.
At first i thought that multitasking would increase my overall efficiency by filling in gaps of downtime in certain tasks, but it soon turned me into a person incapable of focusing on anything deeply.
One day, I noticed that I am unable to read a book the same way i did as a child (cover to cover in one sitting for example), and it kind of shocked me.
I now have a rule that i do one thing only, and start other tasks only when the previous task has been finished. This applies to both productive work (learning, programming etc.) and entertainment (YouTube, books etc.).
I think that it is starting to help, but I feel like it will take time to undo the damage of years of bad multitasking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My primary school age son, and anecdotally, lots of other kids of similar age, relentlessly multitask in ways that hurts my brain just to think about.He literally is playing a game, watching a YouTube video in another screen, and talking to friends at the same time, and in the most extreme case, is even listening to an audiobook or podcast as well.Asking kids about it, they all say that&#39;s just what they do and look at us oldies like we are from the 20th century or something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yet multitasking is still being branded as something of a higher cognitive functioning. Byung-Chul Han in The Burnout Society claims that it is the opposite:&gt; “The attitude toward time and environment known as “multitasking’ does not represent civilisational progress. Human beings in the late-modern society of work and information are not the only ones capable of multitasking. Rather, such an aptitude amounts to regression. Multitasking is commonplace among wild animals. It is an attentive technique indispensable for survival in the wilderness.&gt; An animal busy with eating must also attend to other tasks. For example, it must hold rivals away from its prey. It must constantly be on the lookout, lest it be eaten while eating. At the same time, it must guard its young and keep an eye on its sexual partner. In the wild, the animal is forced to divide its attention between various activities. That is why animals are incapable of contemplative immersion—either they are eating or they are copulating.”&gt; ...&gt; We owe the cultural achievements of humanity—which include philosophy—to deep, contemplative attention.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is common in the Enterprise and makes me wonder how many companies are undermined by their own accounting/billing departments. Typical problems include:1) Vendor agrees to to NET 60, but begins to display warnings to end users on day 30.2) We want to purchase 100 licenses in bulk, but vendor will only sell individual licenses directly to each user, who must pay using the vendor&#39;s payment system, with no exceptions or alternatives.3) Vendor does not have a method to process payment for multiple invoices combined in one check.4) Vendor sends invoice to wrong account at the same enterprise (way too common).What&#39;s frustrating about these examples is that there is no sales pitch needed; we&#39;ve already decided to purchase the product.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The world is a scary and violent place. Without Liveleak, you might never feel it. Until you see the actual violence and gore, it doesn&#39;t mean anything, it&#39;s just empty words. I didn&#39;t care at all about wars in the middle east until I saw the reality on Liveleak. Seeing dead children and people with their legs blown off made all the commentary on CNN and Fox seem so understated.A lot is said about desensitization as a result of seeing horrible things on the internet, but in my experience, only the opposite was true. Seeing violence online when I was in my late teens sensitized me and made the stories on the TV real. Frankly, I owe a lot of my political beliefs (especially on foreign policy) to horrible realities I saw on Liveleak."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do hope you also understand our reasonsI mean, I&#39;d like to try, except he didn&#39;t actually give us any of those reasons.Rest in peace, LiveLeak.  You were a beacon of reality that shone through the propaganda, the bullshit, and the sugar-coating. Your demise means that people who want to see something like a shooting that&#39;s been removed from mainstream platforms will be forced to visit darker corners of the internet.  Now if someone asks me &#34;Hey where can I go see that thing that was taken off of Youtube&#34; I don&#39;t have a ready answer that isn&#39;t an alt-right cesspool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"LiveLeak was the only video site that still felt like the wild west. If I was ever linked to a LiveLink url I knew something crazy was about to happen.I&#39;m sure serving this kind of content had its hurdles legally. And running a video site cannot be cheap in the first place. LiveLeak will be missed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly, in this story everyone looks like a big child.I would maybe be more sympathetic to DHH if it wasn&#39;t the guy who was so opinionated he pushed through Rails features that everyone else disliked or co-wrote several books on company culture that are glorified ads for basecamp (although &#34;it doesn&#39;t have to be crazy at work&#34; is still a thought-provoking read, at least in part). I can only imagine that he might be similarly self-righteous in workplace situations.I think that, no matter your political views, if a situation gets out of hand that bad over matters that aren&#39;t even really directly related to workplace concerns, something must have gone fundamentally wrong much earlier. These levels of tension and distrust don&#39;t just arise out of nowhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m among those with mixed feelings.- list of funny names that is kept in some persistent form and circulates the company with full acknowledgment of the head people: Childish and extremely unprofessional, but still a typical mistake rather than a colossal disaster;- politics and racism issue: looks like typical misunderstanding but on a very fragile subjects. Very easy to get into drama scenarios with this mix. Very easy to mishandle it. But it still seems that this topic is not normal workplace topic. If there is a serious issue in that matter, you go to some authorities. If you did not address it officially and decided to attack the head people - sorry, it&#39;s not the way. That might suggest that there was no real issue as there were no serious actions;- policy change public announcement first then to your team: Yeah that&#39;s a big mistake, something that probably their books wouldn&#39;t even advise. Head people did not recognise  that this is not the way to manage fragile topics.Is DHH and Jason all evil?- These are the same guys that give equal pay regardless of remote worker location.- They were always believing in remote work, which is bigger problem for company and it&#39;s more of a benefit for the 
employees- Many times were vocal about issues with big companies, where many others did not have enough courage to do the same- Creators of a breakthrough tech stack and tremendous contributions to open-source- Always happily sharing their knowledgeThey made a mistake. But they don&#39;t seem to be bad guys here overall.In this context, the article seems to be written by someone who had some personal issues with the guys and he found a way to &#34;show&#39;em all&#34;. Even if it tells his version of the story, to me it&#39;s at least unfair and biased."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel bad for everyone involved. This story made me realize that working at Basecamp is not something I would want to do in the future, primarily because DHH and Fried are so egotistic.However, it also makes me face the reality that I would not want to work with many of the people that resigned. Resigning over a random employee refusing to say that &#34;white supremacy exists&#34; is absurd. I imagine myself working at some of my earlier minimum wage jobs in college and putting forth such a requirement to my managers then. It&#39;s a non-sequitur.When I talk to my family and non-tech non-coasts non-city friends about the sort of political polarization I encounter at my high-tech Seattle job, they often think I&#39;m messing with them, that I&#39;m being facetious or exaggerating. Unfortunately, I&#39;m not.It&#39;s all so tiresome. The increasing politicization of everything, and tech being at the center of it, made me realize I have no interest anymore in climbing the corporate ladder. I realize that my lack of political fervor is a liability. I wish I cared more about these things, I really do, but I don&#39;t."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, all. Author of the project here. Sorry to have caused some confusion: this is part of a research project, and it&#39;s not yet meant to be terribly legible to a public audience.In the near-term, this project is about augmenting written texts so that readers can easily remember the key details. See https://quantum.country for an example or https://numinous.productions/ttft for detailed background and discussion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some context: The author created https://quantum.country which is a text book augmented with spaced-repetition. It seems that Orbit is a toolkit for creating these types of flashcard/spaced-repetition learning webpages for anyone (with the user data being stored at Orbit&#39;s server).I&#39;ll have to say that I&#39;m still not 100% sure how useful this approach is. Most of the times when you&#39;re learning something you&#39;re not merely reading, but you&#39;re also actively using the knowledge in some way. If I&#39;m learning about B-trees then the major part of that learning process is implementing them. If I&#39;m learning some complicated math I will solve a bunch of exercises. Where does flashcards in a text book fit into this?It was also my impression (from the Anki community) that spaced-repetition is far more effective when you create the cards yourself. A common &#34;beginner mistake&#34; is to download a pre-made deck and start memorizing from scratch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since it doesn&#39;t look like this project has been discussed on HN before (though it was a bit hard to search for: https://hn.algolia.com/?dateRange=all&amp;page=0&amp;prefix=true&amp;que...), I&#39;ve changed the title from &#34;Orbit is now open source&#34; to one that describes the project.Edit: ah, but the author&#39;s related essay has been discussed a couple times:Develop Transformative Tools for Thought - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26078115 - Feb 2021 (1 comment)How can we develop transformative tools for thought? - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22147212 - Jan 2020 (44 comments)How can we develop transformative tools for thought? - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=21152542 - Oct 2019 (74 comments)"</p>
