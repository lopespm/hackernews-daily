								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Love love love obsidian. The tool is aesthetically pleasing, built-in vim mode surprisingly well (a few minor glitches with the cursor blinking) — but above all else, the plug-in community takes the cake.Finally, a note taking application with a decent API that&#39;s allowed me to extract metadata and publish metrics into CloudWatch, allowing me to track key metrics and graphically[0] review historical trends of my &#34;second brain.&#34; Previous note taking applications I&#39;ve tried in the past (e.g. Zettlr, Bear) lacked the vibrant developer community that Obsidian has cultivated.Hats off to the founder and the Obsidian team![0] - https://digitalorganizationdad.substack.com/p/stop-zettelkas..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Between Obsidian, Roam, Amplenote, and Reflect it has certainly been a golden age for note taking over the last few years. It&#39;s hard to remember that it was only 5 years ago that second generation note apps like Evernote, Notion and Bear were the only viable options unless you wanted a 1st gen app like OneNote or Workflowy.What might be most interesting about the new set of fast moving note apps is that all seem to be built by teams of 3 or less people. Obsidian seems to have ascended to the top of the heap with a team of three and no apparent VC funding. Anyone that roots for small companies and passionate programmers should appreciate Obsidian proving that the best tools don&#39;t have to be built by the biggest teams. More the opposite."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congratulations, and also: holy fucking shit!! no app has changed my day-to-day life to this degree in many, many years.I use Obsidian every morning on my roof deck for my journal (automated with the plugin, of course) and then at my desk all day long for my daily WTF blah blah info-capturing tool.Sure I wish it had more features (persist collapsed/expanded state, even in a best-effort, might-not-last-forever kind of way! build in git support because apple makes it too hard for plugin guys to do on mobile!) but the fact that it is all just &#34;standard&#34; markdown and image files washes away all almost my complaints.I use the paid Sync plugin, too (even though it&#39;s standard files and folders; could totally do it myself! could totally just use SyncThing! etc!) so that it is on all my machines and virtual machines. Perfect for sysadmin logs of things you touch only annually, e.g. Dad&#39;s iMac.To HN readers who haven&#39;t tried it: it&#39;s the millennials&#39; VisiCalc, basically, except for words."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This release includes a feature I added [1] to support partial foreign key updates in referential integrity triggers!This is useful for schemas that use a denormalized tenant id across multiple tables, as might be common in a multi-tenant application:    CREATE TABLE tenants (id serial PRIMARY KEY);
    CREATE TABLE users (
      tenant_id int REFERENCES tenants ON DELETE CASCADE,
      id serial,
      PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, id),
    );
    CREATE TABLE posts (
        tenant_id int REFERENCES tenants ON DELETE CASCADE,
        id serial,
        author_id int,
        PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, id),
        FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, author_id)
          REFERENCES users ON DELETE SET NULL
    );

This schema has a problem. When you delete a user, it will try to set both the tenant_id and author_id columns on the posts table to NULL:    INSERT INTO tenants VALUES (1);
    INSERT INTO users VALUES (1, 101);
    INSERT INTO posts VALUES (1, 201, 101);
    DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 101;
    ERROR:  null value in column &#34;tenant_id&#34; violates not-null constraint
    DETAIL:  Failing row contains (null, 201, null).

When we delete a user, we really only want to clear the author_id column in the posts table, and we want to leave the tenant_id column untouched. The feature I added is a small syntax extension to support doing exactly this. You can provide an explicit column list to the ON DELETE SET NULL / ON DELETE SET DEFAULT actions:    CREATE TABLE posts (
        tenant_id int REFERENCES tenants ON DELETE CASCADE,
        id serial,
        author_id int,
        PRIMARY KEY (tenant_id, id),
        FOREIGN KEY (tenant_id, author_id)
          -- Clear only author_id, not tenant_id
          REFERENCES users ON DELETE SET NULL (author_id)
          --                                  ^^^^^^^^^^^
    );

I initially encountered this problem while converting a database to use composite primary keys in preparation for migrating to Citus [2], and it required adding custom triggers for every single foreign key we created. Now it can be handled entirely by Postgres![1]: https://www.postgresql.org/message-id/flat/CACqFVBZQyMYJV%3D...[2]: https://www.citusdata.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SQL MERGE looks great! I hope I remember it when the time comes, instead of writing 3 separate queries.edit: Postgres docs on MERGE: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/15/sql-merge.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; PostgreSQL 15 lets users create views that query data using the permissions of the caller, not the view creator. This option, called security_invoker, adds an additional layer of protection to ensure that view callers have the correct permissions for working with the underlying data.Thank you, kind friends. This is a huge QOL improvement when using row-level security with views and is the top reason I&#39;ll be upgrading from Postgres 13 to 15."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"TikTok livestreams are a bizarre experience that doesn&#39;t get fully conveyed by this article. Scrolling through TikTok it will start showing you live streams every once in a while, and they tend to fall in to patterns like:* baby with a giant deformed head in some kind of medical setting, unable to tell if that baby is real -- if it is, then it&#39;s not a good situation for that baby* people who outwardly have disabilities of some sort, but it also looks like how you&#39;d act as having a severe disability if you&#39;re a con-artist (like constantly shaking, or very slurred speech, I still can&#39;t whether these are legit or not)* people with these vibrating bowls of sand with crystals in them, and they take crystals out of the bowl every once in a while to show you* a teenager building a house of cards, and when they get a certain sticker, they have to destroy the house of cards and start building it again. they are pretending to cry while doing this, and begging you not to give them that sticker    \* there was also a variation where it was a kid deleting games off their PlayStation when they got a certain sticker

* people pretending to sleep, and if you donate different kinds of stickers, it plays different loud sounds or trigger lights to &#34;wake&#34; them* people freestyle rapping on the spot, but it&#39;s more like 
melodic rambling to the same backing track, so you don&#39;t really have to rhyme, you just have to rap in a way that sounds like it rhymes or makes sense* and my favourite: some workers in what seems to be a Chinese factory assembling something like AirPods. they take the airpods, they take the case, they put the airpods in the case, and they throw the whole thing on to the completed pileI came across one last night that I hadn&#39;t seen before and was kind of cool. It was a livestream of a woman filling a washing machine with different detergents, and like, way too much detergents for a load, way too much, and then eventually she turned the machine on.It&#39;s a wild show that you don&#39;t ask for, it gets thrust on you every once in a while when scrolling. The whole game is to give viewers a reason to use stickers on the show, which gives the streamer money (and TikTok like 70% of it)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really is a story for our age:Rather than giving money to organisations and charities that can distribute donations cheaply and fairly to those that need it, people give direct to the prettiest/most entertaining/most harrowing channel on a social media app and even then most of the donation ends up in the pockets of middlemen and for profit corporations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The middlemen said they worked with agencies affiliated to TikTok in China and the Middle East, who gave the families access to TikTok accounts. These agencies are part of TikTok&#39;s global strategy to recruit livestreamers and encourage users to spend more time on the app.&#34;Fascinating and rare insight (to me) on how they acquire some of their users. Recruiting high value livestreamers isn&#39;t new (see Twitch) but the target here is radically different: people that don&#39;t even have a phone. That&#39;s one desperate (or at the very least aggressive) rollout. Like a Jehova&#39;s witness for social networks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. Every sufficiently complex framework-free application contains an ad hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of a framework.2. If you have a talented team, that half of a framework can be much better than using a one-size-fits-all framework that is popular because it used to be lean and mean with a small surface area, but has grown over time to do everything for everyone, becoming a complex monster.3. If you have a small team that hires slowly, it&#39;s relatively straightforward to bring new devs up to speed on &#34;the way we do things.&#34; if you are hiring rapidly and/or have a large team, the more bespoke things you have, the harder it is to maintain them.4. Over time, everything degrades. In the long run, many framework-free applications either get walled off as &#34;legacy&#34; apps with new work done in separate services, or replaced outright. If it makes you money before that happens, you win. It is not necessary to try to design architecture that will last for centuries.5. My last and--to me the most significant--observation is this: You want to pay the majority of your attention to the code that has the greatest impact on your desired outcomes.Using libraries and frameworks is like a business outsourcing things that aren&#39;t its core competency and also aren&#39;t competitive differentiators. Most software shops do not win by having their own framework or by not having a framework, they win by using something bog-standard and saving their attention for the part of their code that &#34;moves the needle.&#34;But that&#39;s only &#34;most,&#34; and your business may be one of the few."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time I see anti framework posts I am forced to frusteratedly chime in. This mentality makes me fume... not all of us work on massive teams where building stuff without a framework is even an option.And even then, whats really a &#34;framework&#34;? You could argue it&#39;s even the language itself. Android apps used to be written in Java, and now they are pushing Kotlin way harder (and it may even be the default soon). Everyone who wrote those JavaScript apps back in the 1990s without TypeScript, are they still just as maintainable as their TypeScript counterparts? Such a shortsided and ignorant view IMO.I think what bugs me the most is any sort of purist mentality (about anything) in software engineering. WE ARE ENGINEEERS. ENGINEERS USE THE RIGHT TOOL FOR THE RIGHT JOB! It should NEVER be &#34;always use X&#34;, &#34;never use Y&#34;. Both X and Y exist for a reason, so they are both useful for some reason.And again, because I&#39;m an engineer, I&#39;ve also built my fair share of apps in just &#34;purist&#34; languages, the classic HTML / CSS / JavaScript, so I&#39;m not against the purist approach either. Again, right tool for the right job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The post is promoting building applications in a loosely coupled but highly cohesive manner. It mentions using libraries when appropriate and not duplicating code.I agree with this but it requires a lead who&#39;s good at architecting such a codebase. That person also needs to stay with the company for a long time because they&#39;re essentially replacing the &#34;framework&#34; with bespoke human logic.I think many, maybe most, companies that try to build loosely coupled and highly cohesive code bases end up failing and it ends up being a mess.Frameworks aren&#39;t perfect. But know what&#39;s less perfect? Humans. The really big frameworks try and take the human component out and replace it with codified conventions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many years ago I got a trial license key for something, Aspose components of some sorts I think, and without thinking of it, checked it in into public Github repo. Well, few days later Aspose&#39;s support sends me a nicely worded note saying that they noticed that it was there and invalidated it for me. Their description and instructions were very clear about why they did it and why I shouldn&#39;t have checked it in. I thought that was very proactive and excellent customer service."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hah. Yeah. Found a bunch of ssh keys, passwords, etc for Comcast years back which turned into a shitshow when I tried to report it. Once I found the right people to talk to things got better, but the entire experience was really reflective of how bad large orgs are with security.A friend once told me he was having a hard time getting a client to take his security concerns seriously. So I went on github and found a commit in their repo that included a production password and sent it to him. Maybe took 5-10 minutes to find? Apparently once they found out about the commit, they panicked a bit and started taking his concerns more seriously."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have an idea:What if companies using secret keys (not SaaS providers who generate secret keys) voluntarily send their secret keys (MD5 hashed or somehow encrypted) to GitHub and GitHub can then monitor their leakage and notify the company?Is this useful or feasible?"</p>

But it&#39;s also an amazing business. 1 fulltime employee. $14m a year in revenue.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The key takeaway for me was that the mid-2000s were the perfect time to be a founder of a software tool. I can’t help but feel that there are so many tens of thousands of similar stories without such a successful conclusion.In previous roles I’ve used BuiltWith before and it’s an invaluable tool. There’s a few companies with similar approaches except focusing on social media profiles (HypeAuditor comes to mind) that spawned in (iirc) 2017 after Instagram made significant changes to what data were available through their API.It seems similar that Etherscan had this type of first mover advantage with automated data indexing and basic discovery tools for the Ethereum blockchain.I wonder what the next wave of straightforward software utilities will be like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t hire until you need to.And then don&#39;t hire until you want to.I&#39;m doubtful every business can make it to $14M ARR, but I bet many companies could generate $1M ARR without needing employees. And that amount of money would be life-changing for many people (with, of course, the potential to sell what you&#39;ve created to exit).I&#39;ve spent much of my life chasing the &#34;make it big&#34; startup dream. I&#39;ll be pretty content if I can generate meaningful recurring revenue by building things I love. Still trying to decouple hours worked from the paycheck."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Texas state politics/law is completely f&#39;d in so many ways, but one thing they do that I think is fantastic, and I wish all states did, was have a &#34;Sunset Review Commission&#34;, https://www.sunset.texas.gov/how-sunset-works.Basically, all agencies that are authorized by the legislature are set to automatically be abolished in (usually) 12 years. Once the expiration date is near, the Sunset Commission reviews the agency and recommends whether to reauthorize it, in which case the legislature must pass a law to reauthorize, but the &#34;default&#34; is that the agency expires.This really helps fight the natural tendency of lots of these professional agencies to grow to protect their own power, regardless of their original purpose. And even if agencies are normally always renewed, the review process itself is really useful to, when necessary, smack these agencies upside the head to get them back to their original goal. One example I&#39;m familiar with, a couple years ago the Sunset Commission basically tore the Texas Veterinary Board a new one after they decided to go after animal shelter vets for trying to save animals with extremely limited resources, https://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local/article/One-third-of... - actual report at https://www.sunset.texas.gov/public/uploads/files/reports/St..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest difference between an official site survey and you (or him) doing it themselves is liability. It is pretty clear from the language on the site that they aren&#39;t accepting legal liability and are just a convenience over doing it yourself using Google Maps or a tape-measure.I think the article is very well argued, and if this board&#39;s closure notice is allowed to stand then it will infringe on Californian&#39;s right to simply draw a map of their home or business. His business isn&#39;t offering site surveys and doesn&#39;t proclaim to, and to be honest even Google Maps/Bing/Apple could be at risk if this board&#39;s ability to close/ban this were allowed (they do show property boundaries after all).The biggest problem they&#39;re going to run into is: Who has deeper pockets? Since often in the US legal system that can decide the winner/loser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really feels like a &#34;spirit of the law&#34; vs &#34;letter of the law&#34; situation - requiring that only a licensed surveyor &#34;depict the location of property lines&#34; seems totally reasonable as to prevent the &#34;location of property lines&#34; from eroding legally, but banning a site loaded with &#34;THIS IS NOT A SURVEY&#34; disclaimers does not.A discrepancy between requirements from building departments and planning and platting departments is par for the course. Everywhere I have ever lived, the building department will accept an informal description of boundaries to determine whether or not a plan interferes with setback requirements, while a planning department or platting recorder will demand an officially certified survey to determine the actual parcel boundaries.I think this site&#39;s &#34;If your building department DOES NOT require a Surveyor, Engineer, or Architect Stamp our plans are just what you need!&#34; disclaimer is quite spot-on and it is rather frustrating that they are getting targeted.My own county (Boulder County, CO) offer a county-sponsored GIS service which is not surveyor-approved, with similar disclaimers. My surveyed parcel at my current household differed from their assessment by 5% and at my last household, by 10%. While this is a significant number, for building purposes, it isn&#39;t unreasonable - just a few degrees either way in the projection of edges. I think these sites should be allowed to stand with the acceptance that a suit based on the material contained in these sites would be bogus."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I knew a guy in high school that carried around a sub-compact notebook and one day in science class we were learning about how to factor quadratic equations (a review of old math we should know) and this guy was not paying attention at all, just typing away. The teacher asked him what he was doing that was so important that he couldn&#39;t listen, and to please come up and solve the problem.This kid walked straight up to the board and explained how you can design a computer program to factor any polynomial equation string input to it, and in fact had implemented a polynomial equation factoring program while the teacher explained how to factor simple quadratic equations.Since then, I don&#39;t feel bad if someone achieves more than me, because clearly there are some people out there that are born to solve certain classes of problems (maybe their brain structure is better for those, or something, who knows)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve known quite a few families where both parents are scientists or software engineers or quantitative engineers.Very frequently, their children will have a scary intuitive understanding of concepts that took my many years to understand (I&#39;m a slow learner; didn&#39;t really understand hash tables until my 30s) and then apply their abilities to be in the higher echelons at science in a very young age. I see a similar thing in the children of world-class athletes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nobody is talking about the proof, but about the fact that the person who produced it was younger than them and they are trying to explain the achievement by innate abilities or parent influence. The fact is just that most of people don&#39;t want to do something like that. They just want to be someone who do things like that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Source filing:https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/23131224-76-main#doc...Page 10, lines 26 and 27 say the names are Nick Clegg, Nicola Mendelsohn, and Cristian Perrella.To be clear, this is a motion from OnlyFans lawyers, and they&#39;re trying to communicate that the anonymous tip should not be considered reliable information. Not even the plaintiffs are claiming to have evidence of a demand to go with the bribe. But I expect it should be enough to subpoena the financial records that could prove that the information is true."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; alleged Meta employees added their accounts and others linked to OnlyFans competitors to databases used by companies internationally to identify malware and accounts linked to terrorism.If this is true, I&#39;d guess the situation might not only include issues of bribery, a quasi-public platform silencing speech, interfering with commerce, etc.It sounds like it might include abusing/compromising/eroding mechanisms intended for protecting people against violent attacks, as well as other aspects of national security."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just need to point the obvious out that being &#39;accused of&#39; accepting a bride is not the same as the crime. Too many people commenting are taking the bribe accusation to be true."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Allocating all required memory during startup has been idiomatic for database architectures as long as I can remember. The obvious benefits to doing things this way are wide-ranging.There is a less obvious benefit in more schedule-driven database architectures. By implication, the code knows exactly how much of which resources are instantaneously available at all times since it is directly managing those resources. This enables the database to dynamically adapt its behavior and scheduling decisions in response to specific resource pressures or excess resource capacity. This is basically a fine-grained form of internal micro-backpressure, dynamically prioritizing subsets of the workload that minimize impact on the resources under pressure at any moment in time. In some versions, you can switch internal execution strategies to take advantage of currently under-utilized resources. If you outsource this to the OS, you have no idea how close or far you are from the limits, it doesn&#39;t really work.This doesn&#39;t add much performance per se but is great for minimizing tail latencies. It helps to create a robust internal resource equilibrium that handles transients and concurrency more smoothly and consistently than if the database couldn&#39;t make a fine-grained decisions about what to do from a position of total resource awareness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Building a system that allocates memory once up-front requires up-front thinking.sqlite apparently  has some support for this, although of course you make it more predictable if you control all the code.https://www.sqlite.org/malloc.htmlThey even provide some nice math for you to create the fixed size heap!The problem of dynamic memory allocation, and specifically the problem of a memory allocator breakdown, has been studied by J. M. Robson and the results published as    J. M. Robson. &#34;Bounds for Some Functions Concerning Dynamic Storage Allocation&#34;. Journal of the Association for Computing Machinery, Volume 21, Number 8, July 1974, pages 491-499."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t this just a bunch of static object pools? That&#39;s extremely common in embedded programming. I&#39;m glad to see someone recognized it could apply to a database.My students do this on the GameBoy Advance specifically so they don&#39;t need to learn about dynamic memory allocation to get useful things done early in my course. In fact, they only learn about dynamic memory allocation for academic reasons later on and never _need_ to use it in their games."</p>
