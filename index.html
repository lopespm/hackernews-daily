								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve spent a fair amount of time talking with nurses about the problems. I&#39;m related to a bunch of people who are nurses across disciplines (ER, ICU, med/surg, etc). It&#39;s been enlightening hearing them talk about the problems...1. Many new nurses make the same or more and long time nurses. It&#39;s frustrating when the nurse in charge with the most experience is making less than new nurses. Some hospitals are even trying to stop nurses from talking about pay.2. Patients in COVID have become downright mean. Add this to the problems nurses have management and doctors (who are often rude and arrogant) and it&#39;s a poor culture. The quality of the environment, from a mental health standpoint, is on the decline.3. IT systems that they have to use were designed by people who have not talked with the workers who use them. They may have been designed with laws and compliance in mind. Nurses aren&#39;t the people who choose or pay for these systems. But, they use them a lot (maybe the most) and it&#39;s obvious they weren&#39;t taken into account when designing the UX. It&#39;s maddening for them.This one is big for product designers. Often we listen to the people who pay for it and miss out on the people who actually have to use it.4. Nurses are the catch all for jobs. Not enough aides? Nurses do the work. Food service workers don&#39;t want to take food into a patients room... nurses will do it. Not only do they have higher ratios of patients but they fill in the work when other areas have shortages, too. So, the work per patient goes up. Pay doesn&#39;t go up, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this a shock?- Demanding work: 12 hour shifts, irregular schedules, night shifts, physically exhausting, limited breaks (including bathroom/water!)- High responsibility with unsafe conditions. You&#39;re literally responsible for people&#39;s lives. Poor staffing ratios stretch you thin and make you more likely to make mistakes. And if you make a mistake, you&#39;re at huge risk for litigation... and now criminal consequences too. Responsibilities, resources, and staffing stretched even thinner due to the pandemic.- Administration that treats you as something to be optimized and does the absolute bare minimum to support you. Instead they tack on additional tasks, expectations, and requirements (&#34;no water at a nurse&#39;s station!&#34;). They encourage a culture where nurses provide a concierge service to &#39;guests&#39; instead of critical care to patients.- Hostile/entitled patients. I&#39;d guess many/most patients are not an issue, but it only takes a couple of difficult/combative patients to really ruin your conditions.- Low pay given the responsibility and working conditions for non-travel nurses. https://nurseslabs.com/nurse-salary/#nurse_salaries_by_state Like many others pointed out here, in tech I make way more than a nurse for a job that&#39;s less demanding, has far lower stakes, and is of far less value to society.To me the blame lies mainly in middle/upper management, whose role is to build and empower an effective workforce. If 90% of your workers are considering leaving, you blew it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a close relation that works for one of the oldest pediatric hospitals in the country. It was recently revealed that they will be shuttering almost all pediatric services in the next year because they can 10x their profits by only serving elderly clients. The entire purpose of this organization was to provide pediatric healthcare, and it wasn’t losing money…Sometimes, it feels like we’re min-maxing ourselves to death over here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very favorable comments all around from the very online crowd who comments here.  I’m much more skeptical.I have no doubt this will work well for some students, but as someone who taught online for the better part of two years I can say with certainty that the experience is very different and (for the wide majority of students) worse than being in person.My colleagues and I can attest to both general learning loss (ie., forgetting specific subject matter information) and a loss of broader “studying skills” (ie., coming to class and doing homework) after the pandemic.In intro classes in our department, mean grades have been a whole standard deviation lower than the long run pre-pandemic average.  That’s a huge effect!This is also not just specific to our department or university but has been written about widely in the higher ed press.People have been confidently predicting that online education “is the future” since the 1990’s.  IMO the lesson of the pandemic is “no it’s not and it’s never going to be.”If online works for you, awesome.  Enjoy!   There are great resources out there.   But I don’t think you are in the majority."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Online learning resources are amazing. Compared to pre-internet, the depth, quality and accessibility is amazing. It really does open an opportunity route for a lot of people.However...Institutional learning, whether it&#39;s K-12, colleges, techs or whatnot have barely changed. The same fundamental dynamics exist, whether it&#39;s tertiary sorting and prestige or primary teaching methods. Education still serves and fails the same groups of people as it did before, in much the same way.Education is an enormous &#34;industry.&#34; It&#39;s in the same realm as defense, energy or transport. Possibly even more important.I really hope to see online resources develop in such a way that schools can be built around them. A formula that a middle school principal anywhere, no matter how rural and remote, can implement. Why can&#39;t we have the best of both worlds?The classroom model didn&#39;t work well for me as a student. I don&#39;t think remote-only would have worked either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am looking forward to the day, when quality formal education is available online to all which you may complete at your own pace instead of going with a strict semester and class system. Also, along with offline schools for supporting social learning and helping classes which require offline components like labs, in person support classes, interest based study groups etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Over the course of a few years I spent a lot of time in a secure environment in a DoD facility to which I had to travel multiple times for a project. The environment, a maze of cubicles filled with computers, had been installed inside a historic building. For historic preservation reasons, the exterior windows were kept as built. For security reasons, there was a sheet of plywood painted white inside all of the windows. The building allowed no natural light to enter and emitted only a diffuse glow. It was a miserable place to spend long days, illuminated only by flickering fluorescent light.We had some serious storms come through while I was there. A lot of the permanent residents went home. As I was a visitor and there just for as long as it took me to fix some problems, I was encouraged to stay and work late. I was assured that we would not lose power because the building had been recently equipped with a generator.A storm came through and the building lost power. It was almost entirely pitch black in the building full of computers, which all went dark, fans and disks suddenly silent. A small fraction of the emergency lights came on. Most were in disrepair and never lit up. It turns out that in a secure environment, one has to make special arrangements to have someone inspect the emergency lighting. We heard the generator spin up. Still no computers, no lights.In the darkness, one little nook came to life. This nook contained the coffee pot, microwave, and refrigerator. Apparently this organization considered only one piece of equipment important enough to be connected to the generator. We thereafter referred to it as the mission critical coffee pot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I heard a legend once that someone at IBM in the &#34;blue suit and tie&#34; days found himself to be irreplaceable. So at his next contract negotiations, he politely demanded the dress code be removed from his contract.And then he never shaved again, or wore anything more formal than a Hawaiian shirt. Much to the anger of his entire management chain.I read this. I loved it. I remember it. But I cannot for the life of me find any references to it online and worry that I dreamed it all.I would love if someone here has a reference to this and can share it with me. Or tell me I am truly crazy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On being acquired by IBM things went downhill at the company I was working at - no kettles or coffee machines allowed and you had to buy your tea and coffee from the company store/machines (UK - probably run by Serco or some similar awfulness). All the cool computers taken off the desks and stuck in server rooms and you had to use a managed windows PC which in my case managed to crash once or more times a day thanks to some aspect of the Rational Clearcase filesystem driver.I remember all the lectures from overconfident bullshitters with shiny shoes. A company run by salesmen. It is SO SO nice that IBM got eclipsed by the internet tech companies. Even if they are arrogant/difficult in their own way it was a victory for the technically and ethically competent.It seemed then that IBM was where software went to die."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem is not so much that selinux is too complicated (it is as complicated as it needs to be), but that we all run software we don&#39;t understand.The whole IT ecosystem has become a hail mary. Even admins usually have no idea what a certain program actually wants to do. If the admin knows how to install the app so that it actually runs, you call them a good admin.From a security point of view, an application is like a nuclear power plant. It&#39;s good if it works as planned, but if something blows up it endangers your whole enterprise.The whole container movement can be seen as putting the apps in a sarcophagus like Chernobyl. That way the radiation hopefully stays in, but history has shown that it really doesn&#39;t. Also, the wheel of history has just turned one more iteration and now admins just view the sarcophagus as something you deploy as you previously deployed the app. Who is responsible that it is air tight? Well, uh, nobody, really.You can&#39;t even blame the applications for that. Let&#39;s say you want to build a good, secure application. How do you know what files your application will try to open? What syscalls it wants to call? Library and framework functions tend to not document that properly.Obscure files like /etc/localtime, /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/ld.so.conf, /dev/zero ... how can you expect devs to build well documented and well sandboxable applications if they don&#39;t know which files their library functions will open?You may have heard of /etc/resolv.conf ... but have you heard of /etc/gai.conf? /etc/nsswitch.conf? /etc/host.conf? Wouldn&#39;t it be great if the man page of getaddrinfo mentioned those (mine only mentions gai.conf)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an experienced RHEL admin, a few years ago I probably would have said this is very bad advice in any professional context, and you should spend the time to learn it because it will save you one day.Now, I think my advice would be: Put everything in a container, and learn how to run Docker or Podman (or k8s) in a secure way (ie no root containers, be very careful with volume mounts, etc). Yes, they aren’t as mature as SELinux, but containers aim to provide many of the same benefits that SELinux does (and even more) except in a way that’s much easier to manage. Even better is that these container runtimes often come with SELinux and AppArmor policies out of the box on good Linux distros."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always preferred apparmor. SELinux has always seemed radically more complex for very little benefit, unless you have a tightly constrained OS (like Android, where the VM does most of the work and every app has the same sort of security policy) or a team of admins working full time to maintain it (again, like Android).Apparmor is weak in all the same ways SELinux is weak, at least in terms of the ways that actually matter - that is to say, a kernel exploit is the simplest way out of either. But anyone can write an apparmor profile for any program in an hour, and if you actually know wtf you&#39;re doing you can build very strong profiles and trivially test and maintain them.SELinux is &#34;good&#34; in that if you are building a system like Android, great, consumers get very tight policies for free, and SELinux is ultimately more expressive. But I think 99% of companies looking at an LSM MAC should probably roll apparmor."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The state I lived in developed one of those covid tracking apps. I asked for the source code and was told it wasn&#39;t available and would never be. I talked to people working on other software developed for the state and they all think that software shouldn&#39;t be public.It seems crazy to me that taxpayers pay for this software but it doesn&#39;t belong to them.Knowing what I do know I gotta wonder if it&#39;s just about those developers being ashamed how bad their software is and don&#39;t want others to see it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Large consulting companies like Accenture have entire divisions of their business devoted to &#34;government&#34;. These divisions make money by developing software for governments. It is very much against their interest for this software to be open source because 1) there is visibility into their performance and 2) they can&#39;t sell very similar software to the same government if everyone knows what software they&#39;ve already built.These are the real vested interests preventing this code becoming open source and why lots of government agencies who do their own development are perfectly happy to release the code or access to their APIs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve often wondered if we need to radically change the State&#39;s relationship with the software it produces. As Robert Lessig famously observed, &#34;code is law&#34; in a world controlled by computers. There is increasingly a strong argument I feel in States directly employing software engineers much like they typically employ armies of civil servants to implement policy.Why is software treated as something to be outsourced to a private sector company? Why can&#39;t we have &#34;civil programmers&#34; who contribute to an ever growing body of public code just as the legislative process contributes to an ever growing body of laws. This body of civil programmers (terrible name but hey) could also work hand in hand with the open source community, letting stakeholders (citizens) contribute too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, former WGU student here, though I hadn&#39;t completed my degree.Many WGU students HATE these types of articles, because they undermine the legitimacy of WGU.WGU was not designed for traditional students, it was 100% designed for working professionals, where WGU will only admit you with a reasonable amount of experience in your field.WGU is regionally accredited, not nationally, and it&#39;s a non-profit. So it cannot be compared to University of Phoenix, ITT Tech, DeVry, etc.It was founded by a group of governors out west, hence the name. They realized that there were many working adults who possessed a great depth of knowledge, from long working in their fields, yet they had no paper credentials to show for that knowledge.Their model is competency-based, so you must demonstrate you posses knowledge in any given domain. If you can prove you do then you can test out right away, if you fail to then they offer a variety of resources to allow you to get up to par. In many cases classes are tied to obtaining industry certifications.It&#39;s not for everyone, but it is a far cry from a &#34;degree mill.&#34; Does it really matter if a person that has knowledge got it from sitting in a seat, paying ungodly amounts of tuition, or if they got it from life experience? As long as a bar is set, and you can meet it, then that should be what really matters.Just my personal experience, from having attended the university. Unfortunately life sidetracked my completion, but I hope to return one day soon, and complete my program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On my first day, I completed 4 courses in the span of 4 hours. At a traditional school, it would have taken 4 months. It made me realize…I had underestimated how much knowledge I had gained from previous schools, jobs, projects, books, papers, and talks. This passage underscores how, for this guy and whoever he was selling himself to, a CS degree was just a credential. He did not have much intention of actually learning anything. That’s (I believe) fundamentally different than most people who seek college degrees."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some context on WGU&gt; An audit by the Department of Education&#39;s Office of Inspector General, released on September 21, 2017, &#34;concluded that Western Governors University did not comply with the institutional eligibility requirement that limits the percentage of regular students who may enroll in correspondence courses&#34; and that &#34;at least 69 of the 102 courses were not designed to offer regular and substantive interaction with an instructor and, therefore, did not meet the regulatory definition of distance education.&#34;They later kept their federal loan eligibility but it sounds like it might have been a case where they skated by due to a lack of clear guidance.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Governors_University"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“ Medicine has become a three-way negotiation between you, your doctor, and The Algorithm.”This characterization makes it sound like a good thing.  In reality, the doctor’s responsibility is being pushed to the patient because they are overbooked in the name of economic efficiency.As a patient with complex, non-specific medical condition, I can tell you how miserable this is.I can’t count on doctors _at all_ to move the process forward.  It’s always me, reading articles on PubMed and coming up with ideas.I’m not medically trained nor am I scientist.  It’s a lot of legwork for me normally, but the ways that being sick limits me make it much harder.Further, the emotional and intellectual overhead required to negotiate with medical professionals is high.Back when I could afford to, I saw a neurologist at an office that didn’t accept insurance.  She choose to see fewer patients and give them more time, as well as spend time doing research to look for new clues and ideas.This worked really well and I made progress with her.The rest of the American medical system?  Gatekeepers that block access to potential treatment pathways until you can convince them it’s worth a try."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why are dentists so scammy?In Norway I&#39;ve seen documentaries about them sending the same people to multiple dentists, and some of them receive wildly different advice. Some of that can be ascribed to some being in the school of pro-active, so they want to fix your teeth at the first glance of issues. But in the end, most of the things being quoted were unnecessary. They all seemed very intent on removing wisdom teeth, even when they pose no problems.They re-did the experiment recently, and I think one of the guys they sent got his teeth cleaned and tartar removed from 10 dentists in a week or so. No one stopped to see if it was actually needed, they all just do it by default and charge you for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Laser bacterial reduction (LBR) is just one example of the many high-stakes medical decisionsWhether or not to drop $400 is not a &#34;high-stakes medical decision&#34;. Also, expecting Google to give you high-quality medical advice when your actual, licensed, trained dental hygienest is not is asking a lot of a search engine.Personally I&#39;ve found sticking &#34;examine.com&#34; on the end of most results to be very useful for anything supplement-related, and &#34;reddit.com&#34; as a suffix pretty good for anything else."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It would be interesting to see the gain curve of this speaker.My (limited) experience with piezoelectric speakers is that they resonate at a single frequency very loudly, and are practically silent outside the resonant peak. Perfect for a microwave beeper, but never going to produce audible speech.The &#34;high-quality&#34; descriptor makes it sound like they have produced a reasonably flat gain curve, which seems really significant! But without any explanation I&#39;m skeptical.It may even be as silly as using an unintuitive technical definition of &#34;quality&#34; - in a second order linear system, the &#34;quality&#34; of the gain curve is the ratio of the amplitude at the peak to the input amplitude... The exact opposite of what a reasonable person would consider high-quality sound."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To overcome this problem, the MIT team rethought the design of a thin-film loudspeaker. Rather than having the entire material vibrate, their design relies on tiny domes on a thin layer of piezoelectric material which each vibrate individually. These domes, each only a few hair-widths across, are surrounded by spacer layers on the top and bottom of the film that protect them from the mounting surface while still enabling them to vibrate freely.Whoa, does this mean an array of individually addressable micro-speakers becomes feasible? Like pixels in a computer screen, send different signals to each tiny speaker? That would mean craaaazy spatial audio, if I&#39;m not mistaken."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; When 25 volts of electricity were passed through the device at 1 kilohertz (a rate of 1,000 cycles per second), the speaker produced high-quality sound at conversational levels of 66 decibels. At 10 kilohertz, the sound pressure level increased to 86 decibelsRead: Tinny af.Nonetheless, VERY exciting technology. Will be interesting to watch as it matures."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"During a hostile takeover, someone buys 51% of the shares. They then elect a board of people who will approve whatever they want.Then they can do things like &#39;merge&#39; the company with some other company they own at a board-approved value-per-share. That value will be much lower than what they paid per share when buying it on the open market, but not so low that the government gets involved. Eg: Musk buys the shares at $50/share, and then &#39;merges&#39; the company at $25/share, effectively forcing 49% of the shares to be sold at half price. Those shareholders get screwed because they didn&#39;t sell their shares during the initial takeover.Edit: Or, just run the company however they want and share the profits with the other 49%, but ignore their votes, etc.The Poison Pill says &#34;If a hostile takeover starts, we&#39;ll create and sell new shares at a reduced price to existing shareholders- other than the attacker- to prevent the 51% scenario&#34;. This is done not to prevent any takeover, but in the interest of the 49% of holdouts who would have been screwed over. It&#39;s an effective block against the takeover.The board represents ALL the shareholders, after all. They don&#39;t want to see anyone get screwed.But now Musk has made a deal that the board has approved. All shareholders get a specific price that is approved. The board wants this to happen, so there&#39;s no poison pill."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nobody knows yet why the board relented, but the scuttlebutt seems to be that Twitter arranged an internal valuation once Musk put a price on the company, presumably as justification for an internal plan that they&#39;d announce as their alternative to acquisition, and the valuation actually showed Musk was overpaying for the income Twitter was likely to generate.(If the board hadn&#39;t relented, Musk&#39;s next step would have been to arrange for a tender offer, which goes directly to the shareholders, but does not involved Musk acquiring new shares, but rather just a commitment to buy those shares if the board drops the poison pill. Successfully getting that commitment would be a very strong signal to the board, which would likely then drop the shareholder rights plan and allow the acquisition to proceed. But Twitter&#39;s board skipped those steps.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The poison pill was intended to prevent a takeover without the board’s approval (buying 51% on the open market)The board is negotiating an approved takeover which is entirely differentI.e. the board was saying “you can only buy Twitter if we say so”There was no reversal of intentions"</p>
