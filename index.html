								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminded - I noticed a while ago that being a computer science guy makes me think differently about physical storage and retrieval.For example - my wife likes &#34;shorts&#34; to be in one drawer and &#34;t-shirts&#34; in another. I like for one drawer to be &#34;workout clothes&#34; and have the mix of gym shorts and t-shirts. To me this feels &#34;obviously&#34; right because the use-case requires both items so why pay for two costly &#34;open drawer&#34; IOs?Similarly, she is very organized with her paper files, I just throw mine into a box. In the rare event I need something (eg when doing taxes) I don&#39;t mind scanning through the whole mess. Seems like a better strategy than making each &#34;write&#34; costly (neatly organizing) since writes are frequent and reads are rare.Anyone else like that?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it counterproductive that we expect researchers to work in universities and become professors? It seems like there should be more outlets for the calling. Our universities are proving to be a bottleneck.I see how there is an often-natural relationship between cultivating knowledge and disseminating it to students. However, we need and have more prospective researchers than universities are willing or able to support."</p>

There are so many obstacles in the way: classes designed to weed you out, GPA requirements, the grad school application process, financial instability as a PHD candidate, difficult job opportunities after the doctorate, fighting for funding and tenure, and more. Major reform is needed to progress science, because the current system is a failure pipeline that hurts both researchers and the university (which is shooting itself in the foot)."</p>

Any driver installation will absolutely make this a no-go for family members.- Is additional software required for anything non-techies might reasonably want to do with this device, including resetting it, adding an entry or checking which entries are already on the device? The ideal would probably be if the device acts like a USB stick, with entries being shown as .bin/.txt files which can be manipulated in the normal ways.- How easy is it to create a backup? The ideal (for non-techies) would probably be something like plugging a device into a PC and simply copying files across. Ditto for duplicating to another device.- Is there anything else which would likely stop non-techies from using this for basically everything they care about?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Given the rather enormous of time and attention spent on it, not to mention the vast amounts of heated debate it had already spawned, I&#39;d sort of assumed the NYT would either publish a really, really solid article or (more likely) just spike it and try and forget the entire thing had ever happened. After all, given that the NYT was now so much a part of the story, writing anything good would be pretty hard.But no, kudos to them, they found a third way: Just write a poorly written article that alternates between interjecting disconnected ideas and making vague attempts at guilt by association, and carefully ignore anything inconvenient.&gt; He denounced the neoreactionaries, the anti-democratic, often racist movement popularized by Curtis Yarvin. But he also gave them a platform. His “blog roll” — the blogs he endorsed — included the work of Nick Land, a British philosopher whose writings on race, genetics and intelligence have been embraced by white nationalists.So he denounced the works of one person who believes bad things, but he also linked to a second person, who may or may not believe bad things, but is liked by a third group of people who also believe bad things, so...logically...that must mean he actually does...support the first person? Despite denouncing them, because he didn&#39;t link to them, which proves...something...?It feels weird even writing this argument down. If you link to someone who supports X, then you&#39;re actually supporting every other person who has ever supported X? Link to a pro-vegan website, you must support every terrible ideology that has had at least one vegetarian supporter?What a depressing waste of everyone&#39;s time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a badly-written, mean-spirited article. A typical paragraph has a few ominous claims, which, when you read the links, aren&#39;t supported at all, nor connected in the way they&#39;re suggested to. Such as :&gt; In one post, he aligned himself with Charles Murray, who proposed a link between race and I.Q. in “The Bell Curve.” In another, he pointed out that Mr. Murray believes Black people “are genetically less intelligent than white people.”And when you read the linked page[0], what Scott writes concerning Murrary seems perfectly inoffensive. He divides political views into quadrants, Competitive/Collective vs Optimistic/Pessimistic, then says &#34;The only public figure I can think of in the [Collective + Pessimistic quadrant] with me is Charles Murray.&#34; This is what is described as aligning himself with Murray. The paragraph makes Scott sound like a flaming racist. It&#39;s just totally dishonest writing. It&#39;s hard to believe they&#39;re arguing in good faith there, but who knows.The anonymity thing seems to have been well and truly discarded – flung in his face, more like. What did he do to them to deserve such treatment, such contempt?I did get one laugh, out of:&gt; “[Rationalists] are basically just hippies who talk a lot more about Bayes’ theorem than the original hippies,” said Scott Aaronson[0] https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/23/three-great-articles-o..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Some types in Rust have specific limitations on what is considered a valid value, which may not cover the entire range of possible memory values. We call any remaining invalid value a niche, and this space may be used for type layout optimizations. For example, in Rust 1.28 we introduced NonZero integer types (like NonZeroU8) where 0 is a niche, and this allowed Option&lt;NonZero&gt; to use 0 to represent None with no extra memory.I didn&#39;t know about this, and it&#39;s super cool. It&#39;s part of a broader pattern where the rigid constraints Rust can impose on code allow both the compiler and the user to do things that would be wildly dangerous in a less-strict language."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been doing Rust for a while now, but this is the first time I&#39;ve heard about the niche concept[1]. Sounds really useful.I know that other languages have subranges or refinement types but niches seem to solve a different problem - namely to use the &#34;holes&#34; in a data type for optimization. Does any other language have some comparable concept to niches in Rust?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know whether SARS-CoV-2 escaped from a lab. But if it did, then not only is it probably not the first lab-origin pandemic, but it&#39;s also not the first time the WHO initially excluded that possibility.The 1977 Russian Flu pandemic was genetically near-identical to a strain from 1950, without the expected mutations that should have appeared after 27 years of undetected circulation among humans or animals. It&#39;s been widely suspected in mainstream literature to have escaped from a research or vaccine manufacturing accident, to the point that the NEJM casually wrote:&gt; The reemergence was probably an accidental release from a laboratory source in the setting of waning population immunity to H1 and N1 antigenshttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra0904322But at the time, the WHO said:&gt; Laboratory contamination can be excluded because the laboratories concerned either had never kept H1N1 virus or had not worked with it for a long time.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2395678/pdf/bul...And it&#39;s absolutely bizarre to me that people are asking why the origin even matters. After thousands of people died in Bhopal, did it matter whether better chemical safety standards could have prevented that? So with millions dead now, how could you possibly not wonder whether our current standards for the sampling and manipulation of poorly-understood pandemic-candidate viruses are adequate?"</p>

Or an online video from the main devs explaining what they are doing for five minutes (#)What if there existed something to Make the above easy and simply to do - a small foundation who&#39;s job is to keep membership rolls and accept payments from companies on behalf of any foss project that signs up (it&#39;s something I imagine patreon could offer). They then ensure that the (minimal contract) is adhered to in some manner.(#) Seriously - you could set up a zoom call with 1-5 devs and just hit record once a year - I promise that 99% will see this as unbearable imposition and then talk for two hours.  And that&#39;s &#34;actionable paid insights into the future of this tool we depend on&#34;So the point being, if your FOSS project gets traction, then sign up to this foss-patreon, tell everyone to click to subscribe and you might might get a sponsor or two."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people here are accusing Google of embrace, extend, and extinguish, but you have to realize that the incentives here are different from Big Tech&#39;s point of view. I&#39;d first like to point out Python is a programming language, not an internet standard or file format. It gets its utility merely from the ability to develop in it, even without an established ecosystem or network effect. The barrier to jump in, or fork off and start over is far lower compared to a browser or file format.So what&#39;s in it for Big Tech? Well, in a situation where controlling the technology or suppressing it is difficult due to the low costs of starting over, it is in their best interest to promote the ecosystem rather than control it. When they put in the time, money, and engineers to make it better the return on investment can be massive, because of the help they get from the community to grow, maintain, and keep compatible this core component at less cost than if they did it themselves.The incentives align and benefit everyone, especially if there is a fair governance system mediating between all parties involved. The biggest threat to an open source project is therefore not Big Tech collaboration, but project abandonment and lack of maintenance. I hope this makes everyone a little more optimistic about the direction of open source, especially as companies realize the real value it can have for all involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The argument of specialist vs generalist is futile. They simple fit in distinct parts of the journey and evolution of a software product.Generalists are highly valuable for many types of orgs and projects especially nascent projects. But sometimes you need the precise output of a specialist to achieve something.If my business has a product that is highly dependent of let&#39;s say OpenGL, then an OpenGL specialist will generate more specific output that someone who knows a little of OpenGL and a lot of other things.However, there&#39;s always the counterargument that generalists can compensate with their holistic view and understanding of problems throughout the whole stack. I understand this and agree with it, but I think there&#39;s a point in every innovation where the generalist contribution declines sharply. And I&#39;m saying this as a generalist.If you are a generalist and you feel undervalued, you&#39;re likely in the wrong project or too involved in phases of a project where your contribution can&#39;t move the needle significantly anymore."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my career, I have met exactly one short fat engineer with &gt;5yrs of exp that I was impressed by. That person is now a Product Manager at a FAANG company (albeit PM-ing highly technical stuff).I bring this up because I think there is a very good analogy to the point that the author is making and the distinction between PM and Engineers. Broadly put, PM&#39;s are good at figuring out the theta, and Engineers are good at the r.I think that with the perspectives that short fat engineers have, they can play enormous roles as &#34;PM&#34; or &#34;Engineering Manager&#34;, and definitely as ICs during early stages of startups. But they clearly don&#39;t enjoy depth, and this can be counter-productive for that 1% of the time where you really, really want depth.I don&#39;t buy the knowledge vs wisdom thing though, there&#39;s plenty of wisdom to be gained from going deep into a subject. I&#39;d actually claim that wisdom can only come from depth - though what depth means is different for different roles."</p>
