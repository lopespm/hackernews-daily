								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All of Netanyahu&#39;s allies in the world seem to have profited from this relationship by obtaining military grade surveillance inorder to suppress human rights of journalists and opposition.This is Netanyahu&#39;s legacy, a proto dictator, arming dictators.I&#39;m convince pegasus was used against Israeli journalists, opposition leaders and law enforcement officials. Too bad our political system is still under his thumb and doesn&#39;t shed light on this crap even now that he&#39;s no longer PM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there is one single lasting international effect of Orbán and his party, it&#39;s how he demonstrated how EU is completely helpless against rouge states (as well). The delicate political balance of its parliamental politics make it impossible to react to any complex, even if lethal threats. The EU funds and fuels a Belorussian-style regime in its own heartland for a decade now, and all they can do are angry notices and legal disputes that take years without a noteworthy resolution. Due to how alliances within the union work - Hungary has the full support of Poland and the V4 - any major blowback would result in shattering itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I came to the conclusion that politicians are a big problem. Not sure we can get rid of them but they are.FWIW I just see them use the money of others for their own purposes coactively and provoke a lot of polarization. Many times with bad intention for selfish interests. I am talking about ALL of them.I think people should be able (Hungarian case at hand) to choose whether they want certain contents to be taught at certain age for their kids. No matter which ones. It should be a free to choose thing.The minimum stuff we must all agree upon should be not killing, discriminating, etc. in legal terms. But when you try to force people to like or dislike something, instead of respecting others (whether they like or not other people ideas) then you have this highly polarized environment because you will always find the other half resisting, since it is imposed contents highly ideological.I think that things could be way better with fewer of these people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While this list looks solid, I think it&#39;s telling that none of the papers that immediately came to my mind were on this list.I suspect that there are many more, and which papers are important to any one person is as varied as the disciplines we have within software engineering.- Out of the Tar Pit 2005, a paper on Functional Reactive Programming that is an excellent read for anyone doing functional programming, UI programming, or a number of other things.- Consistent Hashing and Random Trees: Distributed Caching Protocols for Relieving Hot Spots on the World Wide Web 1997, important read for anyone working in distributed systems or services with any sort of scale.- Roy Fielding&#39;s dissertation 2000, to learn just how widely applicable REST principles are and how misunderstood it is as a design.- The Part Time Parliament 1998, the original Paxos paper, important basis for anyone working with distributed systems.- The Cathedral and the Bazaar 1997, an essay not a paper, but a good background to the open source world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Like most of these types of articles, it seems to me, to be biased towards a certain genre of development. I don&#39;t know how often I encounter a lot of the stuff the author seems to consider &#34;fundamentals.&#34;I have spent a good part of my life doing things like device control, and direct, native, user interface. These can get mui hairy.It&#39;s difficult to talk to a lot of folks about these, as everyone is focused on &#34;the Big Picture,&#34; to quote Peter O&#39;Toole.Device control, in particular, has a lot of aspects that are unique, and not particularly applicable to many other disciplines. With the advent of some of the new communication techs, like Bluetooth, and advanced serial buses (like USB and Thunderbolt), we&#39;re starting to see a bit of cross-pollination with communications (another discipline that many software developers never need to worry about).UI has always been best served (not exclusive, but best), as native. This means that each platform tends to have a specific framework.Learning frameworks, SDKs, and APIs has always (for me) been the most time-consuming part of adapting to a platform or system.But that&#39;s just me. YMMV."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few papers that changed my life were the ones about distributed, no sql databases (cassandra, consistent hashing, dynamodb, map reduce, etc). But I would not recommend them to anybody else, I was just useful to me as at the time. I was a CS student in Argentina, studying in a very old fashioned university. The coding exams were done ON PAPER in a Pascal-flavored pseudo code.When I found and started reading those papers it was like finding life in another planet. It completely changed my way of thinking. I dropped out school and focused on learning as much of the cool stuff as possible (on the internet). It payed off well :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a great podcast called &#34;Astray&#34; that talks about how bad mediation and the search for enlightenment can go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since this is a long article, here’s a summary for fellow readers — it’s mostly about the negative side effects of meditation that the author believes is under-documented or under-reported due to the ‘hype’ of meditation as the 21st century cure-all. He talks about dissociative experiences (which is well documented in medical research), it being a pseudo-religion, and lastly, his belief that the extended use of meditation is the ‘opposite’ of stoicism in the way that it can render a person not less, but more susceptible to breakage from smaller stresses, like one of a traffic jam. He also attempts to make a biological argument on how this works by invoking something he calls the limbic system feedback loop, however I have found that argument unconvincing due to lack of any actual evidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This terrain was fresh. I had never previously experienced a psychotic episode and have no history of mental illness besides occasional bouts of mild anxiety and depression.
...
&gt; Why did I start meditating? The short answer is that in 2009 I started a fist fight in a French Quarter bar over some jambalaya, a steamy kiss, and a stray comment I didn’t take fondly. The evening ended hours later after I broke a window with my fist, misplaced my shirt, and guzzled about 16 bottles of Miller High Life.YYMMV, but I feel the author is having problems they dont want to really accept.  That is what the contradiction in the two quotes above indicates.Aside from that, I couldn&#39;t help but think about people having access to too many psychedelics.  For a while, tripping can give you the most profound experiences ever.  But after a while, it sort of becomes mondane, and this is when the bad trip probability suddenly skyrockets.  Or, put another way, even Siddhartha didn&#39;t find awakening in the samana practices.  They were only the first step (of three) to reach his goal.  You can overdo everything, even the very very nice things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing that many people (including myself at times) are prone to is an irrational fear that their idea will be stolen. This wouldn’t be such a big deal if this fear didn’t cause people to repeatedly shoot themselves in the foot. Countless ideas never got off the ground because the innovator refused to talk to investors or partners without an NDA or withheld important details.By far the biggest risk to any idea is that it never gets off the ground. It’s orders of magnitude more likely that you’ll get a zero outcome than anything else. Zero users. Zero adoption. Zero product.For anyone in this position, you’d be better off if the idea was stolen. Because at least you’ll be known as the original version of the thing that big tech ripped off. That’s almost certainly good for a few percent market share. Which is way better than zero."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Imagine if your spouse told you, “I have an idea for a delicious 10-course meal. You should spend the next few days researching each dish, buying the ingredients, testing different versions, preparing the final meal, and serving it plate by plate at a dinner party. We’ll split the credit 50/50.”This is brilliant. I am going to use this next time someone tells me they want to give me equity for building their entire product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Many of them want a partner–they’ll be in charge of the idea, and I’ll execute it.Boy, does that sound familiar. In my experience, they&#39;ll also get most of the money and credit, and will plan to kick me to the curb, once it gets to alpha.&gt; I hate to break it to you, but your idea–any idea, really–is worthless. An idea only has value when it is executed, and it only has a lot of value when it’s executed well.And that &#34;executed well&#34; is important. I have seen so many promising ideas and systems destroyed by being written by &#34;lowest common denominator&#34; implementation talent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looks like it&#39;s getting hugged to death: https://web.archive.org/web/20210716193902/https://artbma.or...I love the BMA. It&#39;s a free museum with a great restaurant, cool exhibits, a nice park across the street. Nearby is The Book Thing, a free book store. Also another (non-free) book &amp; record store, Normal&#39;s. And another, Urban Reads. And another bookstore/coffee shop, Bird in Hand. And a farmer&#39;s market. And a vegan restaurant. And the quirkiest diner ever, Papermoon. And a small rock venue. And a worker-owned co-op coffeeshop that President Obama visited. All in a four block radius.Dang, I miss Baltimore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Also notable is the Broad Museum in Los Angeles. Their guards are also docents, so you are encouraged to talk to them about the art and ask them questions. After experiencing this more human interaction, it was a bit of a shock for me to go down the street to the Museum of Contemporary Art, where I asked a guard a question and they flat out rejected my asking, haha!Arts workers need to be paid well and also have enriching roles in the museums. And I don&#39;t think this sort of thing necessarily requires a 4-year degree or whatnot. I believe people are naturally curious, and we need to lean into that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is peculiar because it treats security guards as humans and challenges unspoken hierarchy. It also implies the museum doesn&#39;t save on security (17 guards is a lot) and there isn&#39;t a big turnover (unless there&#39;s a special type of security guard that mostly works in museums). It&#39;s borderline unthinkable in the 5th roundest country in the world where I live. They would hire students.I was hoping it would be more about burglaries, stealing famous works of arts, selling stolen works etc. The law enforcement / security perspective. Instead it appears to be a pretty standard exhibition except with an unusual method of selecting curators."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve never found anything that worked as well as:1. Become aware that something I&#39;m interested in learning exists2. Watch and skim a bunch of videos at 2x speed around the idea of the thing (usually keynotes or videos created by the author) to get hyped up3. Go through the documentation&#39;s getting started guide while following along4. Immediately start building something with the new thingTreat everything beyond this as question driven development[0] or basically JIT (just in time) learning.For context the first 3 steps are usually no more than a weekend or a few days.I do this loop all the time and it hasn&#39;t really failed yet for learning all sorts of things (5+ programming languages, a bunch of stuff about Linux, Ansible, Docker, Vim, Terraform, Kubernetes, video production, and the list goes on). These are learning things very quickly at a level where you can comfortably bill out freelance work or get employed.[0]: https://nickjanetakis.com/blog/learning-a-new-web-framework-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; If you only follow guided resources, you&#39;ll wind up in tutorial hell.I disagree very strongly here. You can wind up in tutorial hell if you only read surface level small to medium sized posts.My &#34;career superpower&#34; is that I&#39;m always working my way through one textbook or another. You get serious depth this way and avoid getting stuck with a surface level understanding. Plus, with depth you can end up with really strong fundamentals, which make learning the next thing that much easier.I know a lot of people who read tons of blog posts on topics but never crack open a textbook, or people who watch youtubers explain academic papers yet never open up the actual paper.Maybe my &#34;learn stuff quickly&#34; trick is... don&#39;t. Spend a decade accumulating deep knowledge slowly, and it&#39;ll add up. The road to &#34;tutorial hell&#34; is paved with blogposts and missing fundamentals.(I like the rest of the post)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;With software development, though, mistakes are free! If we make a mistake, we can tab back to our editor, change the code, and try again. We even have helpful error messages that can (sometimes) point us in the right direction. This is an incredible luxury, and not one that we take advantage of enough.&#34;This is definitely very underrated and partly why I think computer science education is still sort of broken in some universities. Trial and error should be embraced as a a part of the process of building things. But instead, many curriculums in universities use exams to test your knowledge without any sort of debugger or console. You just have to go off of what you know, getting things as close to correct as you can in the first pass.All evaluations in CS should surround some type of project based work, it&#39;s a huge luxury other fields don&#39;t have. Students studying architecture or mechanical engineering, for example, simply can&#39;t build a functioning bridge as a test due to the cost of raw materials and how fatal an error may be (that would be really cool though). It&#39;s an advantage that we literally can build the bridge equivalent as a project in the CS world."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think some businesses are going out of businesses because they stubbornly refuse to raise their wages.In the vacation community where I live, there are two grocery/delis about a mile apart from each other. One is at a marina, the other is at a beach. They have almost the same business offering. Traditionally, both are fully mobbed during the sunny seasons.Two weeks ago, I visited the one I usually go to -- at the marina. They had a sign at the front door, &#34;Due to the labor shortage...&#34; and they weren&#39;t operating their deli counter. No sandwiches. When I sent inside, it was empty. No customers. The one employee at the register was on their phone. Nothing going on. A couple of people pulled up in their cars, read the sign, pulled out and left immediately.Drove up the road a mile to the other one. No sign -- it was busy like it usually was. Full house, busy counters and registers.My son asked me why the other place wouldn&#39;t just raise their wages.. I couldn&#39;t answer, but I guessed it was more on a matter of principle than calculated reality. There&#39;s no way they were surviving or thriving. I joked that maybe the owner was an old cahoot who remembered when a soda was $0.05 and there was no way they were going to raise their hourly wages to $15 or more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The restaurant industry has known the solution for a long time but everyone wants to pretend it would be too difficult.Stop the tipping guilt trip placed on the public, raise your prices 20%, and pay your employees a livable wage. The public will still show up to eat in your restaurant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wages/insurance/tips are an ongoing concern of food service work, but I want to set that aside and talk about the other half of the article. Customer entitlement is out of control and anybody who works with the general public will tell you it’s gotten even worse since the pandemic—and it wasn’t trending in the right direction before. Flight attendants, park rangers, government clerks, the anecdotes are everywhere, in whispers and on social media.A good friend of mine is a doctor and he has a hair-raising story for me nearly every day, often indistinguishable from fast food customers’ behavior. I’m trying to get him to retire before he gets shot by somebody who was told they’d have to wait 3 days for an appointment.What’s going on?  I have my own theories but I want HN’s take."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just the other day I suggested using a yubikey, and someone linked me to the Titan sidechannel where researchers demonstrated that, with persistent access, and a dozen hours of work, they could break the guarantees of a Titan chip[0]. They said &#34;an attacker will just steal it&#34;. The researchers, on the other hand, stressed how very fundamentally difficult this was to pull off due to very limited attack surface.This is the sort of absolutism that is so pointless.At the same time, what&#39;s equally frustrating to me is defense without a threat model. &#34;We&#39;ll randomize this value so it&#39;s harder to guess&#34; without asking who&#39;s guessing, how often they can guess, how you&#39;ll randomize it, how you&#39;ll keep it a secret, etc. &#34;Defense in depth&#34; has become a nonsense term.The use of memory unsafe languages for parsing untrusted input is just wild. I&#39;m glad that I&#39;m working in a time where I can build all of my parsers and attack surface in Rust and just think way, way less about this.I&#39;ll also link this talk[1], for the millionth time. It&#39;s Rob Joyce, chief of the NSA&#39;s TAO, talking about how to make NSA&#39;s TAO&#39;s job harder.[0] https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2021/01/hacke...[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bDJb8WOJYdA"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article says that although &#34;you can&#39;t have perfect security,&#34; you can make it uneconomical to hack you. It&#39;s a good point, but it&#39;s not the whole story.The problem is that state-level actors don&#39;t just have a lot of money; they (and their decision makers) also put a much much lower value on their money than you do.I would never think to spend a million dollars on securing my home network (including other non-dollar costs like inconveniencing myself). Let&#39;s suppose that spending $1M would force the US NSA to spend $10M to hack into my home network. The people making that decision aren&#39;t spending $10M of their own money; they&#39;re spending $10M of the government&#39;s money. The NSA doesn&#39;t care about $10M in the same way that I care about $1M.As a result, securing yourself even against a dedicated attacker like Israel&#39;s NSO Group could cost way, way more than a simple budget analysis would imply. I&#39;d have to make the costs of hacking me so high that someone at NSO would say &#34;wait a minute, even we can&#39;t afford that!&#34;So, sure, &#34;good enough&#34; security is possible in principle, I think it&#39;s fair to say &#34;You probably can&#39;t afford good-enough security against state-level actors.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love the little nugget in the mitigations section. You can plug the hole for a normal filesystem, but then FUSE filesystems have an additional problem: &#34;if an attacker FUSE-mounts a long directory (longer than 8MB), then systemd exhausts its stack, crashes, and therefore crashes the entire operating system (a kernel panic).&#34;If there&#39;s one place other than the kernel where truly defensive programming should be applied, it is systemd."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone knows how to try the PoC (https://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/07/20/1/1) ?For me it crashes into the fork_userns:177PS: don&#39;t need to downvote. Sometimes managers want you to prove that there&#39;s a need to patch. It&#39;s dumb but it&#39;s what it is"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of issue is the reason why some more modern languages like Rust or Go do not have implicit narrowing conversions. For instance, on Rust, trying to simply pass an usize (Rust&#39;s equivalent of size_t) to a function which expects an i32 (Rust&#39;s equivalent of int) will not compile; the programmer has to write &#34;size as i32&#34; (Rust&#39;s equivalent of &#34;(int) size&#34;), which makes it explicit that it might truncate the value at that point.(Some Rust developers argue that even &#34;size as i32&#34; should be avoided, and &#34;size.try_into()&#34; should be used instead, since it forces the programmer to treat an overflow explicitly at runtime, instead of silently wrapping.)"</p>
