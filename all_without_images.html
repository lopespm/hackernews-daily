								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anthony - if you&#39;re reading this, thank you!! To arrive at this architecture takes 100s if not 100s of hours, and to share it with the community is dang inspiring.I was feeling a bit down on my projects, but this has me amped up seeing how the ultimate goal of working on features rather than deployment is possible, and very real!Best of luck with Panelbear!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author almost seems to apologize for having a django monolith.But it&#39;s worth realising that one purpose of code organisation in larger companies is to mirror the team organisation. That&#39;s a constraint on code that can interfere with the best technical architecture.You can do better with a monolith in a one-man team!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, unless and until, companies like Facebook are fined appropriate amounts they’ll never stop.Quite literally, every business school on the fucking planet will tell you do something if it’s cheaper. It is cheaper for them to not give a fuck, than to give one. Unless they are fined upwards of $20-50bn it’ll never stop because it’s always going to benefit their bottom line. Full stop.If you don’t take 10-15% from a company they won’t ever be incentivized to stop. This 5% or less bullshit has to stop if folks want change.Edit: small grammar fix."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For years companies have been steadily asking, mandating or even trickling users to give them their phone numbers under the excuse of security (while the real reasons were different), now what?How can they be trusted anymore?This also strikes a great point about the data sharing between Facebook and WhatsApp. Linking data between services augments the dangers and the consequences are not obvious to the end user.I think Facebook should offer their users the option to remove their phone numbers with a real deletion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I went in thinking &#34;meh, let&#39;s check&#34; and was surprised and quite amused about the &#34;wholesomeness&#34; of what could have been a very strange encounter.He seemed respectful and she seemed unbothered by the whole ordeal. Interesting, not my cup of tea, but definitely interesting.Something else that caught my attention was how early he believes his interest for feet developed, as early as six and nine years of age. I wonder how this slightly amusing predilection grows and develops over time, as to even gain sexual connotation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; So why not just look at feet on Instagram, or screenshot them for yourself? What do you get out of posting them to another website?This question has always been weird to me, but apparently there are people who don’t experience “this thing is good, i wish to contribute” or “this has brought me joy, i wish to give something back”. I mean, thankfully there are still enough others that we can have Wikipedia, where you also don’t get anything in return. Not even “clout”. Sometimes someone will send you a thank you and that’ll make your day. Open Source is another obvious one, but it extends to the real world, too. Some people will plant flowers in public places or do yarnbombing or pick up trash in the neighborhood or whatever. Why do it? What do you get out of it? I mean, I don’t want to be harsh saying “what a dumb question”, but it just kind of makes me uncomfortable how it challenges something that should be celebrated.The next question about it being invasive is good and valid, but this one on its own just sounds like “why not content yourself with passively consuming”. I’m glad he called himself “generous” because it’s true."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For every weird niche hobby there is a guy who is creating literal database of something with almost scientific precision.Mix it with rule 34 and you got things like WikiFeet or some Czech site which is literal database of nude scenes in our whole cinema history (sorted by movies, actresses and director including screencaps of course)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; CPUs have somewhat plateaued in their single core performance in the past decadeIn fact for many cases single core performance has dropped at a given relative price-point. Look at renting inexpensive (not bleeding edge) bare-metal servers: the brand new boxes often have a little less single-core performance than units a few years old, but have two, three, or four times the number of cores at a similar inflation/other adjusted cost.For most server workloads, at least where there is more than near-zero concurrency, adding more cores is far more effective than trying to make a single core go faster (up to a point - there are diminishing returns when shoving more and more cores into one machine, even for embarrassingly parallel workloads, due to other bottlenecks, unless using specialist kit for your task).It can be more power efficient too despite all the extra silicon - one of the reasons for the slight drop (rather than a plateau) in single core oomph is that a small drop in core speed (or a reduction in the complexity via pipeline depth and other features) can create a significant reduction in power consumption. Once you take into account modern CPUs being able to properly idle unused cores (so they aren&#39;t consuming more than a trickle of energy unless actively doing something) it becomes a bit of a no-brainer in many data-centre environments. There are exceptions to every rule of course - the power dynamic flips if you are running every core at full capacity most or all of the time (i.e. crypto mining)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&#34;Closing File Handles on WindowsMany years ago I was profiling Mercurial to help improve the working directory checkout speed on Windows, as users were observing that checkout times on Windows were much slower than on Linux, even on the same machine.I thought I could chalk this up to NTFS versus Linux filesystems or general kernel/OS level efficiency differences. What I actually learned was much more surprising.When I started profiling Mercurial on Windows, I observed that most I/O APIs were completing in a few dozen microseconds, maybe a single millisecond or two ever now and then. Windows/NTFS performance seemed great!Except for CloseHandle(). These calls were often taking 1-10+ milliseconds to complete. It seemed odd to me that file writes - even sustained file writes that were sufficient to blow past any write buffering capacity - were fast but closes slow. It was even more perplexing that CloseHandle() was slow even if you were using completion ports (i.e. async I/O). This behavior for completion ports was counter to what the MSDN documentation said should happen (the function should return immediately and its status can be retrieved later).While I didn&#39;t realize it at the time, the cause for this was/is Windows Defender. Windows Defender (and other anti-virus / scanning software) typically work on Windows by installing what&#39;s called a filesystem filter driver. This is a kernel driver that essentially hooks itself into the kernel and receives callbacks on I/O and filesystem events. It turns out the close file callback triggers scanning of written data. And this scanning appears to occur synchronously, blocking CloseHandle() from returning. This adds milliseconds of overhead.&#34;PDS: Observation: In an OS, if I/O (or more generally, API calls) are initially written to run and return quickly -- this doesn&#39;t mean that they won&#39;t degrade (for whatever reason), as the OS expands and/or underlying hardware changes, over time...For any OS writer, present or future, a key aspect of OS development is writing I/O (and API) performance tests, running them regularly, and immediately halting development to understand/fix the root cause -- if and when performance anomalies are detected... in large software systems, in large codebases, it&#39;s usually much harder to gain back performance several versions after performance has been lost (i.e., Browsers), than to be disciplined, constantly test performance, and halt development (and understand/fix the root cause) the instant any performance anomaly is detected..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Historically, the Windows Command Prompt and the built-in Terminal.app on macOS were very slow at handling tons of output.A very old trick I remember on Windows, is to minimize command prompts if a lot of output was expected and would otherwise slow down the process. I don&#39;t know if it turned write operations into a no-op, or bypassed some slow GDI functions, but it had an extremely noticeable difference in performance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was a teenager, my music teacher always had a copy of the Real Book around. I went to a local music store and was looking through their music books when one of the employees asked, &#39;is there something I can help you find?&#39; When I said the Real Book, he said, &#39;oh, we don&#39;t keep that out here&#39;... he disappeared for a minute and came back with a copy from the back room. At the time, I felt like I had been admitted into a secret club."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a bassist. I got my Real Book in 1982. I was already playing in the high school jazz band, but as a suburban kid, I had zero exposure to things like jam sessions and live jazz performances. Nobody had taught me how to learn harmonies from recordings, so I was kind of lost. The Real Book gave me a way to follow recorded tunes and grasp what the players were doing. Later on, being able to play from &#34;lead sheets&#34; enabled me to play with musicians who were a lot better than me, and was really how I learned to play.But eventually, I was hauling a ton of fake books to every gig. About 20 years ago, I was running late, and decided to leave my fake books behind. And I survived. I had memorized most of the tunes that were played regularly in my locale, and forced myself to learn the rest by ear, on the bandstand.So I tell people that the two best things I&#39;ve done for my jazz playing were: Getting a Real Book, and getting rid of my Real Book. Today, those tunes are hopelessly overplayed, and I prefer finding bands to play with, who are willing to venture off the beaten path, with less familiar tunes or especially original material."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was learning to play the saxophone my instructor had an old copy of the Real Book. The transcriptions of songs by some of the jazz legends  would blow my mind. I thought the people being able to transcribe those were geniuses (still do). They had no sophisticated software to help them. It was all done manually by listening to countless hours of recordings over and over again. All those chord changes, harmonies, the extra fast tempo...That also reminds me of Phil Schapp. He used to run (probably still does) a radio program at Columbia University. Most astonishing encyclopedic knowledge of jazz!! Have a listen sometime. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phil_SchaapEdit: Added Wikipedia link."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I understand the arguments that &#34;QI has reasonable goals in theory&#34;, but it is time to throw the baby out with the bathwater. If cops didn&#39;t want to lose QI, they should have held themselves to account for the last few decades. Maybe the unions should have spoken up when cops steal tens of thousands of dollars in cash from a suspect, and get away with it due to QI.San Antonio, TX will be voting in May on whether to disband the police union. &#34;Back the Blue&#34; types are saying it&#39;s Defund in disguise, that we won&#39;t be able to find good cops, and so on.Except several large cities in Texas don&#39;t have unionized police, and they do alright. Furthermore, the cops in San Antonio can commit really awful crimes, and still have months- or years-long appeals.Being a cop isn&#39;t a right, it is a privilege and a critical duty. It should be easy to fire bad cops. SAPD, if you didn&#39;t want your union to be busted, maybe you should have  held yourselves to a higher standard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The purpose of qualified immunity is to permit officials to carry out their discretionary duties without fear of personal liability or harassing litigation.It applies to all parts of government. Didn&#39;t get the building permit for your kids horse barn? Sue the planning commission members individually. Animal control writes you a citation for Puddles not being on a leash? Unleash the lawyers. Health department gave your wine bar a bad rating? Sue the inspector personally.The way to fix policing isn&#39;t by making the rest of government worse. Reform unions for employees of the people. Create independent civilian oversight boards with the teeth to suspend and terminate. Invest more in mental health and drug rehabilitation services. Invest in educational resources to teach communities how to deal with law enforcement.Edit to add: People are confusing civil liability with criminal liability. If you are found guilty of a crime, then you can be sued."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since it&#39;s a USA-specific term and not very self-explanatory (I thought this was a COVID-related thing because it contains &#39;immunity&#39;, but it&#39;s not):&gt; In the United States, qualified immunity is a legal principle that grants government officials performing discretionary functions immunity from civil suits unless the plaintiff shows that the official violated &#34;clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known&#34;.-- Wikipedia"</p>

It&#39;s their ultimate out. Minority groups, majority groups, it doesn&#39;t matter - you&#39;re in trouble and need a platform to tell your story? Not happening on Twitch. Expect more to sign on to this idea; it is the ultimate tool for cancel culture proponents.- Foreword: I am not making a constitutional argument. Private companies now own most of the highways we use for speech, much less widespread speech. Sure, Newspapers and mail can be argued, but there&#39;s plenty of examples where they had to tolerate nasty messages for some self-imposed access to speech principles. Secondarily, nobody used a newspaper to talk to their auntie, while Twitch isn&#39;t Facebook or Twitter self-expression is not limited to certain platforms. That is lost on tech companies.This new stage of American moralism is pretty tiring no matter what group or direction it comes from.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s strange to see a company that once prided itself on active engagement with its users to find product-market fit antagonize its content creators so much. And as a user, it gives me the perception that the platform is just plainly unfair. (Plus the platform is unusable without Adblock).Top streamers have been banned or lost partnerships for playing their own music[0], stating controversial political opinions[1][2], getting trolled by users who &#34;snipe&#34; streamers and shout vulgarities, or just accidentally showing movie clips with nudity [3]. From what I gather, the ban appeal process is byzantine and is heavily biased towards inaction. Oftentimes appeals are never even considered, or partnership staff plainly doesn&#39;t respond.The upsetting part is Twitch is such a great platform technology wise, and its competitors can&#39;t seem to recreate the same magic. I guess we&#39;re stuck with lousy moderation until the streaming fad dies down.[0] https://www.sportskeeda.com/esports/twitch-reportedly-suspen...[1] https://dotesports.com/streaming/news/hasanabi-banned-from-t...[2] https://win.gg/news/5496/destiny-loses-twitch-partnership-fo...[3] https://www.ginx.tv/en/twitch/vinesauce-banned-on-twitch-ove..."</p>

Contrary to the popular belief, slippery slope isn&#39;t a logical fallacy.Anonymity is the only way to combat this. Make sure your online identity isn&#39;t connected to your real name.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who has worked in fields that use lattice calculations (on the experimental side), the new calculation is interesting, but I would not say it’s particularly convincing yet. Lattice calculations are VERY difficult, and are not always stable. I am not questioning whether they did their work well or not, just pointing out that in high energy physics and high energy nuclear physics, many times our experimental results are significantly better constrained and also undergo significantly more testing via reproduction of results by other experiments than our theory counterparts’ work. 
Is it possible that all of our previous experiments have had some sort of correlated systematic error in them? Unlikely, but yes. Is it more likely that this lattice calculation may be underestimating its errors? Much more likely. Another interesting option is that one of the theoretical calculations was actually done slightly wrong. My first guess would be the lattice result, since it’s newer, but both procedures are complicated, so it could be either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a particle physicist (no longer working in the field, sadly), this is one of the more exciting results in a long time. Muon g-2 has been there, in some form of another for debate and model building, for many years (taken somewhat seriously for 15+?), waiting for better statistics and confirmation. At over 4 sigma this is much more compelling than it has ever been, and the best potential sign of new (non-Standard Model) physics.I&#39;m not current on what models people like to explain this result, but it has been factored in (or ignored if you didn&#39;t trust it) in particle physics model building and phenomenology for years. This result makes it much more serious and something I imagine all new physics models (say for dark matter or other collider predictions or tensions in data) will be using.Whether or not anything interesting is predicted, theoretically, from this remains to be seen. I don&#39;t know off hand if it signals anything in particular, as the big ideas, like supersymmetry, are a bit removed from current collider experiments and aren&#39;t necessarily tied to g-2 if I remember correctly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Switching to electric cars from ICE cars is continuing to do the wrong thing and make the wrong choices, but doing this wrong thing a bit better.It&#39;s still the same status quo, woefully terrible and unsustainable transportation model.Automobile oriented transportation doesn&#39;t scale, is a huge waste of resources, and perpetuates unsustainable, ultra expensive and resource intensive sprawling urban development patterns.In contrast more compact cities with bike lanes take CO2 intensive cars off the road, and less cars means less parking, which enables cheaper buildings with less CO2 intensive concrete parking lots. Wins all around.It&#39;s frustrating to see so called environmentalist politicians that go all in with big electric car mandates but can barely put any money toward active transportation and rebuilding our cities to be more space efficient and accordingly use less carbon.Remarkably former British Columbia Green Leader Andrew Weaver even got on twitter recently to oppose a Victoria area protected bike lane and got into all sorts of arguments with cyclists. Incredible to see an environmental leader do this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Cycling is not only good for the environment, but for cities in general.During the last confinement, when car traffic completely stopped, I realised that cars are the single biggest reason why living in the city can be unpleasant. People may not realise it consciously, but when they move out of the city, what they are looking for is a place with not as much cars driving around.Cars destroy cities by making a vicious circle of making it unpleasant to live there, therefore enticing people to move to the suburbs and commute by car, which make the problem worse.Setting up biking infrastructure fixes this, because it reduces the room for cars used by commuters, while creating room for bicycles used by people living in the city.With less cars, you can make the city center where people work liveable. You can have offices mixed with housing and have people live close to their work place, further diminishing the need for cars.If you think that your city can&#39;t possibly be a good place to cycle because weather / hills / etc, you are probably mistaken. Electric bikes and the appropriate clothes make biking pleasant in most places. IF there are not too many cars and infrastructure for the bicycle of course, which is probably the thing you don&#39;t have"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Switching from gas to electric is something I can do all on my own.  Switching from gas car to cycling is something that would require major investments from my city and developers.Both are noble goals, but let&#39;s not let perfect be the enemy of good.  Switch to electric now, and also encourage new roads and new developments to be bike friendly, so that switching to a bike is something that will be viable in 20 or 30 years for most cities in America.Edit: To clarify, the investment I&#39;m referring to is rezoning entire cities and tearing down single family homes and replacing them with mixed use buildings to bring commercial spaces closer to residential spaces.  Most American cities have commercial centers and are then surrounded by residential, with very little mixing of the two.  For example the closest place for me to buy food is .75 mile away, but the closest supermarket is 1.5 miles and I have to cross two major roads and a Freeway to get there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting. First time I&#39;ve head of Wuffs. As someone that still uses C, this in particular sounds neat:(from https://github.com/google/wuffs#goals-and-non-goals)&#34;&#34;&#34; Wuffs&#39; goal is to produce software libraries that are as safe as Go or Rust, roughly speaking, but as fast as C, and that can be used anywhere C libraries are used.[...] Wuffs the Library is available as transpiled C code. Other C/C++ projects can use that library without requiring the Wuffs the Language toolchain. Those projects can use Wuffs the Library like using any other third party C library. &#34;&#34;&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My favorite part of the Wuffs github page has to be the definition it gives for Dependent Types&gt; ...Dependent types are a way to implement compile-time bounds checking, but they&#39;re not the only way, and there&#39;s more to programming languages than their type systems. Wuffs does not use dependent types.Wuffs looks really interesting! I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever even heard of a language that is designed to only be used in an auxiliary role along side another general purpose programming language!Edit: As pointed out below, scripting languages like Lua are used in an auxiliary role, but in a very different way! Wuffs is designed for use in the deepest most crucial parts of an app, where as scripting languages are typically GC&#39;d and used at the very highest levels, often times by animations, game designers, or even end users!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; decompressing the entire image all-at-once (into one large intermediate buffer) instead of one row at a time (into smaller, re-usable buffers). All-at-once requires more intermediate memory but allows substantially more of the image to be decoded in the zlib-decompressor’s fastest code paths.Mozilla&#39;s imagelib has a neat trick to gain performance while working with smaller memory buffers when you want to render the output image at a smaller resolution than it is encoded. They call it downscale-during-decode.So this library pulls zlib decompression into the decode loop. Imagelib on the other hand optimizes at the other end of the pipeline and pulls downscaling into the decode loop.imagelib&#39;s optimization has the advantage that it helps with both small images as long as they&#39;re not displayed pixel-exact and also makes decoding humungous images feasible without causing the browser to explode with OOMs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m probably going to make a few enemies with this opinion, but I think modern C++ is just an utterly broken mess of a language. They should have just stopped extending it after C++11.When I look at C++14 and later I can&#39;t help but throw my hands up, laugh and think who, except for a small circle of language academics, actually believes that all this new template crap syntax actually helps developers?Personally I judge code quality by a) Functionality (does it work, is it safe?), b) Readability c) Conciseness d) Performance and e) Extendibility, in this order, and I don&#39;t see how these new features in reality help move any of these meaningfully in the right direction.I know the intentions are good, and the argument is that &#34;it&#39;s intended for library developers&#34; but how much of a percentage is that vs. just regular app/backend devs? In reality what&#39;s going to happen is that inside every organization a group of developers with good intentions, a lack of experience and too much time will learn it all and then feel the urge to now &#34;put their new knowledge to improve the codebase&#34;, which generally just puts everyone else in pain and accomplishes exactly nothing.Meanwhile it&#39;s 2021 and C++ coders are still- Waiting for Cross-Platform standardized SIMD vector datatypes- Using nonstandard extensions, libraries or home-baked solutions to run computations in parallel on many cores or on different processors than the CPU- Debugging cross-platform code using couts, cerrs and printfs- Forced to use boost for even quite elementary operations on std::strings.Yes, some of these things are hard to fix and require collaboration among real people and real companies. And yes, it&#39;s a lot easier to bury your head in the soft academic sand and come up with some new interesting toy feature. It&#39;s like the committee has given up.Started coding C++ when I was 14 -- 22 years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The #1 feature I currently want is the ability to do an implicit lambda capture of a structured binding, at least by reference. I appreciate there are interesting corner cases of like, bindings to bitfields: I simply don&#39;t need those corner cases solved... if it just supported a handful of the most obvious cases I would be so so so happy, and then they can spend the next decade arguing about how to solve it 99% (which I say as we know it won&#39;t be 100%... this is C++, where everything is some ridiculous epicycle over a previous failed feature :/).(edit:) OMG, I found this feature in the list!! (It was in the set of structured bindings changes instead of with the changes to lambda expressions, which I had immediately clanged through.) I need to figure out now what version of clang I need to use it (later edit: I don&#39;t think clang has it yet; but maybe soon?)... this is seriously going to change my life.https://oleksandrkvl.github.io/2021/04/02/cpp-20-overview.ht..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hope one day we can get a widely adopted C and C++ package manager. The friction involved in acquiring and using dependencies with odd build systems, etc. is one of the things I dislike about the language. I’m aware on Linux things are a bit easier, but if it were as easy as “npm install skia”, etc. everywhere, I think many people would use the language more.
 Rust has package management, but not the ecosystem yet. On the other hand, C/C++ has the ecosystem, but no standard way to easily draw from it."</p>

I don&#39;t have my head pinched by headphones for hours, and I can work in silence like I prefer. No coworkers interrupting me when I&#39;m in the zone.I&#39;ve saved between 8-10 hours per week in not commuting. Worse, I&#39;ve had bosses who enjoy flexing by having meetings promptly at 8am, where you have to leave extra early because you travel at peak rush hour.I don&#39;t have to keep up appearances when I&#39;m done with my work for the day or moment. If I&#39;m waiting for responses or reviews, I can veg out, watch Netflix or play a video game, while staying on top of my email and work load.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t believe it.I do believe that 34% of polled workers said they would quit rather than return to the office, but I do not believe even a majority of them would actually go follow through on that threat. Especially if you filter out high paid/high job-security developers and similar people who might have the financial security to do so.People, particularly Americans, are shackled to their jobs for many reasons and most people are risk-averse.Despite myself being pro-remote, I think that we will see a sizable return to office-centric work culture over the next few years. The office may (hopefully) end up looking or feeling a bit different as an outcome. All the stories about the &#34;end of the office&#34; are overblown.Once it again becomes beneficial for your career and/or social life to participate in office culture people will come crawling back. Not saying it&#39;s a good thing, but it&#39;s what will happen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another recent Postgres-complaint post from one of the best engineers I&#39;ve worked with: https://blog.nelhage.com/post/some-opinionated-sql-takes/Quoting his conclusion:&gt; As for Postgres, I have enormous respect for it and its engineering and capabilities, but, for me, it’s just too damn operationally scary. In my experience it’s much worse than MySQL for operational footguns and performance cliffs, where using it slightly wrong can utterly tank your performance or availability. … Postgres is a fine choice, especially if you already have expertise using it on your team, but I’ve personally been burned too many times.He wrote that shortly after chasing down a gnarly bug caused by an obscure Django/Postgres crossover: https://buttondown.email/nelhage/archive/22ab771c-25b4-4cd9-...Personally, I&#39;d still opt for Postgres every time – the featureset is incredible, and while it may have scary footguns, it&#39;s better to have footguns than bugs – at least you can do something about them.Still, I absolutely wish the official Postgres docs did a better job outlining How Things Can Go Wrong, both in general and on the docs page for each given feature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it’s worth mentioning that most of these problems only occur at a scale that only top 1% of companies will reach. I’ve been using PostgreSQL for over a decade without reaching any of the mentioned scaling-related problems.PostgreSQL is still the best general purpose database in my opinion, and you can then consider using something else for parts of your application if you have special needs. I’ve used Cassandra alongside PostgreSQL for massive write loads with great success."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My single biggest beef about PG is the lack of query planner hints.Unplanned query plan changes as data distribution shifts can and does cause queries to perform orders of magnitude worse. Queries that used to execute in milliseconds can start taking minutes without warning.Even the ability to freeze query plans would be useful, independent of query hints. In practice, I&#39;ve used CTEs to force query evaluation order. I&#39;ve considered implementing a query interceptor which converts comments into before/after per-connection settings tweaks, like turning off sequential scan (a big culprit for performance regressions, when PG decides to do a sequential scan of a big table rather than believe an inner join is actually sparse and will be a more effective filter)."</p>

After a decade of using Django I started a project I always wanted to exist: backported security and bug fixes to old versions that the Django project has dropped support for.I&#39;ve seen many Django projects eventually get stuck on an old version as the team I&#39;m on is forced to defer upgrades in favor of commercial pressures and essential product delivery.So you can subscribe to https://www.codestasis.com/ to stay patched on your old version, removing the urgency to upgrade.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple thoughts on django as a long time user.  First, the good:- Django was the first framework i learned when learning to code.  It&#39;s documentation was amazing, and it made conceptualizing an MVC framework really easy.- Django&#39;s ORM is phenomenal for managing migrations of a relational database, especially postgres with stuff like jsonb.   I&#39;ve even included it in non-python projects, just to handle table migrations/rollbacks.- The huge ecosystem is amazing.  Great for rapid prototyping.  Plugins for all kinds of crazy stuff.Now the bad:- In some ways it feels like a relic of an earlier stage of python.  It&#39;s support of asyncio is spotty at best (running the orm in a thread executor not a good work around).- It&#39;s support for type enforcement with mypy is not great.   This is maybe my biggest issue with using it on large collaborative projects.- It doesn&#39;t play nicely with a lot of the rest of the python ecosystem.  Want to swap in SQLAlchemy?  Sorry, no dice.  Want to have nice swagger documentation?  Use django rest framework or you&#39;re out of luck (i know it can be done, but it&#39;s kind of messy).  So in short, it&#39;s a bit of a monolith.These days I tend to only use django for it&#39;s orm in situations where i want a quick ad hoc database for something, or for rapid prototyping.  If I&#39;m going to do a larger project in python, I&#39;d definitely go with FastAPI.  But still, gotta appreciate that it&#39;s there, and has been reliable/well maintained for more than a decade."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Django is the gold standard for consistently pushing out reliable, well documented open source software without any marketing fluff or other bs. The amount of value the team is adding to the world can&#39;t be overstated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an awesome question. I hope someone has good strategies for you. Life should be spent doing the things you find worthwhile, and the fact is, not all of those things are monetizable.Given how esteem- and success driven HN as a platform is... you might not get too many ideas since I suppose people want to maintain their &#34;hireable&#34; status.Success and &#34;loving your job&#34; are more or less empty phrases unless you are actually a professional moving your field forward or learning a highly complex subject matter - or you own a stake in a company.Beyond that you are toiling, and if you like your job, it&#39;s glorious toiling like gardening (pleasing, but not important, but you love it, so it&#39;s great) or terrible toiling for living that eats your soul.I&#39;m basically in a job that is quite important for my org, I get compliments for good job, but I hate most aspects of my daily work since the tech stack is complex and fugly. I probably _appear_ motivated but I&#39;m just a neurotic who hates failing. If I didn&#39;t need to feed and house my family I would have moved to a lower paying position long ago that is intrinsically more motivating.Success and &#34;loving your job&#34; have nothing in common in my experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you want my advice, it is simply this: look for dysfunctional companies. They&#39;re easy to recognize, because they look like pretty much the opposite of those companies everybody really want to work at.Take everything you see from a website like Elastic[1] for example and invert it:- It should NOT be clear what the value proposition is.- The website should NOT adhere to modern design standards, or at least do so very poorly.- Bonus points for lots of unnecessary, buzz-heavy text that does not give any further indication of what the product/service offers.Just look for any remote developer job via linkedin or any other place recruiters frequent and just invert what seems to be a &#34;good&#34; job and look for that instead. Approach it with your current attitude (maybe not in the actual interview) and assume that you probably won&#39;t even want to add it to your resume.I think you won&#39;t have any problem finding a role where you can get away with this: how it will affect your mental health is another question, but that&#39;s for you to find out. If you ever want to bail out, you can just drop it and fill this gap period with something else in your resume, like whatever hobbies you were busy with.For the record, I think the incredulity in some of these responses is pretty hilarious. 99,9 % of companies do not care about your well being as a person, by choosing this attitude you&#39;re really just treating them the way they are already treating you: a disposable business partner that will be removed from the equation as soon as they are no longer beneficial for you.[1]: https://www.elastic.co/"</p>

To be fair though, the other guy was *really bad*. Like, couldn&#39;t even open IIS manager and restart a single website, bad.The pay is not fantastic / FAANG, but it does offer a decent salary in a mid/low cost of living area. Combined with my wife&#39;s salary we make more than enough.Also I get a free master&#39;s degree out of it. So that&#39;s awesome."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There was a similar, much more terrifying, story was in the New Yorker about six months ago.An Iranian physicist, Sirous Asgari, visited some US universities. On his next entry into the US he was detailed by the FBI as he entered and handed a completely-invented indictment of numerous crimes, and they demanded that he become an informant.He refused, since the indictment was completely phony. The FBI, furious, ensured he was charged with everything under the sun.Even though the government lost its case against him (due to clear lies by the FBI), he was then thrown in an ICE jail, through utter Kafkaesque bureaucratic hand-offs. Had to endure near-prison revolts as the inmates tries to keep themselves free of Covid. A judge almost granted him release due to the dangers of getting ill, but then he caught Covid and nearly died, so his petition was rejected. He was finally swapped as part of a  prisoner-swap deal with Iran. And yet he seems to be persona-no-grata now in Iran, as the assumption is that he must now be working for the FBI.https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/09/21/the-man-who-re..."</p>

This was such a great find and can&#39;t thank you enough for helping ensure Private Pages is as secure as possible.This report helped uncover:- A bug in Openresty where `ngx.redirect` didn&#39;t handle unsafe characters [1]. While the fix is now in the latest version of Openresty, a quick patch was to build the URL safely before using it in the redirect.- You should check for case sensitivity when reading `__Host` prefixed cookies, and verify the values against your expected format. It&#39;s possible for both `__HOST-Foo` and `__Host-Foo` cookies to exist, and only the `__Host` prefix requires the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` attributes [2]. In our case we strip all cookies at the edge using Varnish (VCL) to ensure no user-supplied cookies make it to our origin, and now we also ignore any &#34;Secure&#34; cookies that don&#39;t appear to have been set by our servers.[1]: https://github.com/openresty/lua-nginx-module/pull/1654[2]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Se..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I definitely agree with the article that it felt a bit like a betrayal. I&#39;ve pushed some friends and family to use it over Telegram despite significant usability issue, and now I see that instead of implementing some IMO basic features like proper message sync and easy backup when you get a new phone, they prefer to implement a... micropayment system? Based on some niche altcoin which doesn&#39;t even exist on mainstream exchanges?It goes beyond the usual issue with cryptocurrencies. Let&#39;s assume that they integrated with Bitcoin or Litecoin or some &#34;mainstream&#34; CC, would it still be a good idea? You can already send wallet addresses over signal if you care to do it.I&#39;m willing to give the Signal devs the benefit of the doubt and assume that they meant well and aren&#39;t actively trying to benefit from the move (even though I&#39;m not completely dismissing this possibility) but at the very least it&#39;s just showcases a very strange way to lead the project and prioritize issues. I can think of a dozen things out of the top that would do more to drive Signal adoption than integrating with some &#34;literally what?&#34; cryptocoin.This is going to drive the adoption of this niche cryptocoin, it&#39;s not going to do anything at all for Signal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article mirrors my feelings toward this announcement well. I spent a significant amount of time trying out different messaging apps and convincing my friends and family to move over from Telegram and WhatsApp. I used my reputation and their trust in my expertise.The whole blockchain industry is just too mixed with scams that I feel comfortable to have my non-tech relatives dealing with it. It&#39;s enough that I have to educate them on &#39;investments&#39; in random coins (it&#39;s gambling) and cure their FOMO regarding NFTs. Now the technology will be integrated into the messaging app that I endorsed, well-packed together with the smelly involvement of Moxie with the currency.What now?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Throwaway for obvious reasons.I interviewed at signal a while back, and none of their recent mishaps surprise me. At first, they had me talk to Brian Acton on the phone for about an hour, who seemed to think I was already getting an offer, and he was there to sell me on it. He was cool to talk to, so I didn&#39;t mind, but I was surprised at this level of confusion for a company that small.Next, I was given a lengthy take home project (which I was warned not to do in a language other than Java, because Moxie would reject candidates if they didn&#39;t pick a language he liked). After I finished it, they disappeared for a month.Apparently I passed. They said I was basically the only one out of 200 people they sent it to that did pass. I assumed this meant I would be getting an offer, but they then wanted me to do a full onsite. The &#34;onsite&#34; weirdly consisted of another take home, but shorter, and a live interview. After not hearing back again for a while, I got an email titled: &#34;Hello from Signal!&#34;. Great! I opened it, excited: it was a rejection.I tried to get feedback on why I was rejected but never heard back. The best thing I can come up with: in the system design interview, as a solution to a postgres node being overloaded, I didn&#39;t come up with the solution of having a SPOF redis node with a full key scan every 10 minutes acting as an intermediate data store before transferring to postgres. I was told this is how they actually do things.Take this with a grain of salt, since I&#39;m obviously still irked by the experience, but it&#39;s all true."</p>

Being able to take my laptop and go sit under a canopy in my back yard when the weather is nice, seeing my rabbits hopping around the yard, my cats avoiding the aggressive she-rabbit, hearing the birds, etc., while working, is just about as happy as I can be while also working on stuff that doesn&#39;t really matter much.As I begin to form my own company, one of my priorities is to allow my employees to have at least some of their time completely at their own discretion.  They choose when and where they work as long as they can attend some important anchor meetings (and obviously be productive).  And for the social aspect, weekend or week-long dev retreats are ideal.  4 hours of intense serious work, plus a couple of hours of colleague social interaction, and the rest left to the individual to spend however they like, is the kind of situation I would have not even been able to dream of when I was younger.And from a bean-counter owner perspective, do not underestimate the employee loyalty and overachievement motivation you can get by giving some nice free trips, nice free food, and quality equipment.Big companies lack this freedom to treat their creative talent not because they cannot afford it but because the people in charge tend to not be creative thinkers.  This is why most interesting things happen in smaller companies (and ultimately tend to get bought by the laggard big companies)."</p>

Most of what he describes are not normal office problems. Some of them are even health and safety violations. Working from home will only distance him from those problems, but it can’t fix an inherently broken company that doesn’t care about employees. He should be searching for another remote job ASAP"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been programming for a long, long time. Went to college for it when I was a pre-teen. The more and more I code the more I see it closer to something like music than something like engineering. Getting a little garage band together isn&#39;t hard. A couple years of practice and you and your friends can play at a little bar or at least at a high school shindig.The same is more or less true for programming. A simple stack of JS, HTML, and CSS is pretty easy to get going. And if you&#39;re content to make marketing sites for advertising companies or similar, then go nuts. That&#39;s your simple jam and you rock out on it as much as you like.Other people want to learn violin or weird keys or timings or cross rhythm. They want to woodshed some African drums and mix them into complex arrangements. And you know what? It is harder than playing a simple guitar for a simple song.We have the same thing with software, and once you&#39;ve put in the years you find a sort of series of specializations that make you stand out a bit more and get you a bit more money.So when people say &#34;programming is easy&#34; what they really mean is that it&#39;s easier than most people expect it will be for the financial incentives it provides. Compared to, say, structural engineering which takes four years of focussed study then a long period of practical understudy, software is easy and it pays more. Almost any structural engineer can become a data analyst or junior data scientist and make around double the salary within a year or two.Yes we&#39;ve all had the frustrating semicolon days, but there are highlights too. Fast feedback, ease of learning new technologies, ease of scaling to millions of customers. There are many advantages and I think they make up for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I said that the programming field is a fertile ground for beginners, and it is. But what’s fertile for grain is fertile for weeds too, even moreso. And we need to talk about these people, taking advantage of the fertile ground.Yikes. What a gross, self-congratulatory rant. The author tries to defend against the term &#34;gatekeeping&#34; by getting out ahead of it, but that doesn&#39;t change how deeply exclusionary the result is.It doesn&#39;t even stick to a specific complaint; it jumps around to different things that emotionally feel related in the author&#39;s mind but aren&#39;t actually. First we&#39;re talking about boot camps, then we&#39;re talking about how StackOverflow is &#34;the scariest thing that happened to the programming community in the past 10 years&#34;, then we&#39;re talking about &#34;diversity&#34; speakers at conferences riling up &#34;mobs&#34; in some kind of conspiracy against the author and people like him?Buried under all of this (literally, at the very end) is perhaps a poorly-executed attempt to tell beginners something of value, that it may not be easy now, but you can push through and it will get better. But I don&#39;t see any actual beginner reaching that part before getting discouraged by the rest into doubting whether they should be in this career field at all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why is this always discussed only in relation to programming? Is being a doctor hard? How about an architect? Lawyer? Welder? Car mechanic? Airline pilot? Are they all gatekeepers if they say their job is hard?There are different jobs labeled as programming, some easier, some harder.Where does this narrative come from that programming at all professional levels must be easy for everyone, else you are a gatekeeper? Is it anxiety about future automation and the idea that the only remaining jobs will be programming?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The comment from the article echos my own sentiments:&gt; Speaking solely as a person who is really into encrypted messaging, it terrifies me that they&#39;re going to take this really clean story of an encrypted messenger and mix it up with the nightmare of laws and regulations and vulnerability that is cryptocurrency.Moreover, there are three other points I&#39;d add:1. I don&#39;t like &#34;do everything&#34; apps like WeChat or Line. One of Signals strengths was UX that focused on it&#39;s core competency. Early in Signal&#39;s development they would add privacy features. Lately they have been adding social features. This, however, feels especially out of left field and likely to hurt the UX.2. This smells like dev resources will be spent building and maintaining something not related to messaging.3. I&#39;ve always had a &#34;don&#39;t let perfect be the enemy of good&#34; rationalization that gives Signal autonomy to grow a privacy centric messaging app despite the deficits (e.g lack of federation). In contrast, I personally associate &#34;crypto&#34; with &#34;scam&#34;. There have been so many shady ICOs and pump-dump schemes around crypto. This will taint the product for those of us who don&#39;t think of crypto currency as being anything more than pump-and-dump schemes and a way to buy dab rigs online."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are 250 million units of mobilecoin, and majority of them are owned by the founders. Only 37.5 million have been distributed. With current price ($65), they&#39;re worth $14B already. This makes the project a scam and impossible for it to work as a reliable money that holds value. Bitcoin had no pre-mine and has been fairly distributed from the start."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Long-time Signal user here, with a number of technical and non-technical friends, colleagues and acquaintances who also use it. I don&#39;t know who was asking for this. And I think it really dilutes Signal&#39;s message.I believe that everyone has a fundamental right to secure, private communication. Some people may hold the same belief for the right to transfer funds. I don&#39;t agree and I suspect many others feel the same. That tension alone makes this look like a bad decision to me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem I have always had when building elaborate home server setups is the &#34;set it and forget it&#34; nature of the systems I&#39;ve installed bites me in the ass.  Since it&#39;s not my full-time job to manage these systems, I&#39;m really not familiar with them the way I might be with the systems I manage at work.  These systems cruise along for years, and when something finally does go belly-up, I can&#39;t remember how I set it up in the first place.  Now I have a giant chore looming over me, ruining a perfectly good weekend.These days, I design everything for home with extreme simplicity coupled with detailed documentation on how I set things up.Docker has helped tremendously, since you can essentially use an out-of-the-box Linux distro with docker installed, and you don&#39;t really have to install anything else on the hardware.  Then if at all possible, I use standard docker images provided by the software developer with no modifications (maybe some small tweaks in a docker-compose file to map to local resources).Anyway, my advice is to keep the number of customizations to a bare minimum, minimize the number of moving parts in your home solutions, document everything you do (starting with installing the OS all the way through configuring your applications), capture as much of the configuration as you can in declarative formats (like docker compose files), back up all your data, and just as importantly, back up every single configuration file."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The diagram alone is more than enough of an argument to dissuade me from giving this a shot right now - it&#39;s simply too complicated and too much to manage for the amount of time I can dedicate to it.BUT - I&#39;m really thankful for people who keep posting and sharing these sorts of projects; they&#39;re the ones iterating the process for the rest of us who need something a bit more turn-key.I&#39;m excited to see this eventually result in something like the following:- Standard / Easy to update containerized setup.- Out of the box multi-location syncs (e.g. home, VPS, etc.)- Takes 5 minutes to configure/add new locationsI want this to be as easy as adding a new AP to my mesh wifi system at home: plug it in, open the app, name the AP, and click &#34;Done&#34;.(Edit - formatting)"</p>

1) Duck out isn’t a thing, just stop it.
2) Half the articles cited as examples of corporate abuse were later revealed to be mistakes by the user or easily avoidable pitfalls.
3) Self hosting still requires trust (software you’re running, DNS, domains, ISP, etc...) The line of who to trust and how far is a tough one to answer, even for the informed.How I solved it:
1) I use well vetted cloud services for things that are difficult/impossible to self host or have a low impact if lost. (Email, domains, github, etc...)
2) I self host things that are absolutely critical with cloud backups. (Files, Photos, code, notes, etc..)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; What is ThreadSanitizer?  ThreadSanitizer (TSan) is compile-time instrumentation to detect data races according to the C/C++ memory model on Linux. It is important to note that these data races are considered undefined behavior within the C/C++ specification.TSan, ASan, UBSan - if you are writing code and your toolchain supports these, you should use them.  Over the past 6-7+ years I&#39;ve used them, I have never seen a false positive (I&#39;m sure some have occasionally existed but they seem rare in practice).&gt; However, developers claimed on various occasions that a particular report must be a false positive. In all of these cases, it turned out that TSan was indeed right and the problem was just very subtle and hard to understand.Yes, I have seen this phenomenon!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two pieces of information that I found interesting:* Rust had poor support for sanitizers (&#34;Rust, which has much less mature support for sanitizers)&#34;. Work was done to improve this, but it&#39;s not clear how well it works now - it would be worth a blog post in itself IMO. This was surprising, because at least I assumed that it works flawlessly thanks to clang.* Rust / C++ bridges are predictably problematic and weaken Rust&#39;s guarantees (&#34;races in C++ code being obfuscated by passing through Rust&#34;). 
This is the problem to solve for most companies working in a traditionally C and C++ oriented domain, as the C* code will dwarf the Rust code. Because of the shared memory space any problems in that code will be just as critical as if the entire code was unsafe. It would be quite awesome if Rust were able to isolate unsafe code not just at compile time, but also at runtime, by e.g. offering the option of executing the unsafe code in a separate address space. This would require some manual work for moving the data back and forth, but it could offer the tools to support such a work mode e.g. unsafe blocks could take parameters.I wish Mozilla would be more transparent about the absolutely normal and typical difficulties they must be encountering in a mixed code base. I have the feeling that there&#39;s plenty of them, but they don&#39;t want to emphasise them in order not to discourage Rust adoption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Overall Rust appears to be fulfilling one of its original design goals: allowing us to write more concurrent code safely. Both WebRender and Stylo are very large and pervasively multi-threaded, but have had minimal threading issues. What issues we did find were mistakes in the implementations of low-level and explicitly unsafe multithreading abstractions — and those mistakes were simple to fix.&gt; This is in contrast to many of our C++ races, which often involved things being randomly accessed on different threads with unclear semantics, necessitating non-trivial refactorings of the code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"While the result is a big relief, I think it&#39;s not as decisive as I&#39;m noticing some headlines (and commenters) are claiming.One of the big open questions is &#34;are APIs copyrightable?&#34; The court skirted that question, and instead focused on whether it was fair use:&gt; To decide no more than is necessary to resolve this case, the Court assumes for argument’s sake that the copied lines can be copyrighted, and focuses on whether Google’s use of those lines was a “fair use.”That said, this case does establish a precedent that if your copying of an API is primarily for purposes of matching an interface so that developers can reimplement it, you&#39;re in fair use territory:&gt; Google copied these lines not because of their creativity or beauty but because they would allow programmers to bring their skills to a new smartphone computing environment.I&#39;ll count that as a win, on balance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;Google  copied  approximately  11,500 lines of declaring  code from the API,  which amounts to virtually all the declaring  code needed to call up hundreds  of different tasks.   Those 11,500  lines, however, are only  0.4 percent of the entire  API at issue, which consists  of 2.86 million total lines.  In considering “the amount and substantiality of the portion  used” in  this case, the 11,500 lines of code should be viewed as one small part of the  considerably  greater whole.   As  part of an interface, the copied lines of code are inextricably bound to  other lines of code that  are  accessed by  programmers.   Google copied  these lines not because of their creativity or  beauty  but because they would allow programmers  to bring  their  skills to a new smartphone computing  environment.&#34;Sanity prevailed! This judgment could have had devastating consequences and turned software development into a copyright nightmare."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very sad. I found the perfect smartphone for me - the V20. It almost feels like a smartphone that happened by accident and will never return in its glorious form again. Dont know what else to use if it dies. Already have a spare Screen and its 4th Battery ready to be used.The second screen is just the perfect solution for having an allways on display without a real (and stupid) notch. I love this feature. Also knock to power on is super convenient. Battery is replacable. The Screen is super sharp. Its thin despite its very accessible inner parts. The amp and music quality is absolutely awesome. The camera is awesome as is the sound recording quality. The IR Blaster ist just super convenient. Also the FM-Radio is a very nice addition. The camera-app is just awesome and i have yet not managed to find something simmilar. Also i like the gallery app. And the sound recording app. Its also fast, has enough power still to this day. And the SD-Card Slot combined with the internal memory gives me 640GB Storage. Also Dual SIM is nice.Really it is such an awesome phone that im not sure how this phone happened in the first place. As each Smartphone does at least 2 things stupid or hase some dumb features no one asked for.Its allways the same with me - as soon as i find the absolute perfect hardware - its already legacy and nothing like it is buyable in the future ...The V20 is like the perfect tool. No stupid features only used for sales, no shortcuts, just a very nice package. Two things i would change: Cameras should never stick out and the volume buttons should be on the back like on the G4."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve appreciated LG&#39;s adventurous moves. The one I liked the most was LG Optimus 3D, which provided a naked-eye 3D display similar to that of Nintendo 3DS. The most recent LG Wing, I was hopeful.But LG also left a bad taste in my mouth. The last LG phone I used, Nexus 5X, died all of a sudden, but after months of despair, I could revive it using a freaking hair dryer.[1] Yeah, some of you who are well versed to soldering may not be surprised by this, but the fact that such a huge company makes such a minor mistake completely turned me down. My reaction might be irrational, but after the incident I could not get close to newer LG phones anymore.[1] https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/66wsvq/this_might_..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find most sad about this is that LG appears to be the only manufacturer who makes phones with both wireless charging and a headphone jack. Somehow these features seem to contradict themselfs for other manufacturers. Wireless charging is seen as a premium feature, while headphone jack is seen as a budget feature. I unfortunately have gotten so used to both that I don&#39;t want to give them up. I love my wired headphones and my phone is pretty much always at 80% (Battery limiter) since it always charges when I&#39;m at my desk. Right now I don&#39;t see a reason to upgrade my V30 but when that time comes I hope someone makes a similar phone (my biggest hope is Sony as they at least appear to be interested in headphones, now they just need to add wireless charging)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The reason why the Economist articles all read the same is that they go through a process called &#34;subbing&#34; or sub-editing by the same small group of editors who own the Economist&#39;s &#34;voice&#34;.I interned at the Economist one summer in college and wrote two articles for it - the published articles bore a small relationship to what I had submitted. The sub-editors seemed to be mostly George Smiley-type Oxford and Cambridge PhD&#39;s of a certain age with an eclectic range of expertises, as far as I recall."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In high school, there were two magazines I’d read regularly: The Atlantic had an absurdly inexpensive subscription price (I think it was $14 for 2 years at the time) and The Economist was...not inexpensive, so I’d just pick up a copy when I was fortunate enough to visit a bookstore that carried it.The Economist was the only magazine in my life I would regularly read cover to cover. Every article revealed something I didn’t know about the world, or about my own country, and the information was dense. Most articles were just a few paragraphs, so I didn’t have time to get bored before I’d move on to the next one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I respect the writing in the Economist. It&#39;s kept to a high standard and they put their cases well with evidence as the article here highlights. Even the times I don&#39;t agree with their position, I still respect it.I wonder how much it helps that their writers are anonymous and therefore less likely to go on personal flights of fancy or building an argumentative approach. It is perhaps puts the individual writer on the backfoot but makes the quality of the publication higher. Personally I think other sources would do well to consider this - frankly I would rather be a fan of an idea than a writer: the former seems reasonable the latter likely to vere into pointless worship. Plus it&#39;s much easier to switch to new ideas if they&#39;re superceded by better ones in due course."</p>

I’d be fine if they stopped at the scenery, but this quote is just outright misleading and makes it look like a paid hype piece:&gt; “All aircraft have been reviewed with professional pilots who have many hours flying these aircraft or test pilots from the manufacturers to make sure they are controlled exactly like they should.” … In other words, when sim-pilots try to yank-and-bank an A320, they will get the exact same response as if they were flying the real thing.For contrast read some takes by professional pilots, here’s one[0]:&gt; I’ll confess that I don’t know that type of modelling FS2020 is using. But given how it feels, and how it’s the child of FSX, I’m inclined to think it’s using a lookup table. This isn’t necessarily a problem — a good lookup table with many data points could be just as good, if not better than, a blade-element model. Unfortunately, FS2020 doesn’t seem to have a good lookup table. The the linear behaviour unrealistic and the non-linear modelling is terrible.&gt; Maneuvering is laughably easy — and not because the aircraft handles nicely. It’s easy because the aircraft feels like it has no inertia. Yes, the real plane is very maneuverable and responsive, but there’s a “weight” to direction changes which is completely missing. In FS2020, you can instantly pull 60 degree or more turns, and exit them just as quickly. In XP11, there’s a residual tendency to turn that you have to arrest when exiting a maneuver.If you care about how the world looks, get MSFS. If you care about the physics of flying, get X-Plane—it’s an excellent project developed by a smaller company and sold for a fraction of the cost of Microsoft’s product. XP strives to provide the actual fine-grained simulation of flight surface behavior based on weight, shape, etc. (Yes, this means your computer will spend most of its resources simulating rather than painting a pretty picture.)If I had to draw a parallel, X-Plane is more or less the iRacing of flight sims, while MSFS2020 is closer to something like F1 2019.[0] https://medium.com/swlh/microsoft-flight-simulator-2020-no-c...Bias statement: I own a copy of XP11, otherwise not affiliated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Netflix recorded a worldwide income tax accounting expense of about 13.7% last year ($438M on $3.2B of Net Income). It also paid cash taxes of $292M (cash taxes differ from accounting taxes because of timing issues - just like revenue is not the same as cash-in).A lot of growing companies have US taxes that are quite low because they lose money for a long time while they&#39;re investing in growth. When they finally become profitable, they&#39;re allowed to roll forward those losses (within limits) to offset their profits. That&#39;s where a lot of these &#34;Zero taxes paid&#34; headlines come from.On the other hand there is a legitimate gripe about using IP offshoring to shift profits to low-tax countries and out of the US, using accelerated depreciation to decrease current year profits, allowing tax deductibility of interest and lots and lots of tax deferrals and deductions for property transactions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is crazy how economy is tilted in favour of these big corporations. If you are a worker, it is not uncommon to pay over 40% of tax and if you work on your own small business you can pay even more and have very little left to reinvest. Then you have progressive tax that is preventing you from saving much - if you want to save for a deposit to buy a house, spend time on education and getting a better job, you&#39;ll get hit by much higher tax and it will take ages to save anything. Such taxes are often sold to the public as taxes on the rich, but rich people can easily afford ways around it. 
I&#39;ll vote for any party that will reshuffle the tax system, so that big corporations will have to pay tax just as any other business and tax progression will be removed, so that people will have a chance of levelling up.
They should also add a tax on spending money with offshore cards, dividends and so on so that the rich will pay what they are supposed to pay."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Among the mechanisms Netflix is using to achieve its next-to-nothing tax liability are accelerated depreciation (which appears to have cut the company’s tax expense by $148 million); deductions for stock options for Netflix executives and other employees ($339 million); and research and development tax credits ($113 million).These are straightforward deductions."</p>

So, while it&#39;s correct to say that it listens to TCP port 5432, there is a very narrow limit to whom it&#39;s listening for. Namely, the same machine.Postgres is pretty secure by default. It doesn&#39;t allow external connections. It also requires a username and password to connect with permissions on the database you&#39;re connecting to.Compare that to something like redis. They at least used to listen for connections external by default and not even have a password to connect.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I personally secure my postgres instances by putting them in a silod vpc without internet access. I then limit incoming connections to only be allowed from the separate vpc containing the application serverI then use a bastion host when I need to access ssh on the instance. The bastion host remains off and inaccessible except for when I need to perform maintenance.The advantages of this is that there is no &#34;always-open&#34; access to the instance.Not sure why the author does not advocate this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Link with a bit more actual information: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanmic/article/PIIS2666-5...As far as I can tell, what&#39;s going on here is that there are multiple stages of antibody development.  People have circulating B cells, and these cells have their genomes modified by the the VD(J) recombination process [0] from the  genome in the human germline (i.e. what your germline cells and most of the non-B cells in your body have).  There are a large number, but nowhere near infinite number, of B cells and corresponding antibodies that can be produced in this process, and I think these are what the authors call &#34;germline&#34; cells.Once a naive B cell decides that it encodes a useful antibody (which is a complicated process), it starts to divide.  Some of the daughter cells further mutate in a process called affinity maturation [1] to produce what are hopefully even better antibodies.I think that the idea behind this research is that there are certain antibodies that can be produced by affinity maturation that are very useful against HIV, but that the &#34;germline&#34; B cells that lead to these antibodies are not particularly likely to be selected by the immune system when exposed to natural HIV antigens.  Instead, the researchers have developed customized antigens intended to target specific germline cells which are known to be able to mature into cells that can produce the desired antibodies.  If this works, the next step would be a series of additional vaccines (which are not the same as dose 1) that will try to encourage maturation into the useful antibodies.The takeaway is that this result is very promising and that there is (so far?) no reason to expect the trial participants to be immune to HIV.For the ML crowd, another way to think about this is that, when your body is exposed to an antigen, it runs a massively parallel search algorithm to find good antibodies in a truly massive space of possible antibodies.  Unfortunately, most people, when exposed to real HIV or to prior vaccine attempts, get stuck in a bunch of not-fantastic local minima.  The idea is to specifically aim the search in the right direction so, after a few rounds, it can find a better solution.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V(D)J_recombination[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affinity_maturation"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interested to hear from people in the know: how good does this look?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From NPR interviews I listened to during the early days of the mRNA vaccines showing incredible promise, I understood that one of the problems with HIV is that the human body does not naturally have strong defense mechanisms (antibodies, etc) for this type of virus.  Hence, the usual vaccine path (or mRNA derived method) of accelerating the learning of the body&#39;s T-cells, etc. to manufacture its own defenses is not very effective -- they are not there to begin with.Is that not correct?  What are they doing differently here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is something really pleasing about reading PDFs. It’s perhaps how static it is and it won’t change on me. I can zoom in or “operate” on it without some reorganization. It puts the mind to ease. There is no reflowing. There is no columns shifting. It’s just is. Like a piece of paper as an analog - the intent of the author and the designer is retained and frozen in time. Fonts are embedded and chosen by the creator. Haters of PDFs do not understand the human aspects of it - they just see it as a specification (which is convoluted)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love &#34;printing&#34; webpages to PDF files. I&#39;ve been doing this for more than 15 years. I delete most of the images first so that I end up with files of 50-500KB. I then store said file in appropriate labeled directories.Now 15 years later I have a private stash of websites and wikipedia articles that I can consult by simply pressing command+spacebar (the files are indexed in MacOS search).To make a PDF file out of a website I currently use Printfriendly.com, but it wasn&#39;t always this way.Back in the days I loved to use Arc90&#39;s Readability (a firefox extension). I don&#39;t know what happend to that extension though, there are plenty of old HN articles about that Wonderfull plug-in though:Post from 2010, probably I started using it right after finding this post...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What upsets and concerns me the most is when I see poorly developed SPA on really important sites.  For example, government service application websites.  If reddit or nytimes has a bloated, intermittently failing SPA site, that&#39;s an annoyance.  When it&#39;s a form to apply for unemployment, ACA health care, DMV, or other critical services, it&#39;s a critical failure.  Especially since these services are most often used by exactly the population most impacted by bloated SPA (they tend to have slow or unreliable internet and slow computers, maybe even a cheap android phone is all they have).Such sites should be using minimal or no JS.  These aren&#39;t meant to be pretty interactive sites, they need to be solid bulletproof sites so people can get critical services.  And I haven&#39;t even mentioned how SPA sites often lack any accessibility features (which is so much easier to implement if sticking to standard HTML+CSS and no/minimal JS)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d like to add a bit more nuance. Modern frontend development provides many opportunities for failure. These failures often make their way into production. I, personally, get great results with modern FE development. My users are happy. I am happy. It&#39;s all very successful. All the defenders of modern FE development will likely chime in with the same sentiment. I also get great results with C, which arguably provides even more catastrophic opportunities for failure. I wouldn&#39;t say &#34;C is a failure&#34;, but I absolutely hate working in C, and I&#39;m glad we&#39;ve made improvements to systems programming. I think the point I&#39;m moving toward is that we absolutely should strive to make better tools for delivering web content, but the reasons for failure are far more complex than the tooling itself. So, let&#39;s not frame things in black and white and call something that&#39;s been used with large amounts of success a failure. That&#39;s not very productive and is just flame bait. The real question is, &#34;What&#39;s next?&#34;, how are we going to improve the current situation?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regardless of my tweet, that is a personal opinion based on my feelings, background and experiences, the discussions in the replies are interesting from the POV of understanding what different people think in the programming community. Some will say that critiques are only from old people, in the style &#34;when I was young we had only zeroes! You now have ones and zeroes&#34;. Others say that the web is slow because of ADs and trackers and modern frameworks would otherwise be fast. There is who believes that the problem comes from big companies imposing new standards in order to turn the web into the new Java applets (a full fledged application platform), and so forth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You get great insight into the character of the leaders of a company watching how breaches are handled.  Companies that put the customer first are transparent, and quickly take action (even if painful to customers) to ensure that customers’ data and systems stay intact and confidential.  Companies that try to gloss over, hide or downplay things indicate that the leadership does not respect their customers and is only interested in maximizing profit/minimizing loss."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“Sick building syndrome” is a difficult topic to discuss because it’s very difficult to prove a connection between the vague symptoms and the building. In many cases, only a single person seems susceptible to the claimed building issues. In this case, the apartment complex appears to have over 1,800 units, which makes it surprising that only a single person is experiencing such dramatic effects.Unfortunately, doubting these people’s stories is taboo online so I’m going to tread carefully. However, when only 1 unit out of 1800 apartments (presumably 2000-3000 total residents considering multi-bedroom units) is experiencing severe and dramatic symptoms, my first guess would not be the soil under the foundation. I would be looking for building materials or chemical spills in that specific apartment unit.Also, I’m not suggesting that we discount this person’s story. Their symptoms are certainly very real in that they are suffering, but the selfie of the person wearing medical equipment in front of a mirror combined with measurements from consumer devices as evidence should be approached with caution. There is a relatively new phenomenon casually known as Munchausen by Internet where some patients are drawn to the increasing attention they can garner by sharing, and unfortunately exaggerating, their stories on the internet. These patients often post selfies of themselves wearing medical equipment, in doctor’s offices, or in hospital beds. More commonly, typical patients prefer not to be photographed with medical equipment or in medical facilities.  Again, I’m not suggesting we disbelieve this person, but it’s important that we consider the bigger picture (1800 unit apartment complex, apparently only one case of severe symptoms?) before accepting a single person’s analysis of what is causing her issues.Mistaken “sick building syndrome” diagnoses can actually be very detrimental to patients who mistake other illnesses as being caused by their buildings, as they hyperfocus on their presumed explanation to the exclusion of following more typical diagnostic work ups that would help them eliminate more common explanations for those symptoms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some years back I signed a lease in a luxury apartment hi-rise in downtown Chicago. The complex had been an add-on to an existing shopping center and mall. Long story short, the apartment smelled like old grease and trash often, and I could never trace the exact source as it would come and go.
No matter how many air filtration units I installed, or odor absorbing devices, the odors would still collect and infiltrate my clothing and furniture. Again, it wasn&#39;t constant but regular enough for me not to stay there very often.I ended up caulking the entire apartment with clear caulk and sealing any air gaps. Because the hi-rise was pressurized like most hi-rises, I concluded somehow this was drawing up smells from grease traps etc. Of course I could never prove it.My conclusion is that most of these buildings are so cheaply and poorly made that I will never again rent a unit like this. Too bad I spent 30k on the lease and hardly ever stayed there.  So the woman&#39;s experience seems pretty plausible to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most people here seem concerned about vocs. Plastics, carpets, sofas, paints, air fresheners and a ton of other typical household items produce them.I feel like the author is really jumping the gun here in identifying the source of pollutants by not seeking to consider the fact that new apartments are loaded with freshly off-gassing materials.The other thing that should have been mentioned is more about their vitals prior to moving in. How confident was she in her baseline because it could be a preexisting condition that became very exacerbated.Edit: But that said, my opinion of the Irvine company is extremely low. I’d not be the least bit surprised if they willfully cut every corner they could. Either with remediation or materials in the apartment. And pollutants do pool overnight but near freeways they are typically the worst in the dawn hours. There would be less air exchange in the apartment, leading to a buildup from an external or internal source."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve never been an FB &#34;person&#34;, but maybe 6-7 years ago the local running club moved to scheduling everything on FB.  For a while, the page was &#34;public&#34;, but then you had to have an account (which required a phone number) to see anything other than the club&#39;s &#34;landing page&#34;.  So I ended up making an FB account which I&#39;ve only ever used to be able to see the club pages (I haven&#39;t ever posted anything!) -- dumb of me I know, but FB had almost become a requirement to participate in life.However recently, I&#39;ve noticed that I now get a couple of junk text every day or two whereas up until a few weeks ago, I don&#39;t think I&#39;d ever had a single junk text.I wonder if this is why."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a good discussion on this by Troy Hunt[1].&gt; But for spam based on using phone number alone, it&#39;s gold. Not just SMS, there are heaps of services that just require a phone number these days and now there&#39;s hundreds of millions of them conveniently categorised by country with nice mail merge fields like name and gender.[2]&gt; Another general observation on this incident: I&#39;m seeing extensive sharing of the data, both the entire corpus of countries and individual country files. Not just in hacking circles, but very broadly on social media too. This data is everywhere already.[3]&gt; New breach: Facebook had 2.5M addresses exposed in an incident that impacted 533M subscribers&#39; phone numbers. Most records contained name and gender, many also included DoB, location, relationship status and employer. 65% were already in @haveibeenpwned[4]&gt; If we look at the data, email is rare, DoB is rare so the greatest impact here is the phone numbers. Even though it’s “only” 20% of FB users, the number is obviously substantial thus so is the impact[5][1]: https://twitter.com/troyhunt[2]: https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378485999781613569[3]: https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378513457209696256[4]: https://twitter.com/haveibeenpwned/status/137855490210063565...[5]: https://twitter.com/troyhunt/status/1378474534760685568"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, I&#39;m the tech lead of Cloudflare Workers.This article contains several misunderstandings.If a Cloudflare customer has configured their origin server to respond only to Cloudflare IPs, then they MUST also verify that the &#34;Host&#34; header on any request actually matches their domain name. If they do not verify the Host header, then anyone can sign up for Cloudflare and simply configure their DNS to point to the victim&#39;s origin IP address, and requests will be routed there -- but will have the attacker&#39;s domain in the Host header. Workers is not needed for such an attack. This attack has always been possible and is common to basically all CDNs. Fundamentally, the CDN has no way of knowing if the origin server that a user has configured really belongs to them -- the CDN can only tell the origin (via the Host header) what customer it thinks it is serving, and expect the origin not to accept requests that were on behalf of a different customer.Instead of IP-based authentication, we strongly recommend using mTLS-based authenticated origin pulls (with a zone-specific key pair) or Argo Tunnel, as these methods are much more secure.As long as the origin server is verifying via one of the above means (IP+host header, AOP, or Argo Tunnel) that the request was processed by Cloudflare on behalf of the customer&#39;s zone, then the attack described in the article doesn&#39;t accomplish anything. If a Worker makes a request to a hostname that is on Cloudflare, then all of the target host&#39;s Cloudflare security settings will apply to that request the same as if the request came from an external client.Additionally, as mentioned in the article, any requests coming from a Worker will have the CF-Worker header identifying the zone which sent the request. If a customer suspects abusive requests coming from Workers, they should report it to us.~~The article claims that the X-Forwarded-For header can be forged, but this is not true if the target host is itself a Cloudflare customer.~~EDIT: What I said about X-Forwarded-For seems to be incorrect. CF-Connecting-IP has always been the header we use to identify the client IP, and it cannot be forged. X-Forwarded-For seems to have more complicated and subtle behavior that I&#39;m not familiar with. I&#39;m investigating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a nice trick, with some automation you should be able to register new domain names and Cloudflare accounts to get past the 100k limit as well.Cloudflare&#39;s anti bot tooling is terribly annoying while using Tor. I understand why they do it, though. Using Tor is a good way to show how terrifyingly much control Cloudflare has over the internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; As you can see, X-FORWARDED-FOR can be set to an arbitrary value, so you can bypass IP limitation requests during scrapping or more dangerous IP verification during a login procedure … The origin IP is not forwarded to the website, so the only way to block this kind of request on your server is to filter on CF-WORKER header.X-Forwarded-For should always be treated as forged at least for security purposes (except the hops set by reverse proxies under your control). If you do IP whitelisting based on untrusted X-Forwarded-For you’re doing it terribly wrong."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I mean, at this point I think everyone should just accept that at the very least their name, age, address(es), email(s), phone number(s) and screen name(s) have been fully leaked if you have ever had any kind of online presence. Not saying that&#39;s right or good, but at this point it&#39;s just a fact.So if that&#39;s the case, I think we should move beyond really even trying to think of this info as private or a marker of identity, and we need to move everyone to more secure forms of identity verification.As has been pointed out on HN before, &#34;identity theft&#34; is a made-up concept to make it seem as if you had something stolen from you, when the real problem is banks and other service providers do an absolute shit job of identity verification. They&#39;re the ones at fault, and they try to shift the onus onto you to fix things when they screw up.Indeed, a social security number is pretty much the only additional piece of data to the stuff above that one would need to open up a bank account in someone else&#39;s name, and those have been leaked plenty of times too.The government needs to make harsher penalties for banks and others that can ruin your credit, etc. because they accept all this leaked info as &#34;proof&#34; of identity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We should start thinking of these breaches in terms of their accumulated impact. It&#39;s not the 1990s anymore, where data is difficult to store and networking too slow to move it.We should assume the leaked data doesn&#39;t go away; that instead people out there are consolidating Equifax data with Vastaamo data, adding data from Exchange hacks and the Accellion hack, to cross-reference with data from Facebook... it&#39;s like water flooding a levee now, instead of evaporating.Not the first time I&#39;ve harped here about this (ie: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26604753, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24586258), but I hope we start planning for that kind of future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The root of the problem is not the privacy policy or the system security.  The root of the problem is the collection itself.  All large businesses, health care providers, and governments maintain databases.  Every one of them will eventually be leaked.  All it takes is a corruptible trusted insider."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The world desperately needs a replacement for YAML.TOML is fine for configuration, but not an adequate solution for representing arbitrary data.JSON is a fine data exchange format, but is not particularly human-friendly, and is especially poor for editable content: Lacks comments, multi-line strings, is far too strict about unimportant syntax, etc.Jsonnet (a derivative of Google&#39;s internal configuration language) is very good, but has failed to reach widespread adoption.Cue is a newer Jsonnet-inspired language that ticks a lot of boxes for me (strict, schema support, human-readable, compact), but has not seen wide adoption.Protobuf has a JSON-like text format that&#39;s friendlier, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s widely adopted, and as I recall, it inherits a lot of Protobufisms.Dhall is interesting, but a bit too complex to replace YAML.Starlark is a neat language, but has the same problem as Dhall. It&#39;s essentially a stripped-down Python.Amazon Ion [1] is neat, but I&#39;ve not seen any adoption outside of AWS.NestedText [2] looks promising, but it&#39;s just a Python library.StrictYAML [3] is a nice attempt at cleaning up YAML. But we need a new language with wide adoption across many popular languages, and this is Python only.Any others?[1] https://amzn.github.io/ion-docs/[2] https://nestedtext.org/[3] https://github.com/crdoconnor/strictyaml/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"YAML had a worse example, once.For the ease of entering time units YAML 1.1 parsed any set of two digits, separated by colons, as a number in sexagesimal (base 60). So 1:11:00 would parse to the integer 4260, as in 1 hour and 11 minutes equals 4260 seconds.Now try plugging MAC addresses into that parser.The most annoying part is that the MAC addresses would only be mis-parsed if there were no hex digits in the string. Like the bug in this post, it could only be reproduced with specific values.Generally, if you&#39;re doing implicit typing, you need to keep the number of cases as low as possible, and preferably error out in case of ambiguity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is important to keep in mind when you read articles and/or studies about how electric cars or wind or solar power is impractical. A lot of the data these studies use is just obsolete.Say you have an opinion piece in a news paper that says that electric cars will always be expensive toys for the rich. It relies on a scientific paper published in a technical journal 2 years ago. The scientific paper does not perform original research but relies on a study published 2 years ago, which study relies on official data reported by companies six months before publication.Perhaps nobody in this propagation chain meant to mislead. But in the end they are using old data that assumes that battery costs are five times what they are in reality and twenty times what they will be in the near future (for example) and draws all the wrong conclusions.Similar things are happening with articles and public comments about renewable energy. There are numerous arguments about how we will always need coal power or nuclear power, or natural gas and they all base it on old studies with obsolete high costs of batteries. These articles commit a further error by also neglecting the every decreasing costs of solar and wind power. These articles are even more egregious because while a car lasts only 10-15 years a power plant is supposed to last at least 30 (for coal or gas) and up to 60 (for nuclear). Furthermore, nuclear plants take 5 to 10 years to even build. In those years the costs of batteries and renewables will only go down further.In the financial press there were many articles about how Tesla will never be profitable, how it is an extravagant way for shareholders to subsidize luxury car buyers, how it will always rely on government subsidies and will need more of them, etc. Well, guess what the federal tax credit expired and lo and behold tesla is profitable.They weren&#39;t necessarily lying. But they were using automotive industry assumptions, and the auto industry with their internal combustion engines is a mature industry with few opportunities for cost reductions. But as far as batteries and electric motors and power semiconductors go ... well we are just getting started on them and hopefully we will have many opportunities for cost reductions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s remarkable what energy dense batteries have enabled. Drones and the entire quadcopter scene wouldn’t be possible without them.Some maneuvers made on a 5” quad can pull more than 100 amps on a 6S, 22V battery. That is around 2,200 watts—more than most consumer microwave ovens! The fact that a battery weighing no more than half a kilogram can supply this much power almost instantly is truly remarkable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI, the cost of individual cells has long, long gone below $100 per kWh in wholesale volumes.And believe the cost of a pack itself is very quickly approaching $100/kWh as well if not crossed it already.Making batteries is still a rather profitable business with double digit margins, it&#39;s just latest equipment, and cathode materials became way more expensive, and hard to get than what small battery makers can afford.Despite China dominating the metallic cobalt supply chain, the cathode materials market are dominated by Japanese chemical companies, and I suspect some form of collusion is there.With cathode being the most expensive part of the lithium battery cell, it&#39;s hard to fathom how a free market price for it can be many times the cost of input materials for years on end."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Preview is one of the most underrated pieces of software in the world today.I make the assumption that Quicklook uses Preview (because surely it must).Being able to hit spacebar on just about any kind of selected document/image type file and see a near instant look, multiple pages and all, is so important.  Once you don&#39;t have that (move to the Windows world), you realize how much you miss it.  And you can, with a small bit of effort, add capabilities for additional files such as Markdown.Being able to open a PDF or image in a fast, reliable native viewer, and even do some level of editing (such as quickly adding a signature!) is super useful.In terms of reliability, every time over the last 20 years (some distant, some recent) where I tried to live with a Linux desktop, things would stop working after a short while.  Meanwhile, I have lived on my 2014 MBP since 2014, going through multiple OS upgrades in place  - no wipes/reinstalls - and find it just as performant as ever.  It is in most use cases more performant than my 2017 _much_ higher spec Dell XPS 15 (in Windows or Linux boot mode).There are still some things I hate, #1 being that when I cmd-tab to a window which is minimized, it doesn&#39;t raise that window.  What is the f*cking point of cmd-tabbing to an application if you don&#39;t make its window visible!?  This I have never understood.  But generally speaking, macOS on Apple hardware is unmatched by any alternative."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;apt-get was a revolution when it was released in 1998 and it is still the best way to manage software today. brew is a mediocre replacement.While apt still isn&#39;t the best package manager (my heart belongs to pacman, no matter what the haters say), I completely agree that brew is a failed imitation. I wanted to use MacOS for the longest time, because I&#39;ve been told that it&#39;s a real &#34;Unix system&#34;. Brew has distilled my fears into a sobering reality. The &#34;advantages&#34; MacOS offers really comes down to eye-candy or slightly more consistent shortcut mapping, but none of this really matters to me when I can&#39;t use the software I want, and the OS is always second-guessing my authority. Maybe I&#39;ve been spoiled by Linux, but I don&#39;t understand the hype. Not even on my M1 Macbook Air."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From someone who tends to try this switch about once a year (because the lack of TLC the Mac was getting in the last 5 or so years was getting very very worrying - M1 feels like Apple actually care about the Mac again), I agree with a lot of these pain points. My biggest personal issues end up being (and these are super subjective!):- Preview on macOS is great and no other OS has anything remotely equivalent. First class PDF support, ability to easily annotate anything, makes basic PDF editing easy.- I&#39;m far too used to the macOS touchpad gestures, and emulating these on linux doesn&#39;t end up working well. There is an ongoing project for this but it&#39;s very Ubuntu-centric for now. I am hopeful this will help the whole ecosystem improve though! This is still a pain for me on a desktop because my work setup uses a touchpad as the pointer device.- it&#39;s nigh impossible to eliminate tearing on multimonitor setups with X11, and X11 doesn&#39;t support a mix of DPIs for displays without scaling tricks that make text look awful on the low-DPI displays. Wayland was promising here last time I tried, but Wayland itself still has a lot of rough edges for a desktop. Plus since last time I tried I have replaced my last low DPI monitor on my dev setup, so this ought to be a point I can ignore going forward :)- Finding a mail client I don&#39;t hate on linux is tricky. I&#39;ve never been able to get on with the console clients, and I actually quite like Mac Mail. Thunderbird is kinda okay.- My chosen password manager (1password) still has a fairly awful linux experience. This is getting better - they&#39;re producing a native app now. Said native app needs to support the local browser extensions though!- I like the various iCloud/multi device integration features for Apple OSes far too much. This is mostly relatively simple things, that produce disproportionate pain - eg cross-device copy+paste, browser tab syncing, bookmark syncing, etc. Yes, Firefox has Firefox Sync, and Chrome has it&#39;s own sync stuff too, but there&#39;s nothing as all-encompassing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Windows 95 is probably the oldest OS easily usable by young people. It&#39;s fascinating because:- It has established strong foundations about Windows UI. The Menu/Toolbar couple, scrollbars with a relative size, 3D buttons, start menu, toolbar...- The gap between Windows 3.1 (1992) and Windows 95 is insane.- It was beautifully coherent. Today, Windows 10 seems like a mess with different UI pieces from different universes: Modern UI, Windows Vista/7 era utilities, Windows XP/2003 config things and some older gems. Fun thing: open a Word document from a pendrive and unplug the pendrive, MS Word will show an error box from Win95 era, asking to insert the floppy in the drive.- When booting a VM or an old computer with classic Windows I feel &#34;at home&#34;. Our first family computer when I was a child was a Pentium II / Windows 98. I have strong reflexes with this kind of UI and I&#39;m faster with classic window and menus compared to my phone or a tablet with modern touch interface."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recently I went through the attic and found an old laptop (120Mhz CPU, 32Mb RAM, low-RPM 810Mb HDD) with Win98 installed on in. To my amazement it could boot and start Excel and Word within 10sec. Compared to my workstation (20 cores + HT @ 2.5Ghz, 110Gb RAM, PCIe SSD) which takes upward of 40 sec to get to the desktop.Really makes one question the current state of software. Sure, Win7 has some more features, but imagine someone in 98 saying: &#34;we have a great idea for a new OS, it&#39;ll have more features than Win98 and it&#39;ll only take 4 times longer to boot if you are running it on a cluster of supercomputers, but those new features are gonna be worth it&#34; =PSidenote on the hardware side: The laptop had a hinge for the keyboard so you could raise it to a 20 degree angle, the CD/Floppy drive had the same connector as the battery so you could swap the drive for another battery if going on a trip. There were two sliding switches for backlight and speaker-volume. Access to the internals via a simple latch. It may have been a brick but it had interesting ideas.   https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_ThinkPad_760"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The contrast and distinction between the different UI elements is immediately obvious. No mistaking a button for static text, and vice-versa. Also, no hidden scrollbars or other auto-hiding UI elements that are difficult to discover and irritating to use even once you know about them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article focuses on the security issues surrounding his new NAS, and that&#39;s fine. But the problem isn&#39;t security. It&#39;s Trust.Consumers generally trust that manufacturers will follow Best Practices and that security is part of the deal: I pay you money, you give me a quality product that Just Works and is Secure.False.Products are made to be sold at a profit. You can imagine that some engineer at that company knows about this problem, put in a Jira bug for it and since it didn&#39;t affect overall functionality, and because the product needed to be released as soon as possible, they rejected the bug and sent it off.By default, we should NOT trust that things are Good and Secure. If we are security conscious, then it&#39;s on us as consumers to figure out how to mitigate these problems. Or is it?If I was this guy, I&#39;d box that thing up and send it back and give the company feedback as to why, and then I&#39;d show them this very blog post.The manufacturer probably won&#39;t care. They know that until the average consumer cares about security and knows how to mitigate problems it won&#39;t matter. And we all know that the average consumer, even of technical products, has security habits.Now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I need to go take care of some security stuff on my boxes, this really got me thinking about it!  sudo passwd root

After using it for over a month, the ROM is amazingly stable.The earlier MiUi which the tablet shipped with (7.5.2 Android KitKat) had problems with memory management. For some reason, the 2GB RAM was partitioned into two parts, one for the OS and the other for the running apps. But LineageOS does not have this problem, and it is much quicker than when I bought it!I use FDroid to install apps and am very satisfied with it. NewPipe is excellent and videos can easily play at 1080p 60fps when earlier, the tablet used to lag on 480p videos.I have changed the governor to powersave and turned on doze mode. Amazingly, this 6 year old tablet can hold charge for over a week!

Also for voluntary MFA with andOTP of course, because I&#39;m not against MFA, just idiotic pushTANs.Ironically, devices which haven&#39;t had security fixes in 1 year (thanks for nothing, Sony) will also pass safetynet, and the mentioned apps&#39; vendors will still deem them &#34;secure&#34;.Android security past device release remains a joke.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d argue differently. Congrats for having the courage to recognize your problem.The analogy that comes to mind is I&#39;ve been playing basketball in my local town, and now I&#39;ve gotten promoted to play in the big city. I now feel like a small fish in a big pond.If you enjoy software engineering, I&#39;d say, double down. Now that you&#39;re at the medium software company, seek mentorship and coaching from others.In addition, there might be more homework (hitting the gym sort of), things you also have to do on your own.It isn&#39;t going to feel good being humbled and I&#39;ve been there myself. But if you think about the goal as &#34;learning to get better&#34; than &#34;prove to others I am better&#34;, you&#39;ll have a better time walking through this challenge. This all comes from a person who is a PM.So some tactical thoughts of possible advice: 
1. Face the issues head on -&gt; take all the negative feedback on the code and rework the medium complexity task
2. Learn to unlearn bad habits. Yes, it&#39;s harder, but it comes with practice. 
3. Commit to maybe taking a course work online (maybe seek advice from others on what are good ones to address weaknesses you have)Hope this helps.BTW, you don&#39;t need to be able to code things the right way to be a PM. Coding is only one specific skill and not always necessary for a PM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You could be suffering from impostor syndrome. This is the feeling that someone gets when they are in a role but feel like they aren&#39;t living up to it and don&#39;t belong there, even though they may not be doing anything wrong.I also have 10+ years in software development and have switched companies several times. Every place is very different in terms of how their architecture is set up and what&#39;s expected in a software solution. I&#39;ve been at my current job for only about six months, but there are a lot of nuances and things that have thrown me off in implementing various features and fixes.In some cases, I&#39;d start questioning whether or not I&#39;m taking the right approach or if I&#39;m even the right one for the role. Though, some of these things I would bring up with my manager who would either give me advice on ways I could understand their setup better or would give me reassurance that there&#39;s nothing fundamentally wrong with what I&#39;ve been doing. I&#39;d suggest you talk to your manager, too, because I get the feeling that we&#39;re in the same boat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A long time ago, I described what I did as a programmer, and my friend said &#34;Oh, so you get paid to learn?&#34; I thought about it, and agreed. Part of programming is learning.Sounds like you&#39;ve got a great opportunity to learn what you don&#39;t yet know: you already have a list of things you know you need to work on, a codebase, and a job. Do you think one or more of your co-workers would be willing to give you feedback?  Would you be willing to take time (maybe extra time, &#39;off the clock&#39;) to practice?If, e.g., hard-coding is where you&#39;re at, maybe something like working your way through &#39;Code Complete&#39; would be of help, but I would pair the reading with doing, as close to the company&#39;s codebase and personnel as makes sense.I&#39;ve heard tell of people who asked to be shifted to a lower-level position so they could work at the level they were comfortable with."</p>

Regardless of the political/economic reasons why a tax law exists, so many of the rules are so oddly specific that upon reading them I find myself smiling trying to think of the situation that caused a specific law to be made.When I read these rules, I thought of a potentially amusing tax loophole with regards to the stolen property section:&gt;Stolen property. If you steal property, you must report its fair market value in your income in the year you steal it unless in the same year, you return it to its rightful owner.There&#39;s another rule[0] on the books that says interest-free loans to friends and family can have tax implications, but if your friend/family _steals_ the money from you and repays it later that year, they could potentially get a short-term, interest-free loan without incurring the tax implications. I&#39;d have to dig into the details to see if this would actually work out, but it&#39;s an entertaining thought exercise nonetheless.[0] https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/26/7872"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A semi-related thing - in Poland there is a law stating that income from prostitution is not taxable.When some people tried to take advantage of that (to cover illegal income of other kind), they were audited to prove that the money actually comes from prostitution:- the family was asked whether the person was in fact a prostitute- the tax payer was asked to specify where the services were performed- if they said that these were performed at the client&#39;s flats, they were asked to specify the addresses (and names of clients) who might also be interviewed- if they said they did it from clubs and so on, the club owners were asked about it (and likely denied, as even if the people were in fact prostitutes, it is a criminal offense to profit from other people&#39;s prostitution)- if they said they did this at home, the neighbors were interviewed whether the prostitution did in fact take place at homeIn some cases they also rejected these income statements because based on the age and looks, the amount of money was much higher than the woman could have been paid.And if you appeal this decision, you&#39;ll likely get a court decision supporting the tax authority, saying that you are in fact an ugly prostitute and that you have to pay 75% taxes since the source of income was not determined."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yep, if you&#39;re a drug dealer and you don&#39;t want them to get you on tax evasion, make sure you report it.Or really any cash income.  You don&#39;t have to tell them where it came from.  You just tell them you got cash.  Like when you do a garage sale and want to be legit, you report it in the same place."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I read this article in full, and I have to say: Amen. This subject has a deeply personal meaning for me.I watched my wife go through similar things. Her stomach stopped working, and even with groundbreaking surgery and one of the top 10 gastroenterologists in the world at her side, nothing could be done. She tried to get treatments that she thought might help, until one day her GP just down the road finally told her what no doctor had the guts to say out loud: &#34;you&#39;re dying.&#34;That was a punch in the guts. That was late November 2019. She&#39;d just turned 45. She went on hospice care just 4 months later. Hospice care was the best medical care she&#39;d ever received. Finally she was in less pain (but still a lot of pain- starving to death is the opposite of pleasant). Finally able to have one on one care with a nurse who genuinely cared about her.She passed away at home in February 2021 at 46 year old. Nobody tried to violently resuscitate her. Nobody stuck tubes in bad places. Nobody caused her more suffering in order to prolong her suffering. The green paper on the wall said so. One of my own biggest fears was having our home invaded by EMT&#39;s and police, with EMT&#39;s shattering her frail body to try to save it. But that never happened.So, doctors have it right. Die in peace the old fashioned way, if possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My Mom just passed two weeks ago from terminal cancer.The Monday ~2 weeks before she passed she was at the hospital, I asked her if this was all really what she wanted. She really wanted to change over to hospice and focus on palliative care.We began advocating for her to switch. She didn&#39;t have a ton of energy at the hospital to express/follow up on her wishes without someone there. The hospital seems like they would have erred on continuing treatment until all hope was exhausted. But once we began advocating for this want of her, the gears really shifted. She got all the morphine she wanted, and various other comfort measures. The palliative care team was driving the show. She was eventually able to go home for home hospice, and she had a final weekend of energy before passing Sunday before last.All to say, having an advocate that help you with your wishes when you&#39;re in a weakened state feels like it is pretty huge. I can&#39;t imagine what would have happened if me and my siblings weren&#39;t able to help her. She _might_ have been able to get what she wanted ultimately, but all the follow up, checking in, caretaking etc you really want to have someone there advocating for you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh wow... you have just given me some sense of comfort after feeling like a moron for over two decades.When I was growing up, my dad had visited Seattle and came back from the trip with a box of Microsoft Coffee. He claimed to have gotten it from a store called Egg-Head’s Software or Egghead Computing or something like that. (EDIT: Upon reading the full article it seems to have been Egghead Software.)I took it to my computer club and was laughed out of the room for it being fake. I believe he still has it somewhere, in storage...Needless to say, I have some friends to email given that I’ve been the victim of “my uncle works at Nintendo” style teasing about this for years."</p>

I joined Microsoft in 1997 but unfortunately I cannot confirm the story, I never heard this story before, but it doesn&#39;t surprise me, we had a lot of fun back then with all kinds of pranks, and Easter eggs, until one day it was all suddenly stopped, ship an Easter egg and get fired was what they told us.  That was a very sad day.  I can confirm that Microsoft was doing things with Java back then, I worked in an XML parser written in Java when I first joined Microsoft."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh, man. The idea that TextEdit automatically parsed .txt files as HTML if they started with a certain file signature is problematic......but the fact that file:// schemes can access remote files by appending /net/ followed by a domain name is pretty shocking.I mean, the entire purpose of &#34;file://&#34; would seem to be to provide access to local/mounted files and only those.The fact that a Mac engineer thought it would be a great &#34;feature&#34; to allow file:// to access the entire internet is... kinda terrifying.

Reactors are far safer and cleaner than fossil electric generation. It&#39;s mostly the low price of natural gas that is driving these early retirements. Low gas prices have also retired a lot of coal usage -- which is good! -- but we&#39;d make more climate progress if those low prices didn&#39;t also threaten nuclear generation.Some states like New York already provided incentives to keep reactors running for climate reasons:https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=41534Federal policy could be more comprehensive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nuclear energy is the Amiga of energy sources.Ahead of its time, it was unjustly rejected and persecuted by the ignorant masses. Its advocates are bonded by the quiet pride that at least they weren&#39;t unthinkingly siding with those masses. (And they&#39;re right!) Meanwhile, as the Amiga stagnated for terribly unfair reasons, other, scrappier technologies like the i386 and UMG-Si grew from being worthless boondoggles (except in special circumstances, like spaceflight) to being actually far better and cheaper. But the Amiga advocates keep the faith, sharing their suffering and resentment. They inevitably try the alternatives a little and perhaps even start to like them. Gradually their denial recedes, decade by decade.But they know that however much fab costs go down and leave their beloved Amiga behind in the dust, you&#39;ll never be able to run nuclear submarines and Antarctic research stations on solar panels.— ⁂ —Wind, where available, undercut the cost of steam power (including nuclear and coal) a decade ago, and PV undercut it in equatorial parts of the world about four years ago, or in even more of the world if you don&#39;t include storage.  As a result, last year, China, whose electrical consumption has doubled in the last decade, built 48.2 gigawatts† of new photovoltaic capacity last year https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-energy-climatechang... but only has, I think, something like 10 GW of nuclear plants under construction, scheduled to come online over the next several years.  PV installed capacity in China is growing by 23% per year, the same rate it has been growing worldwide for the last few years; with some luck that will return to the 39%-yearly-worldwide-growth trend that has been the fairly consistent average over the last 28 years.‡(A previous version was posted at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26218673.)______† China&#39;s PV capacity factor seems to be only about 13%, so those 48 GWp probably work out to only about 6 GW average.  It would be nice if China managed to site its new PV plants in places that could provide a capacity factor like California&#39;s 28%.‡ Why 28?  Because I haven&#39;t found figures yet on what worldwide installed capacity was in 01992 or earlier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a convert. I was anti-nuclear power, now I am pro with a boatload of caveats.As a person who changed their mind, let me offer this advice to the people commenting here. Don&#39;t pretend there aren&#39;t legitimate concerns with nuclear power. Accidents did in fact happen and, given enough time and more reactors, will absolutely happen again. That&#39;s not a reason not to build more nuclear power, but let&#39;s not play make-believe about it. Don&#39;t pretend that just because we are better at handling nuclear waste it is a solved problem. It isn&#39;t. A hundred-fold increase in nuclear power generation would be a roughly hundred-fold increase in nuclear waste that must be stored away from all life for several hundred years (until we develop technology to resolve the issue, likely long after we&#39;re all dead). And maybe most importantly, acknowledge that nuclear energy is far more expensive than other green energy options and, even if we could drive down the cost, it will not solve all our problems. It is, at best, a big part of the solution, not &#34;the&#34; solution."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know this is supposed to be a joke, but I feel like it&#39;s too close to reality to be funny.I recently ordered a custom tailored set of shirt, trousers, and belt. Their site was bragging about their great AI technology, but sadly I didn&#39;t notice that red flag early enough.The results were nothing short of disastrous. I sent in my measurements and they sent me a trouser with wrong measurements and a postcard that said that they adjusted my measurements with AI for a better fit. The belt they included was a completely different size than the trouser and I&#39;m still waiting for the shirt to arrive. And now I&#39;m fighting the usual uphill battle to talk to a human and get this mess fixed or get a refund.The core of Stitchfix is personalization, as they say. But that means an individual solution for each individual customer, and not AI for memorizing generic trends in a huge dataset."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m sad this is an April fools joke because a lot of the sentiment rings true and I love the slogan “move slow and make things.”Artisans make beautiful things and software artisans make beautiful software, but it’s hard to do it and still be a viable business.And artisans moving slowly isn’t arbitrary. They move slow on the things that matter. The things that shine when attention was paid to the details."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know it’s an april fools joke. But I’ve recently “discovered” why this is nevertheless very true. If you move slow, you have a higher chance of meeting the right customer, of actually allowing your idea to grow and improve over time. Without being locked into it in one form or another. Moving slow allows you to work on it as a side project first. Which means no financial stress.And then making things. To me this means no paper prototyping. Not selling people on your idea without having anything tangible. Some may call it smart. To me it feels like gambling with your believability / integrity. There are only so many times you can do this before people get tired of you and your stories / dreams / business ideas. Just make something, show it to people when it’s actually useful. And feel good about actually having made something people liked. Instead of selling something people liked and then suffer the feeling of non-stop pressure, constantly _not_ being where you’ve told others you are.Happy april fools :)"</p>

I simply walked into an electronic parts store and bought a single spare LED. I don&#39;t think I had ever seen a blue LED in action before, it was completely new to me, so I was very curious.It was of the very common standard shape and size LEDs were during that time, and its case was colorless but cloudy, not clear. A good thing, because that meant the LED would emit its light along the entire casing, not just straight forward, making it much easier to look at. It also wasn&#39;t much brighter than other LEDs, that came later.When I applied power and saw it shining in that beautiful blue color, I was positively amazed. This was so much cooler and so much more beautiful than the red, green, and yellow LEDs I had been using before. I distinctively remember just leaving it attached to power, sitting on my desk, just for something nice to look at."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fact an article like this exists speaks to how bad the keyboard shortcuts for tools like tmux are. It shouldn&#39;t be revolutionary to use basic features of a program.I&#39;m a huge fan of a command window, where you type words to do a fuzzy search of all the commands in a program.Sublime text and jetbrains products have it down so well to the point of me not needing to memorize key shortcuts. I just have to remember the first few letters and I&#39;m good to go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Using the tmux vi keybindings to copy and paste between panes is great if you haven&#39;t tried it.This copy/paste workflow is really nice for working with kubernetes on the command line.E.g., imagine that you need to delete a kubernetes pod.You&#39;d run a few commands like this:1. `kubectl get pods`2. Find the pod id, and copy it using mouse &amp; some shortcut3. `kubectl delete pod &lt;pasted-pod-id&gt;`Instead of this mouse workflow, you could do something like this in tmux:1. `kubectl get pods`2. Find pod id, `Ctrl+b [` to enter tmux&#39;s vi selection mode3. Navigate to the section you&#39;d like to copy; e.g. `k6ww` (up six lines and over two words, for example)4. Press space bar to start selection, and use common vim movements to highlight what you&#39;d like to copy (e.g. w or $)5. Press return/enter to copy the selection6. This text can be pasted with either Cmd/Ctrl+v (it gets copied to the system clipboard for me on macOS 11.2.1 with tmux 3.1c_1 from brew), or using the default tmux shortcut `Ctrl+b ]`. So that would allow you to type `kubectl delete pod Ctrl+b ]`.So yeah, it&#39;s a few more steps, but it&#39;s a lot faster for me.These are the relevant sections of my ~/.tmux.conf file:  # Use vim keybindings in copy mode
  setw -g mode-keys vi

  # Use emacs keybindings in the status bar
  set -g status-keys emacs

(I mention the `set -g status-keys emacs` config line just as an FYI since it&#39;s been really helpful for me with tmux. I&#39;ve never liked using readline-type inputs with vi-mode.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, copy/paste is a weakness of a workflow using tmux.With tmux you end up with four distinct copy/paste buffers: the OS, tmux, the shell, vi/emacs. You do get used to the mental gymnastic of juggling all those but it&#39;s not ideal.Same goes with managing the windows of the OS, tmux and vi/emacs."</p>

When you look at how many other languages have faltered and lost momentum due to transition issues (Perl 6, Python 2/3), it really shows have difficult of a task it is.Progress can seem glacially slow at times - it’s always disappointing to see your favorite upcoming feature get pushed to a later release - but the current language is undeniably light years better than what we started with.Respect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the primary features I&#39;m holding out hope for eventually making it into the language is ValueTypes: http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~jrose/values/values-0.html and the current Valhalla Project: https://wiki.openjdk.java.net/display/valhalla/MainThe simplest example of why this would be valuable (edit: this was not an intentional pun), the Optional type could become stack based, such that you could ensure that the variable referring to the Optional type is never null. This would help reduce a common class of bugs in Java code stemming from NPE&#39;s."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There were days on the internet when a car analogy was appreciated -- let me try here.Suppose there was a rally driver who would claim that rally cars could go much faster if they were always driven in reverse. He did some rudimentary experiments and might have found a significant improvement. The general public and other racing drivers, who in my analogy can all be wonderful people but happen to know little about the mechanics of cars, are naturally enthusiastic: a potential breakthrough in driving! But clearly we need more experiments. So other rally drivers get to work: they set up an elaborate system with ropes and pulleys so they can reverse the driver&#39;s position in the car and run a car as fast as they can, but in reverse, on a test track. What do they find? Sadly, their answer is somewhat inconclusive, probably negative, but perhaps the test track had many bends. So they would like to repeat the experiment on a track with a few more straight segments: they write grant proposals, build a track, and plan other test runs... and all the time their progress is eagerly followed by the general public.Now suppose you are a car mechanic in all this. What are you to do? This cannot work! It flies completely in the face of the way cars are set up, not to speak of the disadvantages in air flow. So you can loudly dismiss the claim as preposterous early on, but then you will be called a pessimist and the public point out that at least the rally drivers are trying something new - what the bleep have you been doing all this time? So you just wait the whole thing out, see it come... and go.I guess I should at least be happy that I did not buy any shares in EnDrive Inc?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For everyone that’s expressing a view like “what a waste of time”, consider this. This hypothesis was by a respected scientist. The experiments have been done by lots of labs. There has been a reasonable position the skeptics have taken throughout. It still has taken a very long time of a bunch of smart people on how to build an experiment to rule these kinds of things out. That means theories have tighter bounds. Technology has been improved in the area which can have knock on beneficial educational and technological effects, etc. Being able to quickly and efficiently rule out hypotheses is a hallmark of the area that science shines in. Being able to say “no, definitely not” with very good certainty is a useful thing to this disciplines toolbelt. From that perspective it’s a pure win and worth any distraction on the scale of all human investment globally."</p>

After I didn&#39;t get anything for 6 months I messaged them that I want to withdraw my order (the phone had already old hardware during release, and it was a year old when I ordered it, but at the same time it cost as much as a high end phone). I got no response from them. I then contacted my credit card company and they charged back.It sucks, because, I would really love phone with a hardware keyboard. I would place an order, but am afraid of the same thing happening again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still consider my old Nokia E70[0] my favorite phone of all time, so I am definitely in the target demographic for this, as I&#39;m 100% sold on the usefulness of a physical keyboard on a phone... However the CPU just doesn&#39;t match the &#34;pro&#34; branding, or the price range. I&#39;d personally rather throw an extra $200-300 on top to get a flagship CPU and then it would be close to a perfect phone for me! As it currently is, the Snapdragon 662 shipped in the pro-1x gets blown away by my current Pixel 5&#39;s Snapdragon 765G - and Pixel phones recently have been generally characterized as having &#34;above-average hardware specs but not enough to justify flagship prices&#34;.Separately, I am also curious for a phone like this that could run Android, LineageOS, and Ubuntu Touch - are there &#34;dual boot&#34; options in the mobile space? With 256GB storage it seems like it should be possible. I&#39;d like to have old reliable Android as a daily driver, but maybe periodically drop into a less stable but more flexible environment like ubuntu.[0]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nokia_E70"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s no free lunch, and it&#39;s easy to overlook the compromises involved in the devices that used to have physical keyboards. By modern standards, blackberrys had a woefully small screen and phones with slideout keyboards were very fat. This device doesn&#39;t look fat which suggests to me that the compromise might be either battery life or low processor power.That said, although this is definitely not for me, it&#39;s generally good for the market to have some devices that are genuinely different rather than just another &#34;me too&#34; Samsung/iphone lookalike."</p>

I guess if we get another wave very soon, maybe it could persist. But it just seems like this is on its way out between organic immunity and vaccine immunity (especially because the latter was focused on the vulnerable).I&#39;m not an expert, so don&#39;t take this as advice to go coughing on everyone. But we all have to make some decisions based on imperfect information and it seems like covid is nearly knocked out.There is some concern over another wave, but it might just be minor cases from unvaccinated young people.

The only logical thing to do is get what is offered to you as soon as possible.That being said, this is excellent news that Pfizer is protective against the SA Variant.

Now, Outlook - at least all configurations I have seen, has pictures via HTML disabled. I have sampled a few IT departments only, of course, but I feel like this is probably a pretty common policy.So let me tell you:Your picture banners, your &#34;rounded corner buttons&#34;, your main engagement centerpiece that&#39;s just a picture ... 
it all ends up being one of those nice 90&#39;s type beveled empty box we remember from surfing with IE and ISDN.This may be a shock, but it really doesn&#39;t make your important newsletter look any better. So, if you are not specifically going for nostalgic &#34;bad modem connection&#34; look and feel, maybe ease off the HTML pictures a bit, okay?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is desktop software, why is there a monthly fee?I occasionally want to send “nice looking” emails but get asked by lots of comms people about it. Recommending a monthly fee service is a non starter, but buying some software is pretty easy to decide. “Should I pay once? Or pay forever?”Is there anything in the functionality that takes advantage of SaaS? Other than updates and whatnot?Of course the price/value computation is up to y’all and your customers but office365 only costs $10/month. Seems tough to value authoring email as higher value than cloud productivity suite.It would be nice if there was a way people like me could use since our competition is an outlook template but still scale up to people who may do this all the time and be willing to pay $20+/month."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"HTML in email is legacy hell. I wonder if someone wants to create a new MIME-type like text/html+css, and clients who want can implement it.In theory you could have representations of the message like video/mpeg4 and text/plain, and depending on the client capabilities and configuration, the receiver could watch a video or read plain text. The information content of the 2 (or more) don&#39;t even have to be the same! Found this out when trying to parse text out of emails into a CRM system, another system sent information in the HTML part, but an empty plaintext part."</p>

Nope, most of their exec layer is a bunch of people who cut their teeth the industry in the 90&#39;s, and are operating within a thick fog of local workplace politics. I guarantee that behind this move is an executive who believes that developers need to be physically colocated to be productive, because that&#39;s how it worked when he was coming up at WordPerfect or whatever. Backing it is also a group of people who have a lot to gain from it politically.At my employer we have some  pockets of embarrassing leadership like this, but thankfully I haven&#39;t seen it in anyone senior enough to make global policy like this.  My department is letting go of remote teams and only hiring in a handful of cities around the world, while ramping up office space spending. It&#39;s more expensive, less flexible, and less productive... and everyone knows it. But I guess it makes some people feel important, and it&#39;s how some others remember developing when they last did it 20 years ago.

I outspend you by 10x per head in my home office, and everything there is to my exact specification. The whole field of modern office design should be a discredited pseudoscience; management is addicted to it because of the real estate crisis though.This is also kind of terrible, because a lot of people use FAANG as their North star for every policy decision.“Well Google use primary colours in their logo, Brian”"</p>

The people living in your house need to be trained as well on what to do.The training for working in the(external) Office started at school, from a time fiber optics telecommunications were unheard for common mortals.Most people feel alone because they lack the social skills to make friends outside work, or just lack the initiative, knowledge and internal motivation to work without external pressure and supervision.The companies that will solve this issue at big scale in the future are those that solve it because the they have to in order to survive(against established companies). It will be a startup that faces all the risks involved, not an established company like Google or Facebook.It will not be companies that could pay millions for people living in ultra expensive places and are already making big bucks doing that.

It doesn&#39;t matter how secure you think your tech stack is. Improving tech is not the solution. Here&#39;s the solution:1. Don&#39;t collect information in the first place, unless absolutely needed. Some schools collect DOB, address and so on just to register for a webinar.2. Don&#39;t permanently store information. If you collect SSN for employability verification then do the verification, store a flag, then delete the SSN. Similarly, after verifying DOB, store a flag then delete DOB.3. Assume information is already public. This is the most important part. Despite all of the leaks happening, many financial and other sites will let you use your DOB, SSN etc. to prove that you are who you say you are. This is absurd.

They are not paying me a salary, so have no legitimate need for this number. I know why they want it, and that purpose does not benefit me. Not once has this led to a problem: they know that there is no legal basis for demanding the number, but ask for it anyway, as they have nothing to lose by doing so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sublime Text has the strangest development cycle I can think of.It does big-bang releases with lots of features, followed by frequent bug fix releases that quickly resolve issues, followed then by years of silence even though there are still issues... until there&#39;s a major version bump and the cycle starts again.This then means that the plugin ecosystem is fairly under developed and inactive because there&#39;s little incentive to actively develop plugins for software that appears to be dead.I used Sublime for many years and it was hard to let it go, the speed was great and the SublimeGit plugin was the best Git client I&#39;ve used, but multi-project development was a pain because the Python/JS/etc plugins didn&#39;t have good support for virtualenvs/per-project config/etc, and it was clear that they were out of active development.I switched to another editor and it&#39;s slower, but fast enough. It&#39;s not quite as nice in many ways but it&#39;s nice enough. Critically though it&#39;s got a great plugin for most things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are text editors and there are IDEs, and each has its place. Sublime Text is, to me, the best GUI text editor around.(For those with the patience to master them, Vim or Emacs may be both objectively and subjectively better. But I&#39;ve never had that patience. Emacs has a hell of a steep learning curve.)You can&#39;t knock Sublime for not having the features of an IDE, because that&#39;s not what it is. If we keep pushing for Sublime to be as &#34;full featured&#34; as an IDE, we&#39;re gonna kill what makes it great.VSC seems to be trying to be both, and by all appearances, those who like it, like it a lot. I&#39;m not in that group, but I admit that there may be something(s) outstanding about it that I just haven&#39;t yet appreciated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I switched from Sublime to VSCode around 2017, and then switched back to Sublime in 2019. My return to Sublime was triggered by a funfunfunction video[1] wherein Mattias recounts an anecdote where he spent an enormous amount of time learning and configuring his IDE, editors, and tools.I realized this is what I was doing with VSCode -- adding more and more extensions, and spending an increasing amount of time configuring them or troubleshooting them when they broke. I realized I was happier and more productive using a &#34;dumber&#34; tool like Sublime Text. I still use plugins with ST, but try to keep them to an absolute minimum. If there is a CLI for what I want to do, I prefer to just use that instead of an extension that obfuscates it. Also, ST is significantly snappier than VSCode, an Electron app.I&#39;ve been using ST4 for over a week now, and it&#39;s been a breath of fresh air.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dIjKJjzRX_E"</p>

Why should your unrelated purchases be disclosed to affiliates just because you clicked an affiliate link for whatever reason? Let’s say the affiliate website use accounts or know the identities of users through another channel, and track outbound clicks. With few enough clicks, they can exactly correlate your unrelated purchases with you, if I understand this correctly. In fact it seems you can easily prank unsuspecting acquaintances this way.To be clear, I have no problem with affiliates getting commission on random stuff.Edit: I can also see why the data could be valuable to marketers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great article - funny &amp; interesting :)Question about &#34;Ads/advertisements&#34; (I&#39;m totally clueless about how they work):Does anybody have a link pointing to some kind of overview from the point of view of a website owner?

VC-backed competitors can simply outspend a bootstrapped company on customer acquisition, marketing, development and hiring, and cash out without the company ever actually making a profit.In the current environment, a bootstrapped company should ideally be:
(a) niche (and therefore outside the traditional VC market crosshairs)
(b) profitable from day one.A to-do list doesn&#39;t fit that mould at all, which this guy found out the hard way.[0] https://sec.report/Document/0001193125-20-228462/"</p>

Well I guess you can, but you shouldn’t!It’s entirely possible there were enough people who liked Flow and didn’t need mobile and native apps for Flow to have been the Basecamp of his dreams. We/he don’t know because he didn’t try for it.Edit: looks like he’s a vc now.

The same thing that many people want to see in EU and US. Clearly it doesn&#39;t belong to the list and the author did zero research on this, but included anyway because it fits the bad guy narrative they are trying to push.What&#39;s even funnier is that Apple threatened to withdraw from the russian market rather than having to do this, so the question is who&#39;s the real bad guy here (how about &#34;a tech giant threatens an unimportant country to be able to bully domestic competitors&#34;?). I guess everybody is horrible in this story, because the government had to compromise and omit the requirement to be able to uninstall this software, and they also included many companies who were large enough to be able to lobby their interests, because obviously they didn&#39;t want to make a single company special. Now Samsung reportedly has a backdoor deal with Yandex to install their software as system on Samsung phones, so it&#39;s being shoved down customers&#39; throats. Nice."</p>

On iPhone it’s even worse because the App Store is not only a centralized distribution mechanism but the only distribution mechanism.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For non-US folks who need a translation here -In the US, we have a nationwide public healthcare system called “Medicare”. You generally only qualify for Medicare once you’re 65 except in special circumstances. Many of our citizens can’t afford to be diagnosed with cancer at an earlier age, as it will increase their non-Medicare private insurance premiums^, result in denied coverage for unrelated issues, and potentially send them into bankruptcy if treated. So they wait until they turn 65, and only then bring in pre-existing conditions for diagnosis and treatment, confident that they can no longer be bankrupted by doing so.^ Insurance premiums average $300-$700 USD per month per person nationwide, when not available through full-time employment or (65+) Medicare. ~75.000.000 US citizens age 18-64 are employed full-time, which compels their employers to subsidize their monthly health insurance costs; the remaining ~127.000.000 citizens are not employed full-time and thus do not qualify for mandatory employer-provided insurance.EDIT - Military veterans, poor people, and so on often have access to additional free public health systems other than Medicare, offered either nationwide or by member states of our union or by non-governmental organizations; degree of subsidy and quality of coverage varies wildly among them.# The above estimates were constructed using napkin math and the below links.“Average Monthly Benchmark Plan Premiums for a 27-Year-Old in Plan Year 2020 in Healthcare.gov States” https://www.investopedia.com/how-much-does-health-insurance-...&#34;Population estimates&#34;: https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US&#34;The U.S. labor force&#34;: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Labor_force_in_the_United_Stat..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This old TechCrunch article from 2018 (https://techcrunch.com/2018/08/23/what-is-this-weird-twitter...) posted at https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26636153 has a former &#34;Amazon Ambassador&#34; actually explain that job:&gt; An actual former ambassador and three year Florida warehouse veteran Chris Grantham explained it in more detail to Yahoo Finance’s Krystal Hu, who shared the information with TechCrunch:&gt;&gt; When I was there they just got an extra paid day off and a gift card after Peak [pre-holiday season]. This is what I got. A paid day off (that expired in 3 weeks lol) and a $50 Amazon gift card. Plus, they gave us lunch. Coldcuts and sandwich bread. I absolutely did not get paid more to train people.&gt;&gt; Ambassador isn’t a ‘job’ you do every day, its just something you are trained to do. You go to a 4 hour class and they teach you how to teach others to tie a knot using a set of instructions. This is how new hires a supposed to be taught. You are supposed to teach them right from a script using a set protocol. Becoming an ambassador was a way to get out of loading trucks, or packing boxes for 10 to 12 hrs. You may ambassador 1 day then unload trucks for the next 3.&gt;&gt; I stopped doing it after the first year I was there because it didn’t pay more. It’s voluntary. Your manager picks them. Generally speaking ambassadors are the “kiss asses” of the department.&gt; In case it isn’t obvious, Chris is no longer at Amazon and is happy to speak his mind. Thanks for helping us clear this up, Chris."</p>

The web was supposed to be a democratizing platform: all you need to communicate with the world is an ISP and a keyboard.  But if there&#39;s no way to control for authenticity, online sentiment will just be an arms race for who can pay for the best astroturfing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Specify it in pixelsNo thank you.I regularly wonder if it might not be better for the web if we got rid of pixels as a unit entirely. We can&#39;t realistically do that for a lot of reasons, and there are legitimate reasons to use pixels sometimes, but resolution independent font-size and container sizing should be the default. If you are using pixels on the web for font sizes, consider this a public intervention that you need to stop.The fact that `em` units are not related to physical size attributes is intended. We don&#39;t want them to be related to physical size -- what `2em` is saying is that you want a piece of text to be twice as large as the &#34;default&#34; size of the specific font on the platform/device. That is a superior way to think about text size, because as a user I don&#39;t want you to try and figure out what the pixel density or screen ratio or resolution of my device is.Size your fonts with `em` and `rem` units, and size your containers based on the number of characters you want to fit in each line. Don&#39;t use pixels. It doesn&#39;t matter if your fonts are bigger on Mac or Windows. It is intentional that platforms can size their fonts differently, and your interface designs should take that into account.If anything, native platforms should be moving more in this direction, they should not be moving away from it. There was a period where you could decide to only care about responsive design on the web, but increasingly you should be thinking about responsive design on native platforms too. And resolution-independent font-sizes based on the user/platform are part of that process.EDIT: Yes, I&#39;m aware that pixels on the web are not necessarily 1:1 ratios with physical pixels on a screen. That doesn&#39;t change anything, pixels are still bad to use on the web. Tying font size to resolution, whether that&#39;s browser window resolution or physical resolution, is still equally problematic. And it certainly doesn&#39;t mean that we should move in the opposite direction on native devices -- the web&#39;s pixels are the way they are because the alternative, being tied to literal physical pixels, would be even worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a fantastic article and I welcome this conversation.As the author states, sizing of fonts and line spacing is currently inconsistent across OS&#39;s, inconsistent across fonts, and inconsistent with other UI elements.It&#39;s madness. There&#39;s no good reason for any of it except inertia and lack of forethought.The author&#39;s proposal to specify cap height is really the only reasonable solution I think there is, though I&#39;d modify it slightly:- When defining cap height, be clear what the logical obvious equivalent in other scripts, e.g. Chinese logogram height- Specify cap height in whatever unit other UI elements are specified in (the author refers to pixels, but that&#39;s arbitrary)- Then line height can also be controlled predictably and exactly in whatever unit UI elements are specified inEnd result: zero inconsistencies. Text shows up exactly where it&#39;s meant to no matter what.How do we get there? Browsers should adopt it first, with something like a CSS &#34;font-cap-size&#34; property that can be used instead of (and override) &#34;font-size&#34;, as well as something like &#34;cap-line-height&#34; overriding &#34;line-height&#34;. (And for units, recommend using &#34;px&#34;, or &#34;rem&#34; ultimately based on a root &#34;px&#34;, and never touching &#34;pt&#34;.)Then OSes can migrate similarly with new function calls/parameters based on cap height, and also try to phase out &#34;pt&#34; sizing in preference of the logical &#34;px&#34; sizing used in the rest of interfaces.I really think this is the way. I really hope browsers and the W3C can consider something like this. It&#39;s decades overdue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;I see no reason to honor the so-called “default line-height”. It’s basically a font designer’s personal preference, imposed on every user of the font in every viewing condition.Erm... To a large extent, these details of a font _are_ the the designer&#39;s -personal-preference- professional judgement, and that&#39;s the point.  We use different fonts because they have a distinct feel or quality, and how much spacing they have between lines is one of the many little details that add up to the gestalt of a font.  If you don&#39;t like the line spacing of a font, don&#39;t use it.  Or tweak it if you like. But don&#39;t pretend that declaring that all fonts should have a line spacing of 200% of their cap height isn&#39;t similarly trying to impose your personal aesthetic preferences on everyone else as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34; Modern cars regularly send basic data about vehicle components, their safety status and service schedules to car manufacturers, and mobile phones work in very similar ways.&#34; -GoogleThis is a beautiful quote because it is an example of one industry&#39;s bad behavior leading to another industry&#39;s bad behavior, upon which the first industry then users the second&#39;s similarity to justify themselves. Cars only started doing this because phones made it normal. It&#39;s wrong in both cases.It&#39;s similar to when Apple defended it&#39;s 30% store cut by claiming it&#39;s an &#34;industry standard&#34;... specifically, an industry standard that Apple established."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;20X more telemetry&#34;, in terms of data usage, is a pretty meaningless statistic on its own (unless it&#39;s large enough to affect your mobile data cap or something).For instance, I would consider it a much bigger privacy violation for my phone to transmit my exact location every hour than my current CPU usage every 10 seconds."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reminds me of 500px. I used to be a huge fan of 500px. It was the most beautiful photography site on the internet, designed with attention to every tiny detail. It allowed you to share your photos under a CC license, presented them beautifully and had fantastic curated feeds with photos by fantastic photographers.In 2018 they were acquired by an investor company and partnered exclusively with Getty. As a contributor, you were now pushed to &#34;earn money with your pictures&#34;, CC licenses were discouraged and (I think) eventually removed. The site stopped getting optimized for aesthetics, it was now getting optimized for selling stock photos. I deleted all my photos and left.I hope this doesn&#39;t happen to Unsplash. But I&#39;m not optimistic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My main association with Getty is their &#39;copyfraud&#39; practises where they claim public domain images (NASA, Library of Congress etc) as their own and sell licenses[0]. They&#39;re also well known for aggressive acquisitions[1]. Perhaps this a good time to create a mirror[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images#Claiming_copyrigh...[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getty_Images#Acquisitions"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m going to instead see this as an opportunity for something better to emerge.My biggest problem with Unsplash is that they did not use a standard license that would easily be compatible with a Creative Commons or open source licensed work. If I incorporated images from Unsplash, suddenly I couldn&#39;t say &#34;you&#39;re welcome to do whatever you like with my work.&#34; In fact, they used to use a CC0 license, but then changed, because other sites were copying them. As a user, this was a feature, not a bug.I would far prefer to see the community band together and produce an image sharing website with CC0 as the default license. Creative Commons image search right now is in need of some TLC from an engaged community."</p>

Here it is only about EMC (and it is well known for years that USB is difficult with EMC and it requires a lot of care on the PCB design !). And USB3 is not the only product that leads to difficulties : there are for example a lot of debates (at least in Europe) now with regards to the impact of LEDs (which might surprise a lot of people). Another example are debates on Wireless Power Transfer (which are desired emissions but with very strong harmonics that affect sensitive radio services)"</p>

They’ve allowed BTC deposits and withdrawals for years (with great UX!) yet are lagging far behind in release cadence.The biggest barrier to spending crypto is still finding merchants that accept it, even through third parties. PayPal’s huge merchant userbase will allow dominance if/when they flip the switch to an open loop, “deposit your crypto” approach.Only PayPal and Stripe can flip that switch at scale with a hosted checkout experience.
