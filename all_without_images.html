								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really think for the Oculus side of this, they should be on the hook for refunding a significant portion of the cost of the user&#39;s Oculus library when they ban the account.This would put the cost of a ban to Facebook for real users in the order of hundreds of dollars which is more than enough to have a support person do a realistic evaluation of the situation. It also reflects the non-recoverable portion of the cost to most users - you can sell the headset, but you can&#39;t transfer the value of the library to anybody. That is a straight up and very significant financial loss.While other aspects of the ban policy are obviously still very problematic, the fact that an arbitrary ban that is caused by actions outside the user&#39;s control can result in hundreds of dollars of losses sits at a whole different level and should be legally problematic for Facebook."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I want to start by pointing out I use two-factor authentication just about everywhere and Facebook is not an exception.I wish he&#39;d mention what kind of 2FA. The reason you _really_ should use U2F/WebAuthn is because it does origin binding which, unlike entering a TOTP, a code from your hardware token/authenticator app on your phone/SMS/etc is not phishable, i.e. you can&#39;t enter it by accident on accounts.google.com.totallylegit.ru and then have them enter it on real accounts.google.com. This is so because the U2F/WebAuthn security key signs a request, sent by your browser, which embeds the requesting page&#39;s domain, so a signature on attacker.com will not pass victim.com&#39;s verification checks, whereas a code from your authentication app is trivially copied."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can this one provide wildcard certificates without having to update DNS entries every three months?That is the one pain point I have with Let&#39;s Encrypt.PS: Yes, you can automate the DNS updates. That is the paintpoint I am talking about. It is one more moving part. One more dependency on a third party. One more thing to set up. One more thing that can break. One more thing that will rot (APIs always change at some point in time).Many people seem to solve the &#34;automate DNS&#34; by putting their DNS credentials on the server which serves their website. This is the worst thing from a security perspective. Now someone who breaks into your application can take over your DNS, point your domain to wherever they like and get any certificate for it they like. This probably enables them to also overtake your email and then escalate further from there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seen this thread going around, but it seems like it skips over the important bit.&gt; So why the rule changes? Because last December the New York Times published an opinion piece by Nick Kristof caller “The Children of Pornhub” that accused the site and its parent company of profiting off revenge porn, child porn and sex trafficking.How do you get from &#39;opinion piece in a newspaper&#39; to &#39;gigantic transnational financial infrastructure company changes its rules&#39;? In my experience, huge companies do not make changes like this purely on the basis of newspaper columns.Was there legal advice? Political pressure? Regulatory pressure? All of those would be much more material than a piece in a newspaper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At least this explains why normal porn sites keep living on perfectly well using MasterCard and Visa. They already have to follow regulatory requirements to demonstrate they are complying with age and consent laws, each video includes a front-matter frame saying where you can get the documentation of their compliance, and many include behind-the-scenes extra content showing all of the performers presenting government-issued IDs and signing consent forms.This brings this conflict out of the realm of adult entertainment and into a broader conflict between incumbent central providers that are held to regulatory standards and apps providing a platform for individual contractors that don&#39;t follow those requirements. It&#39;s in the same field as people arguing AirBNB is only able to exist because it&#39;s allowing people to operate hotels without having to comply with hotel regulations, and Uber allows people to operate taxi services without complying with taxi regulations. OnlyFans was giving individuals a way to produce adult films without having to comply with adult film regulations related to age and consent verification of the performers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aren&#39;t the payment processors not abusing their dominant position, like what happened a decade ago with Wikileaks? At least at that time they had the excuse they were pressured by the US government. What&#39;s motivating them this time? Do we need some sort of liability safe-harbor for payment processors?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey everyone! I have a home server that runs some apps, and I&#39;ve been installing them directly, but they kept breaking on every update. I wanted to Dockerize them, but I needed something that would manage all the containers without me having to ever log into the machine.This also worked very well for work, where we have some simple services and scripts that run constantly on a micro AWS server. It&#39;s made deployments completely automated and works really well, and now people can deploy their own services just by adding a line to a config instead of having to learn a whole complicated system or SSH in and make changes manually.I thought I&#39;d share this with you, in case it was useful to you too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been knee deep in deployment space for post 4 years. It is pretty hard problem to solve to the n-th level. Here&#39;s my 2 cents.Single machine deployments are generally easy, you can do it DIY. The complexity arises the moment you have another machine in the setup, scheduling workloading, networking, setup to name a few, starts becoming complicated.From my perspective, kubernetes was designed for multiple team, working on multiple services and jobs, making operation kind of self serviced. So I can understand the anti-kubernetes sentiment.There is gap in the market between VM oriented simple deployments and kubernetes based setup."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My anti-kubernetes setup for small single servers is docker swarm, portainer &amp; traefik. It&#39;s a setup that works well on low powered machines, gives you TLS (letsencrypt) and traefik takes care of the complicated network routing.I created a shell script to easily set this up: https://github.com/badsyntax/docker-box"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I built a small Go web app to do some security testing. When a user registers for an account, I generate a 128-bit secure token and email it to the address they provided (as a URL). Token URLs look like this:/validate/email/1d00a5c2648c211befd33f5a8a7cbfabThe token is cryptographically strong and disappears after access. It can&#39;t be guessed and no one but the email account holder should click it, but I am seeing the URL accessed multiple times from multiple IPs, so I investigated.Turns out, if the user provides a Gmail or Gsuite email account during registration, Google clicks the link.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"All URLs sent to any major email provider are &#34;clicked&#34; because they are scanning the page to see if it is phishing or otherwise malicious (desktop antivirus and other things will also prescan URLs).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s about time. When I learned that applications like YNAB (You Need A Budget) use services like Plaid to connect to my bank account, and that these services literally take my username and password and impersonate me to get my banking data, I was a little sketched out. I use YNAB every day, and having it connected to my bank account is incredibly useful, but if something goes wrong and Plaid loses my money somehow, is there any recourse?Hopefully individuals will be able to use the Open Banking APIs to access their own data directly, but it looks like accreditation will be required, so probably not.Here&#39;s the full text of the report: https://www.canada.ca/en/department-finance/programs/consult..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a developer living in a country that has fully implemented &#34;Open Banking&#34;, here&#39;s a quick setting of expectations for Canadian developers so they don&#39;t get too excited as I did when this was first being introduced.Open Banking is not, in fact, open in almost any sense of the world. It is standardised and the standards are freely available (&#34;open&#34;), but other than that, you still need to have an official &#34;blessing&#34; to actually access a production API endpoint (even for your own account), you need a legal entity that has some highly specific and entirely meaningless certificates that are hard (and potentially expensive) to get and even after all of that, you&#39;ll still need to negotiate access with each bank individually.What I imagined when I first heard of &#34;Open Banking&#34; was a public OAuth2 endpoint where I can grant my custom script access to just my bank balance and transaction history (possibly with a change webhook) and have it update my finance tracking database.The &#34;open&#34; part is only relevant to the banks, since they don&#39;t have to pay royalties for the standard implementing the APIs. For the rest of us, it might as well be SS7."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I went from being a quite a bad procrastinator to making quite strong progress in running and learning the piano. One of the secrets was setting specific times to do these things such that I can&#39;t wriggle out. For example I run on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings rather than the more vague &#34;three times a week&#34; which gives wiggle room on a given day. I also set modest goals of two 5ks and one longer run (up to 10k). For piano, I aim for twenty minutes a night minimum, five nights a week minimum after dinner (week nights but sometimes I have to be flexible and drop a weeknight and do a weekend). I won&#39;t be an Olympic runner or Mozart but I&#39;m heck of a lot fitter and better at the piano after a surprisingly short amount of time.My &#39;secrets&#39; are rather boring; schedule specific times, keep it achievable and don&#39;t overdo it in the early days. Little and often works wonders and you build the ritual / habit that way. You can then scale the frequency and length of time per session accordingly.Strangely, having kids made me much better at this too. When I had loads of free time I wasted a lot more of it. Now my free time is very limited, it&#39;s much more precious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A major technique mentioned by the author is omitted from the article’s headline: co-working. She writes about benefitting greatly from logging on to a muted Zoom room with hundreds of other people to work at a set time. It’s interesting how this is effective for some people; for another anecdote, blogger Alexey Guzey wrote about a similar system [0] with a smaller group.Psychiatrist Dr. David Burns writes at length about more techniques on addressing procrastination (called “do-nothingism”). He has a chapter on the subject in his book “Feeling Good,” and he wrote a similar passage online in an article for his podcast [1]. The methods he writes about that work best for me have been breaking down tasks into sequence of simple steps. This helps greatly for straightforward tasks, though it is less effective for difficult tasks that involve uncertainty and learning. These harder tasks require persistence and preferably time.Separately, a personal technique I use is to really sell myself on the value of completing a task. The phrase, “discipline matters more than getting motivated” is thrown around a lot on the web, and though it has merit, I find motivation crucial to sustaining projects in the long-term (and also figuring out when it’s worthwhile to exit from a method or approach).[0] https://guzey.com/co-working/[1] https://feelinggood.com/2017/09/18/053-ask-david-i-dont-feel..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Keep in mind that Apple&#39;s claimed false positive rate (one in a trillion chance of an account being flagged innocently), and the collision rate determined by Dwyer in the article, are both derived without any adversarial assumptions. Given that NeuralHash collider and similar tools already exist, the false positive rate is expected to be much much higher.Imagine that you play a game of craps against an online casino. The casino throws a virtual six-sided die, secretly generated using Microsoft Excel&#39;s random number generator. Your job is to predict the result. If you manage to predict the result 100 times in a row, you win and the casino will pay you $1000000000000 (one trillion dollars). If you ever fail to predict the result of a throw, the game is over, you lose and you pay the casino $1 (one dollar).In an ordinary, non-adversarial context, the probability that you win the game is much less than one in one trillion, so this game is very safe for the casino. But this number is very misleading: it&#39;s based on naive assumptions that are completely meaningless in an adversarial context. If your adversary has a decent knowledge of mathematics at the high school level, the serial correlation in Excel&#39;s generator comes into play, and the relevant probability is no longer one in one trillion. The relevant number is 1/216 instead! When faced with a class of adversarial math majors, a casino that offers this game will promptly go bankrupt. With Apple&#39;s CSAM detection, you get to be that casino."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In order to test things, I decided to search the publicly available ImageNet dataset for collisions between semantically different images. I generated NeuralHashes for all 1.43 million images and searched for organic collisions. By taking advantage of the birthday paradox, and a collision search algorithm that let me search in n(log n) time instead of the naive n^2, I was able to compare the NeuralHashes of over 2 trillion image pairs in just a few hours. &gt; This is a false-positive rate of 2 in 2 trillion image pairs (1,431,168^2). Assuming the NCMEC database has more than 20,000 images, this represents a slightly higher rate than Apple had previously reported. But, assuming there are less than a million images in the dataset, it&#39;s probably in the right ballpark. It&#39;s great to see the ingenuity and attention this whole debacle is receiving from the community. Maybe it will lead to advances in perceptual hashing (and also advances in consumer awareness of tech related privacy issues)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s been a lot of focus on the likelihood of collisions and whether someone could upload eg; an image with a matching hash to your device to &#34;set you up&#34;, etc. But what&#39;s still extremely concerning is that there is still no guarantee that the hash list used can&#39;t be coopted for another purpose (eg; politically insensitive content)."</p>

Answer: They pathfind away from player not by euclidian &#34;distance&#34;, but simply by number of navmesh polygons. The game world has uneven navmesh density, with points of interest (locations often housing treasure) having a higher number of polygons, so the foxes tend to pathfind their escape path into them."</p>

They all claim that chip and other supply chains (all based on South East Asian) are all under new pressure from delta strain spread.In fact, I wonder how much of this really is chip supply vs general supply.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"7 years ago I had just aborted an internship, my foray into being an employed adult, because I found myself unable to deal with disagreements. Contrary to my naive hope that the confidence boost from being a Professional Software Developer(tm) would solve all my emotional problems I now knew that my limitations would follow me around anywhere I would go. But I had no idea how to change and was too stuck in my own anxiety and arrogance to ask for help.Around that time I Somehow stumbled upon this[1] article on how to make a Buddhist bone trumpet. It took me completely by surprise, the topic, the author, the tone, the context of Buddhism, nothing fit together like I expected. It was the most absurd thing I ever read and I kept laughing, at the same time it felt utterly genuine. My curiosity piqued I read the other less bizarre articles from the author about Buddhism and life in general. It dawned on me that my attempt at completely controlling my life had, in fact, caused me to lose control over it. The process of learning to accept unpredictability and open myself to the world, that started the evening I read that article, was by no means always this fun, but looking back boy was it worth it.[1] https://buddhism-for-vampires.com/kangling-chod"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://blog.tjcx.me/p/consume-less-create-moreThis article inspired me on two things :1) Lots of the things I do in everyday life is just to consume: buying, watching, following, etc. These things either consume my money, or my time. These things make me feel good, but it does not generate real value. In order to get rich, I need to create things. I also start to realize that great people are great because they started to create things at a very early stage of their life (but not consuming things as they advocate, think about celebrities, entrepreneurs etc), so they are able to practice and perfect the value creating skills to the extreme.2) I start to realize that the world is binary in nature : I create to sell, I buy to consume. I either at the buyer side, or at the seller side. And in this current society, there is a huge buyer side trap, the whole idea of consumerism and social media is to trap you inside the buyer side, so you keep buying, you keep consuming. I really need to break free from this trap.This blog post was written before COVID-19, but the idea feels even fresher during this pandemic era"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"http://wholehealthsource.blogspot.com/2014/07/instant-pot-el...If you see cooking primarily as a means of getting nutrients rather than a hobby, I very strongly recommend getting an electric pressure cooker. It greatly simplifies cooking because it&#39;s automated. Just add the ingredients, close the lid, press a button, and wait. You will get a perfectly cooked one-pot meal with minimum effort. You can even mix fresh and frozen ingredients and the timer won&#39;t start until the frozen ingredients are thawed. If you don&#39;t overfill it the only thing the food touches is the inner stainless steel pot, so it&#39;s very easy to clean. I get the majority of my nutrition from food cooked this way. I can&#39;t imagine going back to slow traditional methods.It also makes dried legumes far more practical, because you can skip the pre-soak phase. If you eat a lot of legumes, and you switch from canned to dried, the savings will most likely pay for the cost of the machine within a few years. In addition, energy costs are reduced because cooking at increased pressure is faster, and good electric pressure cookers are insulated. I am happy with an Instant Pot brand one, although I don&#39;t guarantee they are the best. If somebody has strong opinions on which is best then please post them.The one major downside is the texture of the food can become boring, because everything is mixed together and you can&#39;t make crispy foods with it, but you can always add things like pickles after you&#39;ve cooked it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This would be a serious breach of privacy if true. But reading the tweets I&#39;m not sure what the policy really is:&gt; During a discovery thing 3yr ago, legal forced me to hand-over all my texts. They refused to let me delete anything, even &#34;fully personal,&#34; even when I said &#34;by fully personal I mean nudes.&#34; They said they&#39;re in their &#34;permanent evidence lockerThis doesn&#39;t sound like company policy, and more like they were subpoenaed or otherwise compelled to hand over communications.&gt; Another interesting Apple tidbit: the company tells employees to link their personal iCloud accounts if they need to collab with colleagues when they start. When they leave, they&#39;re asked to hand over their laptops w/o wiping them and give managers access to work systems.I&#39;m not sure how to parse this. Do you need to link your personal accounts with family photos and whatnot? Or can you just create a separate iCloud account just for work, to collaborate with coworkers?I&#39;m a firm believer in separating work and personal accounts. I usually try not to even log into email from my work computer if I don&#39;t need to, and I always use a spare phone for work if a company requires admin access or remote management tools of any kind. That said, reading these tweets I&#39;m not really sure if Apple is asking employees to breach this separation. I&#39;d just create a separate Apple ID for work and use that for the &#34;personal&#34; account that I&#39;m supposed to merge. That&#39;s a separation I&#39;m still comfortable with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some time ago when I hired on at Apple (I&#39;ve since moved on to greener pastures) I had a tough time provisioning my corporate MacBook. Every time I tried entering my work email address I got kicked into an unfamiliar auth flow that ended up not working. After I mentioned how much trouble I was having, someone sitting near me in the office told me I needed to use a personal Apple ID to provision the device.I created a completely new consumer iCloud account and used that. I never did anything remotely &#34;personal&#34; on that machine, and after I left Apple I never used that iCloud account again. In fact I don&#39;t even remember my password for it.I went so far as to carry two iPhones, one personal and the other &#34;corporate,&#34; and I only ever used my &#34;corporate&#34; iPhone with Apple employee apps. I never even connected my personal phone to the campus WiFi; I used wireless data for that phone the entire time I was there.That said, I don&#39;t recall ever being asked to merge my personal and work accounts. It&#39;s just that if you want to do any personal stuff with corp hardware, it&#39;s much more convenient to just use your personal Apple ID when you provision the hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here’s my take as someone who worked there in the last two years.1. You absolutely have the choice to make a separate iCloud account for work, you just can’t make it with an @apple.com email.
2. It’s true that you should not wipe your device when you quit.
3. We were instructed to avoid using iCloud for anything work related. They recommended turning everything iCloud related off on your work computer except for FindMy.
4. None of the claims in the tweet sound familiar to me, but Apple is a big org.My impression is that they need you to have an iCloud account for tracking the location of the device with FindMy, but technical/legal limitations prevent that from happening through your work email."</p>

But I really love that this made it to hacker news because I feel like &#34;hacking&#34; doesn&#39;t exclude non-software hacks and it&#39;s always awesome to see hardware for design and making alongside all the other software news.The idea of open source robotic assemblies or mechanical assemblies is another cool, separate thing.

That said - it&#39;s designed to a low budget that increases the potential audience, and that is something that can only be welcomed. I&#39;m particularly interested in the software as that will be an enabler for future variations that have mechanical rigidity.Nice website!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This could be greatly simplified (at higher cost) by using linear motors for the cross-slides.It may even be more rigid than what is there now (though nowhere near rigid enough to do anything real)The design is actually not unique at all - you can buy much better versions of it (at higher cost, obviously).Most positioning actuators you can buy are literally built to be attached to each other in a cross-slide configuration, and to have a rotary table attached to it.  They also directly sell pre-built cross-slide actuators.If you just google &#34;cross-slide stepper&#34; or &#34;cross-slide servo&#34;, you can see this
(servo/stepper just gets rid of the manual ones, which also exist).The normal reason the configuration is not used is because it has no meaningful rigidity."</p>

He invented a system for classifying gamers&#39; preferred game actions called the &#34;Bartle taxonomy&#34;, which helps game designers understand player motivations better. Think of it like user personas in software development - Killers love competition, Explorers love discovery, Achievers love mastery, and Socializers play games for social reasons. When designing a game for mass appeal it&#39;s often important to make sure players of all stripes find reasons to enjoy it, and Bartle&#39;s taxonomy is a great framework for analyzing how different types of players will interact with a game.You can take an online version of the Bartle taxonomy questionnaire to get your own results here:http://matthewbarr.co.uk/bartle/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can&#39;t believe how weak these cases have been - are these more of a posturing thing?* These were all approved at the time. This is going to make for a crazy world if folks act on an approval and then they are reversed.* The focus of a lot of these seems to be on harm to other (sometimes very scammy) businesses. The Apple case has this issue as well. Match group can&#39;t do non-cancelable auto-renewing billing in their own app store. Rando app can&#39;t get your email and other details but you can route via apple. Etc. Why not focus on consumer harm more - that was traditional focus. The complaint is Facebook doesn&#39;t make an easy api for others to scrape their platform - uh, hello cambridge analytic?* These social network things seem somewhat fragile. Myspace came and went, Friendster was hot. Now I see a lot more folks on tiktok. Are kids still even active on facebook?* Instagram wasn&#39;t that big when purchased, and many folks (including same people writing the articles now about monopolies) said that facebook wildly overpaid.https://twitter.com/rockspindeln/status/189416024058245121What&#39;s crazy is there is so much straight pure scam crap on the internet the FTC does nothing about. I mean, stuff that is obvious consumer harm. In my case I tried to cancel a subscription 30 days in advance recently (nearly 1K per year). It turns out you have to cancel 90 days in advance but not more than 120 days in advance?? So now I&#39;m on the hook for another 1K. That is just total trash behavior online. And instead of the click to sign up, I had to go through endless hoops. Talked to someone, then they wanted me to submit a case, I did that, then back and forth to &#34;verify&#34; me etc etc.The FTC is crickets on just endless false advertising, misleading internet offers etc (stuff that&#39;s not even close to OK)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; After suffering significant failures during this critical transition period, Facebook found that it lacked the business talent and engineering acumen to quickly and successfully integrate its outdated desktop-based technology to the new era of mobile-first communication. Unable to maintain its monopoly or its advertising profits by fairly competing, Facebook’s executives addressed this existential threat by buying up the new mobile innovators, including its rival Instagram in 2012 and mobile messaging app WhatsApp in 2014.Man, I hate FB as much as the next guy, but this argument is weak as hell.FB was still the #1 mobile app in the world when they bought up both of these companies. Hell, neither were even direct competitors any more than Oculus was.FB&#39;s play is clearly a horizontal integration - they want as many different types of products to fall under their single advertising pane of glass as possible. The FTC is going after them for doing the exact opposite thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; After failing to compete with new innovators, Facebook illegally bought or buried them when their popularity became an existential threat.Illegally bought or buried them?1) FTC approved all the mergers. So, it is surprising that they&#39;d say that these were illegally bought.2) Facebook seems to be operating all key acquisitions (Instagram and WhatsApp) as separate products and hasn&#39;t made their usage conditional to having a Facebook account.This is re-writing history and it is just as dangerous when the FTC does it as it is when a political party does it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Second preimage attacks are trivial because of how the algorithm works. The image goes through a neural network (one to which everyone has access), the output vector is put through a linear transformation, and that vector is binarized, then cryptographically hashed. It&#39;s trivial to perturb any image you might wish so as to be close to the original output vector. This will result in it having the same binarization, hence the same hash. I believe the neural network is a pretty conventional convolutional one, so adversarial perturbations will exist that are invisible to the naked eye.This is useful for two purposes I can think of. One, you can randomize all the vectors on all of your images. Two, you can make problems for others by giving them harmless-looking images that have been cooked to give particular hashes. I&#39;m not sure how bad those problems would be – at some point a police officer does have to look at the image in order to get probable cause. Perhaps it could lead to your Apple account being suspended, however."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neuralhashes are far from my area of expertise, but I&#39;ve been following Apple closely ever since its foundation and have probably watched every public video of Craig since the NeXT take over and here is my take: I&#39;ve never seen him so off balance before as in his latest interview with Joanna Stern. Not even in the infamous “shaking mouse hand close up” of the early days.Whatever you say about Apple, they are an extremely well oiled communication machine. Every C-level phrase has a well thought out message to deliver.This interview was a train wreck. Joanna kept asking: please, in simple terms, to a hesitant and inarticulate Craig. It was so bad that she had to produce infographics to fill the communication void left by Apple.They usually do their best to “take control” of the narrative. They were clearly caught way off guard here. And that&#39;s revealing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Headline implies that Apple sued Corellium because of their CSAM research, but that&#39;s not at all related. This is quite clickbaity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The quote from the Apple executive is misleading to outright dishonest.&gt; “Security researchers are constantly able to introspect what&#39;s happening in Apple’s [phone] software,” Apple vice president Craig Federighi said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. “So if any changes were made that were to expand the scope of this in some way—in a way that we had committed to not doing—there’s verifiability, they can spot that that&#39;s happening.”Apple uses complex cryptography to shield themselves and their list providers from accountability.  You cannot determine if they&#39;ve included non-child-abuse images in the database through inspection."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Researchers can vet the client-side part of the tools, but per the Security Device program agreement they can’t discuss anything publicly without Apple giving them the go ahead.And presumably the hash match database downloaded to the device is encrypted and unable to be examined."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s completely unrelated, but it reminds me of the Metasploit UAC bypass for Windows, called &#34;ask&#34;.Metasploit just pops up a UAC prompt asking for escalation. Yes or no. Over and over and over again.On any machine logged into by a local administrator user, if they&#39;re the standard kind of careless user, they&#39;ll just click yes without thinking and they&#39;re owned. If they&#39;re cautious, and on a box where UAC presents as a modal dialog, as per its default config, this essentially locks the user out of the OS until they click &#34;yes&#34;... and they&#39;re owned.On an assessment we did at a local 200-seat business where they ran with admin rights on their local boxes, we got about a 90% escalation rate. The other 10% of people got up from their desks and went to ask the IT guy, which we considered a &#34;pass&#34; in that scenario.Interesting stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The last paragraph hits the nail on the head, it&#39;s impossible to prevent developers from elevating privileges unless one spends much more time and effort than almost any business is willing to on creating a true zero trust internal environment.Developers have little RCEs throughout the entire system, it&#39;s how they do their jobs. If even system with millions of dollars worth of design and security reviews regularly get hacked by people with no internal access to it or its source code, how can you hope to stop someone who already has a foothold and can see into the system, including a bunch of its config files?The real answer is not to stop developers from doing so. That&#39;s a never ending uphill battle. You implement very good logging and RBAC systems instead. Now everybody could hack the system if they wished to, but they would be sued into oblivion if they tried to do it for nefarious reasons.IMO the main purpose of RBAC is not really to stop developers from doing malicious activity, but to stop the stupid ones from breaking the system. The smart ones will be able to get around whatever safeguards you put in, as some of them will undoubtedly be designed by those not so fortunate or experienced. Not every developer has a good understanding of infosec and its many, _many_ ways of circumventing what seems to be an impossible defence. Unless you know all the tricks in the book already, whatever you write is most definitely gonna be swiss cheese."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That last paragraph is hard to argue with:  Maybe this is our version of the &#34;infinite monkeys&#34; thing: given enough software people, enough computers, and enough time, someone at a company will eventually grant universal remote root access to anyone who knows how to read some source code.

At one job, way back in the day, I had a dream that a shared web-hosting installer framework could give you root on whatever server hosted your stuff. Went to work the next day and indeed... it was true and trivially easy to exploit.Sadly, it was a custom wallpaper upload feature that ended up being the actual source of shenanigans. You get 3 guesses on what happened and probably need just one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Neural hash generated here might be a few bits off from one generated on an iOS device. This is expected since different iOS devices generate slightly different hashes anyway. The reason is that neural networks are based on floating-point calculations. The accuracy is highly dependent on the hardware. For smaller networks it won&#39;t make any difference. But NeuralHash has 200+ layers, resulting in significant cumulative errors.This is a little unexpected. I&#39;m not sure whether this has any implication on CSAM detection as whole. Wouldn&#39;t this require Apple to add multiple versions of NeuralHash of the same image (one for each platform/hardware) into the database to counter this issue? If that is case, doesn&#39;t this in turn weak the threshold of the detection as the same image maybe match multiple times in different devices?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now that the model is known, I wonder how hard it is to create &#34;adversarial collisions&#34;: given an image and a target hash, perturb the image in a way that is barely perceptible for a human, so that it matches the target hash."</p>

You might wholly disagree, but recent events aren&#39;t enough to get me to switch yet, because I think the competition has too many tradeoffs.I can get my photos scanned against a CSAM database... or I can have Google tracking my location constantly regardless of what they say (as they&#39;ve been proven to be misleading in the past)... or I can use a Linux phone and say goodbye to battery life and useful apps I need. I&#39;ll pick CSAM Scanning over my Location data being in the hands of Google, sorry.And as for my laptop, macOS doesn&#39;t scan, and the M1 is too impressive and has me spoiled. And I have too many horror stories with both Linux and Windows and can&#39;t stand either of them. (Don&#39;t tell me switch to Linux - I&#39;ve tried over a dozen distributions over the last decade. It&#39;s just not there yet.)"</p>

I haven’t investigated the Linuxability of this thing yet, but it’s super-light and impressive as a mosh terminal (especially with built-in 4G LTE!). Tough magnesium body, super comfy keyboard that’s easy to swap out if you beat it up. Made in Japan!I have a fully loaded MacBook Pro, and couldn’t imagine doing design work on anything else, but I somehow end up getting lots of work done on the Letsnote. It’s at a point where I don’t think I’ll be excited about the long-awaited new 14-inch MacBook Pro, as I doubt it’ll have a matte screen and a durable exterior (and, I much prefer to look like a sad worker stuck with a dorky computer from 2006, than a moneyed tech guy)."</p>

When it does one day leak (I imagine it will), we won’t overreact. We’ll just deal with that one case and continue with transparency.

The CEO of Netflix says this in Ch 5 of his book No Rules Rules. The leak is a predictable result and will happen again. He believes the tradeoff in openness is worth it. If this $3 million is the only incident, maybe he is right."</p>

I also wonder if someone tipped off the SEC or they just uncovered this in their own analysis work - it doesn&#39;t seem like making $3m off Netflix stock trades over a couple of years is particularly alarming on the surface, but idk I&#39;m not an expert... maybe the timing of the buy orders and also looking into what other trades they were making (if any) was easy to spot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HIV is incredibly sophisticated. It&#39;s actually kind of amazing how effective it is. I mean obviously the resulting disease is bad, no question. You can still appreciate the sophistication.HIV has resisted efforts to develop a vaccine for 30+ years at this point.I am already beginning to wonder if the 2020s will be the story of the social transformation caused by mRNA vaccines. An effective and relatively cheap HIV vaccine will be huge.Apart from Covid and HIV, mRNA is going to have a huge effect on the flu vaccine too. For anyone who doesn&#39;t know, predictions are made about what flu strains will dominate the coming winter 4-6+ months ahead of time and the vaccine is made from that. Those predictions may not be accurate, which largely explains the variance of efficacy. mRNA has the potential to reduce that down to 1-2 months so you can potentially react to the actual dominant strains.Cancer of course isn&#39;t a single disease. Even something like lung cancer are a collection of different diseases. But some cancers are caused by viruses. A notable example is cervical cancer where it seems like most cases are caused by HPV strains. Australia is on track to essentially eliminate cervical cancer by 2035 [1]. To be clear, this isn&#39;t an mRNA vaccine.But mRNA vaccines may greatly reduce the time required to develop a vaccine and make it possible to eliminate whole classes of diseases.This is all super-exciting.[1]: https://www.vcs.org.au/blog/our-impact/news/australia-can-co...."</p>

Based on a very rare side effect. Wtf? How can that be? Just tell people the risks of side effects, and if they are ok with that risk then the manufacturer is off the hook.I&#39;d totally take that shot. 59 cases out of 1.4 million is nothing, and even for those it&#39;s unclear how they actually were related to the shot.Sadly, this indicates that the new shot could suffer the same fate. Give it to a million people, some will for sure have some issue, anti-vaxers come with conspiracy theories and convince a few to a class action, and there we go, another few decades without a shot.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a US new england-er, this is game changer for walking through woods.For those un-informed, on a walk through any woods, you should always wear high socks, and do a full body check for ticks after.Deer ticks can be as small as a few grains of sand, and near undetectable if they latch on unless you have sharp eyes.Obviously they can transmit lymes.I had a close encounter a few years ago, but very luckily giant rings appeared around the bite site, making it a very easy diagnosis.That only happens in 30% of cases though. The rest likely have no idea, and over time the disease will work it&#39;s way into your nervous system, causing permanent damage if not treated quickly enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know this is about Lyme disease, but let me add another word of caution while we are discussing ticks.  Two years ago I was bit by the Lone Star tick.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article mentions losses at the hohlraum but doesn&#39;t mention losses in the laser. &#34;Ignition&#34; means they controled the implosion well enough to break (almost) even on laser energy, but the laser itself is less than 1% efficient on wall power. Input energy to the entire system is over 400 MJ per shot. Even at max theoretical fusion yield, it wouldn&#39;t come close to breakeven.There&#39;s also a firing rate issue. Even if the system produced net power, significant production would require many shots per second. Currently, the laser flash lamps are expendable and it takes on the order of a day (and lots of money) to prep for each shot.Some of these drawbacks were addressed in the LIFE proposal, which would use fusion neutrons to burn fission fuel in a blanket around the fusion chamber. You could burn spent reactor fuel subcritically (no fission chain reaction), for example. But then it&#39;s a fission machine, and criticality excursions aren&#39;t much of an issue in conventional fission reactors. In the end, there are many drawbacks and little benefit with such a setup -- even if it worked.I love lasers, and NIF is a marvel. But there really is no sensical story about power production in it. Even the machine&#39;s stated purpose -- stockpile maintenence -- is highly dubious. It is really an elaborate welfare machine, given to weapons scientists in exchange for their support of testing bans."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Herrmann noted that in previous experiments, neutrons exiting the capsule on one side of the implosion arrived a few picoseconds earlier than did those flying off the opposite wayLet’s all just take a step back here and marvel at this statement. We (science-humans) are capable of building a machine that can detect and quantify picosecond level variances in neutrons traveling in an enclosure.  We can do amazing things.Side note - the lab is just down the road from me, I’m proud of my fellow Livermorons, and continue to hope they keep all those megajoules contained."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading the info so far...I would advise a frugal dose of 
moderate optimist toned down with a spice of healthy scepticism:&#34;The lab hasn’t yet reproduced this month’s results, and Herrmann cautioned that doing so might not be straightforward. “We don’t know what variability will be in successive shots. It’s a nonlinear process where alpha heating heats up the fusion fuel and creates more fusion, which creates more heat.” Herrmann says the 3.5 MeV alpha particles, which remain in the plasma, produced 20% of the fusion yield, with 14 MeV neutrons accounting for most of the energy.&#34;&#34;The lab is still analyzing the results from the shot. It’s not yet known which or what combination of advances to the targets, laser pulse lengths, or other variables led to the leap in performance. Some of the instruments were saturated by the unexpected yield of the reaction. A few that are used in the target chamber for other, non-ignition experiments will need repair.&#34;&#34;Herrmann acknowledged that the announcement deviates from the standard practice of peer-reviewed publication. But the results, he says, were leaking, “so we wanted to put it out so people could discuss the facts.”  &#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Zoom has a popular feature which allows for screen sharing a single application window instead of the entire desktop. I assume this is how its discovering running applications with GUI windows open in a cross-platform manner. Perhaps there is a better API for this? Its not a common use-case that an app would need to know all of the other open windows, but it seems like a perfectly valid use case, and frankly handy for sharing a PPT without fear of an embarrassing email showing up in during a meeting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Why would it do that?We can answer part of that with just a little more reading.  What&#39;s pid 3844872?For me, the series of queries against /proc happen from a process that, just a bit earlier, called exec.  So it&#39;s not really zoom reading &#34;all processes and arguments&#34; but ... `pidof gnome-session`, so I guess zoom is looking for the pid of gnome-session.To what nefarious purpose zoom intends to put this knowledge of gnome-session&#39;s pid, I can&#39;t say - I am not running gnome-session so my trail goes cold; but at least for me, for that particular run, zoom itself doesn&#39;t actually see the contents of all of those files."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have no specific comment to make on the (first two chapters of the) book recommended by this blog. However I have become wary of people recommending a textbook because it finally helped them understand something they had tried to wrap their head around for years.I heard a conjecture once that the best textbook you&#39;ll find on any given topic is your third. The point, of course, is that it simply takes about three serious attempts to make it click - but it is a fallacy to give all the credit to the third book."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious what the target audience this book is for. The chapter &#34;Our Goal&#34; says that the books is to teach programmers how to engage mathematics, but programmers have wide range of mathematical maturity. The second theorem in the book is as follows:For any integer n &gt;= 0 and any list of n + 1 points (x[1], y[1]), ... , (x[n+1], y[n+1]) in R^2 with x[1] &lt; x[2] &lt; ... &lt; x[n+1], there exists a unique polynomial p(x) of degree at most n such tat p(x[i]) = y[i] for all i.So, it seems the author assumes that a reader will have math maturity of a good senior high-school student, as most of students wouldn&#39;t need to worry about property of existence. The book also covers the proof of such theorem with formal notations and the proof is built up with previous theorems -- a pretty standard way in math books which nonetheless requires math maturity of a good high school senior. The table of contents also shows that the book will cover linear algebra, calculus, and group theory in a whirlwind. Again, such content demands close-to-college-level math maturity. I&#39;m also generous here, as public schools of the US do not really teach that much formal math.So, here is the dilemma: people with this level of maturity should already be good at math or have access to other materials to help them with math. People who do not possess such maturity will not go through the book anyway, or have more beginner-friendly materials to read. Note I&#39;m sure there are exceptions, but I question the percentage of such exception."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I maintain that it isn&#39;t just hard, it is computationally impossible.We should all know that given a belief about the world, and evidence, Bayes&#39; Theorem describes how to update our beliefs.But what if we have a network of interrelated beliefs?  That&#39;s called a Bayesian net, and it turns out that Bayes&#39; Theorem also prescribes a unique answer.  However, unfortunately, it turns out that working out that answer is NP-hard.OK, you say, we can come up with an approximate answer.  Sorry, no, coming up with an approximate answer that gets within probability 0.5 - ε, for 0 &lt; ε, is ALSO NP-hard.  It is literally true that under the right circumstances a single data point logically should be able to flip our entire world view, and which data point does it is computationally intractible.Therefore our brains use a bunch of heuristics, with a bunch of known failure modes.  You can read all the lesswrong you want. You can read Thinking, Fast and Slow and learn why we fail as we do.  But the one thing that we cannot do, no matter how much work or effort we put into it, is have the sheer brainpower required to actually BE rational.The effort of doing better is still worthwhile.  But the goal itself is unachievable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are some good bits in here. I love the subtitle especially: &#34;The real challenge isn’t being right but knowing how wrong you might be.&#34; Knowing when not to provide an answer is hard. A big part of my job is communicating statistical findings and giving a good non-answer is much harder than giving a good answer, both technically speaking and socially speaking.One thing I&#39;ll add that drives me nuts is the fetishization of bayesian reasoning I see some times here on HN. There are times that bayesian reasoning is helpful and times that it isn&#39;t. Specifically, when you don&#39;t trust your model, bayes rule can mislead you badly (frequently when it comes to missing/counterfactual data). It&#39;s just a tool. There are others. It makes me crazy when it&#39;s someone&#39;s only hammer, so everything starts to look like a nail. Sometimes, more appropriate tools leave you without an answer.Apparently that&#39;s not something we&#39;re willing to live with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think most game styles do not fit the &#34;open source&#34; development model. Mainly because games often need a &#34;surprise effect&#34; when released and that is a poorly fit for open development and also because it is easier to contribute code than convince an artist to contribute art tailored to a very specific style.RTS and games like Wesnoth are an exception: they are born a certain way and slowly evolve through contributions to a point where they sometimes finally became very interesting. I have high hopes for the future of 0ad."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To those here riffing on the theme of “this misrepresents the volume and beneficiaries of the transactions involved” - you’re not wrong. Accurate representation of public info like this is a top organisational problem for our species at the moment.But I do think you miss the point, so aptly put by Mr Eisenhower:“Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed. This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter with a half-million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people. . . . This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.”In a strictly limited sense, I’d rather get my cross of iron at 66% off than for the full $6.4T. Better yet would be universal healthcare, enough homes to go round, clean, sustainable energy production systems, and bridges that keep on bridging."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“Medicare for all”, the single payer universal healthcare system in the US, was projected to cost between $16-34T [1] over a decade. I know there are some big questions around the actual cost of US aggression / state terrorism since 9/11 (ie 6.4T vs 2T as per other entries in this thread). A rough 80/20 analysis suggests:* We could have funded free healthcare to roughly one quarter of the US population for 10 years (see [1])
* We could have funded free medication for all US citizens for 20 years (assuming US spends an average $1100/yr per patient, approx double of other countries [2], viz a biz the estimated spend of $1K USD / yr per US citizen spent over 20 years on aggression since 9-11 mentioned above)
* …I quite like the following quote by Noam Chomsky on US international terror in Afghanistan (and Nicaragua, Iraq, Sudan and many other places):“ The U.S. is officially committed to what is called “low–intensity warfare.” That’s the official doctrine. If you read the definition of low–intensity conflict in army manuals and compare it with official definitions of “terrorism” in army manuals, or the U.S. Code, you find they’re almost the same. Terrorism is the use of coercive means aimed at civilian populations in an effort to achieve political, religious, or other aims. That’s what the World Trade Center bombing was, a particularly horrifying terrorist crime. And that’s official doctrine. I mentioned a couple of examples. We could go on and on. It’s simply part of state action, not just the U.S. of course.” [3]It sums up the meaninglessness quite well.[1] https://www.crfb.org/blogs/how-much-will-medicare-all-cost

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps they should&#39;ve spent this much on medical research instead.  For the same money perhaps we could save a few million people dying of various diseases or cancer.  It would take a whole lot of terrorist events to counter the benefits of significant R&amp;D funding for medicine (or maybe a lot of other things)."</p>

In real-life you can tell your bandmates to &#34;just play a I V IV in C&#34; and they get it. But we are still not quite at a place where we can tell a computer that exact phrase and get something useful. I love how close these text-based languages are getting though!I&#39;ve actually made my own musical language too - called miti [1], which is just one of many others including textbeat [2], foxdot [3], sonic-pi [4], chuck [5], and melrose [6].

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sorry to be a downer here, but can someone explain to me what the appeal of these projects are? In the past year or so I&#39;ve seen a number of text-based music notation projects hit the front page of Hacker News and don&#39;t really understand the purpose they are trying to achieve.If I want to transport music notation between software programs, I have MIDI for that, which does a good job of capturing all elements of a performance (keys, timing, velocity, pedals, aftertouch, etc.) These types of notation formats almost always fail to achieve MIDIs precision across all the aspects of a performance.If I want to compose music, I need a format that makes it easy to visualize and manipulate notes in context of the other notes playing across all instruments. DAW piano rolls do a fantastic job of overlaying note information, and traditional combined scores do the same too. Again, text notation usually falls flat here - for example, if you had a large ensemble, and wanted to know which chord was being played on the 2nd beat of the 5th measure, how easily can do you do that? How do you determine if it&#39;s an open spacing or closed spacing? How do you determine the root without walking back through all the octave shifts?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What&#39;s funny about having to rely on unauthorized clones to provide a fast native UX was that Spotify&#39;s original client back in 2008 started out as beautifully light, custom rendered native client.Few Apps ever had that wow factor the first time I used it, it was so much lighter and more responsive than anything else of the day. I remember being perplexed at how I could search and skip to any part of a song quicker than iTunes could looking at a local library. Everything was latency-free and instantaneous.We were building a Music Startup at the time, so we investigated how it worked. We we’re very surprised we couldn’t find any evidence of an established UI toolkit. It looked as though they had built their own custom UI renderer and optimized TCP protocol which sent back its metadata in XML. Their traffic looked like it was initially seeded from their own (or CDN) servers (for best latency) and then overtime we would see some P2P traffic on the wire.Our QT/C++ client had decent performance but was noticeably heavier than Spotify&#39;s. I was disappointed to see their native client eventually be abandoned and succumb to become yet another Chromium wrapper. I expect it fell to the pressures of a growing startup adding 100s of developers (without the skill of their original CTO/devs) where a native UI couldn&#39;t be updated and re-iterated as fast as a Web App. I wish they maintained 2 desktop clients, and left their native client alone to just be an audio player and push all their new social features to their new flagship CEF app.It&#39;s unfortunate the skill and desire of building fast native UIs are being lost to Electron and CEF wrappers. Seems the larger the organization the more likely they are to build new Web rendered Desktop Apps and we have to rely on unauthorized Indie efforts like this for fast, responsive native UIs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing that has devastated me about recent Spotify updates is that now, when viewing an Artist, you do not get to see all of the albums (or at least the first 10 newest albums) for that artist straight away with all of the tracks listed. It&#39;s now much harder to find a song that you don&#39;t know the title of, but you know an artist has sung.It&#39;s also small changes that are extremely annoying. Pressing &#34;New Playlist&#34; used to come up with a dialog box asking what the playlist should be named. Now it just gets called &#34;New Playlist&#34;. Clicking the playlist name to rename it does not automatically select the textbox to give it a name, meaning that to create a new named playlist - an action that used to take one click, is at least three clicks and two keyboard presses... I mean, come on Spotify!The search bar used to always be visible. Now I need to click search first, then click the search bar.To me, Spotify was the epitome of software completion five years ago. The client worked. It was perfect. It seems like every single update since they released the &#34;Daily Mixes&#34;  has both downgraded the performance of the app, and made discoverability harder. I want Spotify how it was 18 months ago.Spotify on my machine sometimes chews up 2GB of RAM. Reached out to support, and the best that they can give is &#34;try restarting the app&#34;. That helps, until 12 hours later you need to do it again. A music player should not have 10% CPU usage on a modern MacBook.Finding Psst has been a life changer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At this point, I&#39;d be willing to pay for a Spotify client that works exactly the same, but just ignores the existence of podcasts entirely. I use a dedicated podcast client when I want to listen to podcasts, and they keep shoving them in my face and taking up precious UI real estate everywhere.But any client without support for Spotify Connect might as well be dead to me. Controlling my wifi speakers from my phone, or playing music on my desktop Mac from my laptop or gaming PC is critical functionality at this point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I disagree with the idea that SPF, DKIM and DMARC are somehow hard. They&#39;re all one-liners in DNS config that can easily be generated with some online tools if you don&#39;t want to read the standard. In my experience, correctly configuring mail server software is a lot harder than configuring the DNS to make your email arrive as reliably as possible. Obscure configuration formats are par for the course for almost every mail server setup.I&#39;ve personally had a much harder time getting DNSSEC to work than I ever had issues with the various email DNS records. Even that is manageable if you&#39;re willing to Google around for a while.My solution to getting self-hosted email right is using Mailcow. A cheap VPS (Contabo FTW) plus Docker is all you need to get it to work, and it spits out all the DNS records you might need to add. That also includes autoconfig records for tons of software, which is nice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Normally, this means that spf.messagingengine.com has its own SPF DNS record, which will probably list some valid IP addresses that emails can be sent from. There&#39;s also one for Mandrill, for transactional emails. You can have as many of these as you want.This isn&#39;t strictly true (that you can have as many as you want), because SPF has a (IMO) very silly hard limit of 10 DNS lookups per record. From RFC 7208:&gt; Some mechanisms and modifiers (collectively, &#34;terms&#34;) cause DNS queries at the time of evaluation, and some do not.  The following terms cause DNS queries: the &#34;include&#34;, &#34;a&#34;, &#34;mx&#34;, &#34;ptr&#34;, and &#34;exists&#34; mechanisms, and the &#34;redirect&#34; modifier.  SPF implementations MUST limit the total number of those terms to 10 during SPF evaluation, to avoid unreasonable load on the DNS.  If this limit is exceeded, the implementation MUST return &#34;permerror&#34;.We see this not infrequently at Fastmail, when customers report DMARC validation problems, and the answer turns out to be that they&#39;ve got too many includes in their SPF records, so SPF always fails."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s another angle to the App Store scam: Family Sharing.Most people don&#39;t know this but the &#34;Parent&#34; (read:credit card holder) of a family sharing account can&#39;t see, let alone cancel, any subscriptions a minor on the account has purchased.Let that sink in for a second. Apple will happily charge the parents&#39; credit card a weekly recurring fee but there is nowhere in their interface (on device nor on the web) where the parent can even see that subscription.[0]Apple expects the child to go into their interface and cancel the recurring subscription. Something many (most?) adults find confusing. In my case, the child just deleted the App when the trial was over. Which is of course perfectly logical thinking. No bueno.So if the child is away at school (as in my case), or the phone gets left at a friend&#39;s house, or worse... stolen. The only way to get it cancelled is to call them.There&#39;s more to this story, including details on how the built in parental controls are intentionally crippled (IMHO) but I&#39;ve got to run. In summary: The entire &#34;Family Sharing&#34; system is built to rip off people while still maintaining plausible deniability.[0] A senior Apple rep told me this is for privacy reasons. But two things: the minor should have no expectation of privacy when spending their parents money (how is that a good thing?). And secondly, Apple does email a receipt for the subscription to the card holder... so the privacy excuse was pure bullshit. In my case I missed the email because I have more than 6 or 7 recurring Apple subscriptions. I do take partial blame because of that. But I&#39;ve still not been given a good reason why a parent can&#39;t easily cancel a childs subscription."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The submitter of this story here on HN is the developer of FlickType. He had also filed a lawsuit against Apple for allowing apps that have been outright cheating people with incredibly high in-app purchases and has pointed out several instances of scammy apps.I thought larger companies keep tabs on the &#34;noisy and popular&#34; ones in media (and social media) and would take more care not to annoy them further. But this story makes it seem like Apple has decided to just keep pushing his buttons as some sort of punishment.I don&#39;t believe there&#39;s anyone capable in Apple top leadership who&#39;s spending any time in leading the App Store team appropriately. The scammy apps and the contrasting meaningless rejections of praiseworthy apps only tell one thing – the App Store is an abandoned space run by &#34;bots&#34; with almost no oversight.As an Apple iDevice user for long, this story (from the beginning) as well as others have made me wish for alternate app stores on iDevices enforced through regulation. The wait has been too long already, and Apple isn&#39;t being the steward it imagines itself to be or portrays itself in media to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Right. As I&#39;ve pointed out previously, Tesla seems to be unable to detect sizable stationary obstacles that are partly blocking a lane, especially if they don&#39;t look like the rear end of a car. In addition to emergency vehicles, Teslas on autopilot have plowed into freeway barriers and a street sweeper. That&#39;s the usual situation for first responders, who usually try to block as little of the road as possible but often don&#39;t have enough shoulder space.It&#39;s clear what Tesla really has - a good lane follower and cruise control that slows down for cars ahead. That&#39;s a level 2 system. That&#39;s useful, but, despite all the hype about &#34;full self driving&#34;, it seems that&#39;s all they&#39;ve got.&#34;Full self driving&#34; just adds some lane-changing assistance and hints from the nav system."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why I believe the approach of incremental improvement towards full self driving is fundamentally flawed. These advanced driver assist tools are good enough to lull users into a false sense of security. No amount of &#34;but our terms and conditions say you need to always pay attention!&#34; will overcome human nature building that trust and dependence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people in here saying it is not possible to drive safely with partial self driving.  I wonder, how many of those people have actually driven a car with autopilot?I have autopilot on my car, and it definitely makes me a better and safer driver.  It maintains my distance from the car in front and my speed while keeping me in my lane, so my brain no longer has to worry about those mundane things.  Instead I can spend all my brainpower focused on looking for potential emergencies, instead of splitting time between lane keeping/following and looking for emergencies.I no longer have to look at my speedometer or the lane markers, I can take a much broader view of the traffic and conditions around me.Before you say it&#39;s impossible to be safe driving with an assistive product, I suggest trying one out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh, this is exciting. The performance and latency is a huge variable though.For a lot of these experimental hacker-friendly devices, I&#39;m willing to tolerate a lot of compromises. Even here, the software, the out-of-the-box experience isn&#39;t really that important to me. Arguably, you can get away with even more compromise on a device like this than on something like the Pinephone. But it has to have amazing pen performance, or it&#39;s just not worth working with. Everything else except that is either fixable or something that probably isn&#39;t getting in the way of the core point of the device.IMO Remarkable got this right -- their software support is by many metrics quite bad (although I guess it&#39;s slowly started to improve). Their device handles PDFs kind of poorly from what I can tell. It&#39;s expensive. The interface seems slower and more laggy than many other EReaders. But none of that really matters, what matters is they have arguably the best pen latency and physical texturing on the E-ink market, and that writing on the device feels good.So the same thing applies here: the price seems completely reasonable to me, I have no issues with a $400 price tag. I&#39;d pay $600, the price isn&#39;t the issue. But I need to see videos and testimonial that the pen latency isn&#39;t just &#34;acceptable&#34;, but that it&#39;s really good. Otherwise it&#39;s not even worth $100.Writing experience is one of those things where once you get used to a lack of latency/offset, and used to a more accurate feel, it gets progressively harder and harder to go back to anything that&#39;s worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like a direct competitor to the Remarkable[0] which I own, and is a great device. The Remarkable is also &#34;mostly&#34; open. The main binary running the UI of the system is proprietary, but the Linux system underneath is ssh-able, and the hacking community of the device is pretty active and large [1].Looking at the announcement page of the PineNote I&#39;m very excited! I&#39;m hoping the open software running on the PineNote will be comparable to the Remarkable, and if it is I&#39;m definitely going to be making the switch.As a side note, I&#39;m hoping maybe this encourages the Remarkable team to open source their proprietary binary. Their advantage here is definitely the hardware not the software.[0] https://remarkable.com/[1] https://github.com/reHackable/awesome-reMarkable"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a pretty sweet looking device. Even despite this call out “As for the actual user interface, we’re currently talking to the good folks at KDE and trying to figure out whether Plasma Mobile or regular Plasma (with panel-specific tweaks of course) will be the best fit for this particular device. As you can probably tell, this is an uncharted territory for all parties involved, but we’ll figure it out. Needless to say, the software isn’t finished – indeed, we don’t really even know yet what will work well with this technology and what won’t. It is just the beginning of our journey with e-ink technology, and it will take a long time and much effort to make the PineNote end-user worthy.” This still seems worthwhile to pre order if you’re a heavy reader and note taker.Anyone know how this compares with the remarkable?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are two interesting (to me) books on Pixar - one is by the (tech) founder Ed Catmull and is good on the storytelling and hard work side, and a really good &#34;other side of the coin&#34; is by Lawrence Levy who Jobs brought in as &#34;the money guy&#34; to find a way to make Pixar profitable as they tried to land Toy Story - it goes from a little way into the pre-production of the film all the way to the IPO - and it really shines a light on the inner thinking.  No one really had a clue how to monetise things, the IPO was a huge risk etc etc.Fascinating all of it, But for me the big thing to contrast is how Ed Catmull described the IPO (how did Steve plan this, how did he know? I am axed at his business acumen) versus Levy (we were all terrified, movie studios refused to give us their business models, the IPO could have failed at any moment).In short there is always several sides to a story, and if anyone is confident of a future plan but has not done it twenty times before, they are faking it !"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t buy the whole premise about storytelling being the big thing.  In particular I think doing the thing is much much much much much more important than telling the story.  If you do the thing then the story tells itself.I was 1 of a team of 2 or 3 on every pitch in 2 or 3 separate processes to raise over 1bn dollars and make the company I worked for (OakNorth) the most valuable fintech in Europe at the time. We did about 30 investor meetings covering everyone in the PE world, some of the big tech investors, some key VCs, some family offices etc.  We ended up massively oversubscribed so and picked the investors we thought were the best fit. In every single pitch the most important things were:    1. your company should actually do something important/valuable.  Solve an important problem etc.
    2. you should have a plan for a future where the unit economics work, and you should know the plan inside and out
    3. you should have thought through something about how what your company does intersects with *this particular investor&#39;s* interests, and be able to articulate that clearly
    4. You should have clear asks - not just money for valuation but what else you&#39;re looking to get from them (strategic advice, intros, synergies with other companies in their portfolio etc).

The deck, pitch itself etc are much less important than doing something important and actually knowing what you&#39;re talking about. In particular, avoid the thought that you can hack the process with a slick pitch and a cool-looking deck.  It may take you to a first meeting, but it&#39;s not going to get you to close with anyone of substance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That way of boiling down Finding Nemo seems to miss why the story is designed that way.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In other HN comments on this subject I&#39;ve (hopefully) made it clear that I&#39;m not really in favor of this project of Apple&#39;s, and that there&#39;s a legitimate &#34;slippery slope&#34; argument to be made here. So I hope people will entertain a contrarian question without downvoting me into oblivion. :)Here&#39;s the thing I keep circling around: assume that bad actors, government or otherwise, want to target political dissidents using internet-enabled smartphones. The more we learn about the way Apple actually implemented this technology, the less likely it seems that it would make it radically easier for those bad actors to do so. For instance, the &#34;it only scans photos uploaded to iCloud&#34; element isn&#39;t just an arbitrary limitation that can be flipped with one line of code, as some folks seem to think; as Erik Neuenschwander, head of Privacy Engineering at Apple, explained in an interview on TechCrunch[1]:&gt; Our system involves both an on-device component where the voucher is created, but nothing is learned, and a server-side component, which is where that voucher is sent along with data coming to Apple service and processed across the account to learn if there are collections of illegal CSAM. That means that it is a service feature.Will this stop those bad actors if they&#39;re determined? No, of course not, but there are so many ways they can do it already. They&#39;ll get cloud storage providers to give them access. If they can&#39;t, they&#39;ll get network providers to give them access. And if those bad actors are, as many people fear, government actors, then they have tools far more potent than code: they have laws. It was illegal to export &#34;strong encryption&#34; for many years, remember? I&#39;ve seen multiple reports that European lawmakers are planning to require some kind of scanning for CSAM. If this goes into effect, technology isn&#39;t going to block those laws for you. Your Purism phone will either be forced to comply or be illegal.I wrote in a previous comment on this that one of Silicon Valley&#39;s original sins is that we tend to treat all problems as if they&#39;re engineering problems. Apple is treating CSAM as an engineering problem. Most of the discussion on HN about how horrible and wrong Apple is here still treats it as an engineering problem, though: well, you can get around this by just turning off iCloud Photos or never using Apple software or throwing your iPhone in the nearest lake and switching to Android, but only the right kind of Android, or maybe just never doing anything with computers again, which admittedly will probably be effective.Yet at the end of the day, this isn&#39;t an engineering problem. It&#39;s a policy problem. It&#39;s a governance problem. In the long run, we solve this, at least in liberal democracies, by voting people into office who understand technology, understand the value of personal encryption, and last but certainly not least, understand the value of, well, liberal democracy. I know that&#39;s easy to dismiss as Pollyannaism, but &#34;we need to protect ourselves from our own government&#34; has a pretty dismal track record historically. The entire point of having a liberal democracy is that we are the government, and we can pull it back from authoritarianism.The one thing that Apple is absolutely right about is that expanding what those hashes check for is a policy decision. Maybe where those hashes get checked isn&#39;t really what we need to be arguing about.[1]: https://techcrunch.com/2021/08/10/interview-apples-head-of-p..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Apple will publish a Knowledge Base article containing a root hash of the encrypted CSAM hash database included with each version of every Apple operating system that supports the feature. Additionally, users will be able to inspect the root hash of the en- crypted database present on their device, and compare it to the expected root hash in the Knowledge Base article.This is just security theater, they already sign the operating system images where the database reside. And there is no way to audit that the database is what they claim it is, doesn&#39;t contain multiple databases that can be activated under certain conditions, etc.&gt; This feature runs exclusively as part of the cloud storage pipeline for images being up- loaded to iCloud Photos and cannot act on any other image content on the deviceUntil a 1-line code change happens that hooks it into UIImage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t like the idea of stuff running on my device, consuming my battery and data, when the only point is to see if I am doing something wrong?An analogy I can come up with is: the government hires people to visit your house every day, and while they’re there they need your resources (say, food, water, and electricity).

To give you a sense of him, I went to a conference on dynamics that he organized about six years ago, and he opened it with the following story:Many years ago, the philosopher Nasreddin was on his farm looking out into the distance and saw some people approaching.  He had heard that there were bandits in the area and became afraid that they would come, beat him, and steal all his things.  So Nasreddin ran away.  As he ran, he came to a graveyard, and there he found an open grave.  In case the bandits followed him, he decided to take off all his clothes, get in the grave, and pretend to be dead.It turned out that the men were not bandits, but were Nasreddin&#39;s friends.  They saw him run off and wondered where he was going and so followed him.  As they were walking through the graveyard, they came upon the open grave and saw Nasreddin lying there naked.  So they asked him, &#34;Nasreddin, why are you lying in this grave with all your clothes off?&#34;Nasreddin opened his eyes and saw it was his friends, and replied, &#34;My friends, there are some questions which have no answers.  All I can tell you is that I am here because of you, and you are here because of me.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"T-Mobile has had recurring data security deficiencies. I know because I served as CTO of the FCC&#39;s Enforcement Bureau, before returning to academia.In 2017, the FCC determined that T-Mobile had violated federal law in a data breach involving customer credit information [1]. There was reportedly no fine because Congress has imposed a strict one-year statute of limitations on FCC enforcement actions.In 2020, the FCC charged T-Mobile with again violating federal law in failing to protect customer location information [2]. The FCC proposed a $91.6M fine, widely criticized as insufficient at the time [3-4]. I don&#39;t believe the FCC has finalized or collected that penalty.There have been several other incidents, including in 2018 [5], 2019 [6], early 2020 [7], and late 2020 [8].I hope there has not been a new data breach. But if there has been, this is the latest in a pattern, and the incentives have to change.[1] https://www.nexttv.com/news/fcc-admonishes-t-mobile-breach-1...[2] https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-proposes-916m-fine-against-...[3] https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-20-27A4.pdf[4] https://docs.fcc.gov/public/attachments/FCC-20-27A5.pdf[5] https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/24/17776836/tmobile-hack-dat...[6] https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-disc...[7] https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-data...[8] https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/t-mobile-data..."</p>

E.g. John Smith ss#123-45-6789 (T-mobile, Experian) has a false refund filed in his name, $10k in legal costs associated with clearing his name, t-mobile and experian each owe him $5k…Until companies are held accountable for the negative externalities they are causing, this won’t end."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple of weeks ago I was receiving someone else&#39;s T-Systems internet contract and personal data via email. The customer was from Munich. I live in The Netherlands. I was more than 10 years ago customer of T-Mobile Austria.I immediately informed T-Systrms via their crappy contact form on their crappy website. After a couple of days I received an e-mail which I could not reply to, asking me to provide more proof that I was receiving someone else&#39;s emails through. It also said I can&#39;t reply directly to the email and I had to provide this info via their crappy contact form on their crappy website.I refused to do so, since I had already given them the name, address, and customer id of their new customer and it seemed that the procedure is going to be unnecesarily time consuming.After that I received emails about tracking of a package containing the hardware for the internet connection. Then I received an email that nobody was home to pick up the delivery and when the next attempt will be. UAnd utimately that the package was going to ve returned. After that I guess the customer got in touch with T-Systems and fixed the email error.Nobody from T-Systems contacted me asking to destroy the documents and emails containing someone else&#39;s personal data."</p>

1. Learn Rust.
2. Having a code that I wrote run on large amount of devices across the world.Eventually I ended up on MeiliSearch repo, I fixed an interesting bug, and I must say that the maintainers were super nice across all the process, a couple of months after my contribution they sent hand written letters and a bunch of stickers to all of the project contributors, one of the nicest interactions I ever had on the internet (ironically the first PR that I wrote that got accepted involved one line of CSS, which is field I&#39;m proficient at)."</p>

They were grabbing as many pages as you had set for max pages at once and would re query it on pagination - huge waste of data transfer. They refused to see the problem so I just did a private fork just to get it working but far as I know that’s still a bug.I need to upgrade the engine itself but looks like they added the ability to upgrade and not lose all the data.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The older and more experience I get the more I find myself turning into a complexity zealot, to a really extremist extent. Every time I see something introduced at any level that isn&#39;t 100% strictly necessary to the problem being solved it triggers a kind of accumulated PTSD is almost physically painful.I know everyone thinks they like simplicity but my observation is that about 95% of software developers have a complexity fetish. Literally any opportunity they get to introduce something over and above what is essential to the job they are doing they will do it. For many its almost built in as a part of their value system (if all I do is solve the basic problem then I&#39;m just a mediocre mundane developer right? I want to be a rock star who develops frameworks and invents new things that other people use).  And yet the epitome of genius in my mind is finding the solution that solves the problem without introducing anything at all.Again, I know 80% of the people reading my comments right here will nod their heads and identify with it and yet still go away and see themselves as exceptions to the rule and create another abstract class or define an optional configuration file or make their code automatically parse an extra environment variable with a regular expression or .... you get it....We had to add something to the database the other day. Big argument. Should be one to many? many to many? what if this or that happens? what if requirements change? You know what - for the requirement wa actually had it was solvable with a single integer field on an existing table. But this is a battle that has to be fought ... over and over and over ..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is one more level where you hate everything, but then embrace loving the people that make shit.I bought a new truck, and after putting 100 miles on it the transmission started acting strange. I take it in, and they don&#39;t know what is wrong with it. So, they are going to replace the entire transmission next week.Now, I could say &#34;oh, why did I buy that brand&#34; or be like &#34;lolz, these people are n00bs&#34;. Instead, I realize that they are making something at a massive scale and bad things will happen, so I&#39;ll accept the inconvenience and move on with my life. Shit happens, and that&#39;s life.I&#39;ve hated software for a long time because I value precision and reliability, but these are exceptionally hard to scale organizationally. Suppose you fix reliability today, well tomorrow&#39;s feature could just fuck it up.Now, I still hate software, but I come at with a mindset that software is an artifact of a culture which requires nurturing and love."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It goes both ways. I certainly hate un-needed complexity but somethings are just complex. Good examples are font rendering https://gankra.github.io/blah/text-hates-you/ and text input https://lord.io/text-editing-hates-you-too/  You think it&#39;s going to be easy. It&#39;s not. It just isn&#39;t.Often software is too simple. I just recently got my first &#34;Smart Lights&#34; (my mistake). I&#39;m using Apple Home to control them. I put 3 bulbs in a 3 bulb standing lamp. Home has no way to for me to designate those as a single lamp. To Home they are 3 lamps. The solution is supposed to be use normal bulbs and a smart switch. But that precludes being able to set the colors of the bulbs. In other words, they thought it was simple but it&#39;s not.It gets worse. At first I thought this would be cool, but now I realize if I have a house guest, they won&#39;t be able to turn on the lights if I left them off. Arguably, if the power is cut and comes back on, maybe the lights should default to full white? At least then, in an emergency they just work. But again, designing lights that do that would be more complexity, not less.I can even add another wrinkle. My Siri is set to Japanese. So, my English speaking house guests will not be able to ask for the lights to be turned on if I had a HomePod, which I don&#39;t. More complexity because the world is complex"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The silver lining of using this complicated DCP interface is that DCP does in fact run a huge amount of code – the DCP firmware is over 7MB! It implements complicated algorithms like DisplayPort link training, real-time memory bandwidth calculations, handling the DisplayPort to HDMI converter in the Mac mini, enumerating valid video modes and performing mode switching, and more. It would be a huge ordeal to reverse engineer all of this and implement it as a raw hardware driver, so it is quite likely that, in the end, we will save time by using this higher-level interface and leaving all the dirty work to the DCP. In particular, it is likely that newer Apple Silicon chips will use a shared DCP codebase and the same interface for any given macOS version, which gives us support for newer chips “for free”, with only comparatively minor DCP firmware ABI updates.How interesting: by moving some of the driver to firmware, Apple has effectively made it easier for OSs like Linux to have good support for the hardware, because the OS&lt;-&gt;hardware protocol operates at a higher level of abstraction and may work across multiple chips.The trade-off is that the protocol is not stable and so Linux has to decide which versions it will support, and make sure the OS driver always matches the version of the hardware firmware:&gt; As a further twist, the DCP interface is not stable and changes every macOS version! [...] Don’t fret: this doesn’t mean you won’t be able to upgrade macOS. This firmware is per-OS, not per-system, and thus Linux can use a different firmware bundle from any sibling macOS installations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since there are clearly a lot of people who have been following the asahi development in detail, I would like to hear your takes on this quote from their FAQ:&gt; No, Apple still controls the boot process and, for example, the firmware that runs on the Secure Enclave Processor. However, no modern device is “fully open” - no usable computer exists today with completely open software and hardware (as much as some companies want to market themselves as such).I think they&#39;re aiming at purism here, but might have forgotten about the MNT Reform, even though it is currently specced at the lower end of &#34;usable&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Now we know that it’s possible to make really good transistors with impure chemicals, no cleanroom, and homemade equipment.The good news here is that 2 of those 3 issues are pretty easily solvable.  With some work, and a ton of HEPA air purifier machines, you could probably turn an area the size of a small shed or 1 car garage into a class 10000 cleanrom pretty easily.  It would be simplest if this area were embedded in a larger area, like a 2 car garage, but, you could probably squeeze it into just a plain old 1 car garage.Chemicals, you can buy online from scientific supply houses.  Some, like acetone, you can buy from less specialized sources in high purity.  Water and alcohol, you can either buy at high purity pretty easily, or buy lower grade stuff and purify it.Of course, at the point where you&#39;re going for higher purity stuff like this, you might want to switch from acetone as a solvent to DMSO.  DMSO itself is safe to handle and doesn&#39;t evaporate like acetone will.&gt; SilaneYeah, nasty stuff.  Toxic as hell, ignites spontaneously when exposed to air.

To the people saying that this just instills propaganda about specific news sources: consider learning a little bit more about the class.It teaches about how to tell journalism apart from other kinds of information, like entertainment and opinion; the hallmarks of good reporting, like transparency; discerning assertion from verification, and evidence from inference; the idea of seeking out multiple sources and how to reconcile them, etc.  It&#39;s more a toolbox of how to inform oneself, regardless of any specific source.It definitely included examples of bad reporting from all sorts of sources, because the message is that its ideas are applicable to any source of information.Ideas: https://www.centerfornewsliteracy.org/what-is-news-literacy/Class: https://www.centerfornewsliteracy.org/stony-brooks-center-fo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO the most effective and most widely deployed (especially among the supposedly more reputable publications) propaganda tool isn’t outright lies, but rather, selective reporting of cherry-picked facts and omission of others to shape stories into their predefined narratives. TFA doesn’t address that at all. It seems to me that students’ main takeaway from this course would be to trust NPR, NYT and the like, rather than viral content. Which is of course great for NPR, but doesn’t help when your “trustworthy” media selection decide to suppress all arguments from another side, or remain silent on certain stories altogether.Note: This comment was expanded a few times, but the gist remained the same.Edit: No, I’m not saying “trust NPR, NYT and the like instead of viral content you see on Facebook” isn’t a good takeaway. I’m saying the more effective type of propaganda (at least for people who don’t tend to fall for the obvious crap) isn’t discussed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given the primary example used on the kids, the 2016 election, this seems more about instilling bias under the name &#34;news literacy&#34;.  Are they going to do a section studying the &#34;coverage&#34; of hunter biden&#39;s laptop?  Remember, for weeks it was cast as Russian propaganda.  What about the origins of covid.. will they discuss how at first the lab leak theory was discarded as &#34;misinformation&#34;?  I could not trust a public school to ever touch such topics.This is as comforting as hearing that schools are teaching religion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I investigated egui early this year. It&#39;s a very good library! For me, getting used to immediate mode UI was a change from being used to DOM / React-style UI. imgui works well for a lot but it struggles with complex layouts, eg flexbox. This is acknowledged in egui&#39;s READMECouple things I built with egui:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use this in a few of my projects. Simple, no complaints. Compile time is faster than it takes for me to yawn most of the time (using mold linker and sccache, which improves compile time a lot with a far superior linker and caching compiled dependencies, respectively).(Edit to add: below complaint is entirely within rust and irrelevant to this library)Only problem (not the fault of egui) is sometimes the elements disallow me using the templateapp object mutably as a whole: sometimes I have to mut borrow a part of `self` before the ui part (instead of mutating `self.whatever` within the UI element, I have to do `let borrow = self.whatever.borrow_mut()` before the UI element then call that borrow) which seemed odd to me as a beginner. I think this is mostly a rust &#34;problem&#34; but also maybe because of how UI element creation was designed.If you understand the borrow rules then you&#39;ll probably understand it fine. I might be able to just lock an Arc Mutex instead and avoid the problem but I just learned how to use them so :p"</p>

These people are already working or looking to work remotely to companies in richer countries (e.g. UK, Germany, Sweden, Switzerland) and are already profiting for this. I personally switched to a remote-only job and got the biggest raise of my career, with a salary that no local company can match unless we are talking C-level manager position."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What bothers me more is that these tech companies aren’t even trying to have a conversation with their employees. If they did a survey and collected opinions from their employees the decision would be pretty trivial. But the managerial gang knows that and they want to side step it.The companies want to pretend they care about the employees. They claim to be giving them perks. In reality, these perks are just gamification to make the employee spend more time in the office.The managerial gang gamified CS careers with silly interviews and performance reviews. They gamified apps and information dispersal. Entire democracies were at stake and nothing changed.WFH won’t ever happen. These managers have to maintain appearances, name drop names and pretend to be “in the know”. Every engineer knows that 90% of these people are like language models regurgitating what they’ve heard. They can’t do that effectively via video.To me this is the most blatant admission of their inability to measure developer productivity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve only just skimmed through this. And it&#39;s a subject I already know so I can&#39;t tell if it&#39;s actually a good resource. However, my initial impression is that I love it.I think that textbooks, math textbooks in particular, are an example where print publishing does a disservice. (I&#39;m counting PDFs here too.) By having to lay everything out in print form, you have to clutter up your explanations with examples and footnotes that take up physical room. Here, the examples are toggle-able. If I _want_ to explore an example, I can. But I don&#39;t need to. This kind of thing is especially helpful when reviewing content for, say, a test rather than learning it for the first time.Also finding things in textbooks is a real pain. It&#39;s difficult to index things in a helpful way, so you just have these counting schemes in LaTeX that increment for every definition, theorem, etc. I&#39;d love to be able to tag things then search the tags.And that says nothing for when you want to explain something that&#39;s difficult with static images. Being able to interact with animations by zooming, panning, pausing, slowing down, speeding up, etc. is a boon. (I don&#39;t think I actually saw an example of a non-static image here, but I think my point still stands.)All in all, I&#39;d love to see more interactive textbooks. We&#39;ve got this really expressive kind of document via the web. I think we should be taking advantage of it more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote an entry on Wikipedia on visualizing the QR algorithm: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QR_algorithmThe visualization helped me spot an unstable fixed point and understand the behaviour of the algorithm near eigenvalue clashes. The behaviour&#39;s quite sophisticated.I think I wrote this there, but here goes again. The idea is that a positive-definite symmetric matrix can be visualized as an ellipse. This follows from the spectral theorem. Each iteration of the QR algorithm causes the ellipse to fall towards the x-axis, as if under the influence of gravity. The unstable fixed point corresponds to when the ellipse is standing up precariously, unable to fall in either direction. If you tilt it by just a bit, it will fall over (so the fixed point is unstable).The case when the ellipse is nearly circular (corresponding to near eigenvalue clashes) causes the ellipse to fall over slowly. I think this also makes physical sense, if you think of it being under the influence of gravity. If you think of this near-circle as being a matrix, then this matrix is nearly equal to a scalar multiple of the identity matrix, so its eigenvalues are essentially known. The fact that the ellipse falls very slowly implies that the eigenvectors are unstable near eigenvalue clashes, but the eigenvalues are easy to find.Note: The issues surrounding the unstable fixed point can be fixed using Wilkinson shifts. This makes each iteration into a discontinuous function, allowing all the fixed points to be stable. The issue surrounding instability of the eigenvectors near eigenvalue clashes cannot be fixed, as it&#39;s intrinsic to  eigendecomposition (even of symmetric matrices). The latter difficulties can be dodged by slightly perturbing the matrix, but the resulting eigenvectors can be very different from the eigenvectors of the unperturbed matrix."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was achieved also by ignoring open issues and simply closing the bug even though the issue still exists. An example of this is:https://debbugs.gnu.org/cgi/bugreport.cgi?bug=21526In general, I find too much emphasis is now on &#34;closing&#34; an issue as soon as possible. I understand that open issues can be a burden for maintainers. However, filing issues, especially making them reproducible, can also be a burden to users, and users will stop filing issues if too many of them are closed unilaterally without actually correcting the root cause.As I remember it, the Emacs maintainers used to put a lot more emphasis on actually correcting issues instead of only closing them, and this may also be the reason why fewer issues are reported now.A great attraction of Emacs is how easily one can actually report issues, using Emacs itself: M-x report-emacs-bug RET."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you work for a corporation and feel overwhelmed try what the emacs people did, example for email: 1) select everything in your inbox, 2) mark as read, 3) archive. For bugs it would be unassign everything from yourself, or just close them without fixing.I&#39;ve done this several times and it&#39;s magical how you end up losing almost nothing important in the end. I think it works because if something is important enough you&#39;ll either remember it yourself or it will be communicated to you again, perhaps even via a &#34;higher priority channel&#34; such as the management chain.And if you think I&#39;m being extreme then yes, maybe, but maybe you haven&#39;t yet drowned in the never ending stream of problems for a long time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most fascinating thing to me about this blog post is that here we have a guy in his fifties who got insanely rich by working very hard (no doubt) and then selling a major stock broker platform (it is briefly mentioned as &#34;in banking&#34;) - and what does he choose to do now with spare time and more money than anyone could use? He is maintaining Emacs. For fun. This is why open source will grow. It feels meaningful to contribute. He could sail, travel, invest, buy expensive stuff, etc. But Emacs hacking it is.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m sure others who&#39;ve spent more time in Costa Rica can provide more color, but I found it a very interesting place. There&#39;s generally an &#34;enlightened&#34; government in place with relatively low corruption.The government has prioritized important things like clean drinking water, food safety standards, power, and internet (sometimes at the tradeoff of roads). There&#39;s a national emphasis on preserving the natural ecology of the country, and there&#39;s no military. The budget for which goes into social programs, education, and health care.You can go from the Caribbean to the Pacific Ocean in a few hours, which is great. But be warned the coastal areas are both incredibly hot and humid. Fortunately, much of the country is at altitude and not nearly as hot thanks to numerous volcanoes which also feature a hot springs culture in certain areas. Because of the rain forests there&#39;s an impossible number of flora and fauna (and of course rain). All of this combines to make the country quite beautiful with some of the freshest tropical fruits you&#39;ll ever eat.The population is generally well educated, Intel used to have a chip fab there for a time and HP, Dell, Bayer, Bosch, IBM and more operate there. It&#39;s a heavily services oriented economy. Housing is affordable and the people are generally friendly enough. Food can be relatively basic, but is very filling and generally cheap.It&#39;s also fair to point out the downsides. Transportation around can be...rugged and the cities can be bogged down with traffic. The Capital city, San José...I didn&#39;t care much for...at least near the city center. It&#39;s also a very small country with a very small population (~4 million). This can be constraining for some outsiders.Overall though, I found it a fascinating and beautiful country and really did enjoy my time there. I would definitely go back given the chance. I also had a friend who lived there for several years and ran an consulting business to companies in the U.S. The timezone turned out to be rather advantageous and he was able to easy support U.S. East and West coast companies.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Costa_Rica"</p>

Even an acquaintance who does construction was venting to me about how bad apple&#39;s policy is and why she is getting a pixel.After entirely removing that feature and making a commitment to fight against that kind of future I feel like they owe two more apologies to get on my good side - one for screwing up this bad in the first place and one for insulting my intelligence with their handling of the outcry.

That the two features (iMessage scanning &amp; on-device spying pre-upload to iCloud) were intentionally released at the same time to make the whole thing harder to criticize in a soundbite.Confusion is the best-case scenario for Apple because people will tune it out.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m fine with this change for my usage, I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve used password auth for myself or any automated service I&#39;ve setup for years now. However, this will introduce more confusion for newcomers who already have to figure out what Git, GitHub, etc are. I just spent some time last weeekend teaching someone the basics of how to create a new project. Such a simple idea required introducing the terminal, basic terminal commands, GitHub, git and its most common commands. It took about 3 hours for us to get through just the most basic pieces. Adding on ssh-keygen, key management adds even more friction.It&#39;s certainly a difficult problem. How can we offer a more gentle learning curve for budding developers while still requiring &#34;real&#34; projects to use best practices for security and development?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok I&#39;ll admit it. I&#39;m the dingus who is still using https and login/password. It&#39;s how I learned to use it years ago and since I only ever access GitHub via cli it&#39;s all I&#39;ve ever learned. I don&#39;t program anything complex and I&#39;ve never put anything secure up on GitHub (it&#39;s public, after all, so i had the expectation that all info on there is insecure). I don&#39;t understand why this is being deprecated when it&#39;s the default suggestion GitHub provides you when you add a new repo to your profile so that you can connect your local git repo to it. For hosting my trivial personal projects it seems so silly to have to go onto github&#39;s web interface and click through a bunch of their ui to build a personal passkey(which is just a password with a different name afaict).  Am I just not the intended audience for the change or am I missing something crucial that doesn&#39;t make this seem like a bunch of extra effort for no meaningful change?"</p>

If you had not started vim.so, you probably wouldn&#39;t realize this problem exists. You did things that don&#39;t scale with vim.so and now you are doing something which hopefully will scale. All the best."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Slip approach for interactive courses is what is missing in most of learning platforms. For developers the learning process happens when you start coding not by watching videos. But most of the platforms like Udemy they only support text and video materials. We actually wrote an article about importance of learn by doing https://dev.to/corpcubite/why-learn-by-doing-is-important-5a... hope you find it helpful."</p>

I went ahead and signed up as an author and have had a couple of issues so far:1. The first time I clicked the magic link in the login flow took me to another login prompt. I re-entered my email but got a warning that I was requesting another link too soon. I went back and clicked the link again and was logged in right away.2. Once logged in I see an empty page at https://app.slip.so/author - there is the side nav, but nothing in the main well.3. I did notice a couple of console warnings around cookie attributes:
Cookie “__tld__” will be soon rejected because it has the “SameSite” attribute set to “None” or an invalid value, without the “secure” attribute. To know more about the “SameSite“ attribute, read https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cook...I was also wondering for the SQL course if it would be feasible to stand up an in-browser sqlite database via sql.js and/or make an API call out to a service to stand up a database for student use.Congrats on the launch and keep me post if this could be a viable course for your platform!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It might seems like a simple feel-good story for some, but it&#39;s more than that. I didn&#39;t imagine how much children learn and cope through toys until I had my own kids.Example 1: when my daughter was 2 she got a fishbone stuck in her mouth. I gave her lots of bread and water so that something would force the small bone to go down. After 5 minutes the issue was resolved and she immediately jumped to her teddy bear and started playing &#34;you have a bone teddy, you need bread, take this, take that&#34;. The first plays were urgent and quite serious and the teddy was always &#34;cured&#34; quickly. But later through the following days as she played the same idea she started to improvise. Teddy, in her hands, would cough and cough - I would offer him things for 10 minutes and more and nothing would help him. And she would laugh at this. After these plays fish bones in her mind were no longer serious.Example 2: when she was 3 we tried to adapt her to a kindergarten. After the first day when she was home she picked up her toy cars and started playing. Some of the cars were teachers, others were children, one was me, another one was her, and one small car was a smaller child that cried all the time. And we played the routine where I came to the kindergarten with her, stayed for a bit, and then went to work. At the moment the &#34;dad&#34; car went to work she would physically tense up and become silent, as if it was really happening. But those moments became easier once she learned more details about what to expect during the typical day in the kindergarten and that later the &#34;dad&#34; car always comes back to take her home. Seems like this experience was helpful as, despite being somewhat shy, she never cried during her adaptation period."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of stuff is super helpful.My dad was a surgeon who treated kids with scoliosis. He also happened to make teddy bears as a hobby. So he made a teddy bear with an artificial spine in it that he put scoliosis hardware on.When he was meeting with a kid for a pre-op consult, he would let the kid hug the teddy bear, and then he would show them the teddy bear&#39;s X-Ray. It really helped them understand what was going to happen to them, and put them at ease."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This dad is carrying on a fantastic, but not at all new tradition. I had surgery in the early 1970&#39;s when I was three, and I&#39;ve still got the old teddy bear up in a box in the attic that the staff at the hospital made for me that &#34;needed the same surgery&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really want to like Snopes, but I&#39;m not convinced that they weigh evidence correctly. For example, they debunked the myth that Marilyn Monroe had 6 toes. First, I don&#39;t believe that she did. Or even care, for that matter. But at the time, one of their &#34;facts&#34; was that if she&#39;d had a toe removed, she&#39;d basically have to learn to walk all over again because it would throw her balance completely off. (Note: the article no longer includes this fact. It did at one time, though.)However, my wife&#39;s a podiatrist. Part of her job is amputating parts of feet when they&#39;re damaged or infected beyond repair. I asked her what it&#39;s like for an otherwise healthy adult to recover from a pinky toe amputation, and she said it&#39;s basically a matter of waiting for the wound site to heal and then they continue with life as normal. Contrary to popular belief, even a big toe amputation isn&#39;t that disruptive. A vestigial 6th toe hanging off to the side? You&#39;d never notice it was gone.I emailed Snopes and said hey, while I agree with your conclusion, this particular supporting fact is invalid according to an expert in the field. They replied basically that I was an idiot for believing she had 6 toes, and they left the article as-is.That&#39;s not at all what I thought, and I actually agreed with their conclusion. I just didn&#39;t like that they were using incorrect facts to support it, and especially didn&#39;t like that they reacted poorly to a well-meant correction.Since then, I&#39;ve been skeptical of Snopes. Although I think they&#39;re probably right most of the time, that left a bad taste in my mouth. Are other people sending them corrections about their own fields of expertise and having them rejected? I have no way of knowing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Netflix, like countless other online services, is not built for global citizens - people that work in different countries to their own.I am a British born expat, living in Qatar, so of course I want to watch the UK orientated Netflix programming and not the Arabic or Hindi. I have a UK TV license but of course, I can&#39;t watch UK TV from Qatar. Trying to pay for things online is frequently a nightmare as many companies won&#39;t take payment from a UK card unless it&#39;s from a UK IP. Same trying to pay tax on my US houses, also some websites don&#39;t even let you connect to them unless you use a US IP address! Google rightly defaults to Arabic if you&#39;re not logged in, that&#39;s fine, but even they don&#39;t provide a simple way to change the language to English! Similar with Spotify, same with Apple music. Whatsapp voice calls are blocked in Qatar.All of these problems and many more are bypassed with a good VPN. It amazes me how few services ever take into consideration that people don&#39;t always live and work in their country of origin. If VPN&#39;s are clamped down on it&#39;s going to make life difficult for tens of millions of people. VPN&#39;s are actually VITAL in many situations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many years ago, I worked at a small (3 US states) ISP, roughly 500-600K customersThis ISP was one that mostly absorbed smaller ISP&#39;s that weren&#39;t able to scale up enough to remain competitive.One of the ISP&#39;s they absorbed was CondoInternet. A Seattle based firm that provided gigabit internet service across Seattle&#39;s affluent areas and expensive condosAs it turned out, a lot of the customers ordering the service hailed from a country with a very restrictive censorship regime. A &#34;great firewall&#34; if you willThey&#39;d set up home-made VPN&#39;s using Raspberry Pi&#39;s etc for family to tunnel into and watch Netflix on typicallyNetflix however even in 2017 was smart and their algorithm would see these thousands of people logging in while everyone else in Seattle was typically asleep and eventually ban the entire ISP&#39;s IP range. Logging in would give a &#34;please turn off your proxy/VPN&#34; error messageEvery time this happened the ISP&#39;s phone tree would explode, going from mere seconds to literal 6-10 hour queue times. The NOC was entirely upskilled CS agents who had no idea how to contact Netflix&#39;s relevant teams to get the IP ban removed, instead they&#39;d simply tell CS to have customers wait until the IP ban expired (usually a few days)This would happen almost every other month"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Disney+ had inexplicably blocked my IP address for &#34;being a VPN&#34; for close to year, despite me never running a VPN from my home network. Though the block didn&#39;t stop me from watching their content, it just stopped me from paying for, which I was more than willing to do and spent far to long dealing with their support to try to make it happen.If the same thing happens with Netflix, it also won&#39;t keep me from watching Netflix content, I&#39;ll just stop paying for it. Other than the aforementioned Disney+ content, I rarely pirate anything these days and I&#39;d rather not if I can help it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this idea - I paid a grand for this thing, I should be able to run whatever I like on it.However, this does make it significantly more difficult for Apple to dictate terms to every random app that your network of friends and colleagues makes you download, and makes it more likely that those apps will be a regression in terms of actual consumer experience.Regulation of access to  your camera roll and contact list is a terrible idea, so I don’t see a solution.Apple is the only thing stopping WhatsApp (let’s face it, an essential app in 2021) from demanding your location at all times. We don’t notice this on the web, because Mozilla and Google (!) enforce terms for us (and most desktops don’t have GPS receivers).Take out the gatekeeper on mobile and we might find that the benevolent dictatorship wasn’t so bad after all.Edit: want to add that replacing Apple’s consumer protection gatekeeper role with a government agency is a non starter. Apple (and to give them credit, Google) know that the data available to the gatekeeper role is toxic and dangerous. Government thinks it’s a big bowl of lollies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is mostly good, but it forces Apple/Google to hand over your email address (or other means of communication) to anyone you download an app from so they can spam you.The bill says they don’t have to allow spam, but specially allows “legitimate business offers, such as pricing terms and product or service offerings”… which is spam unless one explicitly opts-in to it.I don’t appreciate the double-talk. This part of the bill is user hostile and should be deleted."</p>

I just don’t want them scanning my phone for the purpose of turning me in. I definitely do not want to take an OS update or new phone that does this.(False positives are the huge flaw in this system, though. There are human judgements by anonymous people using opaque processes without appeal throughout this.

One of the other bright stars in my world is Karli Koss, who has an extensive personal data-extraction setup for a ridiculously colossal variety of services &amp; devices[2]. A vast amount of this massive massive data-gathering framework is just reading sqlite databases of the various devices and apps.

The absurdity!This really is quite incredible. Same idea extends to your filesystem too. Tracking millions of 1KB objects on disk? You could load the whole set into memory substantially faster from SQLite using the same disk. If WAL is enabled with reasonable sync flags, the same applies going back out to disk as well.SQLite is the most powerful dependency that our product uses today.  We have been using it in production as the sole persistence mechanism for 100% of our data for the last 5-6 years now. Recently, we have started leveraging the actual SQL engine to process all of our business logic as well."</p>

Instead, they get to arrest you, make an entire copy of your phone, etc.It’s insidious. And it’s stupid. Why Apple is agreeing to do this is disgusting.And it doesn’t make sense. If I were a pedophile and I took a new CSAM photo, how long would it take for that specific photo to get on the list? Months? Years? As long as pedophiles know that their phones are being scanned, they won’t use iPhones for their photos.

Even if some crazy store material on his Apple hardware isn&#39;t that illegal search non usable in law courts ?3. Child abuse is often used as Trojan horse to introduce questionable practice. What if:- the system is used to looking for dissidents: I look for people that have a photo of Tiananmen Square protests on their pc, for example;- for espionage: I have the hash of some documents of interest, so all the PCs with that kind of documents could be a valuable target;- profiling people: you have computer virus sample on your PC -&gt; security researcher/hacker;I think that the system is prone to all kind of privacy abuse.4. this could be part of the previous point, but, because I think it&#39;s the final and real reason for the existence of that system, I give to this point its own section: piracy fight.

Back in 2013 via the Snowden leaks, it was revealed Apple was associated with the NSA domestic surveillance program, PRISM. It appears they (NSA and Apple, et al) pulled out due to the level of negative PR.After 8 years, the intelligence community and tech companies figured out they could sell their surveillance through a thinly veiled effort to “protect X group” (in this case it was children)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Having worked at a place with 11+ years of a project in  ZeroVer, I would caution against ZeroVer as it can mentally wear on software developers. The 0. is not something embraced, but a taunting God who takes pleasure in suffering. The followers of ZeroVer all believe that with some combination of magic and hard work a 0. will turn to a 1., but the mighty 0. never rolls over. To topple the 0.,  they will try tricks like a full rewrite of core code, new scrum patterns, new directors of software development, more code reviews, iron clad  specifications, testing specialists, and more. They’ll  try to do things they see 1.0 software doing: sell the code, use it in production, make billion dollar decision based on its output, have entire livelihoods wrapped up in its existence, and still the 0. is unchanged. The myths of a roadmap to 1.0 will build over time, some say it’s always existed, but there’s no sign of a road or even civilization when you look around. The ZeroVer faith says that everyone is always on the road to 1.0 if they believe, but outsiders continually taunt them for not knowing when 1.0 will reveal itself."</p>

Not sure all the comments are catching that.When I have to use a 0.x-versioned package because it&#39;s a (hard or soft) dependency of some popular framework/platform/tool that &#34;everyone&#34; is using... I feel personally insulted. Like they&#39;re saying &#34;no, we&#39;re not willing to say this is production-ready, we&#39;re not willing to say that we&#39;re not going to break backwards compatibility every month or so in a way you can&#39;t predict from the version number so can&#39;t do automated dependency updates ever, but, hey, everyone else is using it, what&#39;s your problem?&#34;It&#39;s like the ultimate embrace of the typical HN &#34;open source maintainers owe you nothing and you should expect nothing of them&#34; argument.

In-fact we need FLOSS app stores right now (Similar to F-Droid[0], but baked in as the default store), and they need to be funded properly &amp; they need sound economic incentives to continue. No more &#39;free&#39; apps where you pay for them with your data. It&#39;s possible to have FLOSS apps that are not gratis where people pay for them with money, not their data.(The reason I suggest we switch to FLOSS app stores is that the apps can easily be checked for back-doors or malicious code since the code is open source. It makes the apps readily available for audits too)[0] https://f-droid.org/"</p>

And this is before even considering that governments around the world are on the side of hostile technology.Write to your representative, they say, but when our “democratic” representatives couldn’t care less about the needs of their constituents, yet term after term get re-elected regardless, who will hear us? And again, before considering that a) they’re voted in by the same careless majority, and b) that they are empowered by the very hostile technology we want them to combat?I just don’t see a future that isn’t plagued by the overbearing influence of soulless tech companies and the corrupt scumbags that enable them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a few qualms with this app:1. For a Linux user, you can already build such a system yourself quite trivially by getting an FTP account, mounting it locally with curlftpfs, and then using SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem. From Windows or Mac, this FTP account could be accessed through built-in software.2. It doesn&#39;t actually replace a USB drive. Most people I know e-mail files to themselves or host them somewhere online to be able to perform presentations, but they still carry a USB drive in case there are connectivity problems. This does not solve the connectivity issue.3. It does not seem very &#34;viral&#34; or income-generating. I know this is premature at this point, but without charging users for the service, is it reasonable to expect to make money off of this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was a very early Dropbox adopter but eventually switched to OneDrive a few years back because they bundled Office 365 with 1 TB of storage. I just went and looked at the official Dropbox plans to see if there was a family plan similar to the 5 users I get with Office 365/OneDrive...and found their plan/pricing page overwhelming. There&#39;s rows upon rows of features to compare across versions like &#34;Traffic and Insights&#34; and the &#34;Plus button&#34; forcing me to keep scrolling just to see that a family plan costs $16.99 a month for 2 TB. No option for a cheaper plan with less storage. I feel like they are missing the mark when it comes to marketing to consumers here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dropbox is still the bestOneDrive (I use it at work): if one file fails, all files stop syncing. It sometimes tries to sync some files from teams and just never finishes. It also has very strange file name restrictions. if the file name is bad (eg whitespace at the end) it will just stop syncing anything. Still better than Google Drive as it is a standard folder. if it crashes your data is HERE.google drive (I used that at work): on MacOS is it is utter crap as it is not a folder but a mounted thing. So it is not &#34;there&#34; when you login. So every application that tries to open a file on google drive just fails. Because it is not an apple FS a lot of apple apps will complain. MySQL Workbench will often fail to save and often destroy files. If not running it is not mounted and none of your files are here. you also can&#39;t copy out google files (writer, spreadsheet, etc). For whatever reason.iCloud: some strange folder nested hundred levels deep. I only use it because of some ios stuff.So yeah, Dropbox might be pricey but through all the years it really worked very well for me. (And I really don&#39;t care about any of the other services they have)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think he kind of missed the elephant that is modern communication technology has reduced the marginal cost of skilled services enabling pretty much every object designed in an office and manufactured in a factory to benefit from a broader array of engineering and design professionals and methodologies.  The average product and service that the average actor in the economy interacts with is designed and optimized to a far greater degree today than they were historically.Look at the bottle of Elmers glue on the table.  Today the glue probably works better (barring regulation that forces compromises to product efficacy) and comes in a bottle that uses half as much plastic.  Something like a bottle revision that would have formerly required expensive salaried employees to come up with multiple options, send them to the supplier, supplier has to respond to each with details and quotes, etc, can now be accomplished in a fraction of the man hours thanks to email and CAD being ubiquitous in the entire supply chain from marketing, to engineering, to the vendor&#39;s contractor who will actually design the tooling.  Sign off might take days instead of weeks.  This sort of efficiency improvement allows more engineering, design work, or other optimization to be done to every good and service in our economy allowing it to penetrate into even the most thin margin use cases.  From farming to high finance products and services are substantially more influenced and optimized by specialist professionals than they were in 1990. Increase efficiency like this throughout the national and global economy is how lawnmowers and A/C units can be sold on sale for $100 and still make a profit. (yes I know that example isn&#39;t perfect but you get the point)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of a golden age blog post, when lists turned out to be an understudied literary device. I&#39;m a fan of &#34;dumps.&#34; Some interestingly debatable ones here:&#34;Intellectual Property Maximalism rollback: copyright terms have not and probably will not be indefinitely extended again to eternity to protect Mickey Mouse, and in 2019, for the first time since 1998, works entered the public domain&#34;I think the easy indicator may be the wrong one here. Defined more broadly, the public domain is not being enriched. For example, the web was a lot smaller in 1999, but it was a much more public domain. Today&#39;s web and post web internet is more centralised, controlled and therefore private property. Google could crawl pages, links, forums, because they were public, and use that access to create a search engine. Content, connections and signal are, today, proprietary. You can&#39;t order the world&#39;s information if that information is facebook&#39;s, only facebook can.Or patents, more stuff of the last generation is patented than the previous&#39;. Does that mean we invented more or we patented more? What happens to stuff that doesn&#39;t get patented? It&#39;s public.Old copyright expiry deadlines might be a symbolic lead indicator, but they&#39;re determining the location of a fence post in county scale land dispute. A tiny, legible, part of the whole. In real terms, Disney&#39;s copyright portfolio is worth more, not less."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Environment: air quality in most places has continued to improve (and considering the growing evidence on the harms of air pollution, this may well be the single most important item on this whole page), forest area has increased , and more rivers are safe to fish inBecause almost all the industrial production that pollutes water and air moved to third-world countries, where people suffer from pollution. Same for thrash that is taken to China, India, Indonesia for &#34;recycling&#34;, but is actually burned in fires or thrown into the ocean. I wouldn&#39;t consider it an improvement due to advances in technology."</p>

I have no specific super powers.  But, yes... everything stated here rings true for me.  I would, humbly, add some of my own.Learn the people patterns.  Every where I have worked has at least a few, if not all, members of Typical IT Cast Of Characters.  There is the &#34;know-it-all-but-does-not&#34;, &#34;wise old sage&#34;, &#34;management climber&#34;, &#34;new guy&#34;, &#34;one-job-and-doesn&#39;t-want-to-change&#34;, &#34;hockey-jersey-guy-who-smells-but-knows-too-much&#34;, etc.   Pick your own.  Most of these people will avoid, tolerate, get along with, or maybe love the others.  Or some combination thereof.   I have found being the impartial mediator to be advantageous.  Be the &#34;Ferris Bueller&#34;.Know the business as well as the tech.  Technologists that can dive into the business language and work with both groups are invaluable.Diagrams. Work hard on developing the capability to express ideas/concepts/flows in a diagram that fits on one sheet of paper.  Do this all the time...even for one-offs.  As the author states, it helps build your brand.  It&#39;s advertising. When I see a one-pager I did 6 months ago on a desk covered with coffee stains, or pinned to the wall above monitor...I know I have made an impression.  I worked with a few masters of this craft, and honestly, they are all magic on any team.Share credit constantly.  Don&#39;t ever appear that you need validation.  Give good ideas away for team members to catch and grow. You will build a community around you that seek you out for guidance.  Time passes quickly... that junior dev you credited for a schema re-jig 5 years ago is now a VP at BigCo.  She didn&#39;t forget.  Keep in touch, right?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s a great article.I&#39;m 59, and have been out of the &#34;market&#34; for the last 4 years. I have no intentions of ever working for anyone else again. I&#39;m fortunate, in being able to do that.What did it for me, was the atrocious way that I was treated, when I went looking for work, after leaving my previous employer; just shy of 27 years. I stayed that long, not because I&#39;m a &#34;clinger,&#34; but because I was damn good at my job, and they valued me.It seems that us &#34;olds&#34; are not popular. It appears to be personal and emotional; not based on any empirical data (Did I mention that I&#39;m actually fairly good at what I do?). Quite strange, in an industry known for its data-driven approach.It didn&#39;t take me long to figure out that the current environment does not want me around. I won&#39;t go, where I&#39;m not wanted, and I&#39;m incredibly grateful to have the means to do this. I am quite aware that most of my peers do not have this choice, and it hurts my heart to know that they will spend their final years of employment, being treated in such a shoddy manner.But that won&#39;t stop me from working. I just had to set my own agenda. It&#39;s coming along nicely. I tend to develop rather ambitious stuff, and the last few years have been fun. I would not have done it, if I hadn&#39;t been pushed; so I guess it&#39;s all good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I cannot find any source files for the FPGA code in the repository (no .v .vhd .vhdl files and I can&#39;t see anything by looking around manually). The FPGA directory [1] contains some binaries and some documents relating to commercial code from a Swiss firm [2].I&#39;ve seen plenty of projects described as open source when the firmware is open source and the hardware is closed but this is the first time I&#39;ve seen one where the schematics and board layout are open but the firmware is closed. Note that the hardware itself is quite simple, the smart stuff happens in three modules: GNSS receiver, precision clock and FPGA. To me, the contents of the FPGA source code are the only interesting part of this project. Additionally, you won&#39;t be able to meaningfully modify or reuse this project without editing the source code.The hardware module these FPGA binaries seem to be compiled for is described as an AC7100B, the source given for these is a defunct ebay link [3] [4] :-O This project uses two and half grand&#39;s worth of atomic clock and the heart of it runs on a module that fell off the back of a lorry!?[1] https://github.com/opencomputeproject/Time-Appliance-Project...

[4] https://www.ebay.com/itm/XINLINX-A7-FPGA-Development-board-A...Edit: I realise this comes across as quite negative. This looks like a neat project, one I would actually use, but only if it were meaningfully open source."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What&#39;s interesting to me is how the form factor of timing GPS modules has stayed constant over the years.  I started my GNSS timing journey with a used Trimble GPS from the 2000s, and it has the same form factor and pinout as the modern multi-constellation timing GPSes from uBlox.I&#39;ve had a GPS clock going for several years at this point, and without an atomic clock or really any fanciness (just LinuxPPS and Chrony), I see about +/- 380ns, which is pretty good.  NTP to the Internet gives me jitter in the range of about 20ms-70ms, about 5 orders of magnitude worse.(The version a few iterations ago looked like this: https://github.com/jrockway/beaglebone-gps-clock.  But I now have a uBlox multi-constellation GPS, which is much more accurate with my limited view of the sky from my Brooklyn apartment.  And I 3D printed the case, so it actually looks presentable instead of like some crazed madman that attacked a plastic case with a hacksaw -- which is exactly how I made the first case.  As for the DS3231 RTC that I added... that seems to be stable within about 1.5us, which is pretty impressive.  I tuned it a little bit with the trim register, though.)My takeaway from this article is that the project seems quite compelling, but a lot of cost is added to support PTP.  I see why Facebook needs that, but to sync time precisely throughout my lab, all I need is a coaxial cable with 10MHz on it.  I don&#39;t mind if my workstation is 20ms off UTC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Man, tough crowd here. And someone who&#39;s been following precise timekeeping tech for 25 years now.. this is really cool! I think it&#39;s great some smart engineers have built a new reasonably compact and low cost very precise bit of timekeeping hardware. Thank you for sharing it open source!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Since leaving Australia (and started living in Europe) I have come to the conclusion that Australia is not a &#34;real&#34; country - it is just a continent owned by corporate interests that happens to also have people living on it.Corporate interests own the media, politicians, food production, education etc. and no one cares, because Life Is Good. Why expect anything to change, or people to care about strong democratic institutions, when there is no incentive for them to care about abstract concepts such as privacy or governmental oversight.Decades of bull markets, house price increases, a decline in public education, torpedoed communication infrastructure and complicit &#34;independent&#34; media has resulted in a wealthy, ignorant and complacent society who allow their representatives full control over their lives. It is not that they don&#39;t care about these issues, they are not even aware they are issues at all.But who cares, when you can go to the beach?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since 2015 and the meta data laws it’s no wonder things have continued to get worse.There was practically no opposition to the meta data laws. No popular resistance. No protests. It’s a non-issue for the public or political class.The extent to which non-tech people in my social circles care is to switch to signal. Not that they’ve stopped using the other tools.There seems to be a “what else can we do” attitude.Unfortunately, there is also no other party to vote for, as both major parties (liberal and labour) hold the same policies on ‘national security’."</p>

You are being grossly underpaid. The country _is_ an authoritarian surveillance state and has been for years and years. The frog boiled and died years ago. Peace out, and find somewhere that will treat you well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of the discussion here is treating impostor syndrome and qualifications as binary: You&#39;re either qualified or not. And your evaluation of your skills is either above your actual skills or not.But it&#39;s more nuanced than that.I&#39;m a Principal Engineer at a FAAMNG company. I have impostor syndrome all the time. Why? Because I measure myself against 1) role models that are ahead of me in many ways - I&#39;ve always done that, and it&#39;s how I grow, 2) against those with strengths in areas that I have weaknesses.I think my impostor syndrome is absolutely fact-based. I am not as good in the technical areas I care about as those I measure myself against.My fallacy is that there is a billion things that I am good at, but I don&#39;t consider them difficult (how could they be, if I am good at them), or I consider them insufficient to a fully rounded engineer, if I don&#39;t also have the skills that I know I&#39;m missing (but some of my peers are not).It doesn&#39;t help that I&#39;m the epitome of a &#39;Generalist&#39; - I&#39;m good at a lot of things, but I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m the BEST at anything.I get lots of positive reinforcement - from my management chain, and from those more junior than me. But it never resonates. I always think &#34;damn, I&#39;ve actually fooled them all&#34;. And then I feel guilty that the management is putting so much trust in me, and that the juniors actually look up to a fraud.The only feedback that resonates is from my technical peers. Luckily I get this just often enough that I don&#39;t fall into a catatonic mess of anxiety. And sometimes I believe it..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I guess I just don&#39;t really believe this. It sounds nice, and it might even be a good falsehood to tell yourself for personal motivation—but that doesn&#39;t make it true.Yes, of course if you&#39;re an actual fraudster intending to commit fraud, you&#39;re probably comfortable with committing fraud. But feeling &#34;impostor syndrome&#34; colloquially means  second-guessing whether you&#39;re good enough to deserve your position.There are absolutely lots of people who are better at their jobs than they think they are. But I have to imagine there are also lots of people who are just as bad as they think they are, if not worse."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The title is somewhat misleading, because it&#39;s talking about two different types of imposter.The &#34;imposter&#34; of &#34;imposter syndrome&#34; believes others didn&#39;t figure what they really are, that they&#39;re flawed, underskilled, will fail, etc. ; and that makes you somewhat of a fraud, i.e. an imposter, because they&#39;re secretly not the skilled person that was hired.The &#34;actual imposter&#34; from the &#34;imposter syndrome&#34; would be someone who actually lied about their skills and flaws, or at the very least don&#39;t have these skills. I don&#39;t know if these &#34;imposters&#34; have the imposter syndrome or not - but for the sake of argument I would assume that they have the same doubts as everyone else and that they do have imposter syndrome.The &#34;actual imposter&#34; who the author is mentioning is a con, someone who was secretly malfeasant and there for their own benefit. What&#39;s more is that from what the author is saying, they seem pretty skilled, and confident. So of course they don&#39;t have imposter syndrome: they fixed an organization, bring in money, their plan is going well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Kim Stanley Robinson&#39;s recent book The Ministry For the Future starts with a very disturbing scenario: A heatwave  with a &#34;web bulb&#34; temperature of 35 Celsius.It turns out, in those temperatures, even young and healthy people can&#39;t survive. Combined with power outages, as happens in the book, everyone living under such a heat wave will likely die.It&#39;s looking increasingly likely that such heatwaves are possible in the future, and possibly quite deadly. This could result in the mass deaths of many people, especially in poor tropical countries that don&#39;t have a stable infrastructure to cool most people during such a heatwave. I hope a mass death event from a &#34;web bulb&#34; 35C heatwave never happens, but I&#39;m losing hope, especially with the increasing global temperatures, and the very lackluster progress being made on carbon output."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two cities in India that are pretty close by where this difference is very clear. Chennai is on the coast, while Bangalore is inland at a higher altitude while they’re both pretty much the same latitude.The difference in perception even if the dry bulb temperature is the same is insane. In Bangalore I can always find shade and it’ll be cool instantly, but in Chennai my whole body is always soaking wet, my clothes are drenched with my own sweat and I still feel like always about to faint.I used to take long walks during the day when I lived in Bangalore (it has other man made problems like traffic which are still irritating) but here I Chennai I can’t walk or jog outside even if I wanted to. I step outside only to run to the car and turn the AC on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Similar question to this that I&#39;ve been wondering this wildfire season -- at what point is  AQI  (Air Quality Index) too severe for human tolerance? The scale tops out at 500, what happens to a person if the air is even worse than that?Some sensors near Medford, OR are reading in the upper 400&#39;s and even low 500&#39;s -- what happens if it hits what would be the  1000&#39;s if the scale went that high?I&#39;m mostly thinking of particulates, but AQI includes other gases like CO, SO2,  NO2 so maybe those would be more dangerous than particulates (and certainly harder to filter out)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s plenty wrong with Ethereum, but casting miners as &#39;the working class&#39; is a flawed analogy. The mercantile class would be closer to the mark. Notably, their hashing power is based in real world economic power and they extract an annuity from capital expenditure on mining operations and hardware.I also question whether miners are really providing the labour power, as you might expect the working class to do. They build the roads and keep the lights on but the means of production of value is (or ought to be) the services provided by those writing functionality that makes the network useful, i.e. the smart contract writers. Whether one thinks smart contracts on Ethereum have any value is another question but that was at least the vision.A move to proof-of-stake does not remove the role of miners/validators. Validators will still earn a reward from validating blocks. So it&#39;s not as if this &#39;class&#39; is being disenfranchised totally.Finally the social class analogy entails disjointness of classes, this is certainly not the case for miners, many of whom are major token holders, and some of whom are involved in governance (of course by miners we are taking about the humans controlling the mining rigs not the computers themselves)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Something here seems awfully similar to the system that crypto-currency was meant to fix. It was meant to eliminate rulers. It was meant to make everyone accountable for their actions. It was meant to reward the intelligent, the hard working and the capable, and not reward the incompetent, or the makers-yet-breakers of promises. However, this repeat of the broken old system seems to be playing out again.&#34;One response is that the promise was not well thought through. The idea was to replace &#34;rulers&#34; (human beings who make decisions to take care of a system) and &#34;law&#34; (written rules interpreted by humans) with code. But (a) code is written by humans who make mistakes; (b) the world changes, and systems need to update to respond to that; (c) somebody has to be responsible for dealing with a and b. As a result, currencies need central organizers to look after them. And those central organizers need to be motivated, i.e., paid. Old-fashioned currencies have sovereigns to back them, and the sovereigns are paid by the monopoly of taxation and/or the ability to issue money. Inefficient, but it works.From this perspective, bitcoin et al. look like technical solutions to social problems. In particular, bitcoin is designed to have nobody taking care of public goods problems on its behalf. That&#39;s a flaw![1][1] https://wyclif.substack.com/p/thought-bubble-defending-bitco..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seems like one of the core arguments of this is that the the core devs have pushed the difficulty bomb multiple times because they&#39;ve missed their original timelines for switching to PoS without any repercussions.It seems to me that this is actually the correct thing to do.

In the last few months we&#39;ve seen pretty definitive evidence that transformers can recombine concepts ([1], [2]) and do simple logical inference using contextual information ([3], &#34;make the score font color visible&#34;). I see no reason that this technology couldn&#39;t smoothly scale into human-level intelligence, yet lots of people seem to think it&#39;ll require a step change or is impossible.That being said, robust systematic generalization is still a hard problem.

We spent months developing a chatbot using GPT3 for our game and released a video showcasing it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nnuSQvoroJo&amp;t=264sAfterwards OpenAI then added GPT3 chatbot guidelines disallowing basically anything like this.
We were in communication with them beforehand, but they decided later that any sort of free form chatbot was dangerous.What they allow changes on a weekly basis, and is different for each customer. I don&#39;t understand how they expect companies to rely on them"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m still surprised by the approach. I mean, great that it works this well -- but program synthesis is one of those rare domains where you can observe exactly what the outcome is after you generate something. You can see execution traces, variable values, what the JIT produced, etc. And all of this is relatively cheap -- often executing a code snippet should be far cheaper than an extra pass through a giant DNN right? So it&#39;s fascinating to me that they train entirely from dealing with code as text.Imagine learning to develop recipes, not by ever cooking or eating or even seeing food, but only reading a giant library of cookbooks. Or learning to compose music but never hearing or playing anything -- only seeing scores."</p>
