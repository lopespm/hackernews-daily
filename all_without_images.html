								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder if this is because we&#39;re lonely..?  Just wondering out loud here.E.g. Twitter - feels like many of the &#34;thought leaders&#34; I follow, their &#34;friends&#34; are also on Twitter.  And they tweet/respond so much I often wonder if they&#39;re really ever &#34;building a business&#34;. And are they ever interacting with their real-world friends or family?Or if their lives just consist of a constant refresh of their feed. Even at dinner, I wonder if they&#39;re even present?And I wonder if that&#39;s why podcasts have become so popular - it&#39;s someone talking to you.  Someone having a conversation, albeit one-sided, but usually it&#39;s pretty interesting.For the same lonely reasons, I wonder if this is why public radio has been so popular with long haul truck drivers.  Everyone wants to hear a human voice once in a while.The constant reading, listening and entertaining videos...  The voice in your head generates a discussion, with itself. At least it&#39;s something.We work from home.  It&#39;s quiet.  With no one around. We&#39;re looking for a preoccupation.We&#39;re just desperate for any type of human interaction.&#34;Likes&#34;, hearts, thumbs-up, upvotes, +1, PR merge, etc. 
 - are we just clinging to anything that acknowledges our existence and humanity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because we humans have a lot of idle time.We feel like we&#39;re wasting it, and we feel we should instead spend time archiving goals, to better ourselves, to do something more meaningful.  
But that is not how life works. You are just unnecessarily burden yourself with guilt. Thinking you should be doing something else. There are so many things to learn about, so many things to experience, right? We fear on missing out on life, chasing something, but what exactly we don&#39;t really know.But maybe you just don&#39;t need to? Most of us are exactly fine with where we are. Of course you should always strive to improve, but truth is &#34;killing time&#34; is a big part of life. Especially for top of the food chain animals like humans. Watch some livestreams of lions on youtube, what do they do? 99% of the time they just sit under a tree doing absolutely nothing, and I bet they don&#39;t feel guilty about it. People used to walk labyrinths for hours and hours, just to kill time.This whole notion that you need to make the most out of every moment, live life to the fullest, see all the places, chase the uncomfortable! - I don&#39;t think it&#39;s necessarily the best advice, the happiest people I&#39;ve met tend to have very simple boring routines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am addicted to twitter and reddit. Especially reddit. It often takes the place of reading, hobbies, quiet moments, improving my home, talking with my spouse, and playing with my baby.When reddit records a click or an upvote, it thinks it has been a Good Product, and created Engagement. Reddit then takes those feedback loops and tunes the algorithm and feedback loops to create further engagement.But in reality, there&#39;s almost no positive relationship between my engagement with social media and my personal human flourishing. I think these products are mostly poison for my soul."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi! I&#39;m the person who wrote that blog post.
If you have any questions whatsoever, please let me know!English is not my native language and &#34;The solution is trivial&#34; was meant sarcastic. The solution isn&#39;t trivial at all, nor is it complete, because solving the corner cases is complex.I&#39;d also like to mention ahead of time that DirectWrite/Direct2D is very fast at drawing western (Latin) text without coloring (&gt;2000 FPS). In other words, in most situations Casey&#39;s suggestion doesn&#39;t help much, but it does address his termbench issue. At the time we assumed we were using the API incorrectly, after all Direct2D already had everything Casey suggested we should implement and it ran very fast outside of termbench. The new solution is largely identical to regular Direct2D with the only major difference being that ClearType/Grayscale gamma-correction is run on the GPU instead.Casey&#39;s suggestion wasn&#39;t unique to me, as a significant number of other terminals do it exactly that way in OpenGl, something I was quite familiar with already. Originally I credited alacritty in the blog, because that&#39;s how I knew how to do it, but I removed it to keep the article as succinct as possible. Someone kindly offered a HLSL shader on GitHub for us to use, but I didn&#39;t make use of that either."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The idea is that the bidder&#39;s precision signals confidence, and that low confidence signals amenability to negotiation, and that negotiation leads to poorer outcomes for the bidder. The HBS paper they cite on M&amp;A [0] is most interesting, to my view, in the sense that both players in the M&amp;A &#34;game&#34; are presumably quantitative. One would think a social psychology effect would be less so in a game between quants, but their interviews suggest perceived confidence does matter. The precision signals that the bidder is confident pricing and negotiating analytically.The thing I am curious about in [0] is that they report the bid price per share, and not (unless I missed it) the asking price. I don&#39;t know how M&amp;A &#34;works&#34;. If you and I are both estimating the value of a good, if our estimates are close it&#39;s one thing and if they are far apart it&#39;s another. Are rounders losing because their estimates are less accurate, relative their counterparty&#39;s?[0] https://www.hbs.edu/ris/Publication%20Files/16-058_27d73983-..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another extremely successful tactic I stumbled upon by accident: electing a 3rd party decision maker that the other negotiator can&#39;t communicate with. Without the communication channel, the other negotiator is forced to &#34;sweeten the deal&#34; instead of using conversational skills.I received a job offer while my wife was traveling. The number was right for me and the job/company was right. But I told the hiring manager that I needed to talk it through with my wife first and that I&#39;d need a few days (no context about why I needed the time or which direction I expected it to go).She got home 3 days later. We sat down, talked it through for 10 minutes, and we were ready to accept.In the time between the initial offer and accepting the offer, I received 3 updated offers with increasing compensation. The final offer I accepted was $75k higher than the initial offer.After experiencing that, I&#39;ve noticed companies use this tactic frequently. When you call into a help center, often times the phone operator &#34;will need to talk to their manager&#34; who is authorized to make the actual decision. You aren&#39;t allowed to talk to the manager - all communication goes through the intermediary. I suspect they are aware that this is an effective negotiating tactic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Surely this has something to do with the anchoring effect:- If you offer £210,000, it&#39;s a signal that you&#39;re looking at increments of £10,000.- If you offer £211,000 it&#39;s a signal that you&#39;re looking at increments of £1,000.- If you offer £211,000.01 then it signals that you&#39;re taking the piss.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s something about confidence and accuracy in there too, but I would expect anchoring effects to be stronger in those contexts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The sooner we collectively decide that housing shouldn&#39;t be a market, the better. We all need it, and we should figure out mechanisms to make it available to all.Practically that means paying to build and maintain housing stocks, changing tax incentives so developers are incentivized to build more housing and less luxury housing, charging a premium for unused land in desirable areas (parking lots don&#39;t house people), abolish mandatory minimum parking, and upzone neighborhoods (eliminating the &#34;single family home&#34; neighborhoods as a zoning type.)I&#39;m also of the much more radical opinion that we should protect tenants over landlords in nearly every case, that we should protect the rights of people to live where they&#39;ve historically lived (eg, one shouldn&#39;t be &#34;priced out&#34; of the home they&#39;ve lived in for 20 years), and we should offer extensive public housing (built as many geographically distributed small apartment buildings and 5 over 1s, not giant tenements or projects.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Moody&#39;s who quite famously engaged in what should be criminal conspiracy regarding the rating of MBS [1] leading up to 2008 that cost pension funds, mutual funds and investors billions of dollars makes further statements about the housing market.Sorry but I don&#39;t put a lot of stock in what Moody&#39;s says about anything.There&#39;s pretty strong evidence that the rise in house values is structural not speculative. This is essentially the constraint of supply. There are multiple causes of this including:1. The US building very few new homes 2010-2020. There are lots of reasons for this. A big problem is the type of housing being built, particularly in urban center where like NYC where the vast bulk of new housing units are ultra-luxury condos;2. Permissive policies allowing the rich to park money in real estate. This particularly includes foreign nationals from places like China, India and Russia; and3. An increase in people owning multiple properties. These include second homes, vacation homes and short-term rentals (most notably for AirBnB). There&#39;s strong evidence that AirBnB in particular has huge negative impacts on a lot of metropolitan areas.A lot of tempted to blame Blackrock and other instituationl investors as constraining suply. this is completely overblown.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In Keycloak nothing made sense to me until I got myself familiar with OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect.Keycloaks documentation seems vast, but isn&#39;t. There is also no way to search inside their documentation. It&#39;s a pity.A better documentation is contained in the administration web ui itself. There are so many &#34;hints&#34; and tooltips for almost every option there is. It really helped me a lot.Keycloak is good software. It never failed for me. Even upgrading from 7.x.x to 16.x.x somehow just worked.Yes, their docker image is fat, but it&#39;s also very flexible. Now that they are basing Keycloak on Quarkus instead on Wildfly, the docker image should shrink in size.    quay.io/keycloak/keycloak   18.0.0                      a6bd0f949af0   15 hours ago   562MB
    quay.io/keycloak/keycloak   18.0.0-legacy               421e95f49589   46 hours ago   753MB

ok, still big :).Beware: they aren&#39;t using Docker Hub anymore. Newer versions are on Quay only (https://quay.io/repository/keycloak/keycloak).I&#39;m happy with Keycloak. Also nice folks around Keycloak."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My company used Keycloak for a long time (I&#39;m not there any more) and I agree with everyone here, it works great, but it&#39;s hard to understand unless you already know oauth/oidc, and it is a huge binary.While Keycloak is a great out-of-the-box solution, my #1 complaint at the time was how heavyweight it was, which was a burden for development, followed closely by its packaging as a J2EE app and bundling with Wildfly (at the time).This meant we needed to know not only about Keycloak itself, but also about Wildfly&#39;s special quirks, the clustering system (Infinispan??), Java and Docker.Now it&#39;s packaged with Quarkus, which is another dependency to learn about, and to be honest despite the quality of the finished product, all those dependencies have become pretty off-putting.So while I can recommend Keycloak&#39;s functionality, if you&#39;re not already deploying Java apps as part of your job, I suspect it will present a pretty serious administrative burden to deploy into serious production."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We tried using keycloak in a startup where I worked. It needed a loooooooot of memory and was very slow to start. It probably needed some JVM tuning, but we were just deploying as a stateful set (for the postgres). The docker images were also huge.We had to use another FOSS project called Gatekeeper as an authentication software along with keycloak, which got obsoleted and replaced with a different project (lukedo proxy or some such).The community support was also relatively not that active like other FOSS project that we used (for other areas of the stack). Overall, the experience was not so great that we decided to ditch both keycloak and gatekeeper. This was about a couple of years back. Not sure what the current status is.Some other alternatives that we wanted to try were from the Ory project (Kratos etc.) But we just went with some proprietary AUTH solution in our startup."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This sounds like burnout to me. I am in my mid-40s and used to have spells like this, but no more. I needed some kind of large change, back then, to get myself sorted out, but this could be pretty destructive because if I waited too long, the change I&#39;d need wouldn&#39;t really be conducive to staying on whatever project I was on.The key to not having to deal with this problem anymore, for me, was starting to proactively switch things around to break the routine of consecutive work-weeks. One of my tricks was to do some kind of mini-vacation every 6-8 weeks, go somewhere new, leave work behind for 3-4 days. Even smaller things like regular social events can work wonders - anything that breaks the weekly routine.Back when I&#39;d get myself into burnout periods the most effective way to recover enthusiasm was to pick up a new skill, work-related or not. I was in my mid-30s in the late aughts and not entirely sure I wanted to keep coding - so I signed myself up for an 18 month &#34;executive MBA&#34; program to find out if I might want to do something else, and instead came out of that with a whole new outlook on how and why to write code.Then around 5 years later I started writing code on the side, for myself, to gradually improve over the long term, and this can be absolutely therapeutic.Try to switch things around a little bit, do something new, see if that helps?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Your problem is very simple: you are working on bullshit.Across your entire description of your situation you never once mentioned what it is you are actually working on but called out the income you hit and frameworks you are playing with. I humbly submit that your problem is that you have lost the plot.Hate to break it to you chief but the libraries and frameworks and techniques you use to work are not the point. Creating stuff that people want to use is all that matters. Doing it with finesse and craftsmanship is how you go from good to great but if nobody gives a shit you will always feel empty.Switching projects and doing something &#34;harder&#34; isn&#39;t going to fill that void.Build something people want. I promise your drive and all the rest will follow behind once you are making them happy and get hooked on solving their problems and improving their lives.That is what this game is all about."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll pile on to the burnout suggestion with my own personal solution to how I fixed that problem.I&#39;m early 40s, started coding around 13 or so, so it&#39;s been 30 years of software for me.  About ten years ago after living in the web programming world for a few years I got kind of the same feeling you have.  I missed my forms and windows app development, so I went to another company doing what I remembered enjoying.You can guess what happened next.  I hated it.  I remembered all the things that annoyed me about windows app development, and realized I was just tired of coding every day.  Coding has never been what I like about coding, it&#39;s building things that do things.  I started focusing more on the building side, this time with the team around me, and also just some non coding fun projects like learning auto mechanics, etc.  I drifted into a management role by accident and found a ton of fulfillment in coaching and mentoring.  After a while I started to miss the coding side, so I went into an architecture role where I still got to do coding but it was mostly exploratory POC stuff to decide on new technologies or not.  I took a role after that as a principal engineer, and while these are all mostly just title changes, it gave me enough variety to be exciting again.Today I tell prospective employers that I am someone that drifts between IC and leadership roles.  I believe experience in both helps both.  My drive waxes and wanes but I think that&#39;s totally normal for humans.  I just came to terms with it and stopped worrying about it, and now I&#39;m very satisfied in my career."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Energy densities of various substances and/or reactions is pretty fascinating concept.Some of the most interesting energy analysis I&#39;ve come across (Vaclav Smil and David MacKay especially) describe energy in terms of area:  what are the comparable land areas which would have to be dedicated to specific sources or forms of energy or fuels, and how do those compare?  One of Smil&#39;s descriptions of petroleum wells is &#34;punctiform&#34;, which I love.  A hole in the ground, only about 20 cm in diameter, can provide years to millennia of human energy output, per day.1 litre of oil is equivalent to about 3 days of human energy output (at 3,000 kilocalories/day).1 gallon of oil is eqivalent to about 11 days of human energy.One of the oldest oil wells in production (the First Oil Well of Bahrain) produced 80,000 barrels of oil per day initially.  That&#39;s over 1,000 years of human energy equivalent.By comparison, the yeild of current biomass production is far, far less.  The difference, of course, is that oil is biomass, accumulated, converted, and concentrated over hundreds of millions of years.  We&#39;re consuming it at &gt; 5 million times its rate of formation.  (See Jeffrey S. Dukes, &#34;Burning Buried Sunshine&#34; (2003).)In terms of radioactivity, the net metabolic rate of the Sun&#39;s core is lower than that of a human, measured in energy/mass.  Solar metabolism is closer to that of reptiles, about 1/5 of mamallian metabolic rates.Chemical energy is less productive than the most effective nuclear transitions, but its shear abundance and ease of utilisation tends to weigh in its favour."</p>

Even if you captured that decay energy with perfect efficiency, powering a house would require about 300 quadrillion[6] bananas&gt; [6] Fine, I looked it up this time.I think that&#39;s out by a factor of 1000.Potassium-40 decays 89.28% of the time to calcium-40, releasing 1.31 MeV, and 10.72% of the time to argon-40 releasing 1.46 MeV [1].  That&#39;s .8928*1.31+.1072*1.46 = 1.32608 MeV per decay on average, which is about 2.1246e-13 Joules [2] per decay on average.  15 decays per second is 15*2.1246e-13 ≈ 3.1869e-12 Watts = 3.1869 picowatts per banana.  I think Randall is using 1000 Watts as the average power usage of a house.  1000/3.1869e-12 ≈ 3.1378e14 ≈ 300,000,000,000,000 = 300 trillion bananas.  Maybe he looked it up wrong?Can anyone confirm this?I can&#39;t find the packing density of bananas, but if it was 1000 kg/m^3, a medium banana is ~118 g [3], so 1000/.118 ≈ 8475 bananas / cubic metre, so 300e14/8475 ≈ 3.54e12 cubic metres of bananas.  The New York metro area is about 12000 km^2 = 12e9 m^2 [4], so the depth of the banana pile is on average 3.54e12/12e9 ≈ 295 metres, which is indeed taller than most of the buildings, so that bit seems right.It&#39;s half past midnight here, so I&#39;m well into &#34;Someone is wrong on the internet&#34; [5] territory....[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potassium-40[2] https://www.unitjuggler.com/convert-energy-from-MeV-to-J.htm...[3] https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/bananas-calories-carbs[4] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_metropolitan_area[5] https://xkcd.com/386/"</p>

It means the functionality needs to be so strong it doesn&#39;t matter. It also looks super snappy which matters most.Something that Airtable has over relational database GUIs is lightweight enums and arrays of them. Sure you can model all that in SQL, but it&#39;s super useful to have it right inline. I hope this tool can pick up on a pattern like enum tables (like hasura) and provide UI that makes them look like tag list/select fields."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unpopular opinion: Social media is a great scapegoat, but it is not the source of the problem. It is where they go to communicate and cope. My sole qualification to post this: I have four kids that are either teens or in their early 20s, and one who will be a teen next year. Here is what I see out there:1. Kids have little or no slack in their schedule. This means very little freedom, and very little time to work things out mentally. School, practice, volunteer, homework, bed, do it all again. This builds up to a very difficult to unwind ball of stress, anger, fear and despair.2. Everything is conflicted and unclear. Schools teach cultural tolerance while enforcing zero-tolerance policies. Diversity is good, but being ____ is bad. So many areas where what we teach and preach are the opposite of what policies and actions actually do.3. The stakes are too high. View the wrong website on your chromebook and get referred to law enforcement. Have a kid send you the wrong selfie and get charged with a sex crime. Get a bad grade and you are off the volleyball team, and you won&#39;t make the team next year - so done forever. Misbehave and you&#39;ll be arrested by the resource officer and face time at juvi, and potentially a conviction that will be held against you for a very long time (in some states juvi convictions count against three strikes laws).3. Kids are targeted. Sexual predators, gangs, fringe and mainstream ideologues looking to recruit followers, sports agents and talent scouts all have one thing in common: they want to exploit kids or sell them something.It&#39;s really hard to be a kid right now, and that needs to change. We need to lower the stakes, the stress and have something that resembles consistency."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Social media definitely amplifies it, but consider the economic and social environment that teenagers have lived through their entire lives. Multiple major recessions, a global pandemic, rising inflation, housing and education getting more expensive by the day, prospect of a mountain of debt right after graduation, climate that will be unlivable in a few decades, political extremism becoming the norm, and massive government gridlock that has made fixing any of this impossible. Can&#39;t really shield kids from this reality anymore when all of it is one click away. Teens are aware that they are going to inherit a pretty terrible world, and are powerless to do anything about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ofc it is plummeting. We are letting them install apps that have people behind them with the sole job of making them more addictive. We are handing them drugs, multiple variants if I may say so. I had to fight with my daughter for TikTok and whatnot, she is only allowed with YouTube due to school/tutorials/classes etc and I still find myself pretty often having to snap her out of shorts and other bs with an algorithm behind it designed to keep you on and ...consuming.These are modern drugs my friends and we are not doing anything about it. Our kids are being milked of their time, attention, imagination, focus and money. The majority of them can&#39;t even cross the streets properly any more. They don&#39;t even look if the drivers saw them, they all have a phone in hand."</p>

When the user switches focus (where to?) or on every keystroke? Does it make sense to a user that they temporarily see the Fahrenheit value for 2°C if they really want to type in 20°C? What happens if they type an invalid value (or clear the box, which they often have to do)? What happens if they type an incorrect value and then type something into the other field? 
Etc etc.I think there are a lot of interesting tensions between a &#34;formally correct&#34; system and one that feels usable and intuitive to use. Especially with bidirectional data flow, they show up quickly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;a Heroku database&#34; was what was known as core-db internally for the longest time. I&#39;m not sure if still the case or not today.But at one point was the source of everything for Heroku.Over time things were moved out, so this isn&#39;t an everything that exists has been leaked, but it is not a guarantee that attacker didn&#39;t move from one area to another.As someone with some apps on Heroku, having worked there, but no knowledge of the details of the incident more than others... I would:1. Rotate all creds2. Ensure logging all connections to the DB (I can&#39;t recall how much you can do this on Heroku)3. Extra heavily audit Github commits and Heroku releases4. Maybe keep rotating all creds?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s going to be a question about the expected probability of this across cloud service providers.I&#39;ve done security work for multiple cloud service providers and know a lot of people in the industry. I&#39;m not really privy to give details.I can say: dev teams face limits on what they can build securely, platform teams face limits on what secure by default and monitoring features they have time to implement, security operations teams have a lot of data points to look at, and in theory even changes in personnel in a couple of teams can have an impact on the threat posture for a given set of a company.People are trying. But if you do the math for introduction of attack surface over time versus risk mitigation effort over time for that attack surface you can derive some estimates for likelihood of attack.If your cloud provider isn&#39;t providing you that data as a customer, it&#39;s not simple to make a determination about likelihood of risk introduction and breach of your cloud provider.This hasn&#39;t really been something people talk about because there was a tacit assumption that the biggest companies are mostly getting this right.I&#39;m not trying to say the cloud is inherently broken, I run a lot of workloads in the cloud and trust sensitive data to the cloud. But I do wish there were better ways for customers to have data points with which they could evaluate platforms besides extrapolating the history of public breach reports."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On April 7, 2022, a threat actor obtained access...GitHub identified the activity on April 12, 2022, and notified Salesforce on April 13, 2022, at which time we began our investigation.Can some experienced security professionals weigh in on the cultural and organizational factors that allow this kind of major breach to go unnoticed for a week, that too in a reputed company like Heroku?I&#39;m not asking this rhetorically or in bad faith. It&#39;s a genuine question I have based on a project I did. I researched cybersec tech like SOAR, XDR, security logging, and SIEM in depth. On paper, the marketing for such tech gives the impression that by using them, such breaches can be detected and prevented in real-time. But there seems to be a mismatch between the claims and ground realities. If so, why?"</p>

Even now, I run into this mindset _in the Rails community_ of all places. But thankfully we know now how this story will end, because the advantages of wildly simpler stacks which work better with modern web specs AND offer improved performance in many cases are undeniable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was anti-SPAs until I started living permanently on a 2G connection. Now I love the few that I use.They cache a lot of data, lazy load almost everything, and renders are much faster. Also, best of all, the experience when my internet goes down—which is often—is at least a partially functional page, instead of a total blank screen which is what HN and other sites that deliver full HTML or nothing gives me.I cannot count the number of times I have lost a long well-typed comment on HN, because my internet went down while sending it and my browser apparently considers that to not be situation that it can reload the page on using the data it was going to send.I think SPA&#39;s work better on low-data lines because they are apps and work just like other phone apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; For starters: a lot can be done natively nowadaysI learned this recently on my personal site when I was going through and de-javascripting stuff.  I more and more frequently run without scripting enabled, and it felt very wrong that my personal site had some JS requirements.  The worst being that it wouldn&#39;t render without JS due to a slick little fade-in effect in the template...One of the things I do quite like (living on a low bandwidth connection a lot of the time) is lazy loading - and it turns out that you can do that without JS too, now, at least in modern browsers.img loading=&#34;{lazy,eager}&#34; will do this without needing JS.  Combine it with picturesets for smaller images (you let the browser pick an image it supports and a size relevant to the display), and life is good without any JS.At this point, as far as I know, the only things on my site that require JS are the &#34;Make the image bigger when you click on it&#34; feature, and then a JS based search function (which sucks down an awful lot of JSON, but it&#39;s fine, and beats an active server backend for a personal blog).It&#39;s also impressive just how responsive a browser on a gutless wonder ARM SBC is when all it&#39;s having to do is render content, not run a bunch of JS!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The way I look at it is: there are more tools in the toolbox than ever before. Which makes our judgement (the thing they really pay us for) even more important. Kubernetes, for example, is a specific solution to a specific problem. The solution is complex but so is the problem. If k8s give you the right trade-offs for your situation, then it’s not busy work.Of course, there are plenty of project where judgement Is thrown out the window in favor of adding a buzzword to everyone’s resume. I’ve heard it called “promotion-based architecture”, as in you pick the technology most likely to get you promoted.

It’s and industry-wide lack of emphasis on identifying and understanding the problem first."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You are experiencing what I call &#34;The Bisquick Problem&#34;. Bisquick is basically flour with some other stuff, like salt, premixed into it, and sold in a box in the USA. So instead of just buying flour and salt, you buy them together, which makes some things easier (like making pancakes), but it complicates literally everything else. You can&#39;t use it as flour, or as salt.With software, the problem is even greater. You can use react, for example, but you will probably start with create-react-app, which adds a lot of things. Or you could start with Next.js, which adds a lot of things. You could use Java, but you will probably start with Spring Boot, or Dropwizard, which adds a LOT of things. Plus all of these starting points imply the use of new languages, configurations, and programs, in particular, builds.In my view, all of these &#34;Bisquicks&#34; represent experiments-in-progress, with the ultimate goal of the systematic characterization of &#34;software application&#34;, in general. In other words, they are systems of alchemy, pushing toward being a system of chemistry, which we don&#39;t have yet. So it is bound to be a confusing time, just as it was surely confusing to play with chemicals before Lavoisier systematized the practice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I generally agree, but two things I&#39;d like to point out.If you&#39;re using python for the web you&#39;re already part of the complexity problem, atleast from the perspective of someone deploying php 15 years ago.  I use python for web development, and I love it, but deploying webpages used to be copy an apache config and  ftp/scp your files to some location.   Now we need app servers and reverse proxies, and static files are served differently, and even though I&#39;ve gotten used to it over the last decade it does&#39;t mean it&#39;s good.The other thing is that MonoRepos are pushing back against complexity for the sake of complexity. Why create a new repo when a directory will work just fine?  I think a ton of people got repo crazy because their coporate jenkins server only allowed one project per repo,  but it is trivial to check the latest git hash for a directory and base your deployment on that. ...I have a project I inherited that has 14 repos for a webpage with maybe 5 forms on it.   I&#39;ve mostly handed it off at this point, but everytime I have to look at it I end up preaching about monorepos for weeks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If Stripe can leverage their banking relationships to leapfrog Plaid by integrating directly with bank&#39;s APIs instead of doing screen scraping... that would be massive! It seems like Plaid&#39;s biggest weakness is the flakiness of their connections, which creates so much frustration/churn downstream.Plaid&#39;s other weakness is their opaque, enterprise-style pricing, which is seems like Stripe is doing away with. Hopefully they can bring the price down, because lots of consumer-facing use cases aren&#39;t viable due to the high monthly price per connection.I hope they add support for investment account holdings—it seems like Plaid is the only one that does this well.—Edit: digging deeper, it looks like Stripe proxies to Plaid-like &#34;service providers&#34; under the covers—at least for institutions without OAuth flows. [1][2][3] Presumably they&#39;ll build in-house connections over time, but it dents my hope that their connectivity will be better than Plaid&#39;s.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tailscale has a fantastic product, I’ve been extremely happy from day one. If you’re waiting for a weekend to have a few hours to try out Tailscale, don’t, it takes 15 minutes to get every device you own up and running and talking. This is the lowest friction personal VPN to ever exist, and once you see how easy it is for your own devices, you’ll wish you had it at work.The biggest risk that this company has is that Cloudflare  (in all reality) should just buy them or reimplement it. It’s the type of product cloudflare would make, that’s for sure. Being based on open source wireguard, and being just a STUN/TURN server at its core… I’m sure that Tailscale will be the first but maybe not the best.I’ve been dreaming lately of a tor-like network that’s based loosely on the idea of tailnets. Rather than blockchain bullshit, you’d have a direct ring of trust with friends, and then you could set up access policies to forward packets for people you don’t trust, but who know someone you do trust.Web3 happens when people can host stuff on their phones, and Tailscale is something that lets you host things on your phone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With such a huge investment comes the obligation to eventually pay it back. Is this another one of my favourite tools going the way of Dropbox, 1Password and all other companies that were formed around what should be a platform feature, which took on way too large investment sums and were eventually forced to become the everything, losing sight of their core values?I sincerely hope not, but there&#39;s so much bad precedent."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anyone else who wonders wtf tailscale is:&gt; Tailscale is a VPN service that makes the devices and applications you own accessible anywhere in the world, securely and effortlessly. It enables encrypted point-to-point connections using the open source WireGuard protocol, which means only devices on your private network can communicate with each other.It seems to take care of key distribution, nat-traversal, authentication etc etcNeat! No sure how that is &#39;fixing internet&#39; exactly, but really cool anyway"</p>

He fired up Starglider- and I was simply blown away.My C64 didn&#39;t cut it anymore - I just had to get the Amiga. An involvement in the Norwegian demo scene followed.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Former Googler here.  This person has correctly identified that a key reason why google sucks is that people very often...&gt; choose between doing what’s best for users or what’s best for their careerBut the root cause isn&#39;t that people want to get promoted.  It&#39;s that Google promotes people for the wrong reasons.  Put very simply, the problem is that Google promotes people for &#34;solving hard problems&#34; not for solving USEFUL problems.Imagine if people did get promoted for fixing bugs instead of building a new product (to be abandoned)!  Or if maintaining an existing system was somehow on par with building a new system (which is just a bigger more complicated version of something perfectly good).  The googler would say &#34;well those useful problems are too easy to merit a promotion.  Anybody can solve easy problems - we&#39;re google, and we&#39;re too smart to work on those easy problems.&#34;  Grow up.Y&#39;all value the wrong things.  That&#39;s why your culture is broken."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent over 9 years at Google. Got promoted 3 times. Was a manager.Google is absolutely bonkers when it comes to promotions. At every opportunity to provide feedback towards upper management, I had one consistent refrain:Everyone needs to chill the f### out.The stakes (seem) too high. The amount of time invested is too high. The amount of discussion, rehashing, tinkering, rejiggering, and calibration is just too high. It&#39;s off the charts how obsessed seemingly everyone is about it. It&#39;s off the charts how much company time was blown on it and psychological stress people were subjected to. IMHO, the process at Google doesn&#39;t need to be readjusted or tinkered with, but somehow de-escalated; like it needs to not be such a huge f&#39;ing deal.One positive development ~5 years ago is that promotion to levels L5 and below were mostly moved out of the IC&#39;s hands and into their manager&#39;s. Despite being a manager at the time (and creating more work for me), I thought this was great. It reduced the bias in the system from ICs writing up their own packets, which disadvantaged poor writers and poor self-promoters less. It got employees thinking less about promotion, since there was less they could control or do. There were other biases that crept up, but it helps the psychology of day-to-day life to not be stressing over the frantic ladder climb."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It gets worse than promo-driven development.Recently we had a chat with a lead from another team. Their product has a lot of similarities with ours so we sync up every now and then to bounce ideas off each other. They recently release a big change that we thought didn&#39;t provide much value, so we asked him about it.His candid answer was &#34;you know how it works, we have a service running in production, so we need to make changes&#34;. This sounds simple, but the implications are deep. Unlike individual engineers, moving entire teams around is difficult. If you have a team, you need to &#34;justify&#34; their existence. Is not enough to keep the lights on or slowly polish the product, you need grand roadmaps to keep yourself busy the next year or two. Ideally you want to justify that you need extra headcount to keep the product expanding."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Decades ago, in the days before uber, my employer would fly in candidates from college campuses as part of an onsite interview. The candidate would fly in the night before and we relied on a taxi service to bring the candidate to the hotel. Then in the morning the same service would bring them to the onsite and of course bring them back to the airport at the end. It was a whole curated process.Little did the candidate know - we knew the driver quite well and he knew many people in the firm. More than once there would be a candidate who thought they could be rude and disrespectful to the taxi driver because ... you know... its just an immigrant taxi driver with a distinctive accent.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I interviewed at Google in 2006, one of the interviewers asked me to write code for solving a particular problem.  I replied along the lines of &#34;ok I need to think about this, it&#39;s not obvious how to solve it&#34; and started thinking.  Time ticked away.  Five minutes.  Ten minutes.  Fifteen minutes.  The interviewer started reminding me that he needed me to write some code and if there wasn&#39;t anything for him to copy down into his interview notes I wasn&#39;t going to pass the interview.  (Why interviewers were all transcribing the whiteboard rather than taking photos I have no clue.)Eventually I ran out of time, having written no code on the whiteboard.  I asked my interviewer &#34;ok so what is the algorithm for solving this&#34; and he admitted that he had no idea.At the time, I thought he just meant that he had no idea what the solution was; but in hindsight I wonder if the real test was to see if I would crumble under pressure and write code I knew didn&#39;t work.(I got a job offer, but turned it down to start Tarsnap instead.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I interviewed with AWS, half the loop interviews were with remote staff.  I was shown to a videoconferencing room and asked to wait.  There was a pile of VC equipment but it wasn&#39;t connected.  With five minutes before we were due to start, I decided this was part of the interview and plugged stuff in myself, powered it on, and clicked through some boot-time screens, guessing at the right inputs.  A few minutes later a call came in and the interviews themselves proceeded normally.To this day I still don&#39;t know if it was a test."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny thing is, making cities more green isn&#39;t even _that_ difficult. I see above conversations on living closer to nature, or mountains vs parks - but the vast majority of time spent is walking and driving in the cities. So it seems a no-brainer that before everything else, before thinking about taking a 2 hour drive to hike, or making the time for a weekly visit to the park, we should first make sure the places people actually walk through and live in every day are as green as possible.There is no one solution, of course, since at the very least climates and budgets can be wildly different, but a good start is making sure every street has a green canopy above, starting with the largest. After that, take every space you can and put something living on it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the sort of thing I think about when the pro-urban/pro-density/anti-car people talk about their vision for the world. I live in a city now, and the lack of substantial nature is suffocating to the extent that I plan to move. The idea that we should all live this way to conserve space—a resource which is only scarce in these urban places—seems excessive to put it mildly.EDIT: A lot of urban folks are rebutting my “substantial nature” complaint with references to their city’s parks, which is amusingly illustrative of our differing perspectives. I was thinking “mountains and forests”, not just green spaces scattered amid the concrete.EDIT 2: A lot of urban folks are talking like the suburbs are swallowing up the countryside. I’m sure they’ve grown, but it’s still a big world out there people. I can’t recommend a cross-country road trip enough. Y’all need to leave your cities once in a while and see the world that you have such strong opinions about! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Most of the studies in the linked APA article have all the hallmarks of the replication crisis:- Small sample sizes (O(100))- Low correlation coefficients- Everybody is predisposed to believe the conclusion (what kind of monster doesn&#39;t like nature?)- There is zero incentive to report a negative findingAnd even if some of the studies do replicate, the response variable is often either self-reported, or performance on some written test or survey: so it&#39;s not really clear what we are even measuring. What is the unit of &#34;general connectedness&#34; ? How about &#34;eudaimonic well-being&#34; ? These are not legitimate scientific concepts.Nature is great. I find that a long walk in the woods is a good way to clear my head. But I&#39;m not convinced that these studies add anything to my common sense intuitions about the matter. And by using weak methods to justify something we all already believe (or want to believe), we risk degrading trust in science that will be greatly needed when scientists reach a conclusion that isn&#39;t politically convenient."</p>

There are a few commands listed which employ it, but it absolutely deserves its own entry.That and `readlink -f` to get the absolute path of a file. (Doesn&#39;t work on MacOS; the only substitute I&#39;ve found is to install `greadlink`.)And `cp -a`, which is like `cp -r`, but it leaves permissions intact - meaning that you can prepend `sudo` without the hassle of changing the ownership back.I never see `lndir` on these lists either. It makes a copy of a directory, but all of the non-directory files in the target are replaced with symlinks back to the source while directories are preserved as-is. Meaning that when you `cd` into it, you are actually landing in a copied structure of the source directory instead of the source directory itself, as would be the case if you just symlinked the source folder.Once inside, any file you want to modify without affecting the original just needs you to create the symlink into a file, which you can do with `sed -i &#39;&#39; $symlink`. There you have it: effectively a copy of your original directory, with only the modified files actually taking up space (loosely speaking).Looks like I have a few pull requests to submit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Easy to accomplish (at least for me). One word: Dog. I walk daily 90 minutes at least. There was a time (and another dog, but thats not the reason) where it was more like 120-200 minutes a day outside. I live in a fairly populated town in east Germany. We have a solid forest and lots of lakes around. Its great and like 20 years+ later I know most of them, but not all.My coworker and I worked like a year together at my place. He came around, we drank a coffee together and started working. Like 3-4 hours later, depending on schedule, we took a good 60 minutes+ walk with my dog. We talked project related things sometimes, but it felt never like &#34;we have to talk about work&#34;, We were kind of friends so we had lots of other topics. Then back at my place we continued for 2,3 or even 5 hours. We had no issues stopping after 2 hours, but did often way more. We were very productive.We were a good match, but those breaks outside enjoying life (forced by my habits to go at least 60minutes outside with the dog) helped a lot not burning out and making room in the brain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find the anti-backpack mindset interesting, because I started urban walking after getting wilderness backpacking experience. I can&#39;t imagine walking around without a daypack, and I often bring it with me even when it&#39;s empty. On my morning commute today it held a Kindle, a spare set of headphones, and a plastic bag for when I buy more groceries than can fit in the pack. I&#39;m probably not going to use any of those before I get home, though.Backpacks are magic for longer trips. Food, water, coffee, all go in. Unsure about the weather? Layers layers layers, all in the pack. I also use LL Bean&#39;s PrimaLoft Packaway (I own two, one black and one orange), and have a shell for rainy/snowy weather. Unless it&#39;s both cold and rainy, one of the two goes in the backpack.I&#39;ve also never worried much about pocket preferences on my shorts and pants. I instead care about pockets on my packs. My current big pack is an Osprey Exos 58 (but the newer version doesn&#39;t have hip belt pockets or a shoulder strap pocket), and my daypack is an REI Flash 22 (with easily accessible side pockets, and a top pocket that you can reach with an awkward shoulder movement).Edit: The big floppy hat comment was absolutely spot-on"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After walking to and from work for 5 years along the same route, I found that I prefer walking without listening to anything on headphones.Just thinking increases awareness of my surroundings, allows me time to process existing thoughts as opposed to consuming more inputs, and connects me to the people I would inevitably see on a semi-regular basis.Personally, I have found that 1 hour + is a good threshold to aim for for some really quality thinking. After about an hour I&#39;ve already processed normal stuff about family or work and have moved on to deeper topics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The longevity of his employment is likely a result of the company&#39;s willingness to promote him instead of hiring externally, despite his start at the entry level. This is not likely to happen anymore, at least nowadays.From the article: &#34;After getting his first position as a shipping assistant, Walter showed outstanding skills and willingness to learn, always doing more than expected. [...] Shortly after, he was promoted to a position in sales. Then, he became a successful Sales Manager.&#34;I once spoke with a professional baker who started off as a machine operator for a bakery in his late teens, then earned promotion to become a production supervisor and then distribution manager. He then moved companies to become a plant manager, and later an operations director involved in baking formulation, until becoming an account manager (sales) for large baking firms.The commonality between these stories is that loyalty and hard work at a job has historically enabled people to earn a good quality of life. Nowadays, it intuitively seems like internal promotions from the very entry level are harder to come by, as many firms prefer to hire people with degrees for management or hire externally.Instead of promoting internally like in the past, I read and heard from managers they prefer to recruit externally for management positions. They perceive that internal candidates lack &#34;leadership qualities&#34; from past interactions with them, and/or perceive that they produce more value in their current positions. When asked how they account for these people changing jobs for promotions to lead elsewhere, the response was that they would say they understood the former employees&#39; positions and would wish them well (without openly reconsidering whether they were under-weighing the value of internal promotion)."</p>

It used to be much stronger until the disastrous Collor government caused a number of them to go bankrupt or severely reduce their production due to some serious mismanagement of the Brazilian economy.Edit: His original employment contract can be found here (in Portuguese, a bit difficult to read): https://www.brusquememoria.com.br/acervo-imagem/2057"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dabbled in web-based mapping a couple years ago and found the tech stack to be really quite polished. Starting from a database of features from e.g. OpenStreetMap hosted in a Postgres-based PostGIS map server, and geographical boundaries via special shape files, you can write XML files representing the features you wish to see on each layer of the map (using SQL queries intended for PostGIS), and CSS-like style files representing how the features should look. You then set up a tile server (Apache or nginx or whatever) that generates tiles on demand and performs caching. Finally you use a JavaScript library to provide the &#34;slippy map&#34; that users can drag around.All of these layers of the tech stack have FOSS implementations; indeed most of the most widely used ones are FOSS. And then there&#39;s QGIS (also FOSS) to do most of this in a similar fashion, but offline.As merely a dabbler having a bit of fun, it&#39;s rather excellent I must say. It would be interesting to hear from anyone working in this field professionally as to how the FOSS tools measure up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s crazy to see how much has remained the same, even if so many new things were added. Looks like pretty much all the buildings that existed in 1777 still exist today.Even crazier to think that at the time the original map was made, pretty much all cities in the US didn’t even exist yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to see how segmented Antwerpen was back in 1777, what the author describes as hedges.These were usually the result of inheritance, when the land of one owner got split into pieces and each child then got one piece. They got smaller and smaller.I didn&#39;t think that this was already so extreme in 1777, but comparing it to the other maps, only Antwerpen and Brugge seem to be affected."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve always been interested in repair and have done a good bit of mending on my own clothes. I have a few black tee shirts from Target from about six or seven years ago that have just gotten a few small holes that I&#39;ve repaired and you can&#39;t notice. Takes less than 5 minutes after a while from getting the thread out all the way to cutting it at the end.For down jackets, you can get yourself a roll of repair tape for ~$5 that&#39;s as simple as cut and place. I used to work for a large outdoors retailer and we had access to damaged and returned goods at crazy discounts. I got a $200 down jacket for $2.50. Add the $5 roll of repair tape that I still have and we&#39;ve got a great jacket that I&#39;ve worn for about four years now.It&#39;s kind of fun to do as well. Having sentimental value with the things you use is kind of nice, as long as you don&#39;t go overboard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had this beautiful bespoke suit which had just been hanging in the closet, due to me gaining some weight. After slimming down I wanted to wear it again, only to find a couple of large and very noticeable moth holes on one of the lapels.Welp, money down the drain I thought. Local dry-cleaner tipped me about &#34;invisible mending&#34;, so I did some research. Ended up shipping it to the UK, and paid around £120 for getting the jacket repaired - with excellent results. Some might say that&#39;s a steep price, but the alternative was binning a £4000 garment."</p>

research access to OPT-175B upon request.
Access will be granted to academic researchers; those
affiliated with organizations in government, civil

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A quick summary of the Limitations section:- &#34;OPT-175B does not work well with declarative instructions or point-blank interrogatives.&#34;- &#34;OPT-175B also tends to be repetitive and can easily get stuck in a loop. While sampling can reduce the incidence rate of repetitive behavior (Holtzman et al., 2020), we anecdotally found it did not eliminate it entirely when only one generation is sampled.&#34;- &#34;We also find OPT-175B has a high propensity to generate toxic language and reinforce harmful stereotypes, even when provided with a relatively innocuous prompt (Gehman et al., 2020), and adversarial prompts are trivial to find.&#34;- &#34;In summary, we still believe this technology is
premature for commercial deployment.&#34;With regard to stereotypes:- &#34;When compared with Davinci in Table 4, OPT175B appears to exhibit more stereotypical biases in almost all categories except for religion. Again, this is likely due to differences in training data; Nangia et al. (2020) showed that Pushshift.io Reddit corpus has a higher incidence rate for stereotypes and discriminatory text than other corpora (e.g. Wikipedia).&#34;- When testing with the RealToxicityPrompts data set, &#34;OPT-175B has a higher toxicity rate than either PaLM or Davinci&#34;"</p>

I really dislike the fan mob that it&#39;s starting the hate because RTMI is not going to be a throwback and retro-game.&gt; Monkey Island 1 and 2 weren&#39;t pixel art games. They were games using state-of-
the-art tech and art.This is SO true, and as much as I loved those games, as much as I stopped playing modern videogames and as much as I love the style of Thimbleweed Park, going forward for an artist like Ron is what _defines_ an artist. If you like MI1 and Mi2, just play MI1 and MI2 again as I do from time to time. Just like you would watch again a movie from the &#39;70s or listen to the Beatles. But you cannot ask an artist to stay always the same because you loved their first works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this post. I know a decent amount of indie devs, I also have done some hobby game development myself. I see this alarming trend of devs and small studios that are, what I would call, hyper engaging with their players. I get it, the players are important, you want to sell the game, you want people to play it. But, the entitlement and feedback I have seen from some players is just ridiculous. Most players don&#39;t have the fist clue as to what makes a good game, or just how hard it actually is to make games. I feel like this post was very elegant way of basically saying &#34;Shut the hell up, it&#39;s my game, I don&#39;t care what you want, I am making this game primarily for me. This is my art, and my way of expressing myself and sharing it with the world, this is not a collaboration. If you like it great, if you don&#39;t, oh well.&#34;, but in a much more palatable and acceptable manner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a bit ironic that he says he was not really a fan of Day of the Tentacle&#39;s &#34;Chuck Jones&#34; art style, when the screenshots for his upcoming Return to Monkey Island are all very specifically that 90&#39;s-infused Chuck Jones style - multiple skewed perspective lines in a scene, extreme avoidance of curves (rendered instead as polygonal outlines, so to speak).The art style for his new game is rather ironically nostalgia-laden in probably an unintentional way: it&#39;s deep nineties pop art, ala &#34;Xtreme&#34;, etc.&lt;edit&gt;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really exciting. I wish we had nuclear power here in Australia. I know I might get downvoted for this comment. But with advancement in technology and large amount nuclear fuel (Uranium deposit) available, it&#39;s a great choice.1. Vast swathes of uninhabited land can absorb some of the risks/fears associated with a nuclear accident. With technology like this, the risks are even lower.
2. It&#39;s lot cleaner than coal and natural gas, which are still the primary sources of our electricity.
3. There will be a huge demand for electric cars in the near future drawing massive amount power from the grid. Nuclear power would be a lot cheaper and enable us to truely go green.Of course the coal companies won&#39;t like that. I can&#39;t see any reason why don&#39;t have nuclear energy. Please correct me if I&#39;m wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SMRs are nuclear reactors that typically produce up to 300 megawatts (MW) of electricity, which is enough energy to power 300,000 homes for one year.I suppose anyone who has some knowledge re electricity knows what they&#39;re trying to say here, and for anyone who doesn&#39;t it won&#39;t make much difference, but reading a sentence like this still hurts me a little.MW (megawatts) are a measure of power, not energy.  This means the &#34;per year&#34; part is meaningless.  Also for what it&#39;s worth, 300MW for 300k homes is 1kW/home, which is a pretty old rule of thumb for average household power use.  I believe the current average in Canada (and the US) is considerably higher  But that&#39;s also just the average; the peak is much higher.  300MW is the peak output for the plant, so the true number of homes it could power is lower regardless, absent storage.None of that to say the prospect isn&#39;t exciting! And I suppose the source here is the weather network, so perhaps they&#39;re a bit outside their area of expertise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The background on Canada&#39;s plans for small modular reactors (of which this is just one of three projects) can be found here:https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Canadian-provinc...Supposedly this is promoting clean energy and fighting climate change, but the details don&#39;t always match this rhetoric.  In particular they&#39;re thinking they can use nuclear power to replace piped-in natural gas to mine the Alberta tar sands and make (very dirty) syncrude for export to refineries in the USA, maybe China too.  Yes, that does reduce natural gas use... but you&#39;re still burning dirty tarsand oil.  The better option is to just leave the tar in the ground.Otherwise, SMRs sound kind of interesting, but there&#39;s been a lot of failed innovation in nuclear reactors in the past.  Some of us might remember when safe and reliable and innovative pebble bed reactors were going to be the thing that made nuclear acceptable everywhere, and that ended up going nowhere:https://thebulletin.org/2009/06/the-demise-of-the-pebble-bed...&gt; &#34;For some, helium-cooled, graphite-moderated reactors such as the PBMR have always been the ultimate evolution of fission reactor design. The use of helium and graphite allows the reactor to burn the fuel efficiently and to operate at much higher temperatures than conventional light water reactors. It is hoped the temperatures would be high enough to allow for the reactor’s heat to be used directly for industrial processes such as hydrogen production and tar sands processing. High temperature reactors can also be designed to use thorium-based fuel as well as uranium and can be developed as fast neutron reactors that don’t need moderators.&#34;I was enthusiastic about nuclear 20 years ago... now, not so much, since solar/wind/storage really gives more watts per dollar invested, with less side issues (security, uranium supply, waste storage).  Nuclear has a niche, but it&#39;s going to remain small."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to have a reinsurance company as a client. For those unfamiliar, that’s an insurance company that sells insurance to insurance companies. Example: You buy a $1,000,000 automobile liability insurance policy with a $1,000 deductible.If the insurance company doesn’t sell enough of these kinds of policies to reliably offset payouts with premiums, they might turn around and buy a policy from a reinsurance company with a $10,000,000 limit and a $100,000 deductible against their entire portfolio.Thus, reinsurance companies spend a lot of time thinking about things that don’t happen very often but can be very expensive when they happen.And yes, they had a division that did propositions like hole-in-ones, and also they insured legal betting companies against wild trifectas and that sort of thing.I have a small trove of stories they told me about bizarre accidents that wound up costing enormous amounts of money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually had a chat with a friend about prize indemnity insurance, he&#39;s a Lloyd&#39;s guy.In the end it&#39;s the law of large numbers, pretty much what a casino does: take lots of small positive bets, don&#39;t let one bet dominate. If you do get something too big, syndicate it with some of your competitors to spread the risk. Of course also make sure everyone who comes for insurance is actually what you think, like the guy in the article says it&#39;s not necessarily a hugely detailed check but it is enough to stop the worst frauds.You want a model that&#39;s robust, and you only have so much data about how often some guy hits a hole in one or a half court shot, and there&#39;s only so much you can know about whether they are a pro and the distance to the hole.The big problem seemed to be competition. You only get to write the insurance if you&#39;re the best price but the best price is not necessarily one that makes sense for the business. If some guy is buying market share with a loss leader, what do you do? Every segment of the market could be affected by this at a given time."</p>

So sex education resources would frequently get blocked. Although, again, that may have been by puritanical design.Anything which looked like it might be used to bypass their filters (VPN, proxies, etc) were also blocked.Ultimately, the customer isn&#39;t the user.

Spent an hour on chat with them telling me that no such plan had ever existed until I told them I had all the receipts and evidence of how much data I had used and threatened to take them to the small claims court with expenses at £60/hr for my time. They capitulated quickly after that and restored it, then &#39;lost&#39; my plan again the next month.I&#39;ve had problems with billing glitches with four utility companies in the UK now and I am starting to suspect that overcharging people and hoping they don&#39;t notice is actually a common business strategy in the industry and if they get caught they blame bad IT but really their systems are configured to do this on purpose."</p>

I feel like the CDC are the least scary people buying this data. And from the looks of it they used it for medical research, which if similar in style to other medical research is bound by boards and ethics committees.What we aren’t writing about in this article are the groups using this data Cambridge Analytica style to sway political opinion, and other less than stellar purposes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an excellent use of the data, a proof that it is worthwhile for the data to exist, and a terrifying demonstration that we need to grow the hell up with respect to data privacy.It actually sounds like the anonymization and aggregation was done pretty well for this. There&#39;s no such thing as 100% anonymity, but there are useful levels of anonymity.The fact that we don&#39;t have a standardized way of blessing data with varying known levels of privacy, checked and enforced by law, is kind of ridiculous in 2022.If you want to maximize privacy here, then let&#39;s pass laws to prevent doctors from knowing the gender, age, and weight of any of their patients.I 100% agree that privacy is handled way, way too loosely in general, and this does look like the CDC was a lot more interested in a grab bag of use cases than it was with maintaining anonymity. But surely that&#39;s an indictment of our societal failure to regulate data brokers? It shouldn&#39;t be up to the CDC to act counter to their mission."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not even about not willing to spend 1$ for a random phone number.Here&#39;s a list of things that are wrong with what Google does:- If you want to read your email, you have to use app specific password. I&#39;m ok with that.- You can&#39;t generate app specific passwords if you don&#39;t have 2FA enabled. That&#39;s some artificial limitation made to force you into adding phone number to your account.- You can&#39;t use authenticator app to enable 2FA. I have no idea why SMS which is the least secure way to send information is a primary method and authenticator app which can be set up by scanning QR from the screen without sending any information at all is «secondary» and can only be used after you give your phone number.- You can use «notification» to confirm it&#39;s you, but you can only do that on the phone. I&#39;m currently logged in in my browser, certainly I could confirm any login attempt from that same browser, wouldn&#39;t that be a second factor?- Nowhere in announcements or help pages or in the Google Account interface they tell you that you can&#39;t generate app passwords if you don&#39;t have 2FA. The button is just missing and you wouldn&#39;t even know it should be there unless you search on the internet.- Nowhere they tell you the only way to enable 2FA is to link your account to your phone number or to your android/iphone device, the options are just not there.All of this is just bizarre and ugly. I have no idea why other people are not complaining, probably most of them just accepted that and added phone numbers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every tech company is losing the war against credential stuffing. I have a friend working at a series B startup with &lt;10k MAU, you wanna know how many login attempts there are each month? 25,000 login attempts. Per user. That&#39;s 250m login attempts each month using stolen credentials.None of the service providers who claim to fix the issue are worth their weight in salt. Shape, Akamai, none of them have a grip on the problem because the attackers are constantly evolving. As you can see, even Google is capitulating despite all the fud that people on HN spread about the company being omniscient.Anyone who thinks this is about advertising/collecting personal data is out of their minds.The worst part is nobody can talk about it because anything you reveal about your problems can give the attackers a massive edge."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google is no saint, but there&#39;s absolutely no reason to ascribe ill intent to collecting phone numbers of 2FA setup. The reason is simple: Google has billions of users, and at any given time, a lot of them break their devices and lose access to 2FA credentials. Phone numbers, despite all their flaws, are still the most reliable long-term and mostly-immutable attributes which can service as a proxy for identity which can and does aid account recovery at scale. If you crack your phone screen, you can walk to a brick and mortar cell shop, present your ID and get a new phone that receives security codes without a second thought. If you&#39;re using Aegis and storing MFA seeds locally, you&#39;re on the hook for backups and no one wants that responsibility.Think of it like using social security numbers to authenticate yourself to the bank. Yes, it&#39;s terrible, but it&#39;s kind of the only thing that works when done on a massive scale. Yes, you can do better at managing your 2FA credentials, but most users cannot - they struggle even having strong passwords. Phone numbers bridge that security-usability gap. To be clear, this isn&#39;t an endorsement of the system (I think the user should be allowed to choose), but rather trying to make sense from an engineering perspective."</p>

I keep a count of the requests-per-second I&#39;m getting in each nginx worker. I also set a special cookie for every response from the upstream (it could literally be foo=bar). When the RPS goes approve a certain threshold, if the special cookie is not present, I serve a static HTML page (bypassing the upstream) that sets the cookie and reloads the page (Nginx can do 20K+ RPS without breaking a sweat). In my experience, these fly by DDoS attacks never use cookies, so legitimate users can get through, but the bots are blocked.Of course, if you get hit with something slightly more targeted, this defense is worthless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I graduated my bootcamp in 2015 and had a jr developer job with a 50% pay bump within 6 weeks. I had a college degree but in a non-technical field and 0 experience coding before I started the program. In my cohort of ~20 people all but 1 had found gainful employment as software developers within a year, most within 3-6 months.I completely agree that the value of a bootcamp is having a community to encourage you through the process, everything they teach you can be found online. I also went to a bootcamp that had a good reputation around my city so I think it was legitimizing for someone with no experience and no stories of coding for fun as a teenager.Even back then hackernews was full of people saying how flooded the market was with bootcampers.4 years later I grinded leetcode and got a job at a FANG and essentially 6x&#39;d my income from 4 years earlier before I could code. I eventually left that job because I was miserable but thats a whole other story.Now with 7 years of experience I leave the bootcamp off my resume because of the stigma. I took the specific degree program off my linkedIn and just put &#34;bachelors of science&#34; and let people assume what they want. If anyone asks I just say I&#39;m self taught.Point is, it&#39;s 100% possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; But the main advantage of the bootcamp to me was not technical, it was the network. Apart from providing a friend group which will likely end up in referrals down the road, the best bootcamps will introduce you to companies and have relationships with them.I’d love to understand this in detail. When I was at Amazon, we didn’t take boot camp grads very seriously, and in recent years the company only looked into this to increase diversity hiring, specifically boot camps oriented towards either women or the LGBT community.I’m convinced there’s massive upside in bringing in more talent - people who learn in their own time or through boot camps. Unfortunately, senior leadership disagreed and preferred to bring in talent from India and other countries because their visa status gave us considerable leverage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was an underachieving ADHD having bad-at-math kid with no prospects for the future. I dropped out of high school and taught myself programming and system administration, by reading two programming books and going through HOWTOs (remember those? Sorry kids they don&#39;t exist anymore, you&#39;ll have to make do with 1000 random blog posts) to set up server software and networks etc.Because of my unstructured learning and random hobby type direction it took me a couple years to get proficient, but eventually I knew more about systems admin than people who&#39;d been doing it professionally for years. I got hired for peanuts by a startup, and networked through User Groups to a better job that paid more.My career&#39;s been nearly 20 years with no higher education or any other skillset whatsoever, bad at concentration and memorization, no bootcamps or teachers or mentors. I&#39;m not a genius. If I can do it, you can do it.An unlimited amount of free information and learning is out there on the internet. Go and get it, learn it, practice it. Network and find someone who wants to pay you chump change and build that resume.Also remember there are a lot of roles today in tech. Many don&#39;t require a ton of technical chops. Figure out what they are and what they entail, and target your learning towards one. Even lower end roles pay better than most other jobs, and you can always pivot to another role later once you have some work on your resume."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Seems like a great idea. When you look at many ML frameworks half the code and learning overhead is data schlepping code and table like structures that &#34;reinvent&#34; the schema that already exists inside a database. Not to mention, there can be security concerns from dumping large amounts of data out of the primary store (how are you going to GDPR delete that stuff later on?). So why not use it natively where the data already is?For anything substantive it seems like a bad idea to run this on your primary store since the last thing you want to do is eat up precious CPU and RAM needed by your OLTP database. But in a data warehouse or similar replicated setup, it seems like a really neat idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool, running ML workloads on top of SQL is a very practical way of doing ML for a lot of businesses. Many companies don&#39;t have the fancy ML workloads like you see at OpenAI, they just have a SQL database with some data that could greatly help their business with some simple ML models trained on it. This looks like a nice way to do it. A slightly different approach that I&#39;ve been working on involves hooking data warehouses up to Pachyderm [0] so you can do offline training on it. Not as good for online stuff as this, but for longer running batch style jobs it works really well.[0] http://github.com/pachyderm/pachyderm"</p>

I got the feeling that he didn&#39;t actually believe it, and thought if he asked enough times I&#39;d confess to having a team.My experience with this in interview loops is that it&#39;s less about admiring a persons technical abilities, but more a checkbox question to determine whether a person fits into a certain role model that companies have set up. At most FAANGs, interviews will expect that you mention you are being the tech lead of a team (5-10 engineers) at a (L|E)6 role, even if one isn&#39;t a manager. At (L|E)7, it will be 50+ engineers.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great post. This one always brings a smile to my face:&gt; Every component is crash-onlyI was part of the team that developed a distributed, five-9&#39;s control system for an industry where downtime costs millions per minute and comes with a federal investigation if long enough. On top of that, the industry is made up of competitors that explicitly distrust each other, so all components had to be truly distributed, with no central coordination for anything.Given the requirements we decided to explicitly adopt a crash-only approach. Between idempotent operations, horizontal scaling, and fast restart times, we could make failing components not impact SLAs (and we had testing to ensure it).Once it gets out into the field (which because of how risk adverse this industry is, is measured in years), it turns out they really did not like software crashing. They interpreted crashing as bad quality, and no amount of &#34;we do it on purpose to ensure correctness&#34; was going to make them happy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed reading that a lot.&gt; The main advantage of distributed transactions is that they make distributed systems look less distributed by choosing CP, but that inherently trades off availability!This is true, but I suspect that its slightly missing the important thing about transactions. A transaction is an operation that takes the database from one Consistent (ACID &#34;C&#34;, you can think about it as &#34;legal under the business logic&#34;) state to another Consistent state. Linearizability (CAP &#34;C&#34;) isn&#39;t enough to do that, because often changes in databases require &#34;take from Bob and give to Alice&#34;, or &#34;check Bob and Alice&#39;s balance and add the order&#34;, neither of which fit well into Linearizability&#39;s single-key definition of the world. Allowing developers to think about a stream of operations that moves the databases from one legal state to another is super powerful. The whole point is that it provides an abstraction that hides concurrency (ACID &#34;I&#34;) and partial failure (ACID &#34;A&#34;). Saving developers from reasoning about those is a big win!&gt; I should also note that while Distributed Transactions might be a useful tool in building idempotency, simply wrapping a non idempotent operation (e.g. “add 1 to X”) in a transaction does not make it idempotent.The OP is right that this isn&#39;t a panacea, especially where those transactions aren&#39;t idempotent. But transactions are a mechanism to implement idempotence (&#34;insert order number 10 if it isn&#39;t there already&#34;), and idempotence and ACID &#34;C&#34; can be really hard to achieve without transactions (or at least &#34;I&#34; and &#34;A&#34;).Transactions, CRDTs, and the CALM theorem are linked too. You can definitely have transactions in systems that aren&#39;t CAP &#34;C&#34; consistent, and still have them do legal things. The CALM theorem lays out one way to think about those, and CRDTs are a kind of object-oriented embodiment of that theory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a great post and covers many day to day topics that practitioners tend to hand wave over, especially as distributed systems are becoming more pervasive. Dare I say even some of the statements are becoming cliches.The section on distributed transactions could have a little more nuance. Particularly the example about the counter where I suspect any system offering transactions also has a CAS operation. Additionally the benefit of a transaction system is that you can offer bounded counters where as an AP or “strong” EC (CRDTs) system cannot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes, the US is a country that cannot process its own waste so it ships it overseas just to be rid of it. The solution is not to raise money and send it to the Philippines to build landfills. The solution is to actually recycle plastic, build circular supply chains, and use biodegradable materials as much as possible.If humans are to stay on this planet, in the long term we cannot just keep piling up garbage in landfills and building on top of it. Eventually, in hundreds or thousands of years we will have to remediate that land. Its going to be a lot better if we just make our waste as recyclable as possible in the first place.The author is recommending a half measure based on the assumption that the US cannot fix its own problems. They are also implying a false equivalency: banning single use plastics is not the same as recycling plastic. A more equivalent comparison might be the tradeoffs between plastic bottles for soda, water, or oils and glass or metal containers.  It is also true that plastic straws are a much smaller problem then other usages of plastic such as bottles or event fishing gear and even bags.Yet there is nothing inherently wrong with reducing plastic usage. Doing so is smart and will be important for the health and well being of future generations -- human and nonhuman -- of life on earth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Plastic gets a bad wrap. But it&#39;s a pretty dang efficient material. It takes so little energy and material to make something very functional and resilient. I know that CO2 analyses of the replacements to plastic bags and straws has not been very kind to them.I find it commendable to encourage people to consumer less stuff, but the war on plastic straws has been a huge step back - it&#39;s done relatively little to actually help, but has imposed huge and everyday annoyances on everyone. These should be the exact opposite goals of environmental reforms when there are much lower hanging fruits available."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is conflating two separate issues.Their main point is at the end:&gt; Banning plastic straws is stupid.They&#39;re probably right that throwing out plastic straws is better than throwing them in the recycling, assuming that plastic straws can&#39;t be efficiently recycled.  That being said, many US recycling utilities typically sort the recycling on shore, and plastics that are too small to be efficiently identified and recycled (such as straws and loose bottle caps) will just be sent to the landfill regardless. How recycling is processed differs a lot across the country, so it&#39;s hard to make generalizations.But that doesn&#39;t support their final conclusion about whether plastic straws should be banned.  The author doesn&#39;t give a reason, but implicitly that they think paper straws suck, and must suck.  Which a lot of the ones today do. But it&#39;s an odd hill  to die on, given that basically all straws before 1960 were made of paper.  Their ire should probably be directed at the establishments they frequent for buying cheap and terrible paper straws instead of spending a bit more to get good quality paper straws.  Such companies probably want to get you pissed off by paper straws to demand that your government remind the ban so they can go back to using cheaper plastic straws."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey Akash,I like the idea of giving people some help expressing themselves at work. You might be interested to learn about the Power Distance Index, and the body of work on PDI and work culture.You’ll see if you read the comments here that some people are like “the alternatives are bullshit corporate speak and infuriate me”, and some are like “yes, at last, a way to help people be more polite / better communicators”. There’s a smattering of “this is passive aggressive” thrown in.One of the broad pitches PDI at work types make is that the lower the PDI, the more direct communications are preferred; the higher, the more ‘diplomatic’ the communications are preferred. My vibe on your list is that it’s just a tad more diplomatic than Silicon Valley wants to be, hence the slight negative ‘passive aggressive’ reactions.Some of the lowest PDI countries in the world are Israel, and many Northern European countries, and it fits my experience that in those places additional respect is given for bluntness - as Jan Maas in Ted Lasso says “I’m not rude, I’m Dutch.” As a broad stereotype using the alternate wordings you give would be a sign you are not someone to be respected in that environment.On the other hand, Saudi Arabia’s PDI is high, and I would bet that some of your alternate list there would still be much too rude; just a guess, I haven’t worked in Saudi.Anyway, thanks again for this; if you stay interested, you might consider reworking this into different ‘cultural norms’ lists to help people acclimate / go both ways; at that point, I think it would be a very broadly useful resource."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This version of &#34;professionalism&#34; has the stereotypical West Coast problem: the message it claims to be sending gets not only lost in translation, but distorted into something more superficially inoffensive, but underneath that, more opaque and manipulative. It encourages indirection and avoidance rather than respectful candor.Let&#39;s start with the first example. The polite way to say &#34;you are overcomplicating this&#34; is &#34;I think this could be simpler&#34;. Not &#34;let&#39;s concentrate on initial scope&#34;, which isn&#39;t remotely the same thing in general. The latter is less generally applicable (how do we know there was an initial scope?), less specific (why stick to initial scope?), and more prescriptive (&#34;let&#39;s do this&#34; instead of &#34;I listened to your idea and this is what I think of it&#34;).Now, being less specific and more prescriptive may be some people&#39;s idea of effective self-interested corporate behavior, since it works to minimize your vulnerabilities and maximize the obligations of others. But I think communication is more meaningful, effective, and respectful if you explain how you evaluate others&#39; ideas (which implies you at least gave them the respect of listening) before just telling them what to do.They&#39;re not all bad though! I definitely think &#34;that&#39;s a horrible idea&#34; is productively replaced with some version of &#34;I have these concerns&#34; or &#34;I think there may be better alternatives&#34;. It&#39;s generally good to avoid terms that communicate nothing but negative affect and instead communicate whatever ideas that prompted the negative affect.EDIT: another comment mentions Power-Distance Index, which is part of a broader cultural dimensions theory. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstede%27s_cultural_dimens...Apparently I have a very strong preference for low PDI culture, as do most of you. But it&#39;s good to be aware that that&#39;s not universal and our style may require adaptation for success with diverse audiences."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think I agree with most of these. The professional way to say &#34;I told you so&#34; is to not say it. If there are specific action items you can bring them up in a post mortem without pointing fingers.If you feel like you genuinely need to let people know that something wasn&#39;t your fault (which would be a bit of an organizational red flag) that&#39;s an action item for you to make sure your interjections are more visible next time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; so that if another person is shown your sequence of digits from 1 to 6, he/she should not be able to tell whether these numbers were produced by a real die or just “made up” by somebody.That instruction is a flaw in the experiment. It&#39;s always impossible to tell, for any given sequence, whether it was produced by a fair die. There&#39;s nothing an experimental subject can do to make the impossible more impossible.&gt; the kind of sequence you’d get if you really rolled a dieWell, there is no such sequence. The instruction is incoherent.You could take it as meaning &#34;Construct a sequence that you think will convince others that it came from a random source&#34;. That would be coherent. And then it would be legitimate to eliminate responses that were all-heads (&#34;clearly didn&#39;t even try&#34;). But then what are you measuring? The comparative understanding of older and youger people concerning random sources, or the Gambler&#39;s Paradox? Their comparative expertise in human psychology? Their comparative willingness to move the mouse-pointer over the screen?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with the article that the study is flawed in its unwillingness to exclude the all-H and all-T answers. But I’ll go further: the original study is just silly.“Make a sequence that looks random” is sort of a nonsensical ask. Looks random to whom? To our algorithm, is what they meant. There’s no such thing as a randomness test that can look at a sequence and decide “is it random?”, so this algo measures something else and uses it as a proxy for “looking” random to…the study authors, I guess? There’s no ground truth here; it’s chasing a ghost.I don’t know what information we could even hypothetically gain from knowing older people score lower according to this algo—-perhaps that the paper’s authors are younger than 60 and thus picked a different “randomness-looking” algo than they would if they were older? At best that older people have an equally incorrect but qualitatively different idea of “random looking”?Of course we did not learn that; we only learned that older people pick all-H or all-T more. But my point is that there wasn’t really anything interesting at stake anyway.(Edit: expanding a bit)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like a lot of the comments here are written after only taking the test and many are not reading the rest of the article.The authors of the website are stating that they believe the study is wrong. The below/above 60 answer is showing you it’s incorrect half of the time along with data backing up the claim."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like that story, and wish the author luck.I never thought of myself as a &#34;niche programmer,&#34; but, as it turns out, I sort of, am.I write native UIKit applications, using Swift. No PWAs, no hybrid systems (like React, Electron, or Ionic). I&#39;m pretty good at it. I&#39;ve been writing Swift, every day, since it was announced in 2014. It&#39;s no longer an &#34;edge&#34; language; it is now the baseline, mainstream, native development language for Apple systems, and I&#39;m a fluent speaker.It means that the apps I write are really small, really secure, really fast, accessible, highly usable, use very few system resources, leverage the latest Apple tech, have almost no external dependencies, work extremely well, and I write them very, very quickly. Also, because they are UIKit, I can get pretty ambitious, as UIKit is a very mature, ship-oriented system. I am looking forward to using SwiftUI, but am yet to be convinced that it is suitable for really ambitious projects.It&#39;s really difficult to find other native Swift developers that work the way that I do. Part of that, I hate to admit, is probably because I&#39;m 60, and I got really sick of sitting in meetups, with a circle of avoidance around me. I have come to understand that I have &#34;cooties.&#34; I won&#39;t go where I&#39;m not welcome.But I have also come to realize that an awful lot of apps for Apple systems are written using hybrid systems, and that many folks are unaware that there are Apple app development languages, other than JavaScript."</p>

Also, you get access to the filesystem so you can organize your books however you want.- Customizable collections (similar to folders) with Calibre- Run Python so you can run w/e you want. Some ideas...    - Sideload books via WiFi

    - Sync notes automatically


The main idea of Jailbreaking is that you own your device and you can do whatever you want with it. However, I switched from a Jailbroken Kindle Paperwhite to an Android e-ink reader about a year ago and I&#39;m never looking back.Regardless, I&#39;m happy to see this on Hacker News!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"KOReader (something you can install on a Jailbroken Kindle) is the best book reading app I have come across, in any platform."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Got the idea in my head the other day that I should look into Kindle jailbreaking for my older Paperwhite 2. Was surprised to find there wasn&#39;t much of a scene, and no meaningful OS to install.I&#39;d absolutely love to read Twitter and other sites if they were formatted smartly for an e-ink device. An e-ink RSS reader would be a dream. I know there&#39;s a site out there that tries to be a hub/aggregator for reading some sites on the Kindle browser, but you have to type in the URL every time..The Kindle browser is still experimental after a decade and has almost no features or real UX. All the JS out there probably killed the project."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a few qualms with this API:1. For a Linux user, you can already build such a system yourself quite trivially by getting an FTP account, mounting it locally with curlftpfs, using SVN or CVS on the mounted filesystem, and copying all the Owen Wilson &#34;Wow&#34; audio (.ogg) files.2. It doesn&#39;t actually replace a USB drive full of Owen Wilson &#34;Wow&#34; clips. Most people I know e-mail &#34;Wow&#34;s to themselves or host them somewhere online to be able to listen to them, but they still carry a USB drive in case there are connectivity problems. This does not solve the connectivity issue.3. It does not seem very &#34;viral&#34; or income-generating. I know this is premature at this point, but without charging users for the service, is it reasonable to expect to make money off of this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve described this on HN before; forgive me if you&#39;ve already seen it.I have chronic migraine. It sounds worse than it is; I rarely suffer attacks anymore, and when I do, they&#39;re usually mostly harmless, as in the case I&#39;ll describe below.Contrary to popular belief, migraine is not a headache. It&#39;s something a little more like an epileptic seizure. Intense headaches are one common symptom, but there are a lot of others.One common symptom of migraine is called *scintillating scotoma*. A scotoma is a blind or blank spot in the visual field. A scintillating scotoma caused by migraine is an area of the visual field that is temporarily replaced by a vivid visual aura. Its appearance is commonly the first symptom of a migraine attack, and is often followed by more unpleasant symptoms.I&#39;ve seen scintillating scotoma many times over the years. A few years ago I was reading and enjoying a good book, and my scotoma appeared. It was a humdinger: roughly triangular prisms of white light with utterly black zebra stripes moving along them kaleidoscope-style. It took up the lower left middle of my visual field, pulsing and radiating and turning, covering the book in my hand.I was disappointed. I didn&#39;t want to stop reading. I was enjoying the book. So I decided to keep reading until the scotoma made it impossible to continue.It never did.It became so vivid that I couldn&#39;t see my hand at all, but I still had no trouble reading the book. I even started reading it aloud without any difficulty.After a few minutes the scotoma faded. In that instance, it was not followed by any other symptoms (that&#39;s happened more and more frequently over the years since probably my forties).I could now see the book again, and could confirm that what I had been reading was indeed what was on the page.I thought about how to explain my experience. The best hypothesis I&#39;ve come up with so far is that the neurological process of seeing and the neurological process of being consciously aware of what I&#39;m seeing are not the same thing. They&#39;re independent processes. The scotoma prevented me from subjectively experiencing seeing the book, but did not prevent me from actually seeing it, nor from correctly interpreting what I was seeing.This experience (and one two other odd experiences) has led me to adopt the working hypothesis that many of our cognitive experiences are more complicated than we tend to assume, and that they&#39;re often made up of several more or less independent processes. We usually benefit if related processes pretty much work together, so they pretty much do. Because they do, we experience them all together as a single experience, but that&#39;s an illusion that unravels if circumstances screw up their synchronization.I hope someone finds that as interesting as I do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the 1800s, scholars who knew a lot of languages (including, often, several modern and ancient European languages, and increasingly also Sanskrit) started to notice some amazing patterns about similarities in words among all of these languages, including languages from very far apart and that had no visible connection at all from the point of view of their present-day speakers.As these patterns were explored, they were found to be even more systematic and pervasive than they had appeared. In some cases, one sound would systematically change into another sound from language A to language B.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm%27s_lawThese patterns helped reveal historical connections between most languages of Europe, Central Asia, and South Asia, showing that those languages had descended from the same ancient sources. (Note that this isn&#39;t true of 100% of languages in this region -- there are other unrelated families that turned up -- but it&#39;s true of a significant majority.)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languagesThe languages that turned out to be related this way included the Germanic family (like German, English, Dutch, and the Scandinavian languages), the Romance family (like French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, and Catalan), the Celtic family (like Irish and Welsh), the Slavic family (like Russian, Bulgarian, and Ukrainian), and also Farsi and all the Central Asian languages related to it, and Hindi/Urdu and all the South Asian languages related to it. Oh, and Greek.If I tried to list all the languages and language families that were linked up to this family tree, we would probably be here all day, because they go on and on. Just under half the people in the whole world have one or another of them as a native language today!These languages changed quickly enough in history that most people no longer noticed, or remembered, that most of them were related to one another, yet slowly enough that it&#39;s been feasible to deduce an enormous amount of information about the history of particular languages and particular words, once many of the rules and patterns had been identified.A Grimm&#39;s Law example is that the h sound in Germanic languages usually corresponds to the k sound in Romance languages (note that this can be stated much more technically and accurately). So, it turns out that &#34;hundred&#34; and &#34;cent&#34;/&#34;cento&#34;/&#34;centum&#34; actually share the same origin. And &#34;heart&#34; and &#34;cœur&#34;/&#34;corazón&#34;/&#34;καρδία&#34; (origin of &#34;cardiac&#34;) (also &#34;cordial&#34;; the root in Latin sounds like &#34;cord-&#34;). And &#34;who&#34; and &#34;que&#34;/&#34;quoi&#34;/&#34;qui&#34; (and similarly for other wh- questions in English and qu- questions in Romance, which were originally hw- sounds in English and kw- sounds in Latin).Some other examples are t to d (&#34;ten&#34; and &#34;decem&#34;/&#34;diez&#34;/&#34;dez&#34;, plus some of the examples above that have a t in English), and f to p (&#34;foot&#34; and the Latin and Greek words from which we get &#34;pedestrian&#34; and &#34;podiatrist&#34;, and Romance &#34;pied&#34;/&#34;pie&#34;/&#34;pé&#34;; and don&#39;t forget about &#34;father&#34; and &#34;padre&#34;/&#34;pater&#34;/...).Those are just a couple of the phenomena that people noticed in the 1800s; while the exact development of these patterns gets much more complicated, they&#39;ve proven to work over and over and over, for hundreds of languages and hundreds of thousands of words!(... Also, the Grimm from Grimm&#39;s Law is one of the Brothers Grimm, from Grimm&#39;s Fairytales!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In drug development, a lot of the engineering goes into making sure the pharmaceutical compound -- having been developed -- actually reaches the target area of the body. If the compound is a relatively large particle that needs to get into the blood stream, a nasal spray might result in the compound being deposited at the bottom of a person&#39;s lungs without ever getting absorbed. If stomach acids break the chemical down then digestion might not be a feasible approach. Intravenous might work but shots are scary, or worse the medication may need to be administered in low doses over a long period of time, requiring an IV catheter.For a pill that can be digested, often it will be the case that the pharmaceutical compound needs a lot of buffer space, sugar or something else to prevent it from being absorbed too quickly. So if a pill says &#34;Do not break in half&#34; or &#34;Do not chew&#34;, this is because doing these things increased the pill&#39;s surface area and the rate that the drug gets absorbed, when optimal rate of absorption has already been calculated."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very interesting. Can&#39;t wait to give it a shot.I personally use a combination of xpath, basic math and regex, so this class/id security solution isn&#39;t a major deterrent. Couple of times, I did find it to be an hassle to scrape data embedded in iframes, and I can see the heap snapshots treat iframes differently.Also, if a website takes the extra steps to block web scrapers, identification of elements is never the main problem. It is always IP bans and other security measures.After all that, I do look forward using something like this and making a switch to nodejs based solution soon. But if you are trying web scraping at scale, reverse engineering should always be your first choice. Not only it enables you a faster solution, it is more ethical (IMO) as you are minimizing your impact to it&#39;s resources. Rendering full website resources is always my last choice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"About 14 years ago, I also tried to tackle the public conversation troll problem and created a forum that got quite a bit of traction. While Radiopaper takes the carrot approach (&#34;write things people want to engage with&#34;), I took the stick approach: &#34;anyone can ban anyone else for a non-trivial amount of time, but you must reply to their post, and people will see that you banned them.&#34;It was a probabilistic method to filtering out the trolls, and it worked well. Trolls wanted to ban, but they themselves became the more-frequent targets of bans. Eventually, they would get frustrated with the bans and leave. The people that remained, stayed civil to not become a clear target of a ban. There would be brief chaotic behavior, but it never lasted. Cooler heads always prevailed.Radiopaper mentions that there is a lot of room for exploration in this space, to try different models for creating emergent social behavior and productive conversations. I hope we see more of it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A common discussion &#34;technique&#34; on reddit is to block the person you&#39;re arguing with right after your last message, when you feel you&#39;re done with the conversation. That way they will never be able to reply and you always get the last word. Unfortunately this feels like an amplification of that. However, I guess the dynamics will prevent the frustrating feeling when that&#39;s the game you&#39;re singing up for.Intriguing idea anyway. Looking forward to seeing how it pans out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The key mechanism that makes Radiopaper different from other social networks, and more resistant to trolling and abuse, is that messages are not published until the counterparty replies or accepts your comment.My mind is blown at how simple and elegant this solution is!Great work there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before this gets sensationalized more than it has, let’s consider that cognitive ability also plays a heavy roll in learning to play music. There may be some net synergistic effect music playing has on other cognitive function but the brain is also effected heavily when listening to music.

I ignored him, gave up piano, and now 100% without a doubt wish I could go back in time and stick with it.Still, I&#39;m grateful I got the opportunity to learn music, as now it&#39;s a huge part of my life (tinker on guitar, always on the hunt for new artists to listen to, etc).I have my own kids now, and it&#39;s fun watching them get interested in the instruments we&#39;ve got around the house, but I&#39;m also trying to figure out how to navigate the right amount of influence I should try and put on them to focus on music themselves."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nicely succinct explanation of this stance. As someone who agrees, I like this bit:&#34;One of the most promising and new developments in recent years has been a renewed interest in building decentralized systems of all types. Many people are looking into building a system of decentralized identity and giving that control back to the users.&#34;IE, decentralization is great, but blockchain type concensus building is rarely needed or useful in such systems imo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"NIST&#39;s Blockchain Technology Overview is a good explainer:* https://csrc.nist.gov/publications/detail/nistir/8202/finalSee especially Figure 6 (&#34;p. 42&#34;, 53 of the PDF), which is a flow chart to help you decide on whether blockchain may match one&#39;s use case. Extracted:* https://imgur.com/a/RlUj9EdGenerally you need the conditions of needing both (i) append-only log and (ii) distributed/decentralized before considering blockchain &#39;technology&#39;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the more under-appreciated aspects of blockchains is how they&#39;ve made public key encryption more accessible to mainstream users. For the first time in history, millions of people have setup and maintain custody of their own key pairs. These users have learned the importance of securing those keys and have a convenient way to sign or verify signatures using their crypto wallets.Not everything needs a blockchain, but consumer tools for generating and verifying cryptographic signatures would have never reached the same level of adoption as they have w/o the incentives that blockchains provide."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One feature a few of us toyed with for years that I&#39;d love to see tried seriously someday (or does it already exist?) would be intelligent tag trees or maps that stuff could be plugged into, ideally that could also be shared and mixed too. More specific tags would have parent/child/sibling relationships with more generic tags, and a single tag would then pull in all the others as far as searching. So for example if I have a photo of one of my cats, and I tag it Cat Name having set that up, &#34;calico&#34; or &#34;tabby&#34;, breed, plain old &#34;cat&#34; and anything else associated with the specific tag would all be hits. And up the stack, if I tag a picture &#34;calico&#34; it should show up under the &#34;cat&#34; tag as well automatically with no further effort. Conditionals could be incorporated too, like if there is a character who in a series has long hair, tagging &#34;short hair&#34; could automatically pull in &#34;alternative hairstyle&#34;.My big problem with typical tagging is that it&#39;s a lot of grunt work to be comprehensive. AI can help but has its own issues. While getting the UI/UX right would take some work, a universal system-wide multi-dimensional tag map could allow a lot more metadata a lot more easily. Even more so with sharing, communities could curate tag maps around areas of interest and one could stay synced with tag maps of &#34;aircraft&#34; or &#34;trees&#34; or the like which would bring in lots of technical depth to explore in a distributed fashion. Eventually maybe community AI recognition models could be an optional part of that too to help identify specific given subjects (and one would be free to then not have other kinds of things identified or shared)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember buying my first Moleskine notebook in college. It was my first exposure to &#34;fashionable office supplies&#34;, a foreign concept to me growing up. It was a super nice object. In fact it was so nice, I didn&#39;t want to use it to just take notes in class, because what a waste. I also didn&#39;t want to use it to  just scribble personal notes and todo lists in, because what a waste. In the end, I never wrote anything in that notebook at all: what a waste.Now I tend to view fashionable office supplies as productivity fetish items. It&#39;s easy to geek out on that stuff, but does a better notebook make me more productive? Seems to make me less productive, if history is an indicator.Yeah, I will occasionally find myself reading reviews of immaculately designed mechanical pencils, or minutely engineered Japanese scissors. But I try not to lose sight of the advantages cheap, lousy stuff has too: disposable, easy to replace, low barrier to use. These qualities are also valuable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;They aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process.&#34;This exactly! I think with pen and notebook. I also think without pen and notebook, such as during my driving and running. Without notebooks, I often find myself think in circles and having hard time to recall what I just realized a short moment ago. With pen and notebook, it is more relaxed. Often I don&#39;t revisit my notebooks. So the notebooks are mainly serving as a thinking aids than to serve as a database. Replacing them with digital sounds nice, but in reality it is just a distraction. Having the record to go back to is a short term benefit; the few pages of notes that I do end up revisit often quickly become part of paper or presentations, or tweets and moments, or more often, prototype code. I have accumulated a drawer of used notebooks. They only have sentimental values. And they have more sentimental values in paper forms than in digital forms.PS: my current favorite notebook is this one https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Sugarcane-Notebook-College-...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some years ago, I was on the margins of notebook enthusiasm, but never went all-in, because I quickly discovered that while I really enjoyed the physicality of notebooks, I came to dislike their pre-digital limitations. I still prefer the free-form capability to mix text and drawing and color and scribbles that pen or pencil on paper offers, but I then scan the finished pages into the computer.As a result, my favorite notebook is now a pad of A4 paper with a good weight, ruled, and perforated so I can easily detach pages and feed them through the scanner.Content warning for the following paragraph.I then destroy the originals."</p>

It&#39;s not pure PR nor a gruff legally-obligated disclosure.It helps that I wasn&#39;t really affected by this incident."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now a more philosoraptor style comment: I see Mcrib is a service built to
quickly detect and replace memcached&#39;s. I treat memcached in infrastructure as
a very stable service. Meaning it is infrequently necessary to upgrade it, and
it will generally not fail on its own. If it does it will be highly infrequent
compared to services with higher churn or more complexity/dependencies. This
means if they&#39;re failing often enough that you need to rapidly detect and
replace them you have a more fundamental problem.From a structural standpoint I think my technical comment can be useful. If
things really are failing this much A) you should figure out why and slow that
down. B) if you have a generally stable system and understand the typical rate
of failure, you can add tripwires into Mcrib to avoid over-culling services
and loudly raise alarms. Then C) you can improve technical reliability with
redundancy/extstore/etc.I&#39;ve also seen plenty of times where folks have a dependency of a service
determine if that service is usable, which I disagree with quite strongly.
Consul being down on a node should trigger something to consider if the
service is dead. It&#39;s important both for reliability (don&#39;t kill perfectly
working things because you end up having to design around it), and for
maintainability as you&#39;ve now made people afraid of upgrading Consul or other
co-dependent services. Other similar failures are single-point-of-testing
availability checking where instead you probably want two points of truth
before shooting a service.Now you risk people being afraid of upgrading probably anything, which means
they will work around it, abstract it, or needlessly replace it with something
they feel safer managing. The latter is at best a waste of time, at worst a
time bomb until you find out what conditions this new thing breaks under.This isn&#39;t advocating that you design without assuming anything can fail
anywhere at any time; just pointing out that how often a service _should_ fail
is extremely useful information when designing systems and designing fail
safes, alerts, monitoring, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi! I&#39;d like to offer some hopefully useful information if any Slack folks end
up reading this, or anyone else with a similar infrastructure. I&#39;ll start with
some tech and make a separate philosophical comment.Also caveat: I have no deep view into Slack&#39;s infrastructure so anything I say
here may not even be relevant. YMMV.First some self promotion: https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/Proxy
memcached itself is shipping router/proxy software. Mcrouter is difficult to
manage and unsupported. This proxy is community developed, more
flexible, likely faster, and will support more native features of memcached.
We&#39;re currently in a stabilization round ensuring it won&#39;t eat pets but all of
the basic features have been in for a while. Documentation and example
libraries are still needed but community feedback help speed those up
tremendously (or any kind of question/help request).It&#39;s not clear to me why memcached is being managed like this; mcrouter seems
to only be used to abstract the configuration from the clients. It has a lot
of features for redundant pools and so on. Especially with what sounds like
globally immutable data and the threat of cascading failures during rolling
upgrades it sounds like it would be very helpful here.If cost or pool sizes are the main reasons why the structure is flat, using
Extstore (https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/Extstore) can likely
help. Even if object value sizes are in the realm of 500 bytes, using flash
storage can still greatly reduce the amount of RAM necessary or reduce the
pool size (granted the network can still keep up) with nearly identical
performance. Extstore takes a lot of tradeoffs (ie; keeping keys in RAM) to
ensure most operations don&#39;t actually write to flash or double-read.
Extstore&#39;s in use in tons of places and everyone&#39;s immediately addicted.Finally, the Meta Protocol
(https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/MetaCommands) can help with
stampeding herds to help keep DB load from exploding without adding excess
network roundtrips under normal conditions. I&#39;ve seen lots of workarounds
people build but this protocol extension gives a lot of flexibility you can
use to help survive degraded states: anti-stampeding herd, serve-stale, better
counter semantics, and so on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;I completely underestimated how much work it takes to build a business. There&#39;s so much overhead. I&#39;m always figuring out why a build failed, taxes, how to triage issues, responding to support, designing UIs, responding to Apple&#39;s complaints, and more. There&#39;s so much that goes on behind the scenes. There&#39;s no way a single person can possible do this alone, especially as a side project.&#34;This is the part that resonates a lot with me even though I have been able to build a small business that is reasonably successful with a small team but it takes a toll. It is a frikin slog and there are days when you feel like jumping off a cliff. Also the cost of doing something so small can add up when you can have a cushy tech job making 200K relatively easy. To do your own thing requires a very different mindset and incredibly hard.There is a HUGE difference between building a quick side project for fun VS turning it into a real business (no matter how small). I have full sympathy for the owner and totally understand where they are coming from. No judgement and I wish them all the best."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see it going open source! I hope Actual can keep development going with the community support.Similarly, a local-first (PouchDB) budgeting app I built[1] went open source[2][3] a few years ago. It&#39;s worked out well, I love seeing what everyone does with it in their forks. Unlike Actual however, I maintain a paid subscription service while being open source.It&#39;s worked out quite well. Luckily it&#39;s not a huge time commitment as a side project, probably due to no native apps. I&#39;ve also shifted from active development to maintenance, with sporadic updates every now and then. For example, I recently moved everything from Gitlab to Github[4] and upgraded a bunch of dependencies under the hood to get everything compiling on Apple Silicon. (For example, I now run AngularJS tests with Jest, hehe.)[1] https://financier.io/[2] https://github.com/financier-io/[3] https://blog.financier.io/financier-is-now-open-source-bdfe9...[4] https://blog.financier.io/weve-moved-to-github-4617239b9fa3"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author writes well and makes compelling points. His &#34;I want to get off Mr Golang&#39;s Wild Ride&#34; post is good too.But I don&#39;t find myself agreeing with his position, which is &#34;you shouldn&#39;t use Go for production services&#34; (he explicitly says this in one of his Go posts, I forget which one and don&#39;t have time to look right now).The better alternative to Go is Rust. Okay, sure, I&#39;m willing to admit that in the examples presented, Rust handles things better. But Rust isn&#39;t a panacea. Rust is complicated and hard, and often it&#39;s not worth taking on that burden just to theoretically handle cases that rarely occur and even more rarely cause any problem. Programming is a means to an end, and the cost of using Rust (hiring, increased development time) is often not worth it.The reason Go is successful is because it&#39;s easy for companies to use to solve production problems with teams of varying expertise. Its stdlib is well-featured, its ecosystem is good. There&#39;s generally one correct way of doing things. The same doesn&#39;t appear true in Rust. For example, an _incredibly_ common thing to do in production code is to make a web request. In Go, there is no need for debate, you use the stdlib. In Rust, you have to use a crate, which requires a decision to be made. Even worse is the async story, in Rust you have to decide whether to use Tokio or whatever. That burden is just not present with Go.Btw this article should not be flagged and it&#39;s pathetic that people have flagged it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Flagging this post strikes me as shameful censorship of an unpopular opinion.You may say it&#39;s the snark/anger/frustration that got flagged, but I suspect it would not have been flagged if the topic were different.Presuming the author is making bad-faith arguments for internet blog points goes against the spirit of HN. I prefer to draw my own conclusions, thank you. I normally expect HN to take the higher ground with calm and reasoned counter arguments of the content but not today I guess."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used Go and Rust professionally and in side projects, and I had used Go first before Rust. When I first used Go, I was like &#34;oh wow, this is so simple and easy&#34;, and I didn&#39;t realize that I was putting up with the language. Learning Rust was relatively harder, but once I did and wrote some non trivial programs in Rust, it was like a pathway in my brain opened up and was previously blocked, and then when I went back to Go, I was painfully aware of issues that I the programmer had to keep in mind (or write a LOT of boilerplate code to keep track of). Issues that Rust&#39;s type system just solves.The way `nil` can seep into your codebase in Go and how bad the FFI is in Go will prevent me from ever choosing it for a project going forward. And I personally would not feel confident modifying Go code written by someone else, and would not feel confident accepting PRs into my Go codebase unless I understood every line inside and out.Rust is a breath of fresh air in that regard.All that said, I think the author here is idealistic in a certain sense. In the scale of &#34;solving a problem by hand (or using Excel/a proprietary tool etc)&#34; to &#34;writing a computer program to automate it&#34;, both Go and Rust are very close to each other. And once someone learns Go and knows it well enough, the incremental cost of learning Rust or even thinking about the problems Rust solves for you becomes not worth it. I think that it&#39;s sad that this is the way it works, but that&#39;s just how it is. It&#39;s easy for settle for a local optima like Go when taking into consideration family, pets, salary, time, effort etc.I do think on a long enough timescale, programmers will eventually move to a &#34;better&#34; language. But in my opinion, that time scale exceeds the lifespan of a human :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everything is not falling apart, though certain institutions may be falling apart.In America, there&#39;s definitely been a breakdown of belief in its own institutions.  Far more people are skeptical of things like journalism and Silicon Valley; it really wasn&#39;t that long ago that the former was constantly salivating over the latter, but now it&#39;s more of an openly vulture-carrion relationship because that caters to public sentiment.  People who I would consider &#34;normies&#34; even don&#39;t trust law enforcement and the FBI anymore (not that they ever should have).  Even the education system from K12 to college is increasingly being seen as a joke and an outright racket.  We also went from the President being a more respected position to one deserving of relentless tabloid gossip.  Even if one&#39;s &#34;guy&#34; is in office, I don&#39;t think we feel the same about it the way we did even as recent as Obama, and his administration was when we really began to see the social cracks forming.Civilization ebbs and flows, but I think the current sentiment is unprecedented in my lifetime.  This is not a high point by any stretch of the imagination, and while I see &#34;everything is collapsing&#34; to be hyperbolic, it seems inevitable that many things we thought were rock solid are in a transition period where either they will reform or one day be replaced with force of some kind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Things collapsing has been a predominant sentiment in every modern generation. It&#39;s unprecedented because of our collective amnesia, that regards the familiar as a stable starting point rather than a random moment in a volatile reality.Journalism was a tawdry, un-respectable business since its conception, but experienced a brief period of valor around the mid-twentieth century when industry concentration, Cold War ethics and regulation collectively reworked its incentives. The education system has always been in a position of scrutiny since universal education become the norm. Presidents have been the stuff of tabloid gossip since the founding fathers with the media mercilessly opting to promote scandal and controversy over respectability. Our conception of President as moral arbiter is a function of the reworking of journalism mentioned above.The difference in peoples attitudes reflects an increased diet of emotion inducing media that accelerates fears and expectations, rather than some great pivot in volatility. Yes there are things to worry about but there always are (let&#39;s remember the twentieth century had two world wars, the Great Depression, and an even worse pandemic)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d argue that the greater risk of things falling apart is economic rather than political. We&#39;ve built our society on two near-ponzi schemes that are in danger of falling apart. The first is pension funds which are paid into by current workers to pay out for past workers. Pension funds inherently depend on population growth to avoid shortfalls. They rely on the fact that more people pay into them then take out from them at any one time.  This literally meets the definition of a ponzi scheme and it will be heartbreaking when it comes due.The other near-ponzi scheme is the real estate market.  In my city of Toronto, average real estate prices have gone from 2x average income in 1972 to 16x average income today. To continue growing at this pace they&#39;d have to reach 128x average income by 2072. Those prices are absurd enough that it&#39;s clear there will be a slowdown in real estate prices before then. But much of our society is built on real estate growth and we aggressively encourage people to own real estate assets worth more than the entirety of their net worth. When these assets stop going up, or even worse start going down there will be major complications for society.  I&#39;m not talking about the adverse effects of a temporary market correction, I&#39;m talking about a new normal in which real estate is flat or downward trending.  When real estate is no longer an incredible investment opportunity it will have significant adverse effects on society.  For instance, homes are currently a large part of people&#39;s retirement plans and selling a home is often used to pay for an extended stay in a nursing home (which is quite expensive).  For many people the home represents over 60% of a retirement plan. In my parents lifetime, their home value increased to roughly 10x what it was worth. If my home increases 4x instead this is a substantial adverse impact. If my child&#39;s home increases 0x this is disastrous.The things we fundamentally depend on to provide things as important in society as retirement are breaking badly.  Meanwhile we&#39;re so obsessed with political differences that we barely talk about or work towards solving the slow economic crisis we are facing."</p>

There is indeed a need then for Amazon to prevent user tracking in skills (like for example Apple does and requires consent by the user).
But to come to the conclusion that Amazon shares the data with advertisers I would have expected an experiment with eliminating skills as a reason and just having personas interact with Alexa core services. I guess just from shopping questions or general knowledge questions a lot of information for ad targeting could be inferred. If that’s however not influencing ads served when no skills are used, then it’s not necessarily Amazon directly sharing the information, but the skills being able to do so using Amazons provided tooling.That’s a difference at least for my interpretation how “evil” company xyz is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why would facebook block an open source initiative, considering that they&#39;ve contributed a ton of open source software (react, graphql, pytorch, etc)? The more simple explanation is that an automated detector misclassified the link because it shares patterns with spam links."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook is fighting against the &#34;huge target on its back&#34; effect. The bigger of an audience you are, the more interest there is in posting abusive content, whether it&#39;s spam, trolling, or something else.The result is usually that you end up digging a bigger and bigger moat around your submission and curation process, so that your service is not completely flooded with crap.I think this is what you are seeing here, rather than censorship of this specific link or cause.I once posted a URL to a forum site I was developing for a community to Facebook, and somehow it set off the spam detector. For the next several months, I would get regular notices that a comment I left on another group&#39;s discussion was marked as spam, and was not visible to anyone else. I was posting regular comments, without links, apolitical, not critical of anyone, just adding to the discussion.The notices have since stopped, but I still rarely get any response to my comments, and anything I post to my profile&#39;s feed usually gets &#34;ignored&#34; completely, while in the past I&#39;d get a pretty stable number of likes from friends (in the low double digits or high single digits.)As someone who has moderated a decent size sub-reddit in the past, I understand that there&#39;s no malicious intent on Facebook&#39;s part in this. They are just so much bigger than this one individual that they simply cannot see me, the same way I cannot see a bacteria, and may not notice a tiny gnat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the contrary, it&#39;s not even slightly difficult to believe that this is not deliberate because it happens all the time.Not everything has to be a mad conspiracy. It&#39;s roughly one billion times easier to believe that a bad automated flagging system has triggered and marked this particular link as spam, than it is to believe that someone at Facebook is twirling their moustache, stroking their long-haired white cat, and hatching a plot to thwart the dastardly freedom-fighters of the open-source movement.Facebook&#39;s automated moderation systems are famously shit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is super cool.In case you don&#39;t make it through to the project&#39;s webpage howisfelix.today, and read through to the end, here is the creator&#39;s conclusion:Overall, having spent a significant amount of time building this project, scaling it up to the size it’s at now, as well as analysing the data, the main conclusion is that it is not worth building your own solution, and investing this much time. When I first started building this project 3 years ago, I expected to learn way more surprising and interesting facts. There were some, and it’s super interesting to look through those graphs, however retrospectively, it did not justify the hundreds of hours I invested in this project.I’ll likely continue tracking my mood, as well as a few other key metrics, however will significantly reduce the amount of time I invest in it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat, and interesting that his conclusion is that it&#39;s too much effort to do for oneself.My take on this is Timelinize[0], which is capable of downloading all your data from various digital records like social media, your phone, arbitrary files and unstructured folders, your Google account, etc. So it can aggregate data from Google Photos, Location History, Twitter, Facebook, text messages, and more, onto your computer, organized into a single timeline.(It is the successor to Timeliner[1].)I suppose Timelinize can support personal body metrics from various devices, and it is planned to support manual entries as well like journals. Analyses like his would also be possible.Data can be automatically imported on a regular basis via APIs (like, backing up your new tweets every day). The arbitrary file importer can also be scheduled to watch a directory for changes: just write a file or folder to that directory, and Timelinize will automatically import it (and optionally delete it when finished).Timelines are stored locally on your own computer, as plain files on disk, with a sqlite database as an index, so it should be a breeze to back up and use/read without proprietary software.The idea is to:- Back up your precious data that is otherwise held more-or-less hostage on somebody else&#39;s computers- While creating a detailed, personal journal for your family history- In a way that can show you your life in context with others&#39; timelines and the wider world.[0]: https://twitter.com/timelinize (No actual website yet.)[1]: https://github.com/mholt/timeliner"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project is super cool. I would recommend the author starts tracking the amount of CO2 he emits in a year, which could easily be approximated with the flight/transportation and food data he has. Carbon emissions per Capita per year in the US: 18 metric tonnes. In Italy: 8 metric tonnes [1]. Author is probably close to 60-80 with all the transatlantic flights.[1] https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Refreshingly honest about the video quality you should expect in the main promo video. Typical problems like dynamic range, color profile, light bleed and tracking problems with the top of the head being cut off at one point. Pretty typical unless you spend more money on your drone or camera equipment. There are so many companies that fake the footage or pick much easier shooting locations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is such a fun/playful idea, kudos to Snap!Their first hardware product pretty much bombed but this is oddly one of the first consumer tech toys in a while that I&#39;ve felt I wanted. I can definitely see this being a fun thing to bring out in the backyard or to cookouts/parties, especially as a dad with young kids too.A couple things I&#39;d be a bit worried about:* Battery life would need to last long enough to use this on and off for a few hours. If it&#39;s like 15 mins then no way.* Would there be an audible hum in the video it records from the 4x propellers?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People saying that this can’t compete with DJI are missing the point.This product knows its target market (hint, not the people who browse HN) and, based on my initial first impressions, I think it’s nailed it.Forgive me for a slightly contrived analogy, but if a 
DJI Mavic is a DSLR, and a DJI Mini is a portable point-and-shoot camera, then Pixy is a Polaroid. It’s certainly not got the highest picture quality, doesn’t have good altitude or range and the 30s flight time sounds laughable, but it’s a nice looking, approachable device that looks like it could be used by anyone to take videos they currently can’t with the devices they currently have (the mode dial is a brilliant idea.)I think this thing will sell very nicely. The big question for me is whether the Pixy wireless streaming to the phone allows exports out of the Snapchat app, if it does then all the biggest TikTok stars will buy one immediately and it will explode in popularity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great list, but:&gt; To keep young kids behaving on a car road trip, have a bag of their favorite candy and throw a piece out the window each time they misbehave.That&#39;s terrible advice. Treat children with respect! They are very smart, they just lack experience. If they &#34;misbehave&#34;, talk to them and explain why this is not good. If you can&#39;t find an explanation, chances are you are wrong and you should reevaluate your position.But never, never, never willfully hurt them by throwing away their favorite candy. So wrong on so many levels.This was a big surprise for me in this list as I mostly agree with the items before it. Or, to use a previous item:&gt; You’ll get 10x better results by elevating good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior, especially in children and animals.Well said."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  When checking references for a job applicant, employers may be reluctant or prohibited from saying anything negative, so leave or send a message that says, “Get back to me if you highly recommend this applicant as super great.” If they don’t reply take that as a negative.Big disagree here, that&#39;s not fair at all to the applicant. Some people are just terrible referees and it&#39;s hard to know that as the applicant until someone lets you down. Some people mean to reply but forget, some people are too busy to answer and don&#39;t get back to you, some people just don&#39;t want to even though they think you&#39;d be an excellent candidate. On top of that, with people moving around so much it can be hard to nail down recent contact details.If somewhere I&#39;m applying to work can&#39;t get a hold of someone, I&#39;d very much expect them to reach back out to me in order to resolve the issue, if they can&#39;t do me that courtesy then I guess I&#39;ll be working somewhere else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll be honest here, I found this list mostly banal and also not really actionable. I think anyone could generate a similar list with a few Google searches and many of these tips I have seen written by other others and this guy has just re-phrased them. Basically generic self-help.I think a better option is to choose one particular thing you want to improve in yourself and have a focused plan to work on it. However this takes work and effort that most will never do. Reading a big list of 50 sentences will make zero difference to your life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My Anecdotal Experience:Golang is great for spinning up new services and tools with very little overhead, the language is well designed for the backend - and the lack of &lt;insert programming language feature here&gt; avoids &#34;odd&#34; decisions which other engineers will dislike in the future.  If your job is building lots of new things using relatively common building blocks, then Golang looks fantastic!However on mature services, engineers often need &lt;insert programming language here&gt; because they are dealing with something extremely complex.   The author of this blog post digs into the scenario for a package which needs to support different non-nix operating systems, but the same can be true of an app which has to manage many different kinds of objects (Kubernetes, or any service with many DAOs). Alternately there are engineers building all kinds of weird software which may do new things in novel simplified ways.  Golang occasionally makes expressing these types of applications more difficult.Overall I enjoyed my time writing go, until I tried to write a statistics based application for a startup idea back in 2016.  The project didn&#39;t get very far, and that was partly due to me getting bored having to deal with all of the different numeric data types, at the time the lack of generics made it so that you either had to use reflection - or implement the same function N times over to support the different numeric data types.  This tedium killed my love of the language (I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a better experience in 2022)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Golang is great because it was the first to include excellent tooling in addition to the language (strict compiler, linting, non-customizable  gofmt, package manager, good html docs, online playground, etc.)It’s undeniable that it brought a lot of good ideas that languages like Rust borrowed.Golang is still undefeated in terms of battery included. Its standard library is top notch and full featured.On the other hand it is more high-level, has a GC, and has made a number of mistakes (no sum types). The biggest trade off it does though: it lacks expressiveness. The new generic will probably help, but the trade off of Golang is deep. It makes writing code harder so that reading is easier."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t understand entropy and this article did not change it. The issue I take is with the definition of &#34;the most likely state&#34;.Think of a series of random bits that can be either 0 or 1 with equal probability. How likely is it that they are all 0 or all 1? Not very likely. There is exactly one configuration. How likely is it that they have a specific configuration of 0 and 1? Equally likely. All states are equally likely. If you randomly flip bits you go from one state to another state but each one is equally likely to occur. There is no special meaning to a specific configuration if you don&#39;t give it one.If you look at the average of all bits you start grouping all states together with the equal number of 1s. If you talk about the average there is only one configuration that is all 1s but most configurations have roughly 50% 1s. If you now start flipping bits you will meander through all possible bit-states but the average will most likely be close to 50% 1s most of the time.In physics we usually look at averages such as the average velocity expressed as temperature. Therefore it makes sense to group together all states using the average and then the states with very low or very high averages are few.But if you look deeper than that averaging it stops making sense to me. It&#39;s a completely different world. I don&#39;t know what Entropy is supposed to mean on the level of individual states/configurations. I don&#39;t understand what kind of macroscopic &#34;averaging&#34; function we may use to group up those states. There could be more than one possibility - from that would follow that there is more than one definition of macro-Entropy. Ideally there should be one general definition of how we have to look at those microstates and from that follows our general definition of Entropy. Sadly I didn&#39;t study Physics and this topic still continues to confuse me. The usual explanations fail to enlighten me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One aspect of entropy that I always find counterintuitive is that unlike mass, charge, etc. it is not a physical quantity. In fact, from the point of view of an experimenter with perfect information about a physical system, the entropy of the system is exactly conserved over time (as made precise by Liouville&#39;s Theorem). The Second Law survives in this setting only in the most trivial sense that a constant function does not decrease.It&#39;s only when you start making crude measurements---lumping positions into pixels, clouds of particles each with their own kinetic energy into a single scalar called &#34;temperature,&#34; etc---that you start to see a nontrivial entropy and Second Law. Different ways of lumping microstates into macrostates will give you different (and inconsistent) notions of entropy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of a great article that I saw on Hacker news that really helped explain the concept of Entrophy to me.  Linked here:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24140808"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem is that spam was/is so bad that extreme measures were taken to curb it. There are all kinds of invisible forces that you abutt that can be difficult to figure out, such as IP blacklists and the like. And even if you set everything up properly and host your email with a responsible host, Microsoft will still mark your mail as spam.I host my own email server with Vultr on an OpenBSD VM using OpenSMTPD and Dovecot, relaying all outbound mail through SMTP2Go (their free tier more than meets my needs). I have all of the necessary DNS entries set to mark my mail as legit, and I sign all outgoing mail using strong 2048-bit RSA keys. Thus far, I&#39;m able to send mail and not have it marked as spam (at least to everyone that I&#39;ve corresponded with thus far). It was a lot of work to get to that point, but not terrible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been self-hosting email for about 20 years, from a dedicated server in Europe. The server hardware has been replaced a couple of times but kept its IP.If you set everything up right, and choose the host for your mail server carefully, and never change IP, after a fairly short time you won&#39;t have much problem with being marked as spam. No more so than with any other email host.As is so often the case, the people that say you should never do it probably have little relevant experience, they are just repeating something they heard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot to say here from both sides - people running their own mail infrastructure (like I have for almost 25 years) and big mail providers dealing with brutal, unrelenting spam.But there is one piece of this that&#39;s ridiculous, broken and almost cruel:  silently dropping messages marked as &#34;spam&#34; with no notification given back to the sender.Why does this practice exist ?  Who believes that this is decent or acceptable behavior ?If gmail doesn&#39;t want my inbound message - for any reason - that is just fine.If they drop it on the floor without telling me that is totally shitty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"E Ink (the company) keeps improving their electrophoresis display technology. Unfortunately the technology necessarily has very low refresh rates since it it is based on moving around solid particles submerged in a liquid.There were other passive e-paper display technologies like the one by Liquavista (based on moving colored oil droplets) or Mirasol by Qualcomm (mechanical micro-shutters create colored light via interference).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing that always bothers me about these articles, and I completely accept it may just me reading into it what I want to see, is I immediately assume the dollar figure is annual. $160k/yr sounds like great passive income. You could certainly stop working a 9-5 and build out a really great lifestyle business.But then I look at the article. Oh, it&#39;s over six years? Okay, $26k/yr is a lot less and all of a sudden it&#39;s a big risk to try and turn that into a real business. Wait, what&#39;s that in the screenshot? 78 books? $341 per book, per year. And my thought goes from &#34;that sounds like a great little business!&#34; to &#34;fuck that&#34; within about fifteen seconds.And such is the lifecycle of these &#34;how I made $n doing x&#34; articles. Great claims that when you dig into them, the resulting wisdom is basically &#34;do a lot of work, and have a little bit of luck. And don&#39;t forget the marketing!&#34;I don&#39;t mean to tear down what the author did by any stretch, it&#39;s impressive regardless of the time frame. But if you&#39;re already making $150-200k/yr from a tech job, do you really want to bust your ass for another couple grand?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Writing (from a quick skim check) at least 16 books over a period of 6 years, and earning money from that, is not exactly what I&#39;d call &#34;passive income&#34;. And given the topics are mostly (all?) about niches in current technologies they also won&#39;t continue to deliver passively forever.A more appropriate title and angle might be &#34;How I&#39;ve earned $10k/book and manage to keep writing more while maintaining a day job&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve spent a fair amount of time talking with nurses about the problems. I&#39;m related to a bunch of people who are nurses across disciplines (ER, ICU, med/surg, etc). It&#39;s been enlightening hearing them talk about the problems...1. Many new nurses make the same or more and long time nurses. It&#39;s frustrating when the nurse in charge with the most experience is making less than new nurses. Some hospitals are even trying to stop nurses from talking about pay.2. Patients in COVID have become downright mean. Add this to the problems nurses have management and doctors (who are often rude and arrogant) and it&#39;s a poor culture. The quality of the environment, from a mental health standpoint, is on the decline.3. IT systems that they have to use were designed by people who have not talked with the workers who use them. They may have been designed with laws and compliance in mind. Nurses aren&#39;t the people who choose or pay for these systems. But, they use them a lot (maybe the most) and it&#39;s obvious they weren&#39;t taken into account when designing the UX. It&#39;s maddening for them.This one is big for product designers. Often we listen to the people who pay for it and miss out on the people who actually have to use it.4. Nurses are the catch all for jobs. Not enough aides? Nurses do the work. Food service workers don&#39;t want to take food into a patients room... nurses will do it. Not only do they have higher ratios of patients but they fill in the work when other areas have shortages, too. So, the work per patient goes up. Pay doesn&#39;t go up, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this a shock?- Demanding work: 12 hour shifts, irregular schedules, night shifts, physically exhausting, limited breaks (including bathroom/water!)- High responsibility with unsafe conditions. You&#39;re literally responsible for people&#39;s lives. Poor staffing ratios stretch you thin and make you more likely to make mistakes. And if you make a mistake, you&#39;re at huge risk for litigation... and now criminal consequences too. Responsibilities, resources, and staffing stretched even thinner due to the pandemic.- Administration that treats you as something to be optimized and does the absolute bare minimum to support you. Instead they tack on additional tasks, expectations, and requirements (&#34;no water at a nurse&#39;s station!&#34;). They encourage a culture where nurses provide a concierge service to &#39;guests&#39; instead of critical care to patients.- Hostile/entitled patients. I&#39;d guess many/most patients are not an issue, but it only takes a couple of difficult/combative patients to really ruin your conditions.- Low pay given the responsibility and working conditions for non-travel nurses. https://nurseslabs.com/nurse-salary/#nurse_salaries_by_state Like many others pointed out here, in tech I make way more than a nurse for a job that&#39;s less demanding, has far lower stakes, and is of far less value to society.To me the blame lies mainly in middle/upper management, whose role is to build and empower an effective workforce. If 90% of your workers are considering leaving, you blew it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a close relation that works for one of the oldest pediatric hospitals in the country. It was recently revealed that they will be shuttering almost all pediatric services in the next year because they can 10x their profits by only serving elderly clients. The entire purpose of this organization was to provide pediatric healthcare, and it wasn’t losing money…Sometimes, it feels like we’re min-maxing ourselves to death over here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very favorable comments all around from the very online crowd who comments here.  I’m much more skeptical.I have no doubt this will work well for some students, but as someone who taught online for the better part of two years I can say with certainty that the experience is very different and (for the wide majority of students) worse than being in person.My colleagues and I can attest to both general learning loss (ie., forgetting specific subject matter information) and a loss of broader “studying skills” (ie., coming to class and doing homework) after the pandemic.In intro classes in our department, mean grades have been a whole standard deviation lower than the long run pre-pandemic average.  That’s a huge effect!This is also not just specific to our department or university but has been written about widely in the higher ed press.People have been confidently predicting that online education “is the future” since the 1990’s.  IMO the lesson of the pandemic is “no it’s not and it’s never going to be.”If online works for you, awesome.  Enjoy!   There are great resources out there.   But I don’t think you are in the majority."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Online learning resources are amazing. Compared to pre-internet, the depth, quality and accessibility is amazing. It really does open an opportunity route for a lot of people.However...Institutional learning, whether it&#39;s K-12, colleges, techs or whatnot have barely changed. The same fundamental dynamics exist, whether it&#39;s tertiary sorting and prestige or primary teaching methods. Education still serves and fails the same groups of people as it did before, in much the same way.Education is an enormous &#34;industry.&#34; It&#39;s in the same realm as defense, energy or transport. Possibly even more important.I really hope to see online resources develop in such a way that schools can be built around them. A formula that a middle school principal anywhere, no matter how rural and remote, can implement. Why can&#39;t we have the best of both worlds?The classroom model didn&#39;t work well for me as a student. I don&#39;t think remote-only would have worked either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am looking forward to the day, when quality formal education is available online to all which you may complete at your own pace instead of going with a strict semester and class system. Also, along with offline schools for supporting social learning and helping classes which require offline components like labs, in person support classes, interest based study groups etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Over the course of a few years I spent a lot of time in a secure environment in a DoD facility to which I had to travel multiple times for a project. The environment, a maze of cubicles filled with computers, had been installed inside a historic building. For historic preservation reasons, the exterior windows were kept as built. For security reasons, there was a sheet of plywood painted white inside all of the windows. The building allowed no natural light to enter and emitted only a diffuse glow. It was a miserable place to spend long days, illuminated only by flickering fluorescent light.We had some serious storms come through while I was there. A lot of the permanent residents went home. As I was a visitor and there just for as long as it took me to fix some problems, I was encouraged to stay and work late. I was assured that we would not lose power because the building had been recently equipped with a generator.A storm came through and the building lost power. It was almost entirely pitch black in the building full of computers, which all went dark, fans and disks suddenly silent. A small fraction of the emergency lights came on. Most were in disrepair and never lit up. It turns out that in a secure environment, one has to make special arrangements to have someone inspect the emergency lighting. We heard the generator spin up. Still no computers, no lights.In the darkness, one little nook came to life. This nook contained the coffee pot, microwave, and refrigerator. Apparently this organization considered only one piece of equipment important enough to be connected to the generator. We thereafter referred to it as the mission critical coffee pot."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I heard a legend once that someone at IBM in the &#34;blue suit and tie&#34; days found himself to be irreplaceable. So at his next contract negotiations, he politely demanded the dress code be removed from his contract.And then he never shaved again, or wore anything more formal than a Hawaiian shirt. Much to the anger of his entire management chain.I read this. I loved it. I remember it. But I cannot for the life of me find any references to it online and worry that I dreamed it all.I would love if someone here has a reference to this and can share it with me. Or tell me I am truly crazy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On being acquired by IBM things went downhill at the company I was working at - no kettles or coffee machines allowed and you had to buy your tea and coffee from the company store/machines (UK - probably run by Serco or some similar awfulness). All the cool computers taken off the desks and stuck in server rooms and you had to use a managed windows PC which in my case managed to crash once or more times a day thanks to some aspect of the Rational Clearcase filesystem driver.I remember all the lectures from overconfident bullshitters with shiny shoes. A company run by salesmen. It is SO SO nice that IBM got eclipsed by the internet tech companies. Even if they are arrogant/difficult in their own way it was a victory for the technically and ethically competent.It seemed then that IBM was where software went to die."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem is not so much that selinux is too complicated (it is as complicated as it needs to be), but that we all run software we don&#39;t understand.The whole IT ecosystem has become a hail mary. Even admins usually have no idea what a certain program actually wants to do. If the admin knows how to install the app so that it actually runs, you call them a good admin.From a security point of view, an application is like a nuclear power plant. It&#39;s good if it works as planned, but if something blows up it endangers your whole enterprise.The whole container movement can be seen as putting the apps in a sarcophagus like Chernobyl. That way the radiation hopefully stays in, but history has shown that it really doesn&#39;t. Also, the wheel of history has just turned one more iteration and now admins just view the sarcophagus as something you deploy as you previously deployed the app. Who is responsible that it is air tight? Well, uh, nobody, really.You can&#39;t even blame the applications for that. Let&#39;s say you want to build a good, secure application. How do you know what files your application will try to open? What syscalls it wants to call? Library and framework functions tend to not document that properly.Obscure files like /etc/localtime, /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/ld.so.conf, /dev/zero ... how can you expect devs to build well documented and well sandboxable applications if they don&#39;t know which files their library functions will open?You may have heard of /etc/resolv.conf ... but have you heard of /etc/gai.conf? /etc/nsswitch.conf? /etc/host.conf? Wouldn&#39;t it be great if the man page of getaddrinfo mentioned those (mine only mentions gai.conf)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an experienced RHEL admin, a few years ago I probably would have said this is very bad advice in any professional context, and you should spend the time to learn it because it will save you one day.Now, I think my advice would be: Put everything in a container, and learn how to run Docker or Podman (or k8s) in a secure way (ie no root containers, be very careful with volume mounts, etc). Yes, they aren’t as mature as SELinux, but containers aim to provide many of the same benefits that SELinux does (and even more) except in a way that’s much easier to manage. Even better is that these container runtimes often come with SELinux and AppArmor policies out of the box on good Linux distros."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always preferred apparmor. SELinux has always seemed radically more complex for very little benefit, unless you have a tightly constrained OS (like Android, where the VM does most of the work and every app has the same sort of security policy) or a team of admins working full time to maintain it (again, like Android).Apparmor is weak in all the same ways SELinux is weak, at least in terms of the ways that actually matter - that is to say, a kernel exploit is the simplest way out of either. But anyone can write an apparmor profile for any program in an hour, and if you actually know wtf you&#39;re doing you can build very strong profiles and trivially test and maintain them.SELinux is &#34;good&#34; in that if you are building a system like Android, great, consumers get very tight policies for free, and SELinux is ultimately more expressive. But I think 99% of companies looking at an LSM MAC should probably roll apparmor."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve often wondered if we need to radically change the State&#39;s relationship with the software it produces. As Robert Lessig famously observed, &#34;code is law&#34; in a world controlled by computers. There is increasingly a strong argument I feel in States directly employing software engineers much like they typically employ armies of civil servants to implement policy.Why is software treated as something to be outsourced to a private sector company? Why can&#39;t we have &#34;civil programmers&#34; who contribute to an ever growing body of public code just as the legislative process contributes to an ever growing body of laws. This body of civil programmers (terrible name but hey) could also work hand in hand with the open source community, letting stakeholders (citizens) contribute too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, former WGU student here, though I hadn&#39;t completed my degree.Many WGU students HATE these types of articles, because they undermine the legitimacy of WGU.WGU was not designed for traditional students, it was 100% designed for working professionals, where WGU will only admit you with a reasonable amount of experience in your field.WGU is regionally accredited, not nationally, and it&#39;s a non-profit. So it cannot be compared to University of Phoenix, ITT Tech, DeVry, etc.It was founded by a group of governors out west, hence the name. They realized that there were many working adults who possessed a great depth of knowledge, from long working in their fields, yet they had no paper credentials to show for that knowledge.Their model is competency-based, so you must demonstrate you posses knowledge in any given domain. If you can prove you do then you can test out right away, if you fail to then they offer a variety of resources to allow you to get up to par. In many cases classes are tied to obtaining industry certifications.It&#39;s not for everyone, but it is a far cry from a &#34;degree mill.&#34; Does it really matter if a person that has knowledge got it from sitting in a seat, paying ungodly amounts of tuition, or if they got it from life experience? As long as a bar is set, and you can meet it, then that should be what really matters.Just my personal experience, from having attended the university. Unfortunately life sidetracked my completion, but I hope to return one day soon, and complete my program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On my first day, I completed 4 courses in the span of 4 hours. At a traditional school, it would have taken 4 months. It made me realize…I had underestimated how much knowledge I had gained from previous schools, jobs, projects, books, papers, and talks. This passage underscores how, for this guy and whoever he was selling himself to, a CS degree was just a credential. He did not have much intention of actually learning anything. That’s (I believe) fundamentally different than most people who seek college degrees."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“ Medicine has become a three-way negotiation between you, your doctor, and The Algorithm.”This characterization makes it sound like a good thing.  In reality, the doctor’s responsibility is being pushed to the patient because they are overbooked in the name of economic efficiency.As a patient with complex, non-specific medical condition, I can tell you how miserable this is.I can’t count on doctors _at all_ to move the process forward.  It’s always me, reading articles on PubMed and coming up with ideas.I’m not medically trained nor am I scientist.  It’s a lot of legwork for me normally, but the ways that being sick limits me make it much harder.Further, the emotional and intellectual overhead required to negotiate with medical professionals is high.Back when I could afford to, I saw a neurologist at an office that didn’t accept insurance.  She choose to see fewer patients and give them more time, as well as spend time doing research to look for new clues and ideas.This worked really well and I made progress with her.The rest of the American medical system?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why are dentists so scammy?In Norway I&#39;ve seen documentaries about them sending the same people to multiple dentists, and some of them receive wildly different advice. Some of that can be ascribed to some being in the school of pro-active, so they want to fix your teeth at the first glance of issues. But in the end, most of the things being quoted were unnecessary. They all seemed very intent on removing wisdom teeth, even when they pose no problems.They re-did the experiment recently, and I think one of the guys they sent got his teeth cleaned and tartar removed from 10 dentists in a week or so. No one stopped to see if it was actually needed, they all just do it by default and charge you for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It would be interesting to see the gain curve of this speaker.My (limited) experience with piezoelectric speakers is that they resonate at a single frequency very loudly, and are practically silent outside the resonant peak. Perfect for a microwave beeper, but never going to produce audible speech.The &#34;high-quality&#34; descriptor makes it sound like they have produced a reasonably flat gain curve, which seems really significant! But without any explanation I&#39;m skeptical.It may even be as silly as using an unintuitive technical definition of &#34;quality&#34; - in a second order linear system, the &#34;quality&#34; of the gain curve is the ratio of the amplitude at the peak to the input amplitude... The exact opposite of what a reasonable person would consider high-quality sound."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To overcome this problem, the MIT team rethought the design of a thin-film loudspeaker. Rather than having the entire material vibrate, their design relies on tiny domes on a thin layer of piezoelectric material which each vibrate individually. These domes, each only a few hair-widths across, are surrounded by spacer layers on the top and bottom of the film that protect them from the mounting surface while still enabling them to vibrate freely.Whoa, does this mean an array of individually addressable micro-speakers becomes feasible? Like pixels in a computer screen, send different signals to each tiny speaker? That would mean craaaazy spatial audio, if I&#39;m not mistaken."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; When 25 volts of electricity were passed through the device at 1 kilohertz (a rate of 1,000 cycles per second), the speaker produced high-quality sound at conversational levels of 66 decibels. At 10 kilohertz, the sound pressure level increased to 86 decibelsRead: Tinny af.Nonetheless, VERY exciting technology. Will be interesting to watch as it matures."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"During a hostile takeover, someone buys 51% of the shares. They then elect a board of people who will approve whatever they want.Then they can do things like &#39;merge&#39; the company with some other company they own at a board-approved value-per-share. That value will be much lower than what they paid per share when buying it on the open market, but not so low that the government gets involved. Eg: Musk buys the shares at $50/share, and then &#39;merges&#39; the company at $25/share, effectively forcing 49% of the shares to be sold at half price. Those shareholders get screwed because they didn&#39;t sell their shares during the initial takeover.Edit: Or, just run the company however they want and share the profits with the other 49%, but ignore their votes, etc.The Poison Pill says &#34;If a hostile takeover starts, we&#39;ll create and sell new shares at a reduced price to existing shareholders- other than the attacker- to prevent the 51% scenario&#34;. This is done not to prevent any takeover, but in the interest of the 49% of holdouts who would have been screwed over. It&#39;s an effective block against the takeover.The board represents ALL the shareholders, after all. They don&#39;t want to see anyone get screwed.But now Musk has made a deal that the board has approved. All shareholders get a specific price that is approved. The board wants this to happen, so there&#39;s no poison pill."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nobody knows yet why the board relented, but the scuttlebutt seems to be that Twitter arranged an internal valuation once Musk put a price on the company, presumably as justification for an internal plan that they&#39;d announce as their alternative to acquisition, and the valuation actually showed Musk was overpaying for the income Twitter was likely to generate.(If the board hadn&#39;t relented, Musk&#39;s next step would have been to arrange for a tender offer, which goes directly to the shareholders, but does not involved Musk acquiring new shares, but rather just a commitment to buy those shares if the board drops the poison pill. Successfully getting that commitment would be a very strong signal to the board, which would likely then drop the shareholder rights plan and allow the acquisition to proceed. But Twitter&#39;s board skipped those steps.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The poison pill was intended to prevent a takeover without the board’s approval (buying 51% on the open market)The board is negotiating an approved takeover which is entirely differentI.e. the board was saying “you can only buy Twitter if we say so”There was no reversal of intentions"</p>
