When unpartitioning is taking effect, we will stop using double-keying and revert the ordinary (first-party) key.What are these &#34;certain cases?&#34;Edit 2: Reading on, there&#39;s this bit about storage access grants heuristics [2] linked from the blog. But is that really it, or is there a hardcoded whitelist as well? If so, it&#39;d be great to see it.This bit in particular is ambiguous in how it&#39;s supposed to work exactly (who&#39;s &#34;we&#34; here):&gt; If we discover that an origin is abusing this heuristic to gain tracking access, that origin will have the additional requirement that it must have received user interaction as a first party within the past 30 days.1. https://hacks.mozilla.org/2021/02/introducing-state-partitio...2. https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Firefox/Pri..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot of comments in here about how it&#39;s bad that cookies haven&#39;t always worked this way, but a significant amount of web content to this day still requires third-party cookies to work. And I&#39;m not talking about cookies that are designed for analytics purposes; the discussions here where concern is raised revolve around simple things like logins breaking.For greenhorn web developers, you could say the same thing about TLS certificates. Why weren&#39;t they always free?Well, another reason is because TLS (and formerly SSL) wasn&#39;t (weren&#39;t) just about encryption, but about a &#34;web of trust.&#34; Encryption alone isn&#39;t trust.Many things about web technologies have changed over time; and it&#39;s easy to say that any individual piece of functionality should have worked this or that way all along, but the original intent of many web features and how those features are used today can be very different.One day industry standards may dictate that we don&#39;t even process HTTPS requests in a way where the client&#39;s IP address is fully exposed to the server. Someone along the way might decide that a trusted agent should serve pages back on behalf of a client, for all clients.After all, why should a third-party pixel.png request expose me browsing another website?! How absurd. Don&#39;t you think? And yet, we do it every day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been following Tether for quite a long time. I have no absolute proof it is a scam but the writing is on the wall. Here are some facts.- The current Market Cap of USDT is 34 Billion Dollars. It was 4B this time last year. Since the value is pegged this means there has been an influx of cash of 30 B into this shady company in the last year alone. Who invested this money? We have no idea since Tether doesn&#39;t disclose, but we&#39;re supposed to believe all this money entered USDT even with the red flags we see.- There&#39;s a correlation between Tether printing new USDT and the Bitcoin Price.- There&#39;s no way to transfer USDT into USD. The few exchanges that say they offer withdraws actually don&#39;t if you go and try.- Daily volume of transaction is in the 100 B mark. Twice that of Bitcoin and 3 times Tether daily volume this time last year.- BitFinex is included in the NY decision because it&#39;s proven now that Bitfinex and Tether are operated by the same people. Note that a few years ago this was not only undisclosed but actively denied by Tether.- Tether initially told its investors it was 100% backed by dollar reserves and that it would be subjected to constant audits. The audits never happened, and they eventually conceded only ~70% was backed by &#34;short term cash reserves&#34;.My conclusion is that the folks at BitFinex came up with a new currency, printed billions of it and used it to wash trade against itself and other crypto, creating an artificial demand that drove the prices up. It&#39;s textbook Ponzi scheme and will inevitably come crashing down, killing Tether, BitFinex and a chunk of the Crypto Market.Crypto folks will counter argue that people has been saying this for years but Tether is still chugging along and crypto is healthier than ever.Personally I won&#39;t touch any crypto with a 10 foot pole until this thing blows over. If that means missing out on a lot of possible gains so be it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m waiting patiently for the whole Tether printing scheme to fall and crush to finally purchase Bitcoin / Ether.
However I&#39;m not viewing them as inflation hedges so long as Bitfinex / etc. are allowed to continue with their obvious money printing scheme.When most crypto trading volume is traded at trustworthy exchanges which actually hold dollars as much as they say they do, I&#39;ll trust $/BTC to be a fair market.It&#39;s dumb escaping from Powell&#39;s printing machine straight into Bitfinex tether printing machine. BTC isn&#39;t the hedge people think it is so long as it&#39;s traded against fictional dollars. Tether&#39;s volume exceeds Bitcoin, so that&#39;s the scale of fictional dollars supporting Bitcoin right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It appears from the link in the settlement agreement:https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlemen...Tether wasn’t backed at all times. The argument was that this happened due to asset seizures in Poland and Portugal in 2017-2018.https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/95207/bitfinex-tether-ne...Seems to me they couldn’t prove malicious intent, so they suggested they stop trading. Frankly this seems a bit of a click-bait title with the whole “illegal activities”.Sure, tether wasn’t backed at all times (probably is now), due to governments seizing their funds. Also banks do this all the time, every time they issue a loan for instance. The bank only keeps 10-30% collateral on your home."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. At an individual/hobbyist level this is a fine thing to do, if one is already a cryptocurrency enthusiast.2. At a social/planning level it is important to remember that opportunity costs matter, and this should not be recommended as public policy. One kWh of electricity could either be used for mining bitcoin (creating at most one kWh of indoor heat), or it could be used for running a heat pump[*], yielding multiple kWh of indoor heat due to the magic of heat pumps and their &gt;100% &#34;efficiency&#34;[**].[*] Yes, I realize the OP is already using a heat pump, but assisting it with preheat is inherently less efficient than plowing the same energy into running the heat pump itself.[**] Yes, heat pumps aren&#39;t &gt;100% efficient per a physics textbook, but what most people care about is that you can use them to get &gt;1 joule of indoor heat from 1 joule of energy input, which feels magical when compared to electric heaters, gas furnaces etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did this in an apartment I lived in years ago, and do it now in my house.My computer room in the house is the lowest point in the house, so naturally, it tends to be a couple degrees cooler than the upstairs.  This means that if I set the thermostat so that the computer room is comfortable, the bedroom is too warm.  If I run the house circulation fan constantly, it&#39;s not an issue, but that consumes a decent amount of power.If I&#39;m going to consume that much power, I might as well mine crypto and make a few dollars.  Mining for NiceHash, a service that lets people rent hashing power from miners, I&#39;ll average $100-400/month worth of Bitcoin on my RTX 3080, depending on current hashing prices, and how much of my time I spend gaming, since mining is effectively paused while gaming.  The mining happens while I use my computer with no noticeable loss in performance, and it puts a few watts of energy into the room to heat it up a bit, evening it out with the rest of the house."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago when mining with a single gaming card was more common and viable, I lived in a rented room in a house owned by a live-in landlord who controlled the heating, and wouldn&#39;t turn it on for very long in the winter. Since electricity was included in my (fixed) rent, I was able to keep my room a few degrees higher than the rest of the house.However I must point out that you shouldn&#39;t do this in most circumstances, there are environmentally friendly ways of heating your house."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As someone who has had to do IVF for our child and go through the challenge of figuring our what to do to try and improve sperm quality, I can tell you once you start looking into it, basically everything about modern life is bad for sperm. Heat, radiation, plastic, micro plastics, soya, tap water, Teflon, antibacterial soap, underpants, western diet. It’s a perfect storm.If you’re going though it though I offer a ray of hope that it was possible to sufficiently avoid these things, at least temporarily, and it made a very large difference (4X better within 6 months) and resulted in a now 3 year old child."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be helpful if we knew eactly what these endocrine-disrupting chemicals were. As is usually the case with such reports, this article is short on specifics.Over the years there have many reports from cleaners to plasticizers, phthalates, and various other chemicals as endocrine disruptors but no one has put a sufficient measure on the problem so that we can move foreword - put regulations in place, etc.As the article points out, what is so problematic is that many of the chemicals that are under suspicion are ubiquitous and not easily avoided.I consider it important that we act quickly for not only public health reasons but also the fact that we&#39;re living in an increasingly chemical-phobic society and worrying the public without solid evidence isn&#39;t helpful to anybody.We need need more research on this urgently.Afterthought: it is essential that we have solid evidence ASAP as billions of dollars are tied up in the plastics industry. Plastics already cause environmental problems (and I constantly curse the fact that I have to get rid of so much waste plastic) but there&#39;s no point deliberately alienating the plastics industry without good cause."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Store food in glass containers, not plastic. Above all, don’t microwave foods in plastic or with plastic wrap on top. Avoid pesticides. Buy organic produce if possible. Avoid tobacco or marijuana. Use a cotton or linen shower curtain, not one made of vinyl. Don’t use air fresheners. Prevent dust buildup. Vet consumer products you use with an online guide like that of the Environmental Working Group.I really want to do this, but it seems impossibly hard. For example, almost all the food I buy is in plastic containers."</p>

I was almost 12. School was closed for 2-3 weeks because they couldn&#39;t promise there would be electricity to heat the building. The ice kept breaking power lines or crushing the transmission towers from the weight (ice is heavy!). Imagine your car, covered in a 1-2 inch thick layer of very solid ice, encased.People died. The military had to come in to help. My family was fortunate that we had a wood stove in the basement that kept the house warm and cooked some meals on. We lost power a few hours at least every day.Crazy time.Edit: For those interested in this, the Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1998_North_American_ic...) has some great photos and description. 1,000 transmission towers/pylons destroyed, 35,000 utility poles. Whole forests devastated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Once at its destination and hooked in, its V12 had to be run at a specific, constant rpm&#39; to generate AC current at 60 hertz, the frequency used by most North American utilities.I don&#39;t think this is exactly right. I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t consistent either, but few loads really cared too much.From the article&#39;s link, about a different locomotive doing the same thing:&gt; Conrail actually had a set of standing instructions on how to provide quasi-commercial power from a locomotive.  For an SD40-2, you attach to the bus before the diodes.  Operating in notch 6 runs the generator at 647 RPM.  Since the AR10 is a 10 pole machine, that gives 64.7 Hz power.  You could tweak the governor to get it closer to 60 Hz if you really wanted to, but for powering everything but clocks, it&#39;s close enough.  I think the method for regulating the voltage was to disconnect the load regulator from it&#39;s governor-powered vane motor and dialing the voltage in manually.  The output is 3 phase power.  Max output in notch 6 is about 1000KW.  If the avg home draws 2-3 KW on the avg, that&#39;d power several hundred homes.http://cs.trains.com/trn/f/111/t/194245.aspx"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The last paragraph on Amtrak has nothing to do with CN or the rest of the article.

It&#39;s a publicly-traded freight rail company that doesn&#39;t currently operate passenger service.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m also a solo developer and use git in a much less sophisticated fashion. I tend to use it as, &#34;freeze my code here, so in case I f something up, I can get back to a moderately clean state.&#34; It&#39;s kind like a snapshot-based local history.  And, quite frankly, I rarely revert one, but it makes me feel safer. I don&#39;t care if I have a lot of commit messages that say, &#34;interim&#34;. The good ones are clear.Is this a terrible coding practice? I don&#39;t have enough non-me experience to know what an anti-pattern this probably is. I probably won&#39;t change my process, but I&#39;m curious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m happy for this person if this works well for them. For me, no thanks. One of the reasons I feel much more productive as on my solo project than at work is that I don&#39;t have this kind of overhead. I don&#39;t need to write tests for everything (I write them just where they add value). I don&#39;t need to follow some strict branching standard. I can commit in chunks that make sense to me, and adjust as needed for the situation.From my perspective, a lot of this kind of rigid process is important and valuable when you are working with a team, but is counterproductive when it&#39;s just me. I know the tradeoffs of the corners I cut. I have the experience to know, for example, that&#39;s it&#39;s not a safe assumption that I will understand my own code a year (or even a month) from now. But the solution to that is to throw in some freeform comments that jog my memory; not to implement a heavyweight documentation system.Everyone should work in the way that makes them the most productive and happy, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea for solo developers to bring in practices that are designed for team collaboration without really understanding what value they will get from the extra effort."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was a new developer and first learned Git, I felt compelled to use Git the &#34;right&#34; way. That is... small commits with clean messages, things described in this and other posts.But, as I spent more time programming, I developed different Git habits for different situations:- Solo explorative work: working on a feature, many small commit messages create nothing but noise. Trying to come up with wording for these commit messages is mostly a drain on my mental energy: there is an infinitesimal chance I&#39;ll need these commits later. In such cases, I prefer to maintain large &#34;checkpoint&#34; work-in-progress commits that are the result of near-continuous `git commit --amend`s so that I can use `git status` to see what&#39;s changed since my last checkpoint, and easily revert to the last checkpoint. If this fails me, I can almost just as easily refer to the reflog to find some changes. The reflog, in my opinion, is an extremely under-utilized tool. `git diff HEAD@{2}..HEAD@{0}` allows me to see what&#39;s happened in the the last two times that I updated my checkpoint. Since this is active work I&#39;m doing right now, I have a good sense of what happened and when, all without tiresomely writing commit messages that will be a bunch of gibberish in two days. When I&#39;m satisfied with with the work on a checkpoint commit, I reset the branch to the previous real commit, and then incrementally create real, meaningful commits from the accumulated work, that have some chance to be useful to me in the future.- Working on patches and bug fixes for live systems or production libraries: small, atomic commits that include tests for the patch are the only way to go. I believe the &#34;correct Git&#34; approach that is widely espouses is targeted to this use case, but not explorative feature work. Or maybe that&#39;s just me.Wondering if anyone else codes like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with the premise that making is harder than commenting, and this can be frustrating. But I don&#39;t think that telling people not to comment is the right solution.There can be a lot of value in comments, even ones that have not been thought through very deeply. In fact, casual, uninformed comments are often the most valuable as they&#39;re representative of how someone new to your product or project will perceive it.I&#39;ve found that the keys to getting value out of comments without getting discouraged are:1. Not to take comments too personally or get defensive about it. They&#39;re not attacking you. In fact they&#39;re not attacking anything. They&#39;re just making an observation. (On rare occasions, you may get a comment from an asshole who really is attacking you personally, but it&#39;s pretty easy to tell when this is the case and ignore them).2. Take a more statistical view on comments. If one person mentions something, maybe they&#39;re just an outlier. But if 10 people mention the same thing, they&#39;re probably on to something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Roosevelt’s Man in the Area quote sums this up well.&gt; &#34;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&#34;It&#39;s also a useful metric for deciding who to follow on social media. Is the person showing off their work or are they just commenting on the work of others? If the work/comment ratio drops too low, I stop following them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is so vague that people can read anything they want into it, and judging from the comments here, they are. My question is, who is the target of the article, who is supposed to avoid commenting? Your coworkers? Your boss? Your paying customers? Your non-paying users? The media? Twitter/HN randos? All of the above?If you&#39;re a maker, then you&#39;re making things for someone. If you&#39;re only making things for yourself, then of course nobody else has a right to comment. But if you&#39;re making things for other people, then it seems to me that those other people have the right, perhaps even the obligation, to comment on the product, right? The article verges on the parodic idea that no maker should ever be subject to any criticism. If that&#39;s not the author&#39;s intention, then the author ought to be clearer what is intended.That&#39;s my drive-by comment."</p>

It was only playing in a single cinema in the world in Paris and only at midgnight. So glad I got to catch that.I am kind of glad to hear that Daft Pank is over and I say this as someone who their music means a lot to. The arc of their art is complete and there is nowhere left for them to go without it becoming forced, awkward or irrelevant: teenagers with attitude and samplers to elder statesmen recording with an orchestra.As this is HN, does anyone remember their more interesting dives into technology: Daft Club [2] and the multi-angle DVD of D.A.F.T. [3]?This quote [4] about Daft Club, and the state of music on the internet, from 2001 is really interesting in hindsight:&gt; It&#39;s great to find a new channel where there is an open access, open door to more, but not more than had to be done before. It&#39;s establishing a connection between people that listen to our music and ourselves. There&#39;s no limits of time, and it helps people get and listen to this music. A track that could have been done today can be online tomorrow. The other thing is to really express ourselves through the Internet.&gt; ...&gt; Napster is a cool thing with us. The important thing is to make a difference. Napster is a positive thing because it raises questions, it raises issues.[1] https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0800022/[2] https://web.archive.org/web/20020804191122/http://www.daftcl...[3] https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0279758/[4] https://web.archive.org/web/20070609232158/http://music.yaho..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “When they legislate these things, they need to be appropriating enough money to make sure they work,” a source said. They estimated fixing the SB1310 bug would take roughly 2,000 additional programming hours.40 hours a week times 52 weeks is 2080 hours.  Subtract a few weeks for vacations and holidays, and you get a little less that 2000 hours.  So, basically, this is a little more than one programmer-year of effort if the estimate is in the right ballpark.It&#39;s gross that the decision not to fix this carries an apparent implicit economic calculation that one programmer-year is more valuable than the freedom that is being denied to an unknown number of people whom society deems less important.  (Granted the actual situation is more complicated and the state is constrained by their contract with the vendor, which we can reasonably guess is going to charge as much as they can contractually get away with rather than the programmer&#39;s actual salary cost.)At least the Department of Corrections has assigned people to do the calculations manually.  That&#39;s better, but it sounds like they just don&#39;t have enough people on it to keep up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow. I know firsthand from family how this can severely destroy someone&#39;s mental health in what may not be so obvious; it is extremely heavy on someone every moment past the first hour they go past their release time, then the first day followed by a variety of things that will then be taken advantage of by other inmate and guards while one&#39;s defenses are down.  The fun poked at by other jealous inmates and cruel guards constantly will also weigh down hard on another human being.  Arizona penal system puts you into almost always into very nasty and dangerous places of incarceration. frompdx made a statement that truly made my gut feel as if I was at the top of a roller coaster I did not want to get on in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I wanted to have compiled [1] financials, PriceWaterhouseCoopers told me to pick a recognized accounting system, then change the company&#39;s business processes to match that.   They said absolutely not to go the other way, to try to customize any software to match our business.I think about that every time I read about another government (or private!) company that wastes tens or hundreds of million of dollars (or euros or pounds) on custom software.It seems like there should be 1, 2, or 3 DMV programs.   The same for building codes, tax codes, etc.   And prison software.   You can be more like Massachusetts or Mississippi or Montana (hypothetical examples) but pick one and harmonize with it.1: compiled is the lowest of 3 standards that outside accountants can do; &#34;reviewed&#34; is higher and &#34;audited&#34; is the highest.  Even at the compiled level they mailed out postcards to a certain number of customers asking if they were customers over the past year and had spent this much money.   It was fairly easy for the acquiring company&#39;s outside accountants to review PWC&#39;s work and bring it up to audited standard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting, but strikes me as very unrealistic. I don&#39;t think it&#39;d go that way. In fact, it&#39;d be far more horrifying.We wouldn&#39;t bother trying to convince an image of a brain into cooperation, because we simply lose any need to do that very quickly.One of the very first things we&#39;d do with a simulated brain is to debug it. Execute it step by step, take lots of measures of all parameters, save/reload state, test every possible input and variation. And I&#39;m sure it wouldn&#39;t take long to start getting some sort of interesting result, first superficial then deeper and deeper.Cooperation would quickly become unnecessary because you either start from a cooperative state every time, or you quickly figure out how to tweak the brain state into cooperation.And that&#39;s when the truly freaky stuff starts. Using such a tool we could figure out many things about a brain&#39;s inner workings. How do we truly respond to advertising? How to produce maximum anger and maximum cooperation? How to best implant false memories? How to craft a convincing lie? What are the bugs and flaws in human perception? We could fuzz it and see if we can crash a brain.We&#39;ve already made some uncomfortable advancements, eg in how free to play games intentionally try to create addiction. With such a tool at our disposal we could fine tune strategies without having to guess. Eventually we&#39;d just know which bits of the brain we want to target and just have to find ways of getting the right things to percolate down the neural network until those bits are affected in the ways we want.Within a decade we&#39;d have a manual on how to craft the best propaganda, how to best create discord, or how to best destroy a human being by just talking to them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve often imagined what it would be like to have an executable brain scan of myself. Imagine scanning yourself right as you&#39;re feeling enthusiastic enough to work on any task for a few hours, and then spawning thousands of copies of yourself to all work on something together at once. And then after a few hours or maybe days, before any of yourselves meaningfully diverge in memories/goals/values, you delete the copies and then spawn another thousand fresh copies to resume their tasks. Obviously for this to work, you would have to be comfortable with the possibility of finding yourself as an upload and given a task by another version of yourself, and knowing that the next few hours of your memory would be lost. Erasing a copy that only diverged from the scan for a few hours would have more in common with blacking out from drinking and losing some memory than dying.The creative output you could accomplish from doing this would be huge. You would be able to get the output of thousands of people all sharing the exact same creative vision.I definitely wouldn&#39;t be comfortable with the idea of my brain scan being freely copied around for anyone to download and (ab)use as they wished though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As suggested by others the number of taxonomists, people who could accurately identify species (many of which require internal dissection, or molecular methods), who are actually working on collecting and identify species has most certainly declined.  In many groups of insects there is at most a handful of experts worldwide who can take specimens to a species-level identification.This is not to say that species richness is not declining, its to say that in the past 3-4 decades Taxonomists have done a poor (some would say terrible) job at describing to the broader world why they are important, and why they require fixed, institutionally-based funding to actually be able to provide the services that would allow us to confidently state that data like these are because of environmental change (again, they very likely are) rather than a lack of experts in the field actually doing basic research.In other words, it is extremely rare that universities (in the US) actually hire what was once known as &#34;alpha-taxonomists&#34;, in part this is a reflection of taxonomists inability to sell themselves and adapt to new tools (but note that many have evolved) in part it is a reflection of the (I would argue &#34;immense&#34;) short-sightedness of institutions. &#34;We want answers to complex questions!  We&#39;ve neglected to give scientists time to think deeply, and research over decades to answer those questions.  Oh, we see.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last year I installed a beehive in our garden. Didn&#39;t take their honey, didn&#39;t treat them for Varroa. In the midst of winter I was sure they were all dead. Then a few days ago temperatures shot up to about 18°c and suddenly they were back, basking in the sunlight and buzzing around the hive. Made me so happy...Seriously, I&#39;ve come to understand that contrary to what most of us seem to believe, it&#39;s not about what we can do to minimize our negative impact, but rather what we can do to have a positive impact on our environment. Not just ecologically, but also socially and politically."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not sure what a thinly resourced piece like this is doing so high up on HN. There’s really very little evidence that this has anything to do with racial slurs.From a quick read: last June, the channel was banned for “harmful and dangerous” content. The ban was removed in under 24 hours. YouTube has not confirmed the reason. And yet:&gt; Experts suspect that it was the usage of words like &#34;black&#34; and &#34;white&#34; that confused the Yutube&#39;s AI filters.Well, if experts said it, it just be true! The experiment they ran is speculative as best and the article just ran with it as absolute fact. If the filter was caused by use of “black” and “white” wouldn’t every chess channel fall victim to it? The filter isn’t new, why was it triggered once last June?A lot of questions raised and an article that has no interest in answering them. It’s credited to “Buzz Staff”… I think it’s always  suspect when no one wants to attach their name to something they wrote. A smell of clickbait running all the way through this one."</p>

I&#39;m getting banned on Twitter every other day from following anyone because I follow a lot of academics. It&#39;s all legitimate but algos detected some pattern and I&#39;m now toast. Twitter provides exactly zero ways to report this or fix this. They simply don&#39;t care if some monority users suffer. We see same things when Google disables account and you get locked out from your electronic life.I used to think working with governments is very hard. Getting support in places like DMVs and passport renewals is super hard.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Barriers to entry are invisible. They are invisible to people on the inside and most frequently invisible to people who have a hand in creating those barriers.I once had a conversation with a founder about their signup flow. This founder had aspirations to be a global player. They said that step 2 of their flow included entering a credit card number. I had to stop them. &#34;What about people who don&#39;t use credit cards?&#34; They were nonplussed. &#34;You know, China, much of Africa ...&#34; they had never actually thought about whether people had credit cards because every single person they interacted with had one.Back to languages. If you&#39;ve never taught an introduction to computer programming for a general audience you are blind to what does and does not matter about a language. You look at things like `foo.bar()` and think &#34;Yeah that&#39;s a simple method invocation&#34; and have no idea how many people you just lost.Never underestimate how much ease of use matters. We, as a community, have selected for decades against people who care about language ergonomics because they get hit in the face with a wall of punctuation filled text and turn away. We fight over where braces belong while not realizing how many hundreds of thousands of people we&#39;ve excluded.Ease of use is the most important part of a language. It&#39;s just that the barriers to entry are invisible and so the people who happen to be well suited to vim vs emacs debates get to talk while the vast majority of potential programmers are left on the outside.We create barriers to entry accidentally because we design for people like us. To us the barriers are invisible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Going by their first example, the fact that I couldn&#39;t write   list.delete(value)

without realizing it involves a linear search is considered one of the benefits of Go.That said, I agree Go could use a bit for ergonomic and handy methods, while still remaining efficient.The example on Concurrency also has a different answer. Go gives you all the tools, but there are many different ways their problem can be solved. By explicitly avoiding a &#34;join&#34; method and having any default &#39;channels&#39;, Go makes all these possible. What is missing is some of the popular patterns that emerged in the last few years need to make it to into stdlib or some cookbooks.1. If you want a worker model, I would start n=3 go-routines and they all receive from a single channel. They don&#39;t need to much around with a channel of buffer 3, as in the example.2. If the workers already return data from a compute, the read from driver serves as the wait.3. In other cases, there is sync.Waitgroup available to synchronize completion status.4. End of work from the driver can be indicated via a channel close. Closed channels can still be read from until they are empty and the reader can even detect end-of-channel.Designing concurrent system is a bit complicated. Some tutorials do make it sound like a `go` keyword is all you need. All of these can fixed by improving std-lib or cookbooks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"But no one said Go was easy. It&#39;s just simple and easy to reason about. There&#39;s a huge benefit to something doing exactly what it says. No hidden behaviours, no overly complex syntax, nothing like that.I came from C# where I have gotten increasingly frustrated with the amount of additions to the language. Like we now have classes, structs and records. We now have async/await but we also have channels. This is what having a huge toolbox causes. Some people are going to write code using channels, me others will use async. Some people will use features that others don&#39;t care about.I think there&#39;s huge benefit in a simple language. In Go I know that there&#39;s only 2 ways to do concurrency. You either use go routines and mutexes or you use go routines and channels.Generics will bring a lot of helper functions that weren&#39;t possible before which will remove a lot of repetitive code.But otherwise I am super happy with writing Go code. All my pet peeves of something like modern Java or C# are gone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tree Sitter is amazing. The parsing is fast enough to run on every keystroke. The parse tree is extremely concise and readable. It resembles an AST more than a parse tree (ie no 11 levels of binary op precedence rules in the tree). The parse tree emits specific ERROR nodes, so you can get a semi-functional tree even with broken syntax.I can&#39;t wait for the tools to get built with this. Paredit for TypeScript. Syntax-tree based highlighting (vs regex highlighting). A command to &#34;add an arg to current function&#34; which works across languages. A command to add a CSS class to the nearest JSX node, or to walk up the tree at the className=&#34;| ...&#34; position, adding a new className if it doesn&#39;t exist.There&#39;s a nicely documented Emacs package for this [1]. The documentation is at [2]. The parse trees work great. There&#39;s syntax highlighting support and tree-walking APIs. There&#39;s a bit of confusion about TSX vs typescript langs but it&#39;s fixable with some config change [3].[1]: https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-tree-sitter

Tree-sitter would definitely give better results than our current ctags-based approach. It&#39;s been catching our attention more and more lately, and we have plans to use it to upgrade our out-of-the-box, instant code navigation experience.It&#39;s not the exact right fit for our primary goals though, since it&#39;s designed around being extremely fast while editing and robust against errors. Sourcegraph is only used for navigating committed code, so we&#39;re leveraging formats like LSIF to generate complete semantic graphs of codebases and their entire dependency tree. That&#39;ll enable a lot of features that are out of reach for tree-sitter, but is a lot harder to get working out of the box and it&#39;s a much bigger technical investment.It&#39;s very interesting to see the topological space that houses these solutions fill out. Every tool has its own set of unique trade-offs and fall somewhere on these spectrums:- fast vs slow- precise vs imprecise- zero-configuration vs configuration requiredWe&#39;ve visited a few islands in this space but still very curious to see what other islands can be discovered. We&#39;re especially excited about tools and formats like tree-sitter and LSIF around which a large and supportive community can grow so that all the products we love and rely on as developers can all make forward progress."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried to use this to ease the front end work load of students in a compiler project (building a C compiler) for a University course, so that the project could be focused on the more interesting middle and back end parts of the compiler.
However, reported bugs in the C grammar that saw no activity at all [1] made this impossible. From this small sample of experiences, I was left with the impression that Tree Sitter is great for things like syntax highlighting, where wrong results are annoying but not dramatic, but not so suitable for tools that need a really correct syntax tree.---

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on a startup that received seed funding to tackle this. I helped build the platform (using Twilio video) and then answered the first $5000 of calls. Things I learned:- Many entry level programmers at big companies (think Walmart Labs, Target, Goldman Sachs, etc) are too scared to ask managers/team for help. If you work for a large company, make sure new hires feel safe asking questions and seeking help or they will seek it elsewhere.- The really hard questions they&#39;re willing to pay $240 an hour for have too much context for you to grasp. They want you to replace their ORM layer or tell them why their 600 line test case is not working.- Getting customers is not too hard by poaching them from Stack Overflow, Reddit, CodeMentor.- Developers make good money working full time and idly sitting at their desk part of that time. Here you only get paid for active time and the idle time in-between will kill your salary. Your motivation has to come from helping other people and watching them grow, not from $$$."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You&#39;ll need some mechanism to raise rates to attract top developers.Even without the first free minute and time spent reading questions, the most a dev could hope to earn with this service is ($0.75/min)(60 min/hr) = $45/hr. Perhaps for students or devs who barely meet the 100 rep minimum requirement, that might be attractive, but for the experts who&#39;ve written the best Stack Overflow answers, that&#39;s likely to be a (small) fraction of their bill rate.Free contribution is rewarding as a means of helping.Well-paid contribution is rewarding for the $$$.Poorly paid contribution often loses both incentives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d guess that the people at Stack Overflow might have an issue with someone using their name in this way. It should probably be clearer that this is entirely unaffiliated.100+ reputation on SO is also a ridiculously low bar, it&#39;s almost meaningless. Not that any amount of reputation by itself is a sure indicator, but 100 really doesn&#39;t mean anything at all.This kind of site also requires a pretty large critical mass to work, you don&#39;t just want a bunch of random SO users willing to participate, but you need the right users with experience in the right tags to match to the requests in a reasonable timeframe.There&#39;s a good reason Stack Overflow doesn&#39;t allow people to pay for answers, people already cheat enough for meaningless internet points, this will get much worse with real money on the line."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With interest rates so low (and lots of headwinds for them to increase in the short-term), one has to think that this will be the new normal for a few years at least. The rise of SPACs is another sign - they are disrupting both later-stage VC funds as well as obviously vanilla IPOs.I wonder if the abundance of capital is not evenly distributed through the startup lifecycle, but more heavily-weighted towards later stages.Anecdotally, I&#39;ve heard from founders that SEED rounds are getting harder despite all the frothiness. Even back when we did our seed rounds ~2015, we already heard &#34;today&#39;s seed round is yesterday&#39;s Series A&#34; in terms of $ size but also minimum bar of progress. And these days it seems that is EVEN MORE true. It&#39;s also true it&#39;s easier to start a SaaS company than ever before. But it&#39;s ALSO ALSO true that there is less and less SaaS greenspace. Hmmmm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree, at present, capital is abundant. That is, at the moment:  Σ(capital available) &gt; Σ(investment opportunities)

And this imbalance of demand for and supply of investment opportunities is showing up everywhere as... asset price inflation.You can see it in rising angel valuations, rising early-stage VC valuations, rising later-stage VC valuations, rising growth-equity valuations, rising leveraged buyout valuations, rising stock market valuations, rising cryptocurrency prices, rising home prices, etc. Feeding frenzies and bidding wars for high quality assets have become more and more common. Asset prices keep going up and up and up...The multi-trillion-dollar question:Is this sustainable?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps I&#39;m a minority, but I got A LOT of value from my investors (both pre-seed, seed, and series A). To the point where I&#39;d consider them core partners in my journey of building the business.I know Aaron isn&#39;t saying that the investors don&#39;t matter.But when I think about why VCs hate going through an auction-like process, at least part of it is human nature. Like, we&#39;re about to work together for a long time. Let&#39;s not start off by commoditizing what we each bring to the table. I understand the POV that 99.999% of what VCs bring to the table is the literal commodity of cash... but if you have good ones, they really can help.In our case, we had multiple term sheets for our Series A so I was able to optimize terms and get the partner/fund who I thought would add the most value but at &#34;market&#34; on the other terms. &#34;Market&#34; being what was on the other term sheets. That seemed to work OK as a softer way of actually doing the auction.The real point in all of this is that if the VC&#39;s value-add is true, then you shouldn&#39;t NEED to discount things because of that. If it&#39;s real, then they should be happy to pay &#39;market rate&#39; to invest in you, and the impact of their other value will be that together you build a better business, which is more valuable to them too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I always found it funny that companies will go to extreme Herculean lengths to hire the best programmers, and are incredibly fearful and paranoid that they could be making a &#34;bad hire&#34;, and yet once hired they don&#39;t spend a second making sure engineers aren&#39;t completely running the software product off the rails and killing the company internally. The author mentions trying to rewrite Etsy&#39;s backend in Scala and MongoDB. That probably cost the company X million dollars. Etsy could still be recovering from that.The industry constantly mints senior engineers who have been bitten by complexity, but doesn&#39;t want to hire them, or listen to them. More often than not senior engineers pretend to be excited about complecting the tech stack, because hey, it pads their resume with the latest buzzwords and they&#39;ve given up trying to fight against it anyway.The last line of defense against a rogue engineering team is managers who have studied this stuff. How many engineering managers can spot the common situation &#34;the engineers are bored and they&#39;re rewriting perfectly-good codebases in Common Lisp and OCAML for funsies&#34;? And how many know what to do about it when they see it?Anyway, this is a cool website, and it&#39;ll be useful to point people to it in the future, so thanks for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with the non-boring technology club is that programmers see what problem FAANG companies are solving and wanting to be on the edge on new technology too. But they don‘t have the same problems. Another problem is they want to show what they can do. If they tell in an interview they are working with rails/django and a postgresql database they fear they look incompetent using those old technologies. So they try to convince their companies their products need to be rewritten in mongodb, react with graphql in a micro service stack and many more state of the art technologies.And in the end many developer years are wasted just rewriting a working an existing software in a new stack they are not yet comfortable with and the new product is much less stable than the old one.I love basecamp for their hotwired stack and showing that you can make the great software with old boring technologies and just a little bit of javascript magic pixie dust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way I see it is that one should master their stack.  If you work over and over again with the same stack you will know it well.  You will be able to move mountains with it.  But it takes years to arrive to that.  It takes implementing multiple projects the same way over and over again.You need the wherewithal to stick with your stack and not get lured away.  Maybe this is what boring means.  Maybe boring is different to different engineers based on their background.Sometimes you cannot select the stack cause there might be more senior engineers at a company and they have more sway.  This is fine as long as the engineers picking the stack have picked a stack they have mastered and it is boring to them.  As a regular engineer in their team I would hope to rely on their expertise and would hope to learn from them.I remember at one job a rogue engineer picked a boring backend that would have been fine.  But they fell behind because the other engineers knew their boring stack a lot better.  Ultimately the rogue engineer had to switch to the other boring stack.  The rogue engineer just was not fast enough to master it and implement the features required to keep pace with the demands of management.  These demands were trace centralized logging, security, and of course features.  So while they were still learning the ropes, we were moving on to even more advanced security, logging, and feature requirements.  They just couldn&#39;t keep up."</p>

But it&#39;s down in a difficult to access gravity well. There&#39;s no nitrogen. Far, far, better would be fully funding ARM and starting to despin and drag asteroids to the lunar gateway for study, resources, and eventually living space in space protected from radiation and, if you build sub-surface tracks, enough acceleration to live normally."</p>

There are lots of websites that do this very thing like whatsmyname.app.I personally like running my username through tools like this and aggregating my digital presence. When I was younger, I signed up for lots of sites that were the cool, new thing. Checking myself years later, I am shocked by the wide berth I left. Fitness accounts. Accounts from that time I was getting into studying chess. I’m the type of person who is always on to the next hobby. I go 100% in on something, then pop to the next thing. It was a big wake up call to me looking back seeing how much presence I left. Many accounts are so old I can’t even get into them anymore to clean up what’s out there. Tools like this can be used for good.That said, I totally understand the cyber stalking/bullying concerns. I am also astounded by the cyber sleuth types. In the documentary, Don’t F* with Cats, people spent 100s of hours carefully walking through streets in Google Maps to match a location to a photo they had of a guy who killed a cat on YouTube. It seems to me where there’s a will, there’s a way. It’s scary, and unfortunately a lot of tools we can use to protect ourselves are the same tools that can be used against us.

You can&#39;t expect users to protect themselves, because you don&#39;t know what dangers might exist in the future for them that do not exist today.The other thing you can do is not allow your API to iterate over the set of all users by user-set identifier. It&#39;s an extreme flaw of the telephone numbering system. You would think by the 2020s we&#39;d have learned to use a unique UUID designation for every user for any public facing APIs.

Also, I remember that most things we covered in school were completely irrelevant for the real world. So a difficulty to concentrate on school stuff may actually be better than doing the homework.In short, ignoring what society considers normal and instead being super focused on your own things ... sounds more healthy to me than the average &#34;normal&#34; person."</p>

There are endpoint tools which collect MD5’s, network scanners which collect MD5s, and I have heard about actual infosec directors who, upon seeing a blog post like that, would carefully type the hashes in their endpoint management interface to make sure their org is not infected.How on earth can this be effective? It is trivial to create customized binaries in the installer, so no two users have the same file checksum. With a bit of work, one can rig their download server so each user has a completely different installer checksum as well.I remember reading about polymorphic viruses back in the 1990’s - not only those had different checksums for each  computer, they also had no long-ish substrings common between two versions, making signature analysis ineffective. Did malware authors just forgot about all those and went back to trivial “everyone gets the same image” strategy?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Mistake 3: Communicating something one time is enoughI joined a company once where a particularly skilled engineer had become a manager.   She was very good at her job and I&#39;m fairly certain had something like &#39;perfect recollection&#39;.We were in a meeting and she went on about how she was upset people were doing a troubleshooting process wrong despite having sent out a detailed email.Not wanting to do that thing wrong I searched my email, but couldn&#39;t find it.   I asked about it and she told me &#34;Oh it was before you joined us.&#34;.I had been with that team for two years...People tend to remember important things like it was yesterday, but don&#39;t always realize that other people can only absorb so many important things / don&#39;t always know how important it is... and email is kinda a terrible way to communicate it too.   Let alone 2+ years earlier ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mistakes I&#39;ve seen eng mgrs make:- not acknowledging obvious elephants in the room- not building enough trust early on with their reports that when a problem comes up, the information they get is biased as they are seen as part of leadership/management and not the team- applying pressure in the wrong direction (ie; if the team is moving slow because of stress or fear, making things more stressful will not speed things up)- trying too hard to be friends with all their reports, rather than figuring out the appropriate boundaries on a person to person basis- relaying anonymous information around in an effort to &#34;protect people&#34; and thus making themselves the go-between between all members on a team rather than encouraging people to work things out themselves- for ICs that then became mgrs, staying way too focused on the in the weeds details and not on the bigger picture or people details, up to an including still spending too much time coding or trying to do PR reviews that carry too much weight--I would actually go so far as to say that the best &#34;IC turned managers&#34; I&#39;ve had have been about at par with the most mediocre &#34;good people mgrs that didn&#39;t come through coding for that role&#34;, and the people in that role that excelled at it (a motley crew of former stage managers, teachers, guidance counselors, project managers, etc)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; She was on a steady track to land a senior role. Even after I decided to leave the company, I let the next manager know this person is track for a senior position in the next few months.Its very naive to think, that the manager replacing you will see eye to eye with you. I have seen countless occasions, where the engineer in the team who is ontrack for promotion doesnt get it, because the management above has changed.While being in IC role, I never relied on the company to promote me. Its better to jump ships than reestablish the relationship with new manager. It takes same amount of work anyway. At least jumping ship will give you much higher compensation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Running an alternative OS &#34;natively&#34; on a Mac doesn&#39;t seem very appealing to me. It&#39;s almost guaranteed you will never fully get Wi-Fi, audio, graphics acceleration, the trackpad, etc. working flawlessly, especially on the M1 where almost every component is Apple proprietary and it&#39;s not a matter of loading, say, some common Intel graphics driver.On the other hand, virtualization _already_ lets you run whatever arm64 BSD, Linux, or Windows that you want. The trackpad and everything else will work flawlessly thanks to guest additions. Yes, you make some tradeoffs -- you sacrifice a core, a few GB of RAM, some disk space for an OS you don&#39;t _really_ want to be running. But I&#39;m skeptical that these are not better tradeoffs than constantly using a hacked-together and half-broken OS.To me the ideal solution is not that Corellium or Marcan or whoever reverse engineers the drivers to a sufficient degree. I&#39;d rather see Apple (or the Hackintosh types) release a tiny variant of macOS that contains hardware drivers and Hypervisor.framework and not much else. It could be the next generation of Boot Camp and it would probably take less engineering effort for them to maintain while satisfying the small segment of customers interested in running other operating systems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic. OpenBSD on an M1 Mac Mini would be a great home server.As for desktop, I love cwm on my thinkpads, but macbook touchpads have won me over. That said, if arcan gets to a usable state on OpenBSD, I wouldn&#39;t mind sinking a few weekends (and/or crates of beer) into helping with improving touchpad/gesture support. X11 is just too daunting to have me bothered."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So much for the many remarks made on HN claiming that Apple would use the M1 to further exert control over users’ ability to boot an alternative OS. Between this and Asahi Linux, I’d say things are off to a good start.Btw, Asahi has a Patreon page for anyone who wants to contribute. I’m tossing twelve bucks a month and recommend any Mac users with interest in booting alternative OSes support such projects.Now I’m gonna see if there’s an option to throw money at this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am deeply, deeply romantic about programming. I consider it an act of self-actualization.But answering the question literally, I am not representative of everyone in the industry, and that&#39;s a good thing. It&#39;s easy to feel romantic about your vocation when you have a number of reasonable options for achieving modest financial security, and you thus had the privilege of choosing the one that most closely matched your idea of self-actualization and self-identification.Not everyone in this economy has the same set of choices. For many, programming is the lowest-risk way to put a roof over their head and feed their family. We can make up little myths about how we romantics are obviously more passionate, work harder because it&#39;s our dream, are more deeply engaged, and so on.But in the end, I think we&#39;ll find as we look around that those of us who feel romantic about something that is also an excellent way to make money at this particular place in time and space have won a lottery of sorts, and are definitely in the minority.That&#39;s not a bad thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I don&#39;t disagree with the article, this quote better sums up how I feel about programming.&gt; The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination... Yet the program construct, unlike the poet&#39;s words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself... The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time.-Fred Brooks, in The Mythical Man-MonthIn deference to the counterpoints in this thread, a lot of the &#34;poetry&#34; we actually encounter seems to have been written by Vogons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seeing as i&#39;m not as jaded yet as many of the other commenters here towards programming, maybe I can give my views.I understand what the author&#39;s getting at pretty simply, it&#39;s pretty awesome to write some words...lots and lots of words...and you create &#39;something&#39;.It&#39;s sort of the same romance that say would surround something likeA carpenter that builds homes from start to finishOr a mechanic that builds super cars in their garageI think it&#39;s that same thingThe lone programmer hacking away building something awesomeUnfortunately, like the &#39;romance&#39; of most things, the reality isThat carpenter&#39;s working on a crew of 100 people building yet another cooking cutter townhouseThat mechanic works a day job at a shop and spends more time paying bills and dealing with customersAnd...that programmerThey&#39;re part of a team debugging some server code somewhere that a bank or accounting firm relies on or somethingSometimes though, I find it helps just to stop and think of things romantically from time to time, even if you&#39;re disillusioned.By the time I left my prior job, I was kind of fed up with it. But even then there was two ways I could look at it.I could be&#39;A CNC programmer in a granite shop making countertops and fireplaces for rich people&#39;Or&#39;I turned mountains into high end furniture using large machines in a trade that stretches back to the farthest history of humanity.&#39;Looking at it the second way helped on those days you just really didn&#39;t want to be there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I respect Brave&#39;s efforts to make Tor accessible to the masses, but it also puts people at risk. There&#39;s lot of people with not a great deal of technical knowledge who are aware of Tor and might see it as a means to bulletproof privacy, unaware that using it through Brave on an OS like Windows 10 could easily expose them.Brave does present some kind of warning to users when opening an incognito tab. It just doesn&#39;t make the risks clear enough and will mostly be ignored.I&#39;m not sure what solutions there are for this. Perhaps shipping Tor as part of a regular browser isn&#39;t a good idea.

It would be great if we could legally continue to gather data.So far, it seems these substances are arguably much less dangerous than many illegal substances. I would be in favor of legalizing all of them.Decriminalizing seems to be a necessary step in that direction, but it doesn’t allow for quality control.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This classic passive-aggressive apology — “I felt awful that I had let down so many people in my effort to be loyal and learn from EA” doesn’t exactly ring out with contrition — isn’t even internally consistent; if the development team loved their game so much, why was Origin’s management forced to devise stratagems to keep them from going home out of the fear that they wouldn’t come back? Nevertheless, it does contain a fair amount of truth alongside its self-serving omissionsUgh - those omissions are not self-serving. The reality (which we all see) is that the dev team f*cking hated the game, probably gave up on quality, and everyone knows it.  But saying so is an attack on the people Garriott screwed when he screwed up; the omissions are of other people&#39;s contributions to his faults, not his faults themselves.The apology was _incredibly_ well-written: it highlights all of garriott&#39;s mistakes, in detail, and places the blame squarely on his own shoulders: he could say &#34;EA is evil because they enforce business discipline,&#34; but instead said &#34;they did their job as a business, and I didn&#39;t so mine as a creator.&#34;If anything, this was probably _too_ self-blaming (we all know EA would just replace him if he didn&#39;t bow down, accomplishing nothing). But don&#39;t criticize him for failing to throw his team under the bus.  Knowing very little, I&#39;d love work for this guy, based on that apology alone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pagan was pretty bad. I was one of the superfans at the time, I had played every Ultima on my Apple II and then my PC. I was one of the first people to beat Ultima VI and still have my award certificate from Lord British which I got in the mail. I spent late nights tweaking my autoexec.bat and config.sys to get Ultima VII to run properly. Pagan was unplayable on release, it was actually impossible to across the stones leading across an underground river without falling in. Later they released a patch which fixed the most glaring issues and I completed the game, but it left a sour taste in my mouth.What REALLY killed Ultima was the absolute state of Ultima IX. Also released in an unplayable state, the patches rolled in. Finally after about two months, it was playable but as one progressed in the game, incongruities almost immediately popped out. The lore had been changed, sometimes substantially. And this wasn&#39;t the worst thing - it became clear after not too long that the game wasn&#39;t done at all. This was later admitted by an Origin team member who released the real plot, and later on people attempted to fan-patch the game to make it more like it had been planned originally.Of course, EA is to blame for all of this, but Garriott shares this blame for allowing them to take too much control away from his organization and okaying the releases before they were ready.http://hacki.bootstrike.com/english/nitpicks.htmHacki&#39;s page is still THE internet resource for the pissed off former Ultima fan."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looks like it uses system webviews instead of bundling a copy of Chromium? This to me seems like the real headlining feature, but strangely I had to dig pretty deep to find it: https://tauri.studio/en/docs/getting-started/technical-detai...I kind of wonder why it took this long for someone to try this approach. It just makes a whole lot more sense on the surface.Interesting thing I just thought about: since users don&#39;t get to choose their system webview, I wonder if this has the potential to broaden browser diversity a little bit?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of makes me think... is there room for a much more stripped down version of Chromium that is suitable for lower memory footprint? Or is this impossible?It looks like Tauri uses system webviews, which use a lot less memory, but the burden is then on the developer to make sure that they build essentially 3 (maybe more) UI&#39;s on platforms that might change under their feet. That&#39;s why the Electron approach is simpler - it trades of performance for uniformity of experience across the major platforms.But I&#39;m wondering if it really has to be this way. Do modern browsers really need 2G of RAM in order to send and receive messages in a chat box (looking at you, Slack)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A more common scenario I see is that people start with a monolith that ends up inheriting all the conceptual debt that accumulates as a project evolves. All this debt builds up a great desire for change in the maintaining team.A champion will rise with a clean architecture and design in microservice form that addresses all high visibility pain points, attributing forecasted benefits to the perceived strengths of microservices. The team buys into the pitch and looks forwards to a happily-ever-after ending.The reality though is that the team now has multiple problems, which include:- Addressing conceptual debt that hasn&#39;t gone away.
- Discovering and migrating what the legacy system got right, which is often not documented and not obvious.
- Dealing with the overheads of microservices that were not advertised and not prominent at a proof-of-concept scale.
- Ensuring business continuity while this piece of work goes on.I would propose alternative is to fix your monolith first. If the team can&#39;t rewrite their ball of mud as a new monolith, then what are the chances of successfully rewriting and changing architecture?Once there is a good, well functioning monolith, shift a subset of responsibility that can be delegated to a dedicated team - the key point is to respect Conway&#39;s law - and either create a microservice from it or build a new independent monolith service, which aligns more to service oriented architecture than microservices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hahaha. I have been saying the same for years but have either been punished by my managers or mercilessly downvoted on HN.Somehow mentioning that microservices might not be perfect solution in every case triggers a lot of people.I have actually helped save at least one project in a huge bank which got rolled from 140 services into one. The team got also scaled down to third of its size but was able to work on this monolithic application way more efficiently. Also reliability, which was huge issue before the change, improved dramatically.When I joined, I have observed 6 consecutive failed deployments. Each took entire week to prepare and entire weekend to execute (with something like 40 people on bridge call).When I left I have observed 50 consecutive successful deployments, each requiring 1h to prepare (basically meeting to discuss and approve the change) and 2h of a single engineer to prepare and execute using automation.Most projects absolutely don&#39;t need microservices.Breaking anything apart brings inefficiencies of having to manage multiple things. Your people now spend time managing applications rather than writing actual business logic. You have to have really mature process to bring those inefficiencies down.If you want to &#34;do microservices&#34; you have to precisely know what kind of benefits you are after. Because the benefits better be higher than the costs or you are just sabotaging your project.There are actually ways to manage huge monolithic application that don&#39;t require each team to have their own repository, ci/cd, binary, etc.How do you think things like Excel or PhotoShop have been developed? It is certainly too large for a single team to handle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with creating a dichotomy between &#34;monolith&#34; and &#34;microservices&#34; is that... well... it doesn&#39;t make any sense. You describe your &#34;microservices&#34; and I&#39;ll explain how it&#39;s really just a monolith.&#34;So let me get this straight, you have a Billing package and an Ordering package. How are these organized again?&#34;-&gt; &#34;We have a distributed system.&#34;&#34;So you you compile them together and deploy them horizontally across many machines? Like a distributed monolith?&#34;-&gt; &#34;No we use microservices. The two packages are compiled and deployed separately so there is no code dependencies between them.&#34;&#34;Okay. So if I understand this right, you develop each package separately but they both access the same database?&#34;-&gt; &#34;No no no no! Microservices are not just about code dependency management, they are also about data ownership. Each package is developed and deployed separately and also manages it own database.&#34;&#34;Ah, so you have two monoliths?&#34;-&gt; &#34;...&#34;You see the problem is that the above terms are too broad to describe anything meaningful about a system. And usually &#34;monolith&#34; is used to described the dependencies between code whereas &#34;microservices&#34; is used to describe dependencies about data. It turns out there is a lot of overlap.Design and implement your systems according to your use-case and stop worrying about how to label them."</p>

It was successful since it worked.Facebook has entirely failed to utilise it - to allow external systems to connect in so that businesses can do business on there. The voice calls are also a disaster.They&#39;ve now come along to start messing with the privacy to start selling ads.  It is insane that they&#39;re able to make such a mess of this. Is there a word for anti-innovation?Considering that they&#39;re linking Facebook ad platform with the chats, and they&#39;re forcing this upon everyone, why isn&#39;t this covered by the monopoly laws? Most of us paid some money for the app."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s absurd this article doesn&#39;t try to describe what the changes actually are. The privacy policy change doesn&#39;t functionally change anything about what data is collected or shared with Facebook. Metadata collection for ad targeting has been allowed by the privacy policy since 2016."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, as an engineer, looking at the way FAANG are becoming middle-men in just about every part of human life, I would rather ban all social media and more generally mass communication software outright than try and regulate it. It feels to me like it&#39;s gotten to the point where this type of software is doing more harm than good.I know that the software itself is not the issue, the tech has potential to do good, but as humans we are just better off without it, if you ask me.PS. Not looking to argue. Just wanted to vent."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It took time, and many thousands of dollars, before I realized that the vast majority of “likes” my pages received as a result of paid campaigns on FB were from accounts which were clearly not real people.A simple look enough of their profiles revealed that, like would he expected from any fly by night CPA network, FB was using bots, or at least straw man accounts run by low-cost staff, to like and view content which FB was paid to advertise.Worse, I found that the clickthrough metrics reported by them to off-FB destinations I advertised NEVER was anywhere close to what was reported on the destination, including when tracked by Google Analytics.In short: like-fraud, click-fraud, and more.I cannot be the only person to notice these things. I assume it persists because most people, self included, simply complain and move on once we notice the “game” but don’t sue."</p>

OP discovered a problem they had and wrote a solution for it, believing that others might need to solve the same problem.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really interested to see what this does to Deliveroo. I live in central London on a pretty busy street and it&#39;s really wild how many Deliveroo drivers there are. In front of most of the popular takeaway restaurants there are 3-5 drivers waiting at any given time. The increase in delivery and decrease in normal foot traffic during the pandemic has made this really stick out.Deliveroo already totally robs these restaurants. Even for a click and collect order where I get the food myself Deliveroo takes ~20-30%. I assume this will cause Deliveroo to either increase fees or reduce service which may inspire more restuarants to hire their own delivery people again.Overall I think this is a good thing, especially now. These gig workers have been absolutely essential to society over the past year. People have been able to safely shelter in their home while these guys (it&#39;s mostly guys) go out and take all the risks. Let&#39;s pay them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The court made very specific arguments:1. Uber set the fare which meant that they dictated how much drivers could earn
2. Uber set the contract terms and drivers had no say in them
3. Request for rides is constrained by Uber who can penalise drivers if they reject too many rides
4. Uber monitors a driver&#39;s service through the star rating and has the capacity to terminate the relationship if after repeated warnings this does not improveEven if this does hurt Uber short-term, it sounds like the gig economy will be just fine, as long as companies change their behaviour with respect to the above points."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know anything about how the law works, but it seems to accord with the reality of how people tend to think of jobs.Have you ever met an Uber driver who didn&#39;t give the impression that this was what he did all the time? I haven&#39;t, though I imagine not everyone is full time. It&#39;s quite a way from the idea that anyone with a car can give someone else a ride. For instance, I&#39;ve never met a driver who happened to be going where I was going, or someone who thought they&#39;d just make few extra bucks on their day off. They must exist but it seems to not be the norm.At the same time, we&#39;re shoehorning old ideas of what&#39;s work into a modern setting, because it&#39;s reasonably quick to become a driver, and communications with the employer are minimal. Uber doesn&#39;t seem like the kind of firm where drivers might have a teambuilding excursion, though perhaps I&#39;m wrong."</p>

So exited for all the sciencing this nuclear-powered, sample-drilling, laser-zapping behemoth can do when it joins its friends on the only planet (known) to be inhabited solely by robots.Edit: Percy is about to release its two 77 kg Cruise Mass Balance Devices (is this what NASA calls &#39;weights&#39;?) to setup the right lift-to-drag ratio for entry. Mars InSight will be listening for the 14,000 km/hr impacts of these weights, providing useful calibration data. We wrote about this in this week&#39;s issue of our space-related newsletter, Orbital Index - https://orbitalindex.com/archive/2021-02-17-Issue-104/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I don&#39;t understand: when they say &#34;X is 1 minute from happening&#34;, does that mean it&#39;s really 1 minute from happening or does that mean &#34;in 1 minute we&#39;ll receive the signal that X has happened&#34;?Maybe my question makes more sense in the case of &#34;X is happening right now&#34;, because then I should either understand &#34;we infer that X should have happened right about now&#34; or &#34;we have confirmed via signal that X has happened&#34;, and that&#39;s a big big difference.I know in some cases they explicitly say the latter, so I guess my real real question is, do they just keep the communication delay implied in all countdowns &amp; references in discussion, to avoid confusion?(ETA: No need to let me know about simultaneity problems in relativity — earth and mars are, relative to c and to macroscopic time scales, essentially not moving relative to each other AFAIK, so that simultaneity is essentially well-defined. My question was about a much more boring classical-universe problem.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a great achievement with some really interesting work done on the landing algorithms with terrain recognition and it seemed to have worked exceptionally well.Looking forward for the next landing in May of the Chinese rover and all the science these robots will produce. Also, the test of Ingenuity, the helicopter, will be very interesting to watch, that could really pave the way for a different exploration style in the future.And finally, maybe the next transfer window will already see some Starships, that would really change everything."</p>

They are already used to spotty Internet, so Starlink is a massive improvement even if it&#39;s spotty (which it hasn&#39;t been, according to these users)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was at PowerBI in Microsoft, all the execs hailed it as Startup within Microsoft. Come work here instead of Uber. I worked like a dog, sometimes till 2am in morning. My manager would routinely ask us to come on weekends. I was naive, I thought we are growing customer base, this is what a startup looks like.The ultimate realization was in a startup you have equity, a decent amount in a good startup. At Microsoft it was a base salary and set amount of stock. What we did moved very little of the top revenue metric. It made little difference if I worked like a dog, or slacked. The promos were very much “buddy buddy” system.In the end I realized you can’t have startups in big companies (esp as an engineer you don’t have the huge upside  if the startup is successful, your upside is capped)Startups work because you have skin in the game, when you build something people want, you get to reap rewards proportional to it. That correlation and feedback loop is very important.At big companies you don’t have the the same correlation. Some big shot exec they hired reaps far far more on the work you did.Equity is what builds wealth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean, sure, but it also misses the point a bit. &#34;Startup in a big company&#34; doesn&#39;t mean &#34;yo take some cashdollar and try build and release something to the public&#34;, but it does mean &#34;hey, take a small team and do your own thing with less oversight and process overhead from higher-ups&#34;.The team I worked in at AWS was like this and it felt a lot like startup teams I&#39;ve worked with. That didn&#39;t mean we could take &#39;brand and legal risk&#39;, and if that&#39;s what you want then definitely go and start your own thing.If you want more autonomy and higher velocity than is normal at corporates, then a &#39;startup within a big company&#39; might actually work out for you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure why everyone seems so focused on the cafeteria thing. I&#39;m not sure people and their attitudes towards amenities are really the problem here.From my understanding, the differerence is the companywide attitude to risk. A startup has a &#34;grow at any cost, or maybe perish&#34; attitude. If things go south, bankruptcy will take care of the leftover excess risk (barring criminal charges). A bigco cannot easily go bankrupt, even less a single department. There are tons and tons of capital to eat through if the accumulated risk is realized in cost. So a bigco has to do something about that risk somehow, because most of the company wants to keep what capital it has, only a small part of it really wants to risk things. So the only means to have a situation where you don&#39;t risk bigco for a single department is not making it a department. Make it a Ltd. in a holding or something."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good riddance, in my opinion. 40 million copies of a thick catalog with glossy pages means a couple shittons of not just trees but petroleum and petrochemicals for production, distribution, and disposal. Every year! And ten years ago, it was nearly 200. https://archive.is/rHAhGCan you even imagine a stack of one million catalogs?That&#39;s space, trees, plants, mammals, birds, insects, mushrooms, ... all being squeezed for a glossy catalog, most of which will get thumbed through once or twice and sent to the landfill to rot.These catalogs do not biodegrade well, by the way, because they&#39;re not just paper.I love paper books, and I enjoyed browsing this catalog just like many others in this thread, and yet I don&#39;t think I will miss this one. Hopefully, other thick glossy catalogs will follow suit.Production of catalogs like this squeezes our biome, and if we don&#39;t turn back, it will pop, and we&#39;ll be left with only enough resources for a small fraction of us to survive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am genuinely upset about this. I have such fond memories of thumbing through endlessly as a teenager and dreaming of having my own spaces that were so wonderfully busy and eclectic. My wife and I were just at IKEA last week picking up a new bed for our growing toddler, I glanced at the catalogs as we passed and decided against picking one up. I hope I can still get my hands on a couple old copies to keep on my bookshelf.Edit: Just placed an order for the specific catalog year I have so many memories of reading. One of my sillier purchases, but it feels like a piece of personal history."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat unrelated IKEA has been brought to it&#39;s knees during the pandemic and it has made their online ordering completely useless.  For a company shifting focus to online only I would think they would want to be able to ship some things purchased online.Stock is also low in the Portland store, but even the few items available can&#39;t be purchased online and shipped to me. I&#39;ve tried to order a number of things recently and they won&#39;t ship anything to my house."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would normally be appalled by such an action, but the supply issues for RTX 30x0 cards are beyond ridiculous. Mining trashes the environment and, for the majority of crypto assets/volumes, does not provide genuinely valuable economic activity besides speculation (I say that as someone who has put thousands of dollars into crypto in the past). Why should people who want to try some ML/DL at home (maybe they even need it for a class they&#39;re taking), and might also want to play the occasional game, have to pay an arm and a leg to get their (remaining) hands on a modern, efficient card?I really wish Nvidia would do this across the RTX product line.Edit: the &#34;Syrian refugee crossing into Europe&#34; trope might pop up as a counter-argument for crypto. I am Syrian and still have relatives there. Refugees&#39; assets are a drop in the ocean of speculators&#39; mining and HODLing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like it&#39;s time to crack some NVIDIA drivers. I already do it for the video encoding limitations, why not this too? Miners are willing to go to some really hacky extremes, reflashing firmwares, custom fan mods, extreme overclock configurations, etc to maximize hashrates and certainly won&#39;t care if they have to jump through some hoops to patch a specific version of the Linux driver or enable unsigned drivers on Windows, as long as they make more profit.Good luck with this one NVIDIA but you&#39;re playing a losing game. As soon as one un-restricted version of the driver exists, this is as good as useless and demand will be the same as ever for these cards unless they&#39;re able to ship CMP cards at a very high rate, but my understanding is the restriction here is silicon.Let&#39;s not forget that last time they produced &#34;mining only&#34; cards, people managed to crack the drivers to render graphics too... this is no exception.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY4s35uULg4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Gamers hate miners, they&#39;re driving the price up, make hardware impossible to get ect ... It&#39;s a really problematic situation. Almost 6 month after launching new graphic cards from AMD / NVIDIA good luck gettting an RTX 30xx or 6800.On a side note all those virtual currency are just plain wrong on the environment side, it does not make any sense in 2021 to have a currency that need heavy computation thus increasing power consumption. When people designed those currency they def did not think about that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A key part of this legislation is the requirements for tech companies to provide selected news organisations with advance notice about changes to ranking algorithms. This has been generally overlooked in the reporting and discussion but I believe it is the actually the most important part of the legislation. It will give the selected news organisations an enormous advantage over other companies not included and protect them from new competitors, basically entrenching the current media landscape for the foreseeable future.Given the current Australian government&#39;s cosy relationship with a particular media company that currently dominates the media landscape here, I don&#39;t think it is coincidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in Australia and while I&#39;m excited to see less Facebook use, I see a lot of comments saying things like, &#34;good, Facebook monetized an addiction model and this curbs that&#34;. While true, the proposed law that has pushed them to do this is incredibly dangerous. The law doesn&#39;t just apply to Facebook, it applies to whoever the Treasurer of Australia[0] says it applies to - it isn&#39;t metrics/rules based: https://i.imgur.com/7RSqXDJ.pngThis means you as a business owner may wake up one day to find that you are now classified as a designated digital platform corporation and are on the hook to now negotiate contracts with every registered news business corporation, AND provide each of them with the secret sauce behind your ranking algos. The only thing that needs to be done to do this is for the Treasurer to file a decision in the Federal Register of Legislation[1]. It&#39;s a shocking amount of overreach, lack of visibility to the process, and a single point of failure in the system.Overall I&#39;m very curious to see how this plays out. Facebook took the nuclear option here, and I highly suspect that news corporations will feel quite a sting from the loss of traffic / platform. I truly feel like Facebook &#34;winning&#34; here and having the law dropped is the lesser of two evils.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasurer_of_Australia[1] https://www.legislation.gov.au/Browse/Results/ByRegDate/Legi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can certainly see a lot of parallels with Oculus / Facebook.Perhaps unusually, I actually wanted FB to impress itself more strongly on Oculus post acquisition because, frankly, Oculus was a bit of a mess.  Instead, Oculus was given an enormous amount of freedom for many years.Personally, nobody ever told me what to do, even though I was willing to &#34;shut up and soldier&#34; if necessary -- they bought that capability! Conversely, I couldn&#39;t tell anyone what to do from my position; the important shots were always called when I wasn&#39;t around. Some of that was on me for not being willing to relocate to HQ, but a lot of it was built into early Oculus DNA.I could only lead by example and argument, and the arguments only took on weight after years of evidence accumulated.  I could have taken a more traditional management position, but I would have hated it, so that&#39;s also on me.  The political dynamics never quite aligned with an optimal set of leadership personalities and beliefs where I would have had the best leverage, but there was progress, and I am reasonably happy and effective as a part time consultant today, seven years later.Talking about &#34;entitled workers&#34; almost certainly derails the conversation.  Perhaps a less charged framing that still captures some of the matter is the mixing of people who Really Care about their work with the Just A Job crowd.  The wealth of the mega corps does allow most goals to be accomplished, at great expense, with Just A Job workers, but people that have experienced being embedded with Really Care workers are going to be appalled at the relative effectiveness.The communication culture does tend a bit passive-aggressive for my taste, but I can see why it evolves that way in large organizations.  I&#39;ve only been officially dinged by HR once for insensitive language in a post, but a few people have reached out privately with some gentle suggestions about better communication.All in all, not a perfect fairy tale outcome, but I still consider taking the acquisition offer as the correct thing for the company in hindsight."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"9 years @ Google, and I too came from a company acquired by Google. (In my case, Google did not keep our product or tech stack around, so.) And yes, I can say many Googlers are entitled. It&#39;s a fair descriptor. And the pace of work is slower than a startup. In general.And I too have many criticisms of Google. But.Google has entirely different revenue constraints. It can afford an entirely different way of working. That pace allows a more sustainable cadence of development. It can be a more humane place to work, in general.Google can on the whole accomplish its revenue goals without being a meat grinder. So why be one? I think there is a bit of a problem with this guy&#39;s POV where he&#39;s come to fetishize the actual process of the making of the sausage versus the sausage itself.Projects need not be run under insane stress if there&#39;s a steady supply of talent and money to make things happen. Google can afford that. Pace will be slower. Perhaps less competitive. But the core business continues to do excellently.For many of us Google is not an &#34;exciting&#34; place to work. But it&#39;s a pretty good job to have and it pays well and gives access to both great benefits and to interesting technology. And that compensation in _most_ people does yield a sense of responsibility for delivery. But maybe not the survival-of-the-fittest-meat-grinder panic that this guy somehow seems to love."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While he has valid points of how corp life is different from startup, he seems like a horrible, entitled person to work for.General attitude that comes out of it to me, is that your employees growth doesn’t matter, only his vision of product matters. He complains about people being entitled, and at the same time he complains that as CEO of subsidiary of one of the biggest company in the world, he cannot say offensive things in his talks.And most entitled one - he’s sold his company (that he actually didn’t own, from the beginning, like with most startups) and he cannot control it fully anymore? And complaining that he cannot fire people on the spot?He should check his entitlement before complaining about other being entitled by not wanting to put his product vision above their wellbeing."</p>

Microsoft had to pay big because they didn&#39;t asked their users properly for alternative browsers, yet Apple doesn&#39;t even give other browsers a fair chance to compete on iOS.Consumers suffer because Apple controls about 50% of the mobile market and if Apple decides a certain feature will not be available in Safari (e.g. Push API), no other browser vendor can even offer a solution.Sounds to me like totally abusing their market position to uphold their anti-competitive behavior."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can hardly wait to use Amazon App Store to install Amazon and then open up the Epic Game Store to install random game and then open up EA Game Store to install random game and then open up Facebook App Store to install Facebook and then open up the Apple App Store to install the Blizzard App Store to install Hearthstone and then go back to the Apple App Store and update the Blizzard App Store so I can get the latest Hearthstone updates.Going to be super fun!My gaming computer is already filled with like 8 different app stores each completely different then the other and a variety of privacy/security issues on each. All of them need their App Store running in order to play their games, so half the time my computer has 4-5 App Stores running in the background so I can play a single game. And they are all electron/qt webkit apps cause nobody builds apps anymore so each one consumes about 500mb of ram.And each App Store also has their own chat system along with the others like discord.I don&#39;t agree that Apple should have a complete monopoly, but the alternative is not better. And while Android does have the main Google Play Store, and there isn&#39;t to many &#34;alternative&#34; App Stores at the moment. Just give it time, the same thing that is happening to TV Streaming/Game App Stores will happen on Android."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As usual, context matters. If you&#39;re trying to convey complex thoughts about abstract matters, then language is the way to do it. If you are trying to convey deep emotional states, then a photo or video is probably better. You cannot convert the 1st amendment into photos, and you cannot convert the Mona Lisa smile into words.Just try to use words to describe either of these photos and see how they fall short:https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-10/19/1...https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-10/19/1...Between recorded voice and written text, I personally prefer written language. I like the ability to consume at my own pace, go back and re-read tricky bits, and easily search or quote. Plus it&#39;s much easier to use TTS to convert text to speech than the other way around (at the moment). Maybe someday technology will remove this boundary but currently that&#39;s my stance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The question is whether these advantages are because text is a better communication medium, or because of the limitations of our technology?Take using a computer to type a word versus draw a picture: Effectively everyone who uses a computer can type a word, but I&#39;d bet less than 10% could draw a circle.But put a piece of paper in front of someone and effectively everyone can draw a circle.This points to there being a limitation in the technology for working with other forms of media, not the effectiveness of the communication medium itself.This isn&#39;t to say that text isn&#39;t also a better communication medium, but it is to say, until the technology has improved for communicating with other media, it&#39;s difficult to compare without basing the decision on the limitations of the technology.In other words, most of the perceived advantages of text are really advantages of text being easier to represent digitally (or generally reproduced, e.g., printing press), not advantages of text as a communication medium itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Text is not the oldest - nor easiest to use -, text is a heavy abstraction born somewhat recently in human history.The oldest and easiest is the visual in 3D, then comes the visual in 2D.Those exist since we have eyes.Our brain have dedicated and sizeable infrastructure for that. Children can communicate in 3D (gestures, posture, expressions, objects) and in 2D drawings before learning textural communication with great effort.Text is more regular and reliable in certain contexts (not always, sometimes a pictogram or others are better), when the circumstances are proper for that.Text has its uses, just like all the other forms, not being paramount, not at all!(I&#39;d also argue about that we could read old texts. Sometimes yes, but sometimes we cannot read present ones neither if the cultural and knowledge background is inadequate. Which is just aggravated by the ages)"</p>

				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26174269">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Imagine having a business model so fragile that your only line of  defense is to obscure the cancellation process through these tactics. Do they really think that they can curve their churn this way?I mean best you’re doing is getting maybe another month or so of revenue from a customer who is just pushing the pain of cancelling because they are busy or lazy.And at the end instead of getting what could be a dormant customer who can sign up later again, what you get is someone who hates your company.What an incredibly stupid way to erode the brand of a publication, whose major asset to survive is precisely its brand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just cancelled and it was relatively painless, to their credit.When they asked the reason, I said that political coverage was unfair. Left is OK, unfair is not.I don&#39;t consider myself &#34;on the left&#34; but I really don&#39;t mind a publication being left of center or right of center. If it&#39;s good, I will pay for it (I subscribed tp The Atlantic at least twice, and the New Yorker once, and probably others in a mix of print and digital).But the NYT has drifted too far down the path of politically-correct fashions, and away from robust debate and discussion of challenging topics and how they intersect with real events.It feels more like they want to persuade me to hold a set of opinions (which shifts rapidly), rather than informing me and letting me form my own. &#34;Persuade&#34; is even the wrong word; more like &#34;pressure&#34; or &#34;coerce&#34;. If it&#39;s all ads, so be it; but when I pay, I expect that I am the customer and not the product. So I don&#39;t pay as of the end of my billing cycle.Also, the NYT cheers on, and even participates in bullying. Scott Alexander being a recent example, but there are a lot more when it comes to politically-charged topics.I should reiterate that this is not a right-left thing. I would have remained subscribed if the NYT had simply drifted left, and concerned itself mainly with arguments betweed various left-of-center factions. Lots of worthwhile things to discuss and debate there, and lots of events to tie it to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a similar issue with the Wall Street Journal a few years back, and despite having spent the majority of my career working on Wall Street, I’ll never buy a subscription again.I signed up for a really good deal for 6 months of digital + paper delivery, but my paper always arrived a day or two late, so before my 6 months were up I tried to cancel, but couldn’t figure out a way to do so on their website. I messaged support asking them to not renew my subscription, and told them that the paper always arrived late. They responded back that they were going to give me a free subscription until they could figure out the paper delivery. I should have held firm and cancelled, but it seemed lke they were trying to provide good customer service.Nothing changed with delivery, and I followed up a few times to see what was going on. I was told they were looking into it.One day, out of the blue, I received a large bill from them. I called to see what was going on and I was told that my trial was up and since I hadn’t cancelled that it had renewed. A proceeded to tell the about my problems with delivery and that customer service was supposedly working on fixing the problem and not charging me until they could. The person on the phone told me that that’s not possible since they don’t provide same-day delivery to my address. I recounted exactly what had happened, and they basically told me I was a liar, and would not refund the charge because the user agreement says they don’t have to, even though I called within a few hours of the new charge and subscription renewal.The part that really stung was that I was a PhD student and could get an entire year for less than what they charged me for a month. I’ve never had a company treat me so poorly before."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am sorry about the position you&#39;re in. For the last several years I have been balancing taking care of my terminally ill wife who recently passed away, all while working remotely in the web hosting industry. It&#39;s hard to balance. Harder than you think. Setting boundaries will be vital to being successful in any WFH role.Now that that&#39;s out of the way: You need to focus. You&#39;ve described your abilities and that&#39;s fine, but you lack focus. Your qualifications are great, but your presentation is all over the place. You need a single one page resume that focuses on one aspect of your knowledge and experience, and lightly mentions the others. Make multiple resumes, each with a focus on one thing. Use the resume that&#39;s best for the job. I recently saw somebody who must have had 20 different resumes to match the jobs they were applying for. It worked.Also, you might consider looking into the Web Hosting business. If your temperament is as you describe, and you like talking on the phone or live chat, most web hosts will overlook any technical gaps. Those can be taught. In fact that can lend to your focus! Focus on the fact that you know things that can&#39;t be taught: Customer Service, talking down angry customers, talented writing, friendly and always willing to find a solution under dire circumstances. Those are GOLD. Once those are on the table, the rest is negotiable. I&#39;ll email you a link to at least one that is hiring full remote entry level.Additionally, you need to step up your confidence level. Let an employer know that your family is important to you and that you&#39;re dedicated to working hard so that you can support them- and leave it at that. They don&#39;t deserve the other details, and they aren&#39;t relevant.I hope this helps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey anon, I feel for you, and most of the answers here are giving you a 12-month plan when you need a 1-month plan.If you know Linux well enough to configure Wordpress, how about tech support for a hosting company?  Try making some short email approaches to old-school hosting companies (I used to run one).  They might be flexible enough to take a chance depending on how confident your approach is.They have lots of customers bashing away at Linux, making mistakes, often without the patience to see their own problems through.  Their business problem is that these customers need hand-holding but only pay a fixed, monthly fee.  (the hope is eventually they stop asking and keep paying for years).The combination you can offer those companies could be basic Linux knowledge (no need for advanced cloud stuff) and whatever flexibility you can offer them - especially if they&#39;re not in your time zone.The larger ones might be a tall order, all listing locations by default (Gandi, Leaseweb, GoDaddy, Hetzner etc.), but maybe someone here will have an inside track.I agree with other posters - never mention difficult circumstances in a job application, particularly a cold application.  Just talk about how keen you are to solve their difficult customers&#39; problems, how well you work in a team, and keep the initial approach brief.Good luck! And please update us if you can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just an anecdote for you- in 2009, I wanted to drop out of college because I preferred partying. I obviously needed income and was dissatisfied with the jobs I’d had in the past (fast food, waiting tables and hotel customer service). Like you, I had always been a tech “nerd” and had built websites and recycled computers for my church/charities in the past. One day I came across a job post for a small SEO firm that was looking for a “web developer” aka clicking around Wordpress, writing some CSS, and writing SEO content. It paid $11/hr. I sent an email and he agreed to interview me. I must’ve charmed him because he agreed to give me a 90 day trial. It worked out and I worked for him for about 2 years before a recruiter found me and got me a job at a “real” software company on a team of 15 engineers. After a couple years there, I founded my own SaaS side business (which went viral on HN circa 2014). It grew to become much, much more than a side business and was eventually acquired by a PE firm.I just wanted to say to keep your head up, remain persistent, keep learning and stay curious. It can be done and hard work (usually) pays off.Stay flexible - even if a job doesn’t seem super relevant to your core interests you never know when it’ll come in handy later. For example, my experience in fast food gave me great insights into POS systems (which I ended up building) and my time working at a luxury boutique hotel taught me how to provide excellent customer service even in difficult situations (one time I didn’t call a customer’s room at the request wake up call time and he missed his flight- eek).Best of luck to you!Ps- just sent you an email"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I previously submitted this story a few days ago[1], where it garnered some discussion and a bit over 100 upvotes, but never made the front-page due to some down-weights in HN&#39;s algorithm. I&#39;m reposting this story at Daniel&#39;s suggestion. He agreed it deserved a second chance to break out.--I noticed that it&#39;s commonly accepted that Bloomberg&#39;s 2018 stories on the Supermicro hack were bogus, costing them a huge amount of reputational damage. However, Bloomberg stood by the stories. I&#39;m very curious to see how this one will be received. I was never quite convinced by the naysayers or the denials by the government, Apple, or Amazon. I think it&#39;s quite likely that Bloomberg will be proven right in the end, this story having been accurate but suppressed for &#34;secrecy&#34; reasons all along.Notably, one of the criticisms at the time was that Bloomberg didn&#39;t name credible sources with first-hand accounts of the events — understandably given the sensitivity. This time, it seems they have been able to do so.Either way, I&#39;m thrilled to see an outlet do original reporting and stand by their work in the face of universal condemnation. We are better off for having strong dissenting views informing us and expanding the narrative. I&#39;m finding myself increasingly distrustful of the work of journalism outlets, but this (and those gone independent on Substack) gives me hope.[1]: Previous discussion here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26112436"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its weird to see a follow-up to this that doesn&#39;t even begin to acknowledge the broad skepticism of claims except for saying that the previous push-back from the alleged targets was a drop in the bucket.I don&#39;t doubt there are highly-targeted supply chain attacks that happen at the whims of state level actors but the specifics presented by this and its previous reporting still are difficult at best to believe with the reporting as it is presented."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;They shared one other trait; U.S. spymasters discovered the manipulations but kept them largely secret as they tried to counter each one and learn more about China’s capabilities.Putting aside the concerns with the believability of this particular Bloomberg article... how many legitimate security holes are ignored in software purely on the basis of &#34;the NSA figures it&#39;s NOBUS (nobody knows but us) and it&#39;d be good to use it on China?&#34; I&#39;m personally convinced that the spymasters are more worried about keeping a good stock of security holes in reserve instead of actually securing infrastructure."</p>

I&#39;ll have to play with it more, but I was set up in mere minutes and it works at extremely low latency.The fact that this does bidirectional audio is icing on the cake; can&#39;t wait to share this with some quarantined bands.Magic, well done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll chime in with the same intense positivity. In the early days of the quarantine I set up a &#34;walk in theater&#34; on my property where I wanted friends to be able to watch the film without bothering my neighbors with a massive stereo system. The natural option was headphones and I chose between setting up an FM transmitter and trying to get everyone to buy a walkman... or... trying to come up with a network streaming solution. I found the open source implementation of VBAN and tried to write a python script to launch the server and manage finding new connections. It failed absolutely miserably and I ended up setting up an amplified audio system in the rain, much to the trouble of my neighbors also.Needless to say, I love this.

That works fine for Spotify, but there’s instances (watching videos while walking in and out of the office) where the latency is a problem.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax.I had a similar realization during grad school about a lot of the popular topics at the time (early 2000s). I even used to call them &#34;the hoaxes of computer science&#34;. Things like grid computing or formal methods of software engineering had a lot of resources behind them, but nobody was able to use the results. Instead, very different formats of these ideas are what took root: cloud computing and advanced type systems.&gt; the low end eats the high end: that it&#39;s good to be the &#34;entry level&#34; option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you&#39;re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling.I wish every grad student had been forced to memorize this statement. Build something useable, not clever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This comment really resonated with me, I found myself in this exact situation at 25, in a &#34;very prestigious and selective place&#34; for AI nonetheless. It took me a couple years to realize the smart people are just playing the game, the unsuspecting losers are &#34;playing it straight&#34; and getting endlessly frustrated. I found my balance by, frankly, taking advantage of a system that is FUBAR. Incidentally, I also took some art classes and because they were not for credit, I just flowed and drew ( https://lingxiaolingdotus.firebaseapp.com/art ). Tbh I felt more alive placing some hasty marks on paper than I ever did doing &#34;research&#34; in a lab.&#34;I&#39;m only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn&#39;t require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn&#39;t require the students to learn anything.&#34;"</p>

It was always &#34;our most engaged players readily spend on in-game items&#34;, and never &#34;the most addicted users spend money so they can continue playing&#34;It was a great workplace, but I don&#39;t think it was adding much value to the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d add that algorithmic feeds are another part of the triad (quartet?), and probably the worst offender. Personalized addictive content is on the rise (tiktok, YouTube, even Facebook and Twitter curate your newsfeed &#34;for you&#34; ), and these ml-determined feeds drive engagement to the highest possible levels, leading to an incredible waste of time, a distorted world view (mostly the posts with the highest engagement will be those that call for outrage, which leads to radicalization [1]), and just in general a society where our information consumption is determined by black boxes with opaque goals that do not optimize for the common good.I attribute a significant part of the political rift and radicalization that has occurred in the western world in the past few years to specifically this feature, the algorithmically determined, engagement maximizing, feed.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00550-7"</p>

I&#39;ve been trying to break away from Facebook for a while, and recently (the past year or so) I started realizing that my Facebook feed always shows me the exact same posts in the exact same order for days, to the point where I know exactly what post will be first when I open the website.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazon has a problem with fake reviews and it seems they are ok with it.I bought a replacement screen from Amazon and it wasn’t working properly. I thought I did something wrong so I contacted the seller/manufacturer and they told: oh yeah, it‘s defective, we‘ll just give you your money back. I agreed and then the person said „cool, now in order to process your request, please click these buttons on Amazon” and they sent me a screenshot showing how to leave a 5 star review. wtf.I refused and asked them to process the refund. First they said they can’t process the refund technically without me pressing those buttons and then that their job depends on it.I requested a refund through Amazon and tried leaving a 1-star review saying that the product was defective and the seller tried to condition me into giving them a 5 star review. This review was not accepted by Amazon, saying that seller feedback should be given on the seller page.  This does make sense if you have multiple sellers selling the same product, but it was not the case here. These guys were the only ones producing and selling it and if the score of 5-star reviews is from people being coerced to leave a review, then it should be there, not on the seller page where it’s very easily buried.In the end I also contacted Amazon support with screenshots and I had to explain the problem 3 times as the customer representative said they didn’t understand what more can they do since I already received my refund. I’m the end, they said “they forwarded the message to the proper department, have a nice day”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon loves fake reviews as long as they are 5 star. The more it looks like people buying stuff using amazon are happy, the better that marketing is for Amazon. Look at all these people who are so happy to be buying stuff on Amazon, so much better than the alternatives.Amazon could clean this up and then watch the average drop. From the removal of the fake fives but also it makes it look more &#34;socially accpetable&#34; to leave 4 and 3 star reviews. So it costs Amazon to do the right thing by the people parting with money for stuff so they don&#39;t.Amazon are well aware of /their/ incentives and when their incentives align with what looks to me a lot like fraud they&#39;ll play the plausibly deny game.Or perhaps I&#39;m wrong they don&#39;t know and there&#39;s nothing they can do. Amazon employees will probably confirm that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like the fake reviews are merely the tip of the iceberg.Over the last 5-10 years, Amazon&#39;s main shopping website seems to have gone from a reasonably reputable location to an internet cesspool to rival ebay or craigslist.For example, looking for an item one is presented with a wide variety of almost identical products from a wide variety of almost identical, completely unknown brands, with no trust or confidence in any of them.Now obviously, these brands/products are most likely nothing to do with Amazon, they&#39;re just using Amazon as their storefront, and sometimes fulfilment, but it still reflects upon Amazon, and ultimately taints their brand with the same brush.Maybe Amazon makes more money in this way, by taking a cut of this flow through various service fees, but for me it makes Amazon less useful to go to when I don&#39;t know exactly what I want already, and more often pushes me to go direct to a more trusted source."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven&#39;t tried SQLite, please do. For years I ignored SQLite and used MySQL (it does the job) but once you see how fast SQLite is, and advantages of having a DB contained in a single file... just go play around with SQLite instead of ignoring it for years like me. It&#39;s neat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting consequence of this characteristic of SQLite is that it makes it a really good fit for GraphQL.GraphQL has the N+1 queries problem pretty much baked into it. You can work around it to a certain extent with a lot of effort implementing data loader patterns, but someone will still likely be able to cow up with a query that triggers a cascade of SELECTs.Or, because &#34;many small queries are  efficient in SQLite&#34;, you could use that instead.I built a Datasette plugin that exposes a GraphQL API to an existing SQLite database and it works so well that I switched from being a GraphQL skeptic to a GraphQL advocate.https://simonwillison.net/2020/Aug/7/datasette-graphql/Here&#39;s an example nested GraphQL query that executes 32 select queries. It&#39;s pretty snappy: https://datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io/graphql?query=%7..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Appropriate Uses For SQLite page says that dynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL statements each. This has provoked criticism from readers. Examples:&gt; &#34;200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page&#34;&gt; &#34;For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much.&#34;&gt; &#34;[This is] bad design&#34;Funnily enough, at a recent workplace the guideline was &#34;if it only does 200 queries, you&#39;ve optimized it enough&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder how difficult it would be to implement a language for specifying Factorio factories without worrying about physical layouts. This post provides a lot of good insights into how that could be done. Once a factory is specified, a compiler could turn the high-level specification into a blueprint or a valid save file to be loaded up in the game.Of course, the compiler would have no way to lay out the factory with respect to available resource deposits. Maybe that would have to be part of the specification as well? Or maybe the programmer (player?) could pass an empty map file as a compiler argument.Also, this doesn&#39;t give any consideration to the tech tree or enemies within the game. I guess those could be compiler flags, as long as we&#39;re dreaming.Look, all I&#39;m saying is that it would be really cool to be able to check factories into version control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can definitely see the point the author is trying to make, and I agree that it naturally lends itself to a functional model of how the game works.On the other hand, and this is speaking as someone who has played the game for an embarrassing number of hours all the way into endgame &#34;megabase&#34; territory: my mental abstraction of the game isn&#39;t really functional. It&#39;s directed graphs. Sure, the two views can be equivalent representations, but I find thinking about the game as a directed graph (and reasoning about throughputs in a graph representing a network) to be the perspective that gives actionable insights most readily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Factorio is a genre-defining game, and I think the number of clones is a testament to that.Factorio is often compared to programming, but it&#39;s closer to Excel where the logic and the output live in the same space. The game does a great job letting the user build with programming-like constructs without them ever having to understand any theory."</p>

It&#39;s very hard to stop even in a two-person household, because so many of the &#34;products&#34; most people in the Western world are used to buying and using since an early age are violators. I am blessed with being quite sensitive to most of them, so it&#39;s an endless struggle with partners and cohabitants.Basically anything bought new has it: furniture, clothes, cars, anything plastic, dyed, glued, particleboard.&#34;Cleaning&#34; products: sprays, detergents, most &#34;soaps&#34;, shampoos, creams, conditioners, have this type of crap in them.Even most stuff which claims to be &#34;eco-friendly&#34; is bullshit, and has all the same crap in it if you look at the ingredients.And it feels like online there is a whole army of &#34;rational scientific defenders&#34; ready to jump into action anytime I mention it. It feels like there is a whole playbook for discrediting this type of comment, and calling into question how &#34;scientific&#34; it is, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Keep in mind this is a meta-analysis using data published in papers that are up to 30 years old and from overseas including China, then applying it to California&#39;s carcinogen list (prop 65) and California commute times.I am sure a followup study will be done to see if this is actually a problem in the USA in 2021.The article is published here (Open access) : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041202...Edit: I found this news article from 2003 discussing the issue of carcinogenic new car smells and how manufacturers were trying to eliminate the the dangerous smells while simulating what consumers expect a new car should smell like:https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15133792/new-car-smel..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So here&#39;s what I&#39;d love if other people here could help me understand.Sensitivity to VOC&#39;s is extremely dependent on the person. My father, for example, had the carpet redone cheaply in his office, and worked there happily 8 hrs/day without smelling anything and without any ill effects.For me, on the other hand, the smell was noxious but bearable, but I&#39;d start to feel lightheaded after about 15 minutes in there. My brother would get a terrible headache after just 5 minutes. (And this is us as adults, same size as him.)Memory foam (e.g. in a pillow) also affects me, even after it&#39;s offgassed for weeks. I don&#39;t smell a thing, but it gives me a burning sore throat after I&#39;m close to it for a couple of hours. But again, zero effect on my dad.And so my big question is: I&#39;m well aware that people have drastically different responses to VOC&#39;s. But does that mean VOC&#39;s harm people differently too, or are we all harmed the same?In other words, does my dad have some kind of &#34;protective&#34; genes where the VOC&#39;s don&#39;t bother him because they harm him less, so he doesn&#39;t avoid them? Or are my brother and I better off because we&#39;re super-sensitive to them, so we escape the harm he might be suffering?It seems like such an urgent public health problem, especially given how many people use memory foam mattresses and pillows. It just boggles my mind that I get a sore throat after just a couple of hours with one, while other people sleep peacefully all night."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What went wrong is that the Texas legislature which owns Texas-specific grid process to avoid interference from the Feds didn&#39;t figure out how to also ensure Texas generator companies got compensated for weatherizing (and ensuring it was done).How many of the 24+6 recommendations from the NERC/FERC review of last time this happened in Texas (hint:2011) were taken up by the legislature or those at ERCOT they delegated responsibility to or the power generation providers?https://www.nerc.com/pa/rrm/ea/ColdWeatherTrainingMaterials/...The eye opener to me from skimming the 2011 recommendations is that there was no explicit rating/SLA for a power plant&#39;s acceptable temperature operating that could be used by planners for assessing the risks of an upcoming weather event by policy planners. It&#39;d seem pretty basic to be able to ask &#34;How many plants do we lose when temperature drops below X&#34;? 
 Dunno whether they fixed trying to create such a basic measurement for Texas plants, but it doesn&#39;t seem like it.If you want to know some of the specifics about what &#34;winterization&#34; means in practice for a power plant including natural gas ones, you can read some of the details in that report.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love this. I started laughing when I read the description. I laughed because a Harvard physicist (funded by people like Bill Gates) had the same idea to use cooling towers for their DAC project in Carbon Engineering (linked in your post). But as you say, it is still expensive. They are bragging that their design took hundred of man years!And then you two guys come in with the idea that in hindsight seems completely obvious, use all the cooling towers already out there! The most start up thing ever.I used to be an engineer at an ammonia plant. Many of them already capture and sell CO2 from their process. So they have the infrastructure to compress and sell CO2 already on site. The plant I worked at was in Augusta, GA. Might be worth checking out ammonia plants as a growth market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huh, smart idea to piggyback off existing infrastructure. Have you contacted Stripe Climate? They are directing money from stripe businesses to fund carbon removal, and they just put out a call for new companies to contact them.Believe I saw it within past 7-10 days on Patrick Collison’s twitter. Here’s the link. Has details and an application: https://mobile.twitter.com/orbuch/status/1359926307149148162Btw for anyone with a business using stripe: stripe climate is now open for anyone worldwide. I set it up to contribute 1% of my revenues. And it should be deductible as a marketing expense: Stripe let’s you out it on your checkout, invoice and receipt. The founder of Nomadlist found it increased his conversions. Haven’t tested it personally but plausibly it’s actually profit generating.Probably the most impactful climate decision you can make with your business, takes 30 seconds to set up, and may boost your revenue.https://stripe.com/climate"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re not injecting the CO2 underground in a stable form, how does this reverse climate change? It sounds like it&#39;s simply a cheaper option in some circumstances for sourcing CO2 from the air (compared to traditional solutions by Airgas). Not to take away from your efforts! I think this is a fine improvement to CO2 process needs if you can replace more expensive air extraction techniques, but it doesn&#39;t contribute to improving climate change without sequestering the harvested atmospheric CO2."</p>

It&#39;s like Google Product Search that is actually successful and widely used for searching for specific products, or Amazon that doesn&#39;t swindle you left and right.It&#39;s basically just a large catalog of products, filled by third-parties a-la Amazon now, only it didn&#39;t sell anything itself (until recently). Instead, it had detailed characteristics for a lot of products, with corresponding filters in the catalog; and good user reviews. Since Yandex is good at dealing with unstructured text, even poor data exports by vendors end up organized decently on the service. Since Yandex had millions of users on its other services, they all could leave reviews without much hassle. And since Yandex is primarily a search engine, it knows when a bogus review is spammed across the web.Alas, it&#39;s only available in Russian since it works with Russian shops. Every time I need to look for a product on the English web, I lament that there&#39;s no service that is quite that solid. Amazon has filters, but search results usually look like simply a bit better Aliexpress.

Compared to ZigBee or Z-Wave it&#39;s wired and the config is stored in the devices themselves, so there&#39;s no single point of failure. It has strict certification requirements so you can be guaranteed that products from different manufacturers will work together (this does mean its more expensive though). The quality of the hardware (esp. motion/presence sensors) is a lot better than what you can buy from Amazon or the &#39;smart home&#39; section in your local Walmart.There&#39;s plenty of content (in German) on YouTube about it, and forums:https://m.youtube.com/channel/UCiCPbFz0Ld6mera2fNDRWzwhttps://knx-user-forum.de/"</p>

Yandex&#39;s primary business is search and advertising, but just like Google, they diversify a lot. And even in primary area, they sometimes manage to beat Google. Yandex&#39;s reverse image search (when you upload the image to search for similar ones) is FAR superior to Google&#39;s.And there&#39;s a lot of unique Russian content on global sites like Facebook, Livejournal (owned by a Russian company nowadays) or Wikipedia."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve found my experience designing gearboxes for Boeing has applicability to software design. For example, the fundamental idea with airplane design is not to design components that cannot fail, as that is impossible. The idea is to design the system to be tolerant of failure. Every part in the system is not &#34;how can we make this part never fail&#34; but &#34;assume it failed. How does the airplane survive?&#34;This is a fundamental shift in viewpoint.It seems pretty well established that making secure software is impossible. Time to pivot to designing software systems that are tolerant of inevitable security breaches.One example of this is compartmentalization. A single breach must not have access to all the sensitive data. Another is backups must be air gapped (or put on physically read-only media) so ransomware cannot compromise them.Compartmentalization is used in battleship design, aircraft design, spy networks, etc. Time to use it in software systems design.P.S. Just to be clear, one still strives to design airplane parts so they won&#39;t fail, it&#39;s just that one does not rely on them never failing.P.P.S. It&#39;s really really hard to sink a battleship as they are so compartmentalized. See the sinking of the Bismarck and the Yamato."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Largest impact, sure. But architecturally it was a relatively simple formula - compromise a widely used package and sleep on it until it was pervasive enough to be a valuable hack. I disagree with this being the most sophisticated though. Unless I&#39;m missing something about this hack, the Stuxnet[1] architecture, complexity, and long term planning feel far more sophisticated than the SolarWinds hack.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean, it&#39;s 100% going to happen again, and it was plainly obvious it was going to happen to begin with. We did a Black Hat talk about this (checks notes) 14 years ago, after being paid by a client to audit something like 12 different agent-based management systems:https://web.archive.org/web/20061215050427/http://www.matasa...Agent-based endpoint management is super convenient and is mainstream in modern IT management. But nobody grows up wanting to write the communications software for enterprise server inventory software, so the code quality on these products, which are ubiquitous, is awful. But 99% of enterprise buyers aren&#39;t even slightly motivated by software security when making purchasing decisions, and everyone knows it, so vendors buy fig-leaf audits from vendors who will sell public-facing documents for 2p1w engagements, and IT purchasers, whose performance reviews are based on completing projects and not protecting their companies from $500,000 purchase orders for what is effectively malware, accept those bogus reviews and get on with their lives.Nothing is going to change about this, because nothing is going to alter the incentives. Reporters like Nicole Perlroth will try to blame it on ex-NSA hired guns (as if you needed the exploit chains NSA buys to break any of these systems), but I can&#39;t think of any realistic policy that could be applied to stop these kinds of attacks, not without massively disrupting the technology industry at the same time.Best get used to it, is I guess my point. I mean that sincerely, not as a sort of appeal to right the ship; the ship is already upside down."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Israel feels like the only nation taking the importance and urgency of vaccination seriously.Here in Europe, articles are coming out complaining that the slow vaccination could be harming the economy which, well, fucking duh. (https://www.brusselstimes.com/news/belgium-all-news/154626/c...)Fast rollout. Involve pharmacies. Involve the army. Distribute widely and efficiently. Prepare for months before the vaccine is here. Follow-up campaign to convince vax holdouts. A real War Effort.There&#39;s barely any calls for volunteering here in Belgium. Hospitals and vaccination centers will complain to the government that they are understaffed but you seldom hear them urgently asking for new volunteers to assign to COVID teams and vaccination centers. We spent a ton of time debating whether the social bubble should be 2 or 3 large, whether kids should be 12 or 14 before they count for it, etc etc and those spending that time were the same people who didn&#39;t prepare for the eventuality of a vaccine, and started doing so in late December.Sorry this has veered off topic. The number of articles that can be summed up to &#34;Vaccines work, are good, and israel is doing it right&#34; frustrate little european me. :("</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Google COVID-19 statistics for Israel show that cases and deaths are declining, but not at a faster rate than elsewhere in the world. Reported deaths lag behind sometimes for weeks and new deaths were caused by infections weeks ago, so vaccination may not have much effect on deaths, yet. But the number of positive tests should have gone down considerably with 50% of the population vaccinated. Are all these aymptomatic cases or do the is this due to part of the population not keeping any rules? Does anybody have information why the numbers are sill that high?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The vaccine has 95% efficacy in initial controlled trials. It is almost impossible to reach (within 1%) of that same level of effectiveness in the real world as claimed here. The real world has a big chunk of the population with an immune system that doesn&#39;t respond nearly as well to the vaccine (such as the elderly).Here is an overview of an Israeli study that was finding a more realistic effectiveness of 70% https://dalewharrison.substack.com/p/israeli-vaccination-dat...If anyone has a link to the actual study, please post it! It is really annoying to see news articles posted about studies that don&#39;t link to them or even provide any basic information to find the study."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related fun (and sad) fact: In Norway, the tax submission forms are online and so user friendly that you don&#39;t need a tax filing program like this. Edit: Here is a link to an explanation for the form, in English, which was revamped in 2020: https://www.skatteetaten.no/en/person/taxes/tax-return/tax-r...The submission form is essentially a wizard that asks you questions related to your situation and your past year. Depending on your answers, it expands different parts of the form. Other parts, such as tax exempt donations are automatically filled out based on information that the recipients filled out for you.I visited the UX department of the Norwegian equivalent to the IRS (Skatteetaten), and they had almost every device you could think of (eye-tracking being the most fun). No wonder they made good forms.I understand that some people object politically to taxes, but as long as it&#39;s one of the certainties of life (death being the other), I cannot understand why filling out the submission seems so hard in most countries..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool, and I&#39;d like to encourage work like this. I currently don&#39;t think I can recommend this to others because:It isn&#39;t immediately obvious who is running the site. whois info lists a Canadian privacy company. The site doesn&#39;t have an about page. Github has contributor info, which may help. Tax returns need to be private and accurate. If it&#39;s hard to verify that the authors are even in the US, it&#39;s had to know if this is a scam.I think the project is still young, and the above is likely something addressable.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Germany the official application to submit your taxes as a private person to the state has been a windows application for years. Using the app was a 1:1 copy of the official paper forms. Disregarding the complexity of the german tax law, you had a reference to the papers. So it was kind of easy to use the digital counterpart one was accustomed to.It was disimproved by hauling it into a web app, which breaks with all the usual connections you built with the paper equivalent and is the most UX unfriendly monstrosity one could create. From this year on you HAVE TO USE IT. I deeply disrespect this regression, which forces many people into paying a tax office for their private tax submission.I wish for a swedish/norwegian system, where the state courts you for YOUR money. I don&#39;t know a single person in Germany which states: &#34;I love doing my tax submissions!&#34;EDIT: Typos plus last paragraph"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve brought this up before, but I wonder if a &#34;JS constraint spec&#34; could be added to the JS standard that guarantees against this sort of (already uncommon) dynamic behavior in certain cases, so that code can be more aggressively optimized when possibleIf you&#39;re already using TypeScript to constrain your code, why couldn&#39;t it generate interpreter/compiler hints?These could take the form of a language-agnostic metadata file, similar to source maps, that optionally ships alongside the JS bundleEdit: Several people have misunderstood, so I must not have articulated this well. What I meant was not a new/stricter subset of JS that forbids certain dynamic behaviors across the board. What I&#39;m talking about is having TypeScript (or otherwise), which knows things at compile-time about how specific pieces of code are and are not called, manifest this information in a way that V8 can digest and act on directly, for that specific codebase. V8 already tries to guess this information and uses it to decide which things to optimize and how, but it&#39;s treating the JS bundle as a black box even though in many cases, an earlier stage of the pipeline already had this information on-hand and threw it away.In addition to being more granular, this (like TypeScript itself) would allow parts of a codebase to continue being fully dynamic while other parts are well-constrained."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By putting the number of arguments onto the stack, we end up making the stack larger for every single function call.   We also require every access to any stack variable to do math to figure out where on the stack it&#39;s arguments are.That seems an insane overhead for the common case...  If this really does make benchmarks faster overall, it suggests an even better solution might exist out there that does not add overhead for the common case...Perhaps it might be worth keeping track of how many arguments a function is typically called with, and recompiling code for each case?    Then all the checks for argument counts can be entirely removed in the optimized code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Salary is a negotiation between parties. Looked at soberly, you&#39;re the business, your employer is your customer, and the salary they pay you is really the price you charge for your services.They have no obligation to pay more for your services than they think they have to, compared to alternatives on the market. And you have no obligation to charge less for your services than you can get from other &#34;customers&#34;. Either of you can negotiate the price up or down, and the other is free to take it or leave it.It&#39;s not about who &#34;deserves&#34; what. It&#39;s a simple negotiation, like every other business transaction.The more valuable (and less replaceable) your services are, the more pay you can successfully negotiate for. I guarantee you there are plenty of people at these &#34;location-based pay&#34; companies who&#39;ve negotiated for considerably higher pay than others in their location. Just as there are many businesses (e.g. Apple) who&#39;ve found a way to charge more for their products than their competitors have.So it&#39;s worth learning to negotiate. And, perhaps more importantly, it&#39;s worth learning to provide massive value that&#39;s hard to replace. Or accepting the tradeoffs if you choose not to.Let&#39;s say you mould your skillset to fit perfectly into a commonly-open job description: front-end software engineer. Well great, the benefit is you have lots of jobs you can apply for, so you can easily &#34;fire&#34; one company to go work at another. The downside is you&#39;re now in direct competition with a million other people who&#39;ve shaped themselves to have the same common skillset, so it&#39;s easier for companies to fire you. Competition drives prices down and makes you more easily replaceable. But it gives you some safety due to redundancy. That&#39;s often a reasonable tradeoff to make, but you should be aware you&#39;re making it. If you want the big bucks, it helps to be rarer, and to work at places and in roles where it&#39;s easier to demonstrate your value."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Bangladeshi, I can tell you that the workers in my country don&#39;t have proper unions. They can&#39;t negotiate. Salary is the last thing on their minds, they can&#39;t even negotiate safe working conditions. They are uneducated, so they don&#39;t know what they deserve. See here -&gt; https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Dhaka_garment_factory_fir...So, the cheap stuff that you&#39;re getting is because someone is getting a super bad deal, by exploiting the heck out of workers. Same in China.The garments factory owners are walking away with tonnes of money, leaving the workers high and dry.The more _subtle_ point that the author is making, is that, &#34;wait, if people realize that they can get awesome developers in developing nations for a lower price, I&#39;m not going to get hired any more in my over-priced city&#34;.Good, move to a place where your salary is worth more, and work to enrich that community. Why should SF and NY get all the benefits of economic growth?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re running a remote company, there&#39;s another reason (besides fairness) that location-based pay is a bad idea: it makes it harder to create a compensation structure that incentivizes high performance.If Person A is outperforming Person B, but is getting paid less because they happen to live somewhere else, you lose the ability to claim that you compensate people for performance without sounding like you&#39;re talking out of both sides of your mouth. Not only is Person A not going to be happy about that, Person A is not going to believe that compensation at your company is based on performance.Companies that want to hire and incentivize the best people need to be congruent in their messaging around compensation and performance. Claiming that compensation is performance-based and then including a factor (location) that has no bearing on performance is incongruent and will not help to develop the right culture in this regard."</p>

I want to see how you use stateless functional programming to control a garage door actuator. Or how you model a Car which can have their doors open or closed either by the class itself or external actors.

Double doses, 5x what was needed in monkeys, gold standard adjuvants.I would not be amazed in the slightest if they decide to half-dose the vaccine or do away with the second shot or even both. They probably didn&#39;t have time to run the trial any other way"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So many people in the comments are just certain that more money wouldn&#39;t have made any difference to vaccine production, and that economic considerations had nothing to  do with it. The arguments they make fail to simple comparison tests:&#34;If we paid Tesla 2x as much per car, could they really not produce more cars?&#34;They also fail to privileging the status quo - &#34;If we paid Tesla half as much money, would they produce fewer cars?&#34;Obviously, they would. Money influences how easily they can produce cars.  At the margin there must be decisions related to turning money into efficiency every day. And the same thing must apply for vaccines.  The best vaccine expert in the world asked for a yearly sabbatical - 200k wasn&#39;t enough to keep them.  Double that to 400k?  Oh actually it can wait til next year.The question for people who deny money&#39;s ability to produce more vaccines is: why do you admit that any lower price for a vaccine would reduce supply - but you deny that any higher price would increase supply.

Somewhat more of a sober tone than Scott&#39;s typical writing, but still with a dash of his typical wit:&gt; I don’t want to accuse the New York Times of lying about me, exactly, but if they were truthful, it was in the same way as that famous movie review which describes the Wizard of Oz as: “Transported to a surreal landscape, a young girl kills the first person she meets and then teams up with three strangers to kill again.”I have only gained respect for Scott, and lost respect for the NYT, throughout this while saga. Hopefully this is the end of it.Edit: in the spirit of moving on, here are two of my favorite articles since his return, one enlightening, one funny:&#34;WebMD, And The Tragedy Of Legible Expertise&#34; -- https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/webmd-and-the-tragedy-...&#34;List of Fictional Cryptocurrencies Banned By The SEC&#34; -- https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/list-of-fictional-cryp..."</p>

It&#39;s sad that the NYT can see him only through the lens of their standard political &amp; cultural obsessions.Perhaps Alexander&#39;s ultimate virtue is epistemic humility: His pieces are long, sometimes inconclusive, and accompanied by diverse commentary because he&#39;s committed to his own fallibility and lack of omniscience.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Neat concept.  Exploring the difference between what successfully compiles vs. what won&#39;t seems like a great way of getting more familiar with the language.I&#39;ve written a little over 1,000 lines of Zig at this point and I really like it.  I think its key feature is a rich compile-time imperative programming environment (&#34;comptime&#34;).  If you can have full compile-time imperative code execution, you can get a lot of the benefits of more complicated language features (like C++ templates) &#34;for free.&#34;In C++ templates are &#34;a language within a language&#34;, but even templates with all their complexity cannot solve all of the problems you might want to solve at compile-time, so C++ has been gradually expanding its compile-time code execution features so that more and more of the language is available at compile-time (constexpr, consteval, etc). Zig jumps straight to the finish line by making most of the language available at compile-time from the outset, and in doing so avoids the need to add the complexity of templates in the first place.Having &#34;slices&#34; as a first class type feels like a general and powerful solution to the problems that std::string_view and std::span are trying to solve.I am comparing Zig to C++ a lot, which many Zig fans would probably take exception to as Zig does not aspire to be a better C++, but rather a better C.  Indeed many key C++ patterns like RAII are explicitly out of scope.  But to me Zig bridges the gap between C and C++ by solving many of the problems that make C feel too spartan without jumping to the incredible complexity of C++.There are a few things about Zig that give me pause.  I&#39;ve noticed that compile-time feels like a very lazy environment, meaning that functions do not seem to undergo full semantic analysis unless they are called from somewhere.  You can write a function that compiles successfully, leading you to believe the function is syntactically and semantically coherent, only to find that when you add an actual call to that function, the compiler now flags errors inside that function.  This adds some friction to development, because the act of writing a function is no longer a self-contained activity.  Writing the function feels more like sketching it; later when you actually call it you have a new set of compile errors to contend with.I also miss tools like ASAN to catch memory errors.  I&#39;m guessing things like that will come with time.Overall I feel very positive on Zig."</p>

It became a bit of a hang spot, and at some point we had a pretty consistent group of folks who&#39;d go to both. Marisa realized Rust could use something similar to NodeSchool, and started hacking on Rustlings during these evenings — which now a few years later has really taken off!It&#39;s really cool to now see other languages in turn be inspired and follow from Rustlings ^^"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am not surprised that the cost of context switching due to I/O readiness can often be roughly equal between async tasks and kernel threads. Normal blocking I/O can be surprisingly efficient because of various factors, such as a reduced need for system calls.Think about it this way—if you have a user-space thread which wakes up due to I/O readiness, then this means that the relevant kernel thread woke up from epoll_wait() or something similar. With blocking I/O, you call read(), and the kernel wakes up your thread when the read() completes. With non-blocking I/O, you call read(), get EAGAIN, call epoll_wait(), the kernel wakes up your thread when data is ready, and then you call read() a second time.In both scenarios, you’re calling a blocking system call and waking up the thread later.Of course, there are scenarios when epoll_wait() returns multiple events, which reduces the number of context switches. But the general result is that it’s not always easy to beat blocking I/O and kernel threads."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; People often see that there&#39;s some theoretical benefit of async and then they accept far less ergonomic coding styles and the additional bug classes that only happen on async due to accidental blocking etc... despite the fact that when you consider a real-world deployed application, those &#34;benefits&#34; become indistinguishable from noise. However, due to the additional bug classes and worse ergonomics, there is now less energy for actually optimizing the business logic, which is where all of the cycles and resource use are anyway, so in-practice async implementations tend to be buggier and slower.I disagree with this. I feel like using Async programming is actually much more powerfull and expressive than theaded programming, especially with Rust combinators on streams of futures (for examples: futures_unordered), which allow to trivially express complex concurrency patterns (such as: wait for the first two requests to return something and discard the third request&#39;s response, and btw also cancel that request). Async programming also allows for structured programming, where each task is an owned resource of a parent tasks, which means that lifetimes of tasks can be controlled and runaway threads can&#39;t exist (if one is avoiding tokio::spawn). I&#39;ve been developping [Garage](https://git.deuxfleurs.fr/Deuxfleurs/garage) for some time now (a simple distributed object store that implements a subset of S3, not ready for production!), and I&#39;ve been in awe about how easy it was to write these complex patterns using async Rust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The throughput increase in I/O scenarios with many tasks is due to the number of supported concurrent processes and Little&#39;s law; it has little to do with context switching time, which has a negligible impact on the throughput in these use-cases: https://inside.java/2020/08/07/loom-performance/Low context switch latency only matters when the number of tasks is very small (their data all fits in the cache), and the workload is entirely computational. Otherwise, even the fastest implementation is ~60 ns, which is the cost of a cache-miss, and the compiler can&#39;t optimise things into a simple goto because the dispatch goes through a scheduler that has a megamorphic call-site.So memory is much more important for I/O use-case throughput, and while it is true that the kernel doesn&#39;t commit the full stack memory on thread creation, it&#39;s misleading to think that you get good memory usage. For one, once the memory is committed, it&#39;s never uncommitted (although it can be paged out). For another, the granularity is that of a page, i.e. at least 4K, which can often be much higher than what a task requires.&gt; It is hard to pin down exactly how the alleged advantages would arise.For I/O use-cases the answer is here:&gt; the async version uses about 1/20th as much memory as the threaded version.This could translate to 20x throughput -- due to Little&#39;s law -- although usually less because there are other limits, like network saturation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The fundamental challenge of GUIs is that they have state as a core concern. Unlike most systems, state is not an implementation detail that can be refactored away. It is central to the problem domain. The end user sees and cares about having a stateful system.The hardest part of dealing with state in a complex system is maintaining consistency in different places. Some instances of this this can be avoided by creating single-sources-of-truth, but in other cases you can&#39;t unify your state, or you&#39;re dealing with an external stateful system (like the DOM), and you have no choice but to find a way to keep separate pieces of state in sync.I should probably write a blog post on this"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here is my personal opinion on it (not sure if it&#39;s the right one, though): Write the GUI independently of the model, let the GUI components update and communicate among each other as they like, and perform some validation in these GUI components. Translate between model and view only at one well-defined point at which there is also a final validation at the model side, and make sure model and view are only loosely coupled.Good GUIs have way too many requirements to be controlled (via a controller) by the model. As a typical example, the fact that a button should only be activated if there is data in a textbox has usually nothing to do with the underlying model. The model should only ever contain valid and consistent data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great discussion on the challenges of designing UI for complex applications.In the aggregate, what ends up being most effective for me, is rapid prototyping, and “paving the bare spots.”[0]I find that I do a terrible job of predicting user mental models.The rub with prototypes, is that they can’t be lash-ups, as they inevitably end up as ship code. This means that a lot of good code will get binned. It just needs to be accepted and anticipated. Sometimes, I can create a standalone project for code that needs to go, but I still feel has a future.So there’s always a need for fundamental high quality.What has been useful to me, is Apple’s TestFlight[1]. I write Apple software, and TestFlight is their beta distribution system.I start a project at a very nascent stage, and use TestFlight to prototype it. I use an “always beta” quality approach, so the app is constantly at ship quality; although incomplete.It forces me to maintain high quality, and allows all stakeholders to participate, even at very early stages. It’s extremely motivating. The level of enthusiasm is off the charts. In fact, the biggest challenge is keeping people in low orbit, so they don’t start thinking that you are a “WIZZARD” [sic].It also makes shopping around for funding and support easy. You just loop people into the TestFlight group. Since the app is already at high quality, there’s no need for chaperones or sacrifices to The Demo Gods.I like that it keeps development totally focused on the actual user experience. They look at the application entirely differently from me.[0] https://littlegreenviper.com/miscellany/the-road-most-travel...[1] https://developer.apple.com/testflight/"</p>
