								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey Akash,I like the idea of giving people some help expressing themselves at work. You might be interested to learn about the Power Distance Index, and the body of work on PDI and work culture.You’ll see if you read the comments here that some people are like “the alternatives are bullshit corporate speak and infuriate me”, and some are like “yes, at last, a way to help people be more polite / better communicators”. There’s a smattering of “this is passive aggressive” thrown in.One of the broad pitches PDI at work types make is that the lower the PDI, the more direct communications are preferred; the higher, the more ‘diplomatic’ the communications are preferred. My vibe on your list is that it’s just a tad more diplomatic than Silicon Valley wants to be, hence the slight negative ‘passive aggressive’ reactions.Some of the lowest PDI countries in the world are Israel, and many Northern European countries, and it fits my experience that in those places additional respect is given for bluntness - as Jan Maas in Ted Lasso says “I’m not rude, I’m Dutch.” As a broad stereotype using the alternate wordings you give would be a sign you are not someone to be respected in that environment.On the other hand, Saudi Arabia’s PDI is high, and I would bet that some of your alternate list there would still be much too rude; just a guess, I haven’t worked in Saudi.Anyway, thanks again for this; if you stay interested, you might consider reworking this into different ‘cultural norms’ lists to help people acclimate / go both ways; at that point, I think it would be a very broadly useful resource."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This version of &#34;professionalism&#34; has the stereotypical West Coast problem: the message it claims to be sending gets not only lost in translation, but distorted into something more superficially inoffensive, but underneath that, more opaque and manipulative. It encourages indirection and avoidance rather than respectful candor.Let&#39;s start with the first example. The polite way to say &#34;you are overcomplicating this&#34; is &#34;I think this could be simpler&#34;. Not &#34;let&#39;s concentrate on initial scope&#34;, which isn&#39;t remotely the same thing in general. The latter is less generally applicable (how do we know there was an initial scope?), less specific (why stick to initial scope?), and more prescriptive (&#34;let&#39;s do this&#34; instead of &#34;I listened to your idea and this is what I think of it&#34;).Now, being less specific and more prescriptive may be some people&#39;s idea of effective self-interested corporate behavior, since it works to minimize your vulnerabilities and maximize the obligations of others. But I think communication is more meaningful, effective, and respectful if you explain how you evaluate others&#39; ideas (which implies you at least gave them the respect of listening) before just telling them what to do.They&#39;re not all bad though! I definitely think &#34;that&#39;s a horrible idea&#34; is productively replaced with some version of &#34;I have these concerns&#34; or &#34;I think there may be better alternatives&#34;. It&#39;s generally good to avoid terms that communicate nothing but negative affect and instead communicate whatever ideas that prompted the negative affect.EDIT: another comment mentions Power-Distance Index, which is part of a broader cultural dimensions theory. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hofstede%27s_cultural_dimens...Apparently I have a very strong preference for low PDI culture, as do most of you. But it&#39;s good to be aware that that&#39;s not universal and our style may require adaptation for success with diverse audiences."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Almost none of these are &#34;professional&#34; or the sort of corporate double speak the author wants to convey. In fact, I find a lot of the &#34;alternatives&#34; more passive aggressive and rude than the original intentions! Instead of &#34;stop bothering me&#34; being:    You have not heard from me because further information is not available at this time, Once I have an update I’ll be sure to loop you in

It should be something like &#34;Let&#39;s sync up later&#34; or &#34;I will ping you once I have an update.&#34; Way less hostile."</p>

Purchasing the difference, as the author did, would only cause more trouble. The questions now are how much will be refunded, whether any purchases will go through, and whether there will be a fine or legal action.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; so that if another person is shown your sequence of digits from 1 to 6, he/she should not be able to tell whether these numbers were produced by a real die or just “made up” by somebody.That instruction is a flaw in the experiment. It&#39;s always impossible to tell, for any given sequence, whether it was produced by a fair die. There&#39;s nothing an experimental subject can do to make the impossible more impossible.&gt; the kind of sequence you’d get if you really rolled a dieWell, there is no such sequence. The instruction is incoherent.You could take it as meaning &#34;Construct a sequence that you think will convince others that it came from a random source&#34;. That would be coherent. And then it would be legitimate to eliminate responses that were all-heads (&#34;clearly didn&#39;t even try&#34;). But then what are you measuring? The comparative understanding of older and youger people concerning random sources, or the Gambler&#39;s Paradox? Their comparative expertise in human psychology? Their comparative willingness to move the mouse-pointer over the screen?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with the article that the study is flawed in its unwillingness to exclude the all-H and all-T answers. But I’ll go further: the original study is just silly.“Make a sequence that looks random” is sort of a nonsensical ask. Looks random to whom? To our algorithm, is what they meant. There’s no such thing as a randomness test that can look at a sequence and decide “is it random?”, so this algo measures something else and uses it as a proxy for “looking” random to…the study authors, I guess? There’s no ground truth here; it’s chasing a ghost.I don’t know what information we could even hypothetically gain from knowing older people score lower according to this algo—-perhaps that the paper’s authors are younger than 60 and thus picked a different “randomness-looking” algo than they would if they were older? At best that older people have an equally incorrect but qualitatively different idea of “random looking”?Of course we did not learn that; we only learned that older people pick all-H or all-T more. But my point is that there wasn’t really anything interesting at stake anyway.(Edit: expanding a bit)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like a lot of the comments here are written after only taking the test and many are not reading the rest of the article.The authors of the website are stating that they believe the study is wrong. The below/above 60 answer is showing you it’s incorrect half of the time along with data backing up the claim."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While I have seen another comment: ,,why?’’ and agree with it, I’d like to expand on it.For a long time I thought that switching away from 3d buttons, getting to less colors was only frustrating me and other techies who like how things were done before (I love the original iPhone aesthetics for example).But a few months ago my father died, my mother is left alone 73 years old, far from me, and I try to help her through phone (and sometimes remote sessions), but it’s extremely frustrating that she can’t tell me what buttons there are on the screen, because she can’t make a difference between buttons and text. With more black and white, I even can’t tell her what color to look for. And the worst thing is that when she can’t achieve something she needs to (like pay a bill), her blood pressure goes up, and she has to take medications with serious side effects.I’m very angry at companies that don’t test changes with old people whose life and health at this point depends on being able to use digital services."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unicode already has a way to specify that emoji should be rendered black-and-white for consistency with surrounding text: affixing the combining character U+FE0E VARIATION SELECTOR-15 (examples[0]). Some touch keyboards have the text-style variations in the flyouts.This only works on emoji for which a variation sequence is defined. Some emoji render the text presentation by default; you can choose the emoji presentation for those using U+FE0F VARIATION SELECTOR-16. Sequences also exist for ideographic variations like single- or double-storey &#39;a&#39; and &#39;g&#39;, unified CJK, and miscellaneous ones such as serifs for certain mathematical characters.[1][0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miscellaneous_Symbols_and_Pict...[1] https://unicode.org/faq/vs.htmlI find this tool handy for listing the Unicode characters in a string.[2][2] https://qaz.wtf/u/show.cgi?show=%F0%9F%8C%8D%EF%B8%8EEdit: An easy way to add the variation selector without a method for Unicode input (though there&#39;s a registry hack for Windows to enable Unicode alt codes): put the emoji in an address bar, then add the URL-encoded variation selector,  %EF%B8%8E"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Right. The hard line on this comes from aerospace. If A won&#39;t connect to B, you check the spec. If A isn&#39;t compliant with the spec, A is wrong and the vendor of A has to fix it. Same for B. If you can&#39;t tell who&#39;s wrong from the spec, the spec is wrong. This is why you can unplug a Pratt and Whitney engine from a aircraft and plug in a Rolls-Royce engine.Now, this worked a lot better when aerospace companies and the USAF had real clout with manufacturers. If it wasn&#39;t in compliance with the spec, you put a red tag on it and rejected it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like that story, and wish the author luck.I never thought of myself as a &#34;niche programmer,&#34; but, as it turns out, I sort of, am.I write native UIKit applications, using Swift. No PWAs, no hybrid systems (like React, Electron, or Ionic). I&#39;m pretty good at it. I&#39;ve been writing Swift, every day, since it was announced in 2014. It&#39;s no longer an &#34;edge&#34; language; it is now the baseline, mainstream, native development language for Apple systems, and I&#39;m a fluent speaker.It means that the apps I write are really small, really secure, really fast, accessible, highly usable, use very few system resources, leverage the latest Apple tech, have almost no external dependencies, work extremely well, and I write them very, very quickly. Also, because they are UIKit, I can get pretty ambitious, as UIKit is a very mature, ship-oriented system. I am looking forward to using SwiftUI, but am yet to be convinced that it is suitable for really ambitious projects.It&#39;s really difficult to find other native Swift developers that work the way that I do. Part of that, I hate to admit, is probably because I&#39;m 60, and I got really sick of sitting in meetups, with a circle of avoidance around me. I have come to understand that I have &#34;cooties.&#34; I won&#39;t go where I&#39;m not welcome.But I have also come to realize that an awful lot of apps for Apple systems are written using hybrid systems, and that many folks are unaware that there are Apple app development languages, other than JavaScript."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was doing my undergrad at the University of Waterloo in the &#39;90s, my first co-op (internship) placement happened to be at OTI -- a (some might say &#34;the&#34;) Smalltalk shop.  Smalltalk was very much a niche language even at the time but it opened up opportunities I wouldn&#39;t have dreamt of down the road.  My last couple co-op jobs took me to Australia and from there to a customer engagement in Thailand.  I bet that wouldn&#39;t have happened if I just specialized in C++ or whatnot.All this to say that I heartily endorse the OP&#39;s strategy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I didn&#39;t dive into finding an online Clojure community and none of my programmer friends did Clojure or had heard of it either so I had no idea if the language was gaining popularity or dying.This is so fascinating to me and I guess just a reminder of the HN echo chamber."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Benefits of JailBreaking Your Kindle:- Customize your lock screen to the recently opened book cover, selected image, or randomized from a collection of images. Amazon added something similar recently but it took them 13 years for something so basic.- KOReader for reading epub and pdf. Also, you get access to the filesystem so you can organize your books however you want.- Customizable collections (similar to folders) with Calibre- Run Python so you can run w/e you want. Some ideas...    - Sideload books via WiFi

    - Sync notes automatically


The main idea of Jailbreaking is that you own your device and you can do whatever you want with it. However, I switched from a Jailbroken Kindle Paperwhite to an Android e-ink reader about a year ago and I&#39;m never looking back.Regardless, I&#39;m happy to see this on Hacker News!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This needs distributed training...Years ago I made a shared tensor library[1] which should allow people to do training in a distributed fashion around the world.   Even with relatively slow internet connections, training should still make good use of all the compute available because the whole lot runs asynchronously with highly compressed and approximate updates to shared weights.The end result is that every bit of computation added has some benefits.Obviously for a real large scale effort, anti-cheat and anti-spam mechanisms would be needed to ensure nodes aren&#39;t deliberately sending bad data to hurt the group effort.[1]: https://github.com/Hello1024/shared-tensor"</p>

It&#39;s something a little more like an epileptic seizure. Intense headaches are one common symptom, but there are a lot of others.One common symptom of migraine is called *scintillating scotoma*. A scotoma is a blind or blank spot in the visual field. A scintillating scotoma caused by migraine is an area of the visual field that is temporarily replaced by a vivid visual aura. Its appearance is commonly the first symptom of a migraine attack, and is often followed by more unpleasant symptoms.I&#39;ve seen scintillating scotoma many times over the years. A few years ago I was reading and enjoying a good book, and my scotoma appeared. It was a humdinger: roughly triangular prisms of white light with utterly black zebra stripes moving along them kaleidoscope-style. It took up the lower left middle of my visual field, pulsing and radiating and turning, covering the book in my hand.I was disappointed. I didn&#39;t want to stop reading. I was enjoying the book. So I decided to keep reading until the scotoma made it impossible to continue.It never did.It became so vivid that I couldn&#39;t see my hand at all, but I still had no trouble reading the book. I even started reading it aloud without any difficulty.After a few minutes the scotoma faded. In that instance, it was not followed by any other symptoms (that&#39;s happened more and more frequently over the years since probably my forties).I could now see the book again, and could confirm that what I had been reading was indeed what was on the page.I thought about how to explain my experience. The best hypothesis I&#39;ve come up with so far is that the neurological process of seeing and the neurological process of being consciously aware of what I&#39;m seeing are not the same thing. They&#39;re independent processes. The scotoma prevented me from subjectively experiencing seeing the book, but did not prevent me from actually seeing it, nor from correctly interpreting what I was seeing.This experience (and one two other odd experiences) has led me to adopt the working hypothesis that many of our cognitive experiences are more complicated than we tend to assume, and that they&#39;re often made up of several more or less independent processes. We usually benefit if related processes pretty much work together, so they pretty much do. Because they do, we experience them all together as a single experience, but that&#39;s an illusion that unravels if circumstances screw up their synchronization.I hope someone finds that as interesting as I do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the 1800s, scholars who knew a lot of languages (including, often, several modern and ancient European languages, and increasingly also Sanskrit) started to notice some amazing patterns about similarities in words among all of these languages, including languages from very far apart and that had no visible connection at all from the point of view of their present-day speakers.As these patterns were explored, they were found to be even more systematic and pervasive than they had appeared. In some cases, one sound would systematically change into another sound from language A to language B.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grimm%27s_lawThese patterns helped reveal historical connections between most languages of Europe, Central Asia, and South Asia, showing that those languages had descended from the same ancient sources. (Note that this isn&#39;t true of 100% of languages in this region -- there are other unrelated families that turned up -- but it&#39;s true of a significant majority.)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-European_languagesThe languages that turned out to be related this way included the Germanic family (like German, English, Dutch, and the Scandinavian languages), the Romance family (like French, Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, and Catalan), the Celtic family (like Irish and Welsh), the Slavic family (like Russian, Bulgarian, and Ukrainian), and also Farsi and all the Central Asian languages related to it, and Hindi/Urdu and all the South Asian languages related to it. Oh, and Greek.If I tried to list all the languages and language families that were linked up to this family tree, we would probably be here all day, because they go on and on. Just under half the people in the whole world have one or another of them as a native language today!These languages changed quickly enough in history that most people no longer noticed, or remembered, that most of them were related to one another, yet slowly enough that it&#39;s been feasible to deduce an enormous amount of information about the history of particular languages and particular words, once many of the rules and patterns had been identified.A Grimm&#39;s Law example is that the h sound in Germanic languages usually corresponds to the k sound in Romance languages (note that this can be stated much more technically and accurately). So, it turns out that &#34;hundred&#34; and &#34;cent&#34;/&#34;cento&#34;/&#34;centum&#34; actually share the same origin. And &#34;heart&#34; and &#34;cœur&#34;/&#34;corazón&#34;/&#34;καρδία&#34; (origin of &#34;cardiac&#34;) (also &#34;cordial&#34;; the root in Latin sounds like &#34;cord-&#34;). And &#34;who&#34; and &#34;que&#34;/&#34;quoi&#34;/&#34;qui&#34; (and similarly for other wh- questions in English and qu- questions in Romance, which were originally hw- sounds in English and kw- sounds in Latin).Some other examples are t to d (&#34;ten&#34; and &#34;decem&#34;/&#34;diez&#34;/&#34;dez&#34;, plus some of the examples above that have a t in English), and f to p (&#34;foot&#34; and the Latin and Greek words from which we get &#34;pedestrian&#34; and &#34;podiatrist&#34;, and Romance &#34;pied&#34;/&#34;pie&#34;/&#34;pé&#34;; and don&#39;t forget about &#34;father&#34; and &#34;padre&#34;/&#34;pater&#34;/...).Those are just a couple of the phenomena that people noticed in the 1800s; while the exact development of these patterns gets much more complicated, they&#39;ve proven to work over and over and over, for hundreds of languages and hundreds of thousands of words!(... Also, the Grimm from Grimm&#39;s Law is one of the Brothers Grimm, from Grimm&#39;s Fairytales!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In drug development, a lot of the engineering goes into making sure the pharmaceutical compound -- having been developed -- actually reaches the target area of the body. If the compound is a relatively large particle that needs to get into the blood stream, a nasal spray might result in the compound being deposited at the bottom of a person&#39;s lungs without ever getting absorbed. If stomach acids break the chemical down then digestion might not be a feasible approach. Intravenous might work but shots are scary, or worse the medication may need to be administered in low doses over a long period of time, requiring an IV catheter.For a pill that can be digested, often it will be the case that the pharmaceutical compound needs a lot of buffer space, sugar or something else to prevent it from being absorbed too quickly. So if a pill says &#34;Do not break in half&#34; or &#34;Do not chew&#34;, this is because doing these things increased the pill&#39;s surface area and the rate that the drug gets absorbed, when optimal rate of absorption has already been calculated."</p>

Couple of times, I did find it to be an hassle to scrape data embedded in iframes, and I can see the heap snapshots treat iframes differently.Also, if a website takes the extra steps to block web scrapers, identification of elements is never the main problem. It is always IP bans and other security measures.After all that, I do look forward using something like this and making a switch to nodejs based solution soon. But if you are trying web scraping at scale, reverse engineering should always be your first choice.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"About 14 years ago, I also tried to tackle the public conversation troll problem and created a forum that got quite a bit of traction. While Radiopaper takes the carrot approach (&#34;write things people want to engage with&#34;), I took the stick approach: &#34;anyone can ban anyone else for a non-trivial amount of time, but you must reply to their post, and people will see that you banned them.&#34;It was a probabilistic method to filtering out the trolls, and it worked well. Trolls wanted to ban, but they themselves became the more-frequent targets of bans. Eventually, they would get frustrated with the bans and leave. The people that remained, stayed civil to not become a clear target of a ban. There would be brief chaotic behavior, but it never lasted. Cooler heads always prevailed.Radiopaper mentions that there is a lot of room for exploration in this space, to try different models for creating emergent social behavior and productive conversations. I hope we see more of it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A common discussion &#34;technique&#34; on reddit is to block the person you&#39;re arguing with right after your last message, when you feel you&#39;re done with the conversation. That way they will never be able to reply and you always get the last word. Unfortunately this feels like an amplification of that. However, I guess the dynamics will prevent the frustrating feeling when that&#39;s the game you&#39;re singing up for.Intriguing idea anyway. Looking forward to seeing how it pans out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The key mechanism that makes Radiopaper different from other social networks, and more resistant to trolling and abuse, is that messages are not published until the counterparty replies or accepts your comment.My mind is blown at how simple and elegant this solution is!Great work there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nicely succinct explanation of this stance. As someone who agrees, I like this bit:&#34;One of the most promising and new developments in recent years has been a renewed interest in building decentralized systems of all types. Many people are looking into building a system of decentralized identity and giving that control back to the users.&#34;IE, decentralization is great, but blockchain type concensus building is rarely needed or useful in such systems imo."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the more under-appreciated aspects of blockchains is how they&#39;ve made public key encryption more accessible to mainstream users. For the first time in history, millions of people have setup and maintain custody of their own key pairs. These users have learned the importance of securing those keys and have a convenient way to sign or verify signatures using their crypto wallets.Not everything needs a blockchain, but consumer tools for generating and verifying cryptographic signatures would have never reached the same level of adoption as they have w/o the incentives that blockchains provide."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One feature a few of us toyed with for years that I&#39;d love to see tried seriously someday (or does it already exist?) would be intelligent tag trees or maps that stuff could be plugged into, ideally that could also be shared and mixed too. More specific tags would have parent/child/sibling relationships with more generic tags, and a single tag would then pull in all the others as far as searching. So for example if I have a photo of one of my cats, and I tag it Cat Name having set that up, &#34;calico&#34; or &#34;tabby&#34;, breed, plain old &#34;cat&#34; and anything else associated with the specific tag would all be hits. And up the stack, if I tag a picture &#34;calico&#34; it should show up under the &#34;cat&#34; tag as well automatically with no further effort. Conditionals could be incorporated too, like if there is a character who in a series has long hair, tagging &#34;short hair&#34; could automatically pull in &#34;alternative hairstyle&#34;.My big problem with typical tagging is that it&#39;s a lot of grunt work to be comprehensive. AI can help but has its own issues. While getting the UI/UX right would take some work, a universal system-wide multi-dimensional tag map could allow a lot more metadata a lot more easily. Even more so with sharing, communities could curate tag maps around areas of interest and one could stay synced with tag maps of &#34;aircraft&#34; or &#34;trees&#34; or the like which would bring in lots of technical depth to explore in a distributed fashion. Eventually maybe community AI recognition models could be an optional part of that too to help identify specific given subjects (and one would be free to then not have other kinds of things identified or shared)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember buying my first Moleskine notebook in college. It was my first exposure to &#34;fashionable office supplies&#34;, a foreign concept to me growing up. It was a super nice object. In fact it was so nice, I didn&#39;t want to use it to just take notes in class, because what a waste. I also didn&#39;t want to use it to  just scribble personal notes and todo lists in, because what a waste. In the end, I never wrote anything in that notebook at all: what a waste.Now I tend to view fashionable office supplies as productivity fetish items. It&#39;s easy to geek out on that stuff, but does a better notebook make me more productive? Seems to make me less productive, if history is an indicator.Yeah, I will occasionally find myself reading reviews of immaculately designed mechanical pencils, or minutely engineered Japanese scissors. But I try not to lose sight of the advantages cheap, lousy stuff has too: disposable, easy to replace, low barrier to use. These qualities are also valuable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;They aren’t a record of my thinking process. They are my thinking process.&#34;This exactly! I think with pen and notebook. I also think without pen and notebook, such as during my driving and running. Without notebooks, I often find myself think in circles and having hard time to recall what I just realized a short moment ago. With pen and notebook, it is more relaxed. Often I don&#39;t revisit my notebooks. So the notebooks are mainly serving as a thinking aids than to serve as a database. Replacing them with digital sounds nice, but in reality it is just a distraction. Having the record to go back to is a short term benefit; the few pages of notes that I do end up revisit often quickly become part of paper or presentations, or tweets and moments, or more often, prototype code. I have accumulated a drawer of used notebooks. They only have sentimental values. And they have more sentimental values in paper forms than in digital forms.PS: my current favorite notebook is this one https://www.amazon.com/Universal-Sugarcane-Notebook-College-...

I still prefer the free-form capability to mix text and drawing and color and scribbles that pen or pencil on paper offers, but I then scan the finished pages into the computer.As a result, my favorite notebook is now a pad of A4 paper with a good weight, ruled, and perforated so I can easily detach pages and feed them through the scanner.Content warning for the following paragraph.I then destroy the originals."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Now a more philosoraptor style comment: I see Mcrib is a service built to
quickly detect and replace memcached&#39;s. I treat memcached in infrastructure as
a very stable service. Meaning it is infrequently necessary to upgrade it, and
it will generally not fail on its own. If it does it will be highly infrequent
compared to services with higher churn or more complexity/dependencies. This
means if they&#39;re failing often enough that you need to rapidly detect and
replace them you have a more fundamental problem.From a structural standpoint I think my technical comment can be useful. If
things really are failing this much A) you should figure out why and slow that
down. B) if you have a generally stable system and understand the typical rate
of failure, you can add tripwires into Mcrib to avoid over-culling services
and loudly raise alarms. Then C) you can improve technical reliability with
redundancy/extstore/etc.I&#39;ve also seen plenty of times where folks have a dependency of a service
determine if that service is usable, which I disagree with quite strongly.
Consul being down on a node should trigger something to consider if the
service is dead. It&#39;s important both for reliability (don&#39;t kill perfectly
working things because you end up having to design around it), and for
maintainability as you&#39;ve now made people afraid of upgrading Consul or other
co-dependent services. Other similar failures are single-point-of-testing
availability checking where instead you probably want two points of truth
before shooting a service.Now you risk people being afraid of upgrading probably anything, which means
they will work around it, abstract it, or needlessly replace it with something
they feel safer managing. The latter is at best a waste of time, at worst a
time bomb until you find out what conditions this new thing breaks under.This isn&#39;t advocating that you design without assuming anything can fail
anywhere at any time; just pointing out that how often a service _should_ fail
is extremely useful information when designing systems and designing fail
safes, alerts, monitoring, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi! I&#39;d like to offer some hopefully useful information if any Slack folks end
up reading this, or anyone else with a similar infrastructure. I&#39;ll start with
some tech and make a separate philosophical comment.Also caveat: I have no deep view into Slack&#39;s infrastructure so anything I say
here may not even be relevant. YMMV.First some self promotion: https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/Proxy
memcached itself is shipping router/proxy software. Mcrouter is difficult to
manage and unsupported. This proxy is community developed, more
flexible, likely faster, and will support more native features of memcached.
We&#39;re currently in a stabilization round ensuring it won&#39;t eat pets but all of
the basic features have been in for a while. Documentation and example
libraries are still needed but community feedback help speed those up
tremendously (or any kind of question/help request).It&#39;s not clear to me why memcached is being managed like this; mcrouter seems
to only be used to abstract the configuration from the clients. It has a lot
of features for redundant pools and so on. Especially with what sounds like
globally immutable data and the threat of cascading failures during rolling
upgrades it sounds like it would be very helpful here.If cost or pool sizes are the main reasons why the structure is flat, using
Extstore (https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/Extstore) can likely
help. Even if object value sizes are in the realm of 500 bytes, using flash
storage can still greatly reduce the amount of RAM necessary or reduce the
pool size (granted the network can still keep up) with nearly identical
performance. Extstore takes a lot of tradeoffs (ie; keeping keys in RAM) to
ensure most operations don&#39;t actually write to flash or double-read.
Extstore&#39;s in use in tons of places and everyone&#39;s immediately addicted.Finally, the Meta Protocol
(https://github.com/memcached/memcached/wiki/MetaCommands) can help with
stampeding herds to help keep DB load from exploding without adding excess
network roundtrips under normal conditions. I&#39;ve seen lots of workarounds
people build but this protocol extension gives a lot of flexibility you can
use to help survive degraded states: anti-stampeding herd, serve-stale, better
counter semantics, and so on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;I completely underestimated how much work it takes to build a business. There&#39;s so much overhead. I&#39;m always figuring out why a build failed, taxes, how to triage issues, responding to support, designing UIs, responding to Apple&#39;s complaints, and more. There&#39;s so much that goes on behind the scenes. There&#39;s no way a single person can possible do this alone, especially as a side project.&#34;This is the part that resonates a lot with me even though I have been able to build a small business that is reasonably successful with a small team but it takes a toll. It is a frikin slog and there are days when you feel like jumping off a cliff. Also the cost of doing something so small can add up when you can have a cushy tech job making 200K relatively easy. To do your own thing requires a very different mindset and incredibly hard.There is a HUGE difference between building a quick side project for fun VS turning it into a real business (no matter how small). I have full sympathy for the owner and totally understand where they are coming from. No judgement and I wish them all the best."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see it going open source! I hope Actual can keep development going with the community support.Similarly, a local-first (PouchDB) budgeting app I built[1] went open source[2][3] a few years ago. It&#39;s worked out well, I love seeing what everyone does with it in their forks. Unlike Actual however, I maintain a paid subscription service while being open source.It&#39;s worked out quite well. Luckily it&#39;s not a huge time commitment as a side project, probably due to no native apps. I&#39;ve also shifted from active development to maintenance, with sporadic updates every now and then. For example, I recently moved everything from Gitlab to Github[4] and upgraded a bunch of dependencies under the hood to get everything compiling on Apple Silicon. (For example, I now run AngularJS tests with Jest, hehe.)[1] https://financier.io/[2] https://github.com/financier-io/[3] https://blog.financier.io/financier-is-now-open-source-bdfe9...[4] https://blog.financier.io/weve-moved-to-github-4617239b9fa3"</p>

All are focused on budgets and mostly managing cash accounts.I&#39;ve always wanted an equivalent but for investments. I know you can sync investment accounts to some of these, but that only reports the balance generally.I&#39;d love to have the equivalent for investment accounts that answer these questions:What is my sector exposure?How much, across multiple accounts and brokerages, of Apple (or any stock/etf/mutual fund) do I own as a total percentage?How much money are in retirement accounts vs non retirement accounts?What is my IRR (rate of return) in aggregate and per account?And of course things like projections, safe withdrawal rates, analysis in the form of charts and graphs like what Actual and the rest offer.etc"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author writes well and makes compelling points. His &#34;I want to get off Mr Golang&#39;s Wild Ride&#34; post is good too.But I don&#39;t find myself agreeing with his position, which is &#34;you shouldn&#39;t use Go for production services&#34; (he explicitly says this in one of his Go posts, I forget which one and don&#39;t have time to look right now).The better alternative to Go is Rust. Okay, sure, I&#39;m willing to admit that in the examples presented, Rust handles things better. But Rust isn&#39;t a panacea. Rust is complicated and hard, and often it&#39;s not worth taking on that burden just to theoretically handle cases that rarely occur and even more rarely cause any problem. Programming is a means to an end, and the cost of using Rust (hiring, increased development time) is often not worth it.The reason Go is successful is because it&#39;s easy for companies to use to solve production problems with teams of varying expertise. Its stdlib is well-featured, its ecosystem is good. There&#39;s generally one correct way of doing things. The same doesn&#39;t appear true in Rust. For example, an _incredibly_ common thing to do in production code is to make a web request. In Go, there is no need for debate, you use the stdlib. In Rust, you have to use a crate, which requires a decision to be made. Even worse is the async story, in Rust you have to decide whether to use Tokio or whatever. That burden is just not present with Go.Btw this article should not be flagged and it&#39;s pathetic that people have flagged it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Flagging this post strikes me as shameful censorship of an unpopular opinion.You may say it&#39;s the snark/anger/frustration that got flagged, but I suspect it would not have been flagged if the topic were different.Presuming the author is making bad-faith arguments for internet blog points goes against the spirit of HN. I prefer to draw my own conclusions, thank you. I normally expect HN to take the higher ground with calm and reasoned counter arguments of the content but not today I guess."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used Go and Rust professionally and in side projects, and I had used Go first before Rust. When I first used Go, I was like &#34;oh wow, this is so simple and easy&#34;, and I didn&#39;t realize that I was putting up with the language. Learning Rust was relatively harder, but once I did and wrote some non trivial programs in Rust, it was like a pathway in my brain opened up and was previously blocked, and then when I went back to Go, I was painfully aware of issues that I the programmer had to keep in mind (or write a LOT of boilerplate code to keep track of). Issues that Rust&#39;s type system just solves.The way `nil` can seep into your codebase in Go and how bad the FFI is in Go will prevent me from ever choosing it for a project going forward. And I personally would not feel confident modifying Go code written by someone else, and would not feel confident accepting PRs into my Go codebase unless I understood every line inside and out.Rust is a breath of fresh air in that regard.All that said, I think the author here is idealistic in a certain sense. In the scale of &#34;solving a problem by hand (or using Excel/a proprietary tool etc)&#34; to &#34;writing a computer program to automate it&#34;, both Go and Rust are very close to each other. And once someone learns Go and knows it well enough, the incremental cost of learning Rust or even thinking about the problems Rust solves for you becomes not worth it. I think that it&#39;s sad that this is the way it works, but that&#39;s just how it is. It&#39;s easy for settle for a local optima like Go when taking into consideration family, pets, salary, time, effort etc.I do think on a long enough timescale, programmers will eventually move to a &#34;better&#34; language. But in my opinion, that time scale exceeds the lifespan of a human :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everything is not falling apart, though certain institutions may be falling apart.In America, there&#39;s definitely been a breakdown of belief in its own institutions.  Far more people are skeptical of things like journalism and Silicon Valley; it really wasn&#39;t that long ago that the former was constantly salivating over the latter, but now it&#39;s more of an openly vulture-carrion relationship because that caters to public sentiment.  People who I would consider &#34;normies&#34; even don&#39;t trust law enforcement and the FBI anymore (not that they ever should have).  Even the education system from K12 to college is increasingly being seen as a joke and an outright racket.  We also went from the President being a more respected position to one deserving of relentless tabloid gossip.  Even if one&#39;s &#34;guy&#34; is in office, I don&#39;t think we feel the same about it the way we did even as recent as Obama, and his administration was when we really began to see the social cracks forming.Civilization ebbs and flows, but I think the current sentiment is unprecedented in my lifetime.  This is not a high point by any stretch of the imagination, and while I see &#34;everything is collapsing&#34; to be hyperbolic, it seems inevitable that many things we thought were rock solid are in a transition period where either they will reform or one day be replaced with force of some kind."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Things collapsing has been a predominant sentiment in every modern generation. It&#39;s unprecedented because of our collective amnesia, that regards the familiar as a stable starting point rather than a random moment in a volatile reality.Journalism was a tawdry, un-respectable business since its conception, but experienced a brief period of valor around the mid-twentieth century when industry concentration, Cold War ethics and regulation collectively reworked its incentives. The education system has always been in a position of scrutiny since universal education become the norm. Presidents have been the stuff of tabloid gossip since the founding fathers with the media mercilessly opting to promote scandal and controversy over respectability. Our conception of President as moral arbiter is a function of the reworking of journalism mentioned above.The difference in peoples attitudes reflects an increased diet of emotion inducing media that accelerates fears and expectations, rather than some great pivot in volatility. Yes there are things to worry about but there always are (let&#39;s remember the twentieth century had two world wars, the Great Depression, and an even worse pandemic)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d argue that the greater risk of things falling apart is economic rather than political. We&#39;ve built our society on two near-ponzi schemes that are in danger of falling apart. The first is pension funds which are paid into by current workers to pay out for past workers. Pension funds inherently depend on population growth to avoid shortfalls. They rely on the fact that more people pay into them then take out from them at any one time.  This literally meets the definition of a ponzi scheme and it will be heartbreaking when it comes due.The other near-ponzi scheme is the real estate market.  In my city of Toronto, average real estate prices have gone from 2x average income in 1972 to 16x average income today. To continue growing at this pace they&#39;d have to reach 128x average income by 2072. Those prices are absurd enough that it&#39;s clear there will be a slowdown in real estate prices before then. But much of our society is built on real estate growth and we aggressively encourage people to own real estate assets worth more than the entirety of their net worth. When these assets stop going up, or even worse start going down there will be major complications for society.  I&#39;m not talking about the adverse effects of a temporary market correction, I&#39;m talking about a new normal in which real estate is flat or downward trending.  When real estate is no longer an incredible investment opportunity it will have significant adverse effects on society.  For instance, homes are currently a large part of people&#39;s retirement plans and selling a home is often used to pay for an extended stay in a nursing home (which is quite expensive).  For many people the home represents over 60% of a retirement plan. In my parents lifetime, their home value increased to roughly 10x what it was worth. If my home increases 4x instead this is a substantial adverse impact. If my child&#39;s home increases 0x this is disastrous.The things we fundamentally depend on to provide things as important in society as retirement are breaking badly.  Meanwhile we&#39;re so obsessed with political differences that we barely talk about or work towards solving the slow economic crisis we are facing."</p>

There is indeed a need then for Amazon to prevent user tracking in skills (like for example Apple does and requires consent by the user).
But to come to the conclusion that Amazon shares the data with advertisers I would have expected an experiment with eliminating skills as a reason and just having personas interact with Alexa core services. I guess just from shopping questions or general knowledge questions a lot of information for ad targeting could be inferred. If that’s however not influencing ads served when no skills are used, then it’s not necessarily Amazon directly sharing the information, but the skills being able to do so using Amazons provided tooling.That’s a difference at least for my interpretation how “evil” company xyz is."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why would facebook block an open source initiative, considering that they&#39;ve contributed a ton of open source software (react, graphql, pytorch, etc)? The more simple explanation is that an automated detector misclassified the link because it shares patterns with spam links."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook is fighting against the &#34;huge target on its back&#34; effect. The bigger of an audience you are, the more interest there is in posting abusive content, whether it&#39;s spam, trolling, or something else.The result is usually that you end up digging a bigger and bigger moat around your submission and curation process, so that your service is not completely flooded with crap.I think this is what you are seeing here, rather than censorship of this specific link or cause.I once posted a URL to a forum site I was developing for a community to Facebook, and somehow it set off the spam detector. For the next several months, I would get regular notices that a comment I left on another group&#39;s discussion was marked as spam, and was not visible to anyone else. I was posting regular comments, without links, apolitical, not critical of anyone, just adding to the discussion.The notices have since stopped, but I still rarely get any response to my comments, and anything I post to my profile&#39;s feed usually gets &#34;ignored&#34; completely, while in the past I&#39;d get a pretty stable number of likes from friends (in the low double digits or high single digits.)As someone who has moderated a decent size sub-reddit in the past, I understand that there&#39;s no malicious intent on Facebook&#39;s part in this. They are just so much bigger than this one individual that they simply cannot see me, the same way I cannot see a bacteria, and may not notice a tiny gnat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the contrary, it&#39;s not even slightly difficult to believe that this is not deliberate because it happens all the time.Not everything has to be a mad conspiracy. It&#39;s roughly one billion times easier to believe that a bad automated flagging system has triggered and marked this particular link as spam, than it is to believe that someone at Facebook is twirling their moustache, stroking their long-haired white cat, and hatching a plot to thwart the dastardly freedom-fighters of the open-source movement.Facebook&#39;s automated moderation systems are famously shit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is super cool.In case you don&#39;t make it through to the project&#39;s webpage howisfelix.today, and read through to the end, here is the creator&#39;s conclusion:Overall, having spent a significant amount of time building this project, scaling it up to the size it’s at now, as well as analysing the data, the main conclusion is that it is not worth building your own solution, and investing this much time. When I first started building this project 3 years ago, I expected to learn way more surprising and interesting facts. There were some, and it’s super interesting to look through those graphs, however retrospectively, it did not justify the hundreds of hours I invested in this project.I’ll likely continue tracking my mood, as well as a few other key metrics, however will significantly reduce the amount of time I invest in it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat, and interesting that his conclusion is that it&#39;s too much effort to do for oneself.My take on this is Timelinize[0], which is capable of downloading all your data from various digital records like social media, your phone, arbitrary files and unstructured folders, your Google account, etc. So it can aggregate data from Google Photos, Location History, Twitter, Facebook, text messages, and more, onto your computer, organized into a single timeline.(It is the successor to Timeliner[1].)I suppose Timelinize can support personal body metrics from various devices, and it is planned to support manual entries as well like journals. Analyses like his would also be possible.Data can be automatically imported on a regular basis via APIs (like, backing up your new tweets every day). The arbitrary file importer can also be scheduled to watch a directory for changes: just write a file or folder to that directory, and Timelinize will automatically import it (and optionally delete it when finished).Timelines are stored locally on your own computer, as plain files on disk, with a sqlite database as an index, so it should be a breeze to back up and use/read without proprietary software.The idea is to:- Back up your precious data that is otherwise held more-or-less hostage on somebody else&#39;s computers- While creating a detailed, personal journal for your family history- In a way that can show you your life in context with others&#39; timelines and the wider world.[0]: https://twitter.com/timelinize (No actual website yet.)[1]: https://github.com/mholt/timeliner"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project is super cool. I would recommend the author starts tracking the amount of CO2 he emits in a year, which could easily be approximated with the flight/transportation and food data he has. Carbon emissions per Capita per year in the US: 18 metric tonnes. In Italy: 8 metric tonnes [1]. Author is probably close to 60-80 with all the transatlantic flights.[1] https://www.theguardian.com/environment/datablog/2009/sep/02..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Refreshingly honest about the video quality you should expect in the main promo video. Typical problems like dynamic range, color profile, light bleed and tracking problems with the top of the head being cut off at one point. Pretty typical unless you spend more money on your drone or camera equipment. There are so many companies that fake the footage or pick much easier shooting locations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is such a fun/playful idea, kudos to Snap!Their first hardware product pretty much bombed but this is oddly one of the first consumer tech toys in a while that I&#39;ve felt I wanted. I can definitely see this being a fun thing to bring out in the backyard or to cookouts/parties, especially as a dad with young kids too.A couple things I&#39;d be a bit worried about:* Battery life would need to last long enough to use this on and off for a few hours. If it&#39;s like 15 mins then no way.* Would there be an audible hum in the video it records from the 4x propellers?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People saying that this can’t compete with DJI are missing the point.This product knows its target market (hint, not the people who browse HN) and, based on my initial first impressions, I think it’s nailed it.Forgive me for a slightly contrived analogy, but if a 
DJI Mavic is a DSLR, and a DJI Mini is a portable point-and-shoot camera, then Pixy is a Polaroid. It’s certainly not got the highest picture quality, doesn’t have good altitude or range and the 30s flight time sounds laughable, but it’s a nice looking, approachable device that looks like it could be used by anyone to take videos they currently can’t with the devices they currently have (the mode dial is a brilliant idea.)I think this thing will sell very nicely. The big question for me is whether the Pixy wireless streaming to the phone allows exports out of the Snapchat app, if it does then all the biggest TikTok stars will buy one immediately and it will explode in popularity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great list, but:&gt; To keep young kids behaving on a car road trip, have a bag of their favorite candy and throw a piece out the window each time they misbehave.That&#39;s terrible advice. Treat children with respect! They are very smart, they just lack experience. If they &#34;misbehave&#34;, talk to them and explain why this is not good. If you can&#39;t find an explanation, chances are you are wrong and you should reevaluate your position.But never, never, never willfully hurt them by throwing away their favorite candy. So wrong on so many levels.This was a big surprise for me in this list as I mostly agree with the items before it. Or, to use a previous item:&gt; You’ll get 10x better results by elevating good behavior rather than punishing bad behavior, especially in children and animals.Well said."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  When checking references for a job applicant, employers may be reluctant or prohibited from saying anything negative, so leave or send a message that says, “Get back to me if you highly recommend this applicant as super great.” If they don’t reply take that as a negative.Big disagree here, that&#39;s not fair at all to the applicant. Some people are just terrible referees and it&#39;s hard to know that as the applicant until someone lets you down. Some people mean to reply but forget, some people are too busy to answer and don&#39;t get back to you, some people just don&#39;t want to even though they think you&#39;d be an excellent candidate. On top of that, with people moving around so much it can be hard to nail down recent contact details.If somewhere I&#39;m applying to work can&#39;t get a hold of someone, I&#39;d very much expect them to reach back out to me in order to resolve the issue, if they can&#39;t do me that courtesy then I guess I&#39;ll be working somewhere else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll be honest here, I found this list mostly banal and also not really actionable. I think anyone could generate a similar list with a few Google searches and many of these tips I have seen written by other others and this guy has just re-phrased them. Basically generic self-help.I think a better option is to choose one particular thing you want to improve in yourself and have a focused plan to work on it. However this takes work and effort that most will never do. Reading a big list of 50 sentences will make zero difference to your life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My Anecdotal Experience:Golang is great for spinning up new services and tools with very little overhead, the language is well designed for the backend - and the lack of &lt;insert programming language feature here&gt; avoids &#34;odd&#34; decisions which other engineers will dislike in the future.  If your job is building lots of new things using relatively common building blocks, then Golang looks fantastic!However on mature services, engineers often need &lt;insert programming language here&gt; because they are dealing with something extremely complex.   The author of this blog post digs into the scenario for a package which needs to support different non-nix operating systems, but the same can be true of an app which has to manage many different kinds of objects (Kubernetes, or any service with many DAOs). Alternately there are engineers building all kinds of weird software which may do new things in novel simplified ways.  Golang occasionally makes expressing these types of applications more difficult.Overall I enjoyed my time writing go, until I tried to write a statistics based application for a startup idea back in 2016.  The project didn&#39;t get very far, and that was partly due to me getting bored having to deal with all of the different numeric data types, at the time the lack of generics made it so that you either had to use reflection - or implement the same function N times over to support the different numeric data types.  This tedium killed my love of the language (I&#39;m sure it&#39;s a better experience in 2022)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Golang is great because it was the first to include excellent tooling in addition to the language (strict compiler, linting, non-customizable  gofmt, package manager, good html docs, online playground, etc.)It’s undeniable that it brought a lot of good ideas that languages like Rust borrowed.Golang is still undefeated in terms of battery included. Its standard library is top notch and full featured.On the other hand it is more high-level, has a GC, and has made a number of mistakes (no sum types). The biggest trade off it does though: it lacks expressiveness. The new generic will probably help, but the trade off of Golang is deep. It makes writing code harder so that reading is easier."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t understand entropy and this article did not change it. The issue I take is with the definition of &#34;the most likely state&#34;.Think of a series of random bits that can be either 0 or 1 with equal probability. How likely is it that they are all 0 or all 1? Not very likely. There is exactly one configuration. How likely is it that they have a specific configuration of 0 and 1? Equally likely. All states are equally likely. If you randomly flip bits you go from one state to another state but each one is equally likely to occur. There is no special meaning to a specific configuration if you don&#39;t give it one.If you look at the average of all bits you start grouping all states together with the equal number of 1s. If you talk about the average there is only one configuration that is all 1s but most configurations have roughly 50% 1s. If you now start flipping bits you will meander through all possible bit-states but the average will most likely be close to 50% 1s most of the time.In physics we usually look at averages such as the average velocity expressed as temperature. Therefore it makes sense to group together all states using the average and then the states with very low or very high averages are few.But if you look deeper than that averaging it stops making sense to me. It&#39;s a completely different world. I don&#39;t know what Entropy is supposed to mean on the level of individual states/configurations. I don&#39;t understand what kind of macroscopic &#34;averaging&#34; function we may use to group up those states. There could be more than one possibility - from that would follow that there is more than one definition of macro-Entropy. Ideally there should be one general definition of how we have to look at those microstates and from that follows our general definition of Entropy. Sadly I didn&#39;t study Physics and this topic still continues to confuse me. The usual explanations fail to enlighten me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One aspect of entropy that I always find counterintuitive is that unlike mass, charge, etc. it is not a physical quantity. In fact, from the point of view of an experimenter with perfect information about a physical system, the entropy of the system is exactly conserved over time (as made precise by Liouville&#39;s Theorem). The Second Law survives in this setting only in the most trivial sense that a constant function does not decrease.It&#39;s only when you start making crude measurements---lumping positions into pixels, clouds of particles each with their own kinetic energy into a single scalar called &#34;temperature,&#34; etc---that you start to see a nontrivial entropy and Second Law. Different ways of lumping microstates into macrostates will give you different (and inconsistent) notions of entropy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of a great article that I saw on Hacker news that really helped explain the concept of Entrophy to me.  Linked here:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24140808"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem is that spam was/is so bad that extreme measures were taken to curb it. There are all kinds of invisible forces that you abutt that can be difficult to figure out, such as IP blacklists and the like. And even if you set everything up properly and host your email with a responsible host, Microsoft will still mark your mail as spam.I host my own email server with Vultr on an OpenBSD VM using OpenSMTPD and Dovecot, relaying all outbound mail through SMTP2Go (their free tier more than meets my needs). I have all of the necessary DNS entries set to mark my mail as legit, and I sign all outgoing mail using strong 2048-bit RSA keys. Thus far, I&#39;m able to send mail and not have it marked as spam (at least to everyone that I&#39;ve corresponded with thus far). It was a lot of work to get to that point, but not terrible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been self-hosting email for about 20 years, from a dedicated server in Europe. The server hardware has been replaced a couple of times but kept its IP.If you set everything up right, and choose the host for your mail server carefully, and never change IP, after a fairly short time you won&#39;t have much problem with being marked as spam. No more so than with any other email host.As is so often the case, the people that say you should never do it probably have little relevant experience, they are just repeating something they heard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot to say here from both sides - people running their own mail infrastructure (like I have for almost 25 years) and big mail providers dealing with brutal, unrelenting spam.But there is one piece of this that&#39;s ridiculous, broken and almost cruel:  silently dropping messages marked as &#34;spam&#34; with no notification given back to the sender.Why does this practice exist ?  Who believes that this is decent or acceptable behavior ?If gmail doesn&#39;t want my inbound message - for any reason - that is just fine.If they drop it on the floor without telling me that is totally shitty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"E Ink (the company) keeps improving their electrophoresis display technology. Unfortunately the technology necessarily has very low refresh rates since it it is based on moving around solid particles submerged in a liquid.There were other passive e-paper display technologies like the one by Liquavista (based on moving colored oil droplets) or Mirasol by Qualcomm (mechanical micro-shutters create colored light via interference). These were capable of achieving high refresh rates, but unfortunately they have long been abandoned.I believe the monochromatic electrophoresis displays by E Ink had higher reflectivity and lower price, which is what mattered for e-readers, so all the others went out of business."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing that always bothers me about these articles, and I completely accept it may just me reading into it what I want to see, is I immediately assume the dollar figure is annual. $160k/yr sounds like great passive income. You could certainly stop working a 9-5 and build out a really great lifestyle business.But then I look at the article. Oh, it&#39;s over six years? Okay, $26k/yr is a lot less and all of a sudden it&#39;s a big risk to try and turn that into a real business. Wait, what&#39;s that in the screenshot? 78 books? $341 per book, per year. And my thought goes from &#34;that sounds like a great little business!&#34; to &#34;fuck that&#34; within about fifteen seconds.And such is the lifecycle of these &#34;how I made $n doing x&#34; articles. Great claims that when you dig into them, the resulting wisdom is basically &#34;do a lot of work, and have a little bit of luck.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Writing (from a quick skim check) at least 16 books over a period of 6 years, and earning money from that, is not exactly what I&#39;d call &#34;passive income&#34;. And given the topics are mostly (all?) about niches in current technologies they also won&#39;t continue to deliver passively forever.A more appropriate title and angle might be &#34;How I&#39;ve earned $10k/book and manage to keep writing more while maintaining a day job&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve spent a fair amount of time talking with nurses about the problems. I&#39;m related to a bunch of people who are nurses across disciplines (ER, ICU, med/surg, etc). It&#39;s been enlightening hearing them talk about the problems...1. Many new nurses make the same or more and long time nurses. It&#39;s frustrating when the nurse in charge with the most experience is making less than new nurses. Some hospitals are even trying to stop nurses from talking about pay.2. Patients in COVID have become downright mean. Add this to the problems nurses have management and doctors (who are often rude and arrogant) and it&#39;s a poor culture. The quality of the environment, from a mental health standpoint, is on the decline.3. IT systems that they have to use were designed by people who have not talked with the workers who use them. They may have been designed with laws and compliance in mind. Nurses aren&#39;t the people who choose or pay for these systems. But, they use them a lot (maybe the most) and it&#39;s obvious they weren&#39;t taken into account when designing the UX. It&#39;s maddening for them.This one is big for product designers. Often we listen to the people who pay for it and miss out on the people who actually have to use it.4. Nurses are the catch all for jobs. Not enough aides? Nurses do the work. Food service workers don&#39;t want to take food into a patients room... nurses will do it. Not only do they have higher ratios of patients but they fill in the work when other areas have shortages, too. So, the work per patient goes up. Pay doesn&#39;t go up, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this a shock?- Demanding work: 12 hour shifts, irregular schedules, night shifts, physically exhausting, limited breaks (including bathroom/water!)- High responsibility with unsafe conditions. You&#39;re literally responsible for people&#39;s lives. Poor staffing ratios stretch you thin and make you more likely to make mistakes. And if you make a mistake, you&#39;re at huge risk for litigation... and now criminal consequences too. Responsibilities, resources, and staffing stretched even thinner due to the pandemic.- Administration that treats you as something to be optimized and does the absolute bare minimum to support you. Instead they tack on additional tasks, expectations, and requirements (&#34;no water at a nurse&#39;s station!&#34;). They encourage a culture where nurses provide a concierge service to &#39;guests&#39; instead of critical care to patients.- Hostile/entitled patients. I&#39;d guess many/most patients are not an issue, but it only takes a couple of difficult/combative patients to really ruin your conditions.- Low pay given the responsibility and working conditions for non-travel nurses. https://nurseslabs.com/nurse-salary/#nurse_salaries_by_state Like many others pointed out here, in tech I make way more than a nurse for a job that&#39;s less demanding, has far lower stakes, and is of far less value to society.To me the blame lies mainly in middle/upper management, whose role is to build and empower an effective workforce.

It was recently revealed that they will be shuttering almost all pediatric services in the next year because they can 10x their profits by only serving elderly clients. The entire purpose of this organization was to provide pediatric healthcare, and it wasn’t losing money…Sometimes, it feels like we’re min-maxing ourselves to death over here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very favorable comments all around from the very online crowd who comments here.  I’m much more skeptical.I have no doubt this will work well for some students, but as someone who taught online for the better part of two years I can say with certainty that the experience is very different and (for the wide majority of students) worse than being in person.My colleagues and I can attest to both general learning loss (ie., forgetting specific subject matter information) and a loss of broader “studying skills” (ie., coming to class and doing homework) after the pandemic.In intro classes in our department, mean grades have been a whole standard deviation lower than the long run pre-pandemic average.  That’s a huge effect!This is also not just specific to our department or university but has been written about widely in the higher ed press.People have been confidently predicting that online education “is the future” since the 1990’s.  IMO the lesson of the pandemic is “no it’s not and it’s never going to be.”If online works for you, awesome.  Enjoy!   There are great resources out there.   But I don’t think you are in the majority."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Online learning resources are amazing. Compared to pre-internet, the depth, quality and accessibility is amazing. It really does open an opportunity route for a lot of people.However...Institutional learning, whether it&#39;s K-12, colleges, techs or whatnot have barely changed. The same fundamental dynamics exist, whether it&#39;s tertiary sorting and prestige or primary teaching methods. Education still serves and fails the same groups of people as it did before, in much the same way.Education is an enormous &#34;industry.&#34; It&#39;s in the same realm as defense, energy or transport. Possibly even more important.I really hope to see online resources develop in such a way that schools can be built around them. A formula that a middle school principal anywhere, no matter how rural and remote, can implement. Why can&#39;t we have the best of both worlds?The classroom model didn&#39;t work well for me as a student. I don&#39;t think remote-only would have worked either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am looking forward to the day, when quality formal education is available online to all which you may complete at your own pace instead of going with a strict semester and class system. Also, along with offline schools for supporting social learning and helping classes which require offline components like labs, in person support classes, interest based study groups etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Over the course of a few years I spent a lot of time in a secure environment in a DoD facility to which I had to travel multiple times for a project. The environment, a maze of cubicles filled with computers, had been installed inside a historic building. For historic preservation reasons, the exterior windows were kept as built. For security reasons, there was a sheet of plywood painted white inside all of the windows. The building allowed no natural light to enter and emitted only a diffuse glow. It was a miserable place to spend long days, illuminated only by flickering fluorescent light.We had some serious storms come through while I was there. A lot of the permanent residents went home. As I was a visitor and there just for as long as it took me to fix some problems, I was encouraged to stay and work late. I was assured that we would not lose power because the building had been recently equipped with a generator.A storm came through and the building lost power. It was almost entirely pitch black in the building full of computers, which all went dark, fans and disks suddenly silent. A small fraction of the emergency lights came on. Most were in disrepair and never lit up. It turns out that in a secure environment, one has to make special arrangements to have someone inspect the emergency lighting. We heard the generator spin up. Still no computers, no lights.In the darkness, one little nook came to life. This nook contained the coffee pot, microwave, and refrigerator. Apparently this organization considered only one piece of equipment important enough to be connected to the generator. We thereafter referred to it as the mission critical coffee pot."</p>

All the cool computers taken off the desks and stuck in server rooms and you had to use a managed windows PC which in my case managed to crash once or more times a day thanks to some aspect of the Rational Clearcase filesystem driver.I remember all the lectures from overconfident bullshitters with shiny shoes. A company run by salesmen. It is SO SO nice that IBM got eclipsed by the internet tech companies. Even if they are arrogant/difficult in their own way it was a victory for the technically and ethically competent.It seemed then that IBM was where software went to die."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem is not so much that selinux is too complicated (it is as complicated as it needs to be), but that we all run software we don&#39;t understand.The whole IT ecosystem has become a hail mary. Even admins usually have no idea what a certain program actually wants to do. If the admin knows how to install the app so that it actually runs, you call them a good admin.From a security point of view, an application is like a nuclear power plant. It&#39;s good if it works as planned, but if something blows up it endangers your whole enterprise.The whole container movement can be seen as putting the apps in a sarcophagus like Chernobyl. That way the radiation hopefully stays in, but history has shown that it really doesn&#39;t. Also, the wheel of history has just turned one more iteration and now admins just view the sarcophagus as something you deploy as you previously deployed the app. Who is responsible that it is air tight? Well, uh, nobody, really.You can&#39;t even blame the applications for that. Let&#39;s say you want to build a good, secure application. How do you know what files your application will try to open? What syscalls it wants to call? Library and framework functions tend to not document that properly.Obscure files like /etc/localtime, /etc/resolv.conf, /etc/ld.so.conf, /dev/zero ... how can you expect devs to build well documented and well sandboxable applications if they don&#39;t know which files their library functions will open?You may have heard of /etc/resolv.conf ... but have you heard of /etc/gai.conf? /etc/nsswitch.conf? /etc/host.conf? Wouldn&#39;t it be great if the man page of getaddrinfo mentioned those (mine only mentions gai.conf)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an experienced RHEL admin, a few years ago I probably would have said this is very bad advice in any professional context, and you should spend the time to learn it because it will save you one day.Now, I think my advice would be: Put everything in a container, and learn how to run Docker or Podman (or k8s) in a secure way (ie no root containers, be very careful with volume mounts, etc). Yes, they aren’t as mature as SELinux, but containers aim to provide many of the same benefits that SELinux does (and even more) except in a way that’s much easier to manage. Even better is that these container runtimes often come with SELinux and AppArmor policies out of the box on good Linux distros."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always preferred apparmor. SELinux has always seemed radically more complex for very little benefit, unless you have a tightly constrained OS (like Android, where the VM does most of the work and every app has the same sort of security policy) or a team of admins working full time to maintain it (again, like Android).Apparmor is weak in all the same ways SELinux is weak, at least in terms of the ways that actually matter - that is to say, a kernel exploit is the simplest way out of either. But anyone can write an apparmor profile for any program in an hour, and if you actually know wtf you&#39;re doing you can build very strong profiles and trivially test and maintain them.SELinux is &#34;good&#34; in that if you are building a system like Android, great, consumers get very tight policies for free, and SELinux is ultimately more expressive. But I think 99% of companies looking at an LSM MAC should probably roll apparmor."</p>

As Robert Lessig famously observed, &#34;code is law&#34; in a world controlled by computers. There is increasingly a strong argument I feel in States directly employing software engineers much like they typically employ armies of civil servants to implement policy.Why is software treated as something to be outsourced to a private sector company? Why can&#39;t we have &#34;civil programmers&#34; who contribute to an ever growing body of public code just as the legislative process contributes to an ever growing body of laws. This body of civil programmers (terrible name but hey) could also work hand in hand with the open source community, letting stakeholders (citizens) contribute too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So, former WGU student here, though I hadn&#39;t completed my degree.Many WGU students HATE these types of articles, because they undermine the legitimacy of WGU.WGU was not designed for traditional students, it was 100% designed for working professionals, where WGU will only admit you with a reasonable amount of experience in your field.WGU is regionally accredited, not nationally, and it&#39;s a non-profit. So it cannot be compared to University of Phoenix, ITT Tech, DeVry, etc.It was founded by a group of governors out west, hence the name. They realized that there were many working adults who possessed a great depth of knowledge, from long working in their fields, yet they had no paper credentials to show for that knowledge.Their model is competency-based, so you must demonstrate you posses knowledge in any given domain. If you can prove you do then you can test out right away, if you fail to then they offer a variety of resources to allow you to get up to par. In many cases classes are tied to obtaining industry certifications.It&#39;s not for everyone, but it is a far cry from a &#34;degree mill.&#34; Does it really matter if a person that has knowledge got it from sitting in a seat, paying ungodly amounts of tuition, or if they got it from life experience? As long as a bar is set, and you can meet it, then that should be what really matters.Just my personal experience, from having attended the university. Unfortunately life sidetracked my completion, but I hope to return one day soon, and complete my program."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; On my first day, I completed 4 courses in the span of 4 hours. At a traditional school, it would have taken 4 months. It made me realize…I had underestimated how much knowledge I had gained from previous schools, jobs, projects, books, papers, and talks. This passage underscores how, for this guy and whoever he was selling himself to, a CS degree was just a credential. He did not have much intention of actually learning anything. That’s (I believe) fundamentally different than most people who seek college degrees."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"“ Medicine has become a three-way negotiation between you, your doctor, and The Algorithm.”This characterization makes it sound like a good thing.  In reality, the doctor’s responsibility is being pushed to the patient because they are overbooked in the name of economic efficiency.As a patient with complex, non-specific medical condition, I can tell you how miserable this is.I can’t count on doctors _at all_ to move the process forward.  It’s always me, reading articles on PubMed and coming up with ideas.I’m not medically trained nor am I scientist.  It’s a lot of legwork for me normally, but the ways that being sick limits me make it much harder.Further, the emotional and intellectual overhead required to negotiate with medical professionals is high.Back when I could afford to, I saw a neurologist at an office that didn’t accept insurance.  She choose to see fewer patients and give them more time, as well as spend time doing research to look for new clues and ideas.This worked really well and I made progress with her.The rest of the American medical system?  Gatekeepers that block access to potential treatment pathways until you can convince them it’s worth a try."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why are dentists so scammy?In Norway I&#39;ve seen documentaries about them sending the same people to multiple dentists, and some of them receive wildly different advice. Some of that can be ascribed to some being in the school of pro-active, so they want to fix your teeth at the first glance of issues. But in the end, most of the things being quoted were unnecessary. They all seemed very intent on removing wisdom teeth, even when they pose no problems.They re-did the experiment recently, and I think one of the guys they sent got his teeth cleaned and tartar removed from 10 dentists in a week or so. No one stopped to see if it was actually needed, they all just do it by default and charge you for it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It would be interesting to see the gain curve of this speaker.My (limited) experience with piezoelectric speakers is that they resonate at a single frequency very loudly, and are practically silent outside the resonant peak. Perfect for a microwave beeper, but never going to produce audible speech.The &#34;high-quality&#34; descriptor makes it sound like they have produced a reasonably flat gain curve, which seems really significant! But without any explanation I&#39;m skeptical.It may even be as silly as using an unintuitive technical definition of &#34;quality&#34; - in a second order linear system, the &#34;quality&#34; of the gain curve is the ratio of the amplitude at the peak to the input amplitude... The exact opposite of what a reasonable person would consider high-quality sound."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To overcome this problem, the MIT team rethought the design of a thin-film loudspeaker. Rather than having the entire material vibrate, their design relies on tiny domes on a thin layer of piezoelectric material which each vibrate individually. These domes, each only a few hair-widths across, are surrounded by spacer layers on the top and bottom of the film that protect them from the mounting surface while still enabling them to vibrate freely.Whoa, does this mean an array of individually addressable micro-speakers becomes feasible? Like pixels in a computer screen, send different signals to each tiny speaker? That would mean craaaazy spatial audio, if I&#39;m not mistaken."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; When 25 volts of electricity were passed through the device at 1 kilohertz (a rate of 1,000 cycles per second), the speaker produced high-quality sound at conversational levels of 66 decibels. At 10 kilohertz, the sound pressure level increased to 86 decibelsRead: Tinny af.Nonetheless, VERY exciting technology. Will be interesting to watch as it matures."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"During a hostile takeover, someone buys 51% of the shares. They then elect a board of people who will approve whatever they want.Then they can do things like &#39;merge&#39; the company with some other company they own at a board-approved value-per-share. That value will be much lower than what they paid per share when buying it on the open market, but not so low that the government gets involved. Eg: Musk buys the shares at $50/share, and then &#39;merges&#39; the company at $25/share, effectively forcing 49% of the shares to be sold at half price. Those shareholders get screwed because they didn&#39;t sell their shares during the initial takeover.Edit: Or, just run the company however they want and share the profits with the other 49%, but ignore their votes, etc.The Poison Pill says &#34;If a hostile takeover starts, we&#39;ll create and sell new shares at a reduced price to existing shareholders- other than the attacker- to prevent the 51% scenario&#34;. This is done not to prevent any takeover, but in the interest of the 49% of holdouts who would have been screwed over. It&#39;s an effective block against the takeover.The board represents ALL the shareholders, after all. They don&#39;t want to see anyone get screwed.But now Musk has made a deal that the board has approved. All shareholders get a specific price that is approved. The board wants this to happen, so there&#39;s no poison pill."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nobody knows yet why the board relented, but the scuttlebutt seems to be that Twitter arranged an internal valuation once Musk put a price on the company, presumably as justification for an internal plan that they&#39;d announce as their alternative to acquisition, and the valuation actually showed Musk was overpaying for the income Twitter was likely to generate.(If the board hadn&#39;t relented, Musk&#39;s next step would have been to arrange for a tender offer, which goes directly to the shareholders, but does not involved Musk acquiring new shares, but rather just a commitment to buy those shares if the board drops the poison pill. Successfully getting that commitment would be a very strong signal to the board, which would likely then drop the shareholder rights plan and allow the acquisition to proceed. But Twitter&#39;s board skipped those steps.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The poison pill was intended to prevent a takeover without the board’s approval (buying 51% on the open market)The board is negotiating an approved takeover which is entirely differentI.e. the board was saying “you can only buy Twitter if we say so”There was no reversal of intentions"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I already commented in the first submission of this article:Now that&#39;s something I can really use in one of my current problems. Calculating a minimal perfect hash by creating acyclic random graphs. This conjecture gives now tresholds when to stop trying creating random graphs and start afresh.This eg is needed for large perfect hashes in gperf or integer sets in compilers, such as eg. for C switch statements with Unicode. switch in C is only efficient for dense tables, but not sparse. sparse tables are linear, but could be constant. A switch in Pascal was constant, but so far GCC and llvm didn&#39;t care. gperf neither.see http://ilan.schnell-web.net/prog/perfect-hash/algo.html and http://programming.sirrida.de/hashing.html#c_case_of_string"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the original letter:  While well-intentioned, we believe that many of the changes proposed by the CMF are deeply misguided and will disproportionately harm under-resourced students. Adopting them would result in a student population that is less prepared to succeed in STEM and other 4-year quantitative degrees in college.  The CMF states that &#39;many students, parents, and teachers encourage acceleration beginning in grade eight (or sooner) because of mistaken beliefs that Calculus is an important high school goal.&#39;

The updated CMF looks better, but I just don&#39;t see how an educator who knows math or how to teach math could come to such a conclusion (that Calculus should not be a goal). If it is well-intentioned, what was the intention... to dumb down math in high school? Perhaps we need to educate those who are coming up with the math frameworks in math and science, or to get people who care on the California Department of Education?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SF CA resident, parent of two school age children chiming in. The direction with math seems pretty dismal, in that as of right now, everyone is singly tracked together for math through freshman year of high school. This results in children who have higher aptitudes[1] to not be well served by schools. The majority of people I know who have the means opt out of the public school system, which probably makes the problem worse generally but solves a pain point for them.[1] - I take it as a fact that different people have different talent levels for different things, but not everyone agrees with that, and disagreement on this point is a big driver (but not the only driver) in the &#34;everyone gets exactly the same&#34; approach that is trending now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something is rotten in the state of academia when looking at the evidence there are mathematicians, scientists and social scientists standing bravely in favour of a high bar and a quality education program in mathematics.On the other side of the argument you have people from the Department of Education who specialize in Mathematics Education who seem happy to lower the bar as far as possible in the name of equality.When I was in University the Department of Education was the most woke department on campus, except for perhaps the Department of Gender Studies. We are now seeing policies that favour wokeness ahead of the best interests of the students affected by the policies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, all.  Author here.  Thanks for all the great feedback.I&#39;ve learned a lot from your comments and pointers.The Zed project is broader than &#34;a jq alternative&#34; and my bad for trying out this initial positioning.  I do know there are a lot of people out there who find jq really confusing, but it&#39;s clear if you become an expert, my arguments don&#39;t hold water.We&#39;ve had great feedback from many of our users who are really productive with the blend of search, analytics, and data discovery in the Zed language, and who find manipulating eclectic data in the ZNG format to be really easy.Anyway, we&#39;ll write more about these other aspects of the Zed project in the coming weeks and months, and in the meantime, if you find any of this intriguing and want to kick the tires, feel free to hop on our slack with questions/feedback or file GitHub issues if you have ideas for improvements or find bugs.Thanks a million!https://github.com/brimdata/zed

								<p class="story__comment_others">"jq is incredibly powerful and I&#39;m using it more and more. Even better, there is a whole ecosystem of tools that are similar or work in conjunction with jq:* jq (a great JSON-wrangling tool)* jc (convert various tools’ output into JSON)* jo (create JSON objects)* yq (like jq, but for YAML)* fq (like jq, but for binary)* htmlq (like jq, but for HTML)List shamelessly stolen from Julia Evans[1]. For live links see her page.Just a few days ago I needed to quickly extract all JWT token expiration dates from a network capture. This is what I came up with:    fq &#39;grep(&#34;Authorization: Bearer.*&#34; ) | print&#39; server.pcap | grep -o &#39;ey.*$&#39; | sort | uniq | \
    jq -R &#39;[split(&#34;.&#34;) | select(length &gt; 0) | .[0],.[1] | gsub(&#34;-&#34;;&#34;+&#34;) | gsub(&#34;_&#34;;&#34;/&#34;) | @base64d | fromjson]&#39; | \
   jq &#39;.[1]&#39; | jq &#39;.exp&#39; | xargs -n1 -I! date &#39;+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&#39; -d @! 

It&#39;s not a beauty but I find the fact that you can do it in one line, with proper parsing and no regex trickery, remarkable.[1] https://jvns.ca/blog/2022/04/12/a-list-of-new-ish--command-l..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Whenever jq comes up I feel obligated to mention &#39;gron&#39;[1]. If all you&#39;re doing is trying to grep some deeply nested field, it&#39;s way easier with gron, IMHO.[1] https://github.com/tomnomnom/gron"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wish that LineageOS could accept the &#34;signature spoofing&#34; patch that is needed for microg (possibly with a toggle switch that would be &#34;off&#34; by default), so that we could avoid the need for the less-frequently-updated https://lineage.microg.org/ and properly install apps from Play Store without the Google Service Framework (that essentially give root access to Google on your smartphone).(and actually I also wish they could implement the shims developed by https://grapheneos.org/usage#sandboxed-google-play in order to sandbox the google play services, so that the user could choose between approach 1 (microg with signature spoofing) and approach 2 (sandboxed GSF) on any smartphone supported by LineageOS (grapheneos only supports Pixel phones due to their ability to relock the bootloader))"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just switched to LineageOS 18 w/ MicroG and oh my lord is this stuff still complicated. I&#39;m fairly familiar with this stuff and yet still it took me many hours to set everything up correctly. To be clear, this is not the fault of LineageOS, this is simply the state of the FOSS Android environment and the fact that Google has no interest in supporting this setup whatsoever, to put it mildly. Not only is it complicated, it also seems to change pretty much every year.First the question is how to transfer all your application data, for which there still seems to be no surefire way. I settled on &#34;Neo Backup&#34;, which mostly worked fine, except for Signal (of course...), and the darned Microsoft Authenticator.So first unlock the bootloader (good luck), then you need to find the correct TWRP for your phone (and careful with 32/64 bit) and flash it via fastboot.Then I flashed LineageOS, which worked fine. Luckily I found an image which already had the signature spoofing patch included, so I didn&#39;t have to worry about that. How do you get root? SuperSU? XPosed? Magisk? OK it seems everybody&#39;s using Magisk nowadays. OK, flashing worked fine, but now, how do you get MicroG on it? If you look at the MicroG homepage, you might think you can just install it with F-Droid, and you actually can, but many things won&#39;t work (like FCM notifications). It needs to be a system app. I tried using the F-Droid Priviliged Extension, flashed it via TWRP, which seemed to work fine but actually wasn&#39;t installed and not working at all. Now what? There&#39;s a multitude of information in forums what to do. Some say to flash NanoDroid, but the last release was in January 2021, it seems it&#39;s not updated anymore? I settled on the &#34;MicroG installer revived&#34; Magisk module, which worked fine (btw, there&#39;s no curated Magisk module repo anymore, you have to search the web and hope you find something that&#39;s not malicious).Of course my banking apps refuse to run because &#34;U ROOTED UR PHONE&#34;, I search for Magisk Hide, it doesn&#39;t exist anymore, now you need to configure a &#34;Zygisk deny list&#34;, whatever that is. Then I also need to hide the Magisk app, my banking works now thank you very much. FCM notifications also work after I uninstall and reinstall my apps which need it...To be clear: I&#39;m eternally grateful to all the developers who make this possible in their spare time. This is not their fault."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Our very popular privacy oriented built-in firewall, restricted networking mode, and per app data isolation features were all rewritten to account for AOSP’s new restricted networking mode and BPF. Additionally, data restriction and network isolation features were merged into a single implementation. Combined, this means that one of our largest pain points each bringup should now be easier to forward port in future revisions!I&#39;m so glad to hear this. Every other custom ROM&#39;s Android 12 version had to remove the &#34;disable internet access per app&#34; feature.Lineage took its time to rebase to Android 12, but they did it without removing important features like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I switched from Linux Mint desktop to an M1 Air last year.Performance-wise, the M1 is very impressive, probably feels about 80% as fast as my 6 year old desktop (that sounds like snark, but it isn&#39;t). Meanwhile, the battery life is insane (I&#39;ve never brought the charger anywhere but my desk, and will often use it for a week out and about).I opted for the Magic Keyboard and Magic Touchpad, because I had a lot of trouble with everything else.I could not get a mouse setup that worked (I&#39;m strictly no acceleration, and macOS&#39;s acceleration was literally making my arm ache).I switched because I stopped being a fulltime developer, my main machine was getting old (6 years), and macOS has good MS Office support.Overall I&#39;d say I&#39;m about 70% efficient vs on Linux, a bit less so when in active development. The mobility makes up for it, and efficiency just isn&#39;t as important to my day-to-day for now.Many of my gripes are listed elsewhere, but things like middle-click paste is something that is easy to write off but was actually a gigantic part of my process. Also, the fact that everything I want to tweak requires buying an app?I had to pay for an app in order to properly emulate middle clicks on the touchpad! That&#39;s bonkers!I&#39;ll leave this final tidbit though:On Linux:* Open Spotify* Press play button on keyboard* Spotify playsOn Mac:* Open Spotify* Press play button on keyboard* Apple Music opens ??????"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"2 of these 3 things, I have done multiple times on a Mac.  Mounting NFS is natively supported in macOS and has been for nearly a decade.  Mounting SSH is supported by 3rd-party tools, yes, but they&#39;re the same cross-platform 3rd-party tool you&#39;d use in Linux... sshfs, which is built on top of FUSE, which is something you can install on a Mac and is not installed by default in most Linux distributions (although fair enough it&#39;s installed by default on Ubuntu).The only thing I wasn&#39;t familiar with is MTP, which is apparently a Windows-specific protocol that Microsoft forced into the USB standard in later versions, and as far as I know across decades of using Linux, BSD, Windows, and macOS across multiple computers on the same network with shared peripherals I&#39;ve never even used this protocol.What&#39;s the complaint again?OS choice is mostly a personal preference.  As far as I am personally concerned, FreeBSD is the best OS possible to use, and macOS is second best.  But I don&#39;t write blog posts telling people that their preference is incapable of doing things my preference is capable of doing, and if I were to do so, I&#39;d at least do my research first to make sure it was correct."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Read MTP devices&gt; Mount an SSH or NFS driveI know fanboy debates are tiresome, but... I really do struggle to comprehend taking a device that can&#39;t do these things seriously as a computer.As a toy yes, or as a specialised tool for video or audio rendering, which... fair enough. But moving bytes is something any general purpose computing device should be good at. It&#39;s almost something you have to actively design out. It&#39;s certainly a deliberate, non-budget-constrained choice from Cupertino to be bad at this.Crap like &#34;should Apple be [scanning for CSAM | scanning for copyright | scanning for anti-CCP | whatever I&#39;ve almost stopped caring ] before uploading to iCloud?&#34; exists primarily because the devices are so bad at moving bytes around without relying on iCloud."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well done. That&#39;s a respectable number of sales for your first year!The economics of self publishing is interesting. When I think back on
my first book I count at least 5 years research that enabled me to be
able to write it, 3 years writing it and then many years selling the
thing around industry.  By a pessimistic account I was about £500k
down :) Like you, the first year I sold about 500. Unlike online
fulfilment today, I spent that time stuffing envelopes, staring at a
slowly shrinking pile of boxes in the corner of my study, printing
labels, with occasional trips to the post-office. It was actually
work, and many times I thought &#39;this is crazy&#39;. It doubled for two
more years until dealing with the orders actually became too much
(while doing a &#34;real job&#34;).On the other hand, it got me a string of well paying jobs, established
me as the go-to consultant in a niche, invitations to talk and teach
all around the world, and basically transformed my career. So putting
a &#34;net profit&#34; number to it seems unfathomable. Each book you write,
if researched from scratch, is kinda equivalent to a PhD.What happened next is that I sold the title, from my own publishing
company to a large publisher (MIT). Publishers don&#39;t take many risks
these days, but they will buy a book that already has reasonable
number of sales as a going concern. The advantage is that all
mechanics and business is suddenly off your hands. Without an advance
to pay back you then have a modest income stream and time to write the
next book.Another effect of being a semi-professional writer, as a side gig, is
that other people want to pay you to edit, typeset, and review
works. Learning LaTeX and various markups and text processing tools
has been a huge gift. That can be quite fun if you&#39;re in a vibrant
field that genuinely interests you. And you don&#39;t have to be
associated with academia or a big-name institution for that to
work. In fact I&#39;d say that academics these days never have time for
writing and that most other successful authors I know are independent.I hope your book takes off even more, but right now I think you can
count 600 sales in the first year as a definite success!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My own experience convinces me there are many extra benefits to having written a book. My first book has been out for 4.5 years now. I know many people on Hacker News have read it and I&#39;m grateful to all of you.I&#39;ve enjoyed getting emails about it. Especially regarding &#34;badly managed startups&#34; and  &#34;abusive bosses&#34; many of you have reached out to share similar stories. Maybe at some point I&#39;ll do a blog post that collects some of those email stories. Some people thought I was destroying my career by revealing the dark side of startups, but some entrepreneurs appreciate my realism and practicality, so I&#39;ve gotten three very lucrative consulting jobs, thanks to that first book. And, surprisingly, the book has gotten more and more popular. It sold more this last year than it sold during its first two years. I assume that at some point the book will seem dated and obsolete, but at least for now it still strikes people as current, so the benefits of writing that book continue to pay dividends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I sold around 300 in my first year (which ended recently), which is much less than the other book I wrote via my publisher. Yet, even though it is sold at a lesser price, my self-published book made almost more money. This is essentially because the percentage I make on every sales with my publisher is really low (10%). So for my next book, I&#39;ll self publish as well.(the book btw https://securityhandbook.io/)"</p>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31151591">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Happy to see “secretlang” out in the open! I have been following development from afar and really like the idea of a “simple” take on a language, but with a lot of wisdom and affordances added since the state of the world back in 1972. In short, Hare seems to be a language that I really should like and I want to take it for a spin.What I find a bit confusing though is the licensing. I belong to the “BSD school”, but can at least claim that I understand (and respect) how GNU looks at things. Looking at Hare’s licensing [1], I am somewhat stumped and my usual modes of thinking no longer apply. What is the threat that warrants this level of complexity? A commercial fork? A community fork? Proprietary drivers? Are these really realistic enough threats to warrant this level of license complexity rather than just stamping ISC and CC-BY on the whole thing and not worry about forks at all? Yes, there is some writing in the README, but perhaps I am too thick to “get it”?[1]: https://git.sr.ht/~sircmpwn/hare#licensingLastly, a sanity check, am I reacting too strongly to this if I feel that it has a bit of chilling effect in terms of my excitement?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tagged union type seems a defining feature of Hare to me. It is not exactly &#34;tagged&#34; in the sense that it internally has tags but users don&#39;t explicitly see them [1]. This kind of types are normally headaches for language designers (cf. polymorphic variants in OCaml), but the Hare type system is simple enough that it doesn&#39;t pose a significant problem. In turn it gives an intuitive model of conversion; you don&#39;t have to convert from, say, one type of error to another type of error. Zig error type is also similar in this aspect, but it is not as general as Hare&#39;s tagged union type.[1] I really want to refer this as to &#34;untagged&#34; union type, but of course this will cause a confusion with C-style unsafe unions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since the language is officially announced now, here&#39;s an interesting analysis on the language: https://tilde.team/~kiedtl/blog/hare/Personally I&#39;m very interesting in playing with it. Generics, functional programming constructs, and a lot of the syntactic sugar you find in modern languages have their uses but I think there&#39;s a lot of merit to the idea that you might not want them in a systems language. I think cleaning up some of C&#39;s rough edges and providing batteries while keeping things extremely simple and clear is very compelling. I&#39;m also appreciative that it doesn&#39;t seem overly opinionated where it doesn&#39;t need to be.It&#39;s kind of a bummer that there&#39;s no MacOS support so I&#39;ll have to SSH into my linux box to play with it. I hope the language takes off and support for other platforms materializes. Congratulations to everyone who worked on this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s an all-time great post about why you might consider SQLite in production with data about performance: https://blog.wesleyac.com/posts/consider-sqliteI use SQLite in production for my SaaS[1]. It&#39;s really great — saves me money, required basically no setup/configuration/management, and has had no scaling issues whatsoever with a few million hits a month. SQLite is really blazing fast for typical SaaS workloads. And will be easy to scale by vertically scaling the vm it&#39;s hosted on.Litestream was the final piece of the missing puzzle that helped me use it in production — continuous backups for SQLite like other database servers have: https://litestream.io/ With Litestream, I pay literally $0 to back up customer data and have confidence nothing will be lost. And it took like 5 minutes to set up.I&#39;m so on-board the SQLite train you guys.[1] https://extensionpay.com — Lets developers take payments in their browser extensions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of my previous employers was using SQLite as a large distributed database - they had their own custom sharding strategy, but essentially the idea was to shard A accounts * B tables * C num_of_days with a .db file for every shard.When I first came and saw it, it...did not sound right. But I didn&#39;t want to be the guy who comes in and says &#34;you are doing it wrong&#34; month 1. So I went along with it.Of course, eventually problems started to pop up. I distinctly remember that the ingestion (happening via a lot of Kafka consumers) throughput was high enough that SQLite started to crumble and even saw WAL overruns, data loss etc. Fortunately, it wasn&#39;t &#34;real&#34; production yet.I suggested we move to Postgres and was eventually able to convince everyone from engineers to leadership. We moved to a custom sharded Postgres (9.6 at the time). This was in 2016. I spoke to people at the place last month, and it&#39;s still humming along nicely.This isn&#39;t to illustrate anything bad about SQLite, to be clear! I like it for what it does. Just to show at least 1 use case where it was a bad fit.SQLite was a tempting first answer, but what solved it was Postgres, and we eventually offloaded a lot of aggregation tables to Clickhouse and turned the whole thing into a warehouse where the events got logged."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The sqlite docs page has a nice article [1] on when to use an embedded database such as sqlite and when to go with a client/server model (postgres, mysql or others)When not to use sqlite:- Is the data separated from the application by a network?- Many concurrent writers?- Data size &gt; 280 TBFor device-local storage with low writer concurrency and less than a terabyte of content, SQLite is almost always better.[1] https://www.sqlite.org/whentouse.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I consumed a lot of blog posts like this before becoming a manager. It feels satisfying to read vague principles like this:&gt; Facilitate wellbeing&gt; Personal safety, dignity, and wellbeing of every team member are paramount. Team success is only success if team members feel good about it.But then you become an actual manager and realize that these are largely just feel-good aphorisms that don&#39;t really help navigate the hard work of being a manager.Don&#39;t get me wrong: I think &#34;facilitate wellbeing&#34; and similar tidbits are valid advice. Likewise, a manager who chooses to not facilitate wellbeing would clearly be in the wrong. But when you get into management you realize that the hard work isn&#39;t waking up and deciding to facilitate wellbeing. The hard work often involves making unpopular decisions, or telling someone &#34;no&#34; when their pet request wouldn&#39;t be in the best interests of the team, or defusing interpersonal conflict among two team members who have been feuding for months.These feel-good blog posts seem rather vacuous after being in the trenches of management for several years. Again, not because the advice is bad or wrong, but because it&#39;s just a lot of text around the basics of being a decent human being. Learning how to do the hard things about management or how to make unpopular but necessary decisions is something that you won&#39;t learn from the average blog post or LinkedIn post, largely because these function more as personal branding pieces than actual advice.In my experience, the best management advice comes from talking to the best managers you know personally. Online, the most practical management advice comes on smaller forums where people are either anonymous (and therefore less interested in personal brand building) or older and accomplished (and therefore not worried about blowback impacting their career). The type of feel-good blog posts or LinkedIn blurbs that people associate with their personal brand don&#39;t really add much value after you&#39;ve read 5-10 articles saying the exact same aphorisms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lot of misconceptions here that cause teams to underperform.1. Managing comes first. (Nope, as a manager your are primarily responsible for ensuring a good outcome. As your title goes from manager, senior, higher to VP etc this becomes more important. Lower job titles you get paid to &#34;do the work&#34;, higher titles are about &#34;achieve outcome&#34;.) In the current market you&#39;ll often run into team members that don&#39;t perform. I see this so often where leads think that they have to &#34;manage&#34; and not do the work and the result is them and their team failing
2. Facilitate wellbeing. That&#39;s nice. But your primary responsibility is to A. Achieve the goal. B. hold people accountable to an acceptable level of performanceGive credit, take blame: That&#39;s a good one.This post is just full of vague language that doesn&#39;t hold anyone accountable. Sucks to be an IC on that team, thinking everything is going well and eventually end up having whole teams being fired since your manager didn&#39;t set the right pace."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Optimize work distribution
&gt; Managers have a portfolio of work that the business needs and people with work preferences. Optimize the dual objectives of delivering value to the organization and giving individuals problems that build their skillset, impact, satisfaction, and/or advancement. Performance is contextual; set people up to shine.I find this so important. A good manager has a good mental map of the business&#39;s short-term and long-term goals, and a corresponding map of each person on the team&#39;s short-term and long-term goals (and strengths/weaknesses) . This map requires constant updating and refining. The magic happens in finding the right fit between all of that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Recycling partially used soap is a good idea. Making sure everyone around the world has access to soap is certainly super important.There&#39;s really no reason US recycled soap needs to be the soap that is sent to (eg) Africa, shipped over oceans. Doesn&#39;t (eg) Africa have it&#39;s own soap production facilities? But I guess American consumers would be unwilling to use recycled soap?  Or just the neat connection between the soap collected in one place and delivered to those poor unfortunates overseas is what&#39;s necessary to get funding and other support? Nobody wants to fund just paying for soap in (say) Africa or just recycling soap in the US, I guess.Causing &#34;60%+ reduction in the number of children who die from diarrheal diseases each year&#34; -- is a pretty stunning claim.  Looking closer... I guess they&#39;re simply saying that children ding of such diseases had dropped by 60% from 1990 to 2020, not that they alone are responsible for that? Just that they&#39;ve &#34;helped&#34; to some unknown extent?  I bet most readers didn&#39;t catch that. That seems a bit dishonest actually. Still, even the 60% reduction in such deaths over 20 years alone is pretty great and I hadn&#39;t known about it! (I believe this is one of the leading causes of death in man parts of the world -- or used to be?).  I suspect this particular effort had a pretty minimal contribution to those numbers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Those tiny hotel soaps are just the peak of the iceberg.My SO used to work seasonally in a hostel in Venice. People leave a lot of half-used shower gel bottles, soaps, makeup products etc.It got to a point where the staff just put all the products which were safe to use(laundry detergent, shower gels, spray deodorant, shaving foam) in an unoccupied room referred to as &#34;the Rossmann&#34; (popular drugstore chain in some European countries) from which everyone in the know was at liberty to take as much as they wished.A fraction of the goods were originally found unopened."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a poor use of resources. Sending anything but money to places in need is just wasteful. This soap effort is not efficient. The expense of collecting the soap, refining it in a garage (including cost of the equipment), and delivering it to the recipients is almost certainly vastly more than if they&#39;d just sent cash and bought brand new soap local to the recipients. And that&#39;s not even factoring in the labor of the people doing it. This is another feel-good measure that is economically stupid, and whose primary purpose is to make the volunteers feel good about themselves. That&#39;s fine, if that&#39;s what they want to do with their time and money. But no one should help them by donating. It&#39;s far better to donate your cash to people that make efficient use of it."</p>

Rwanda’s universal health care system reaches over 90 percent of the population. In 2009, the government piloted a phone-based program, called RapidSMS, to track and reduce maternal and child mortality.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Disclaimer: IANAL, IANATA, this isn&#39;t tax advice, etcForeigners residing in Japan are eligible to participate in furusato nouzei, but Americans might want to note the following clause in the section &#34;Tax Must Be the Legal and Actual Foreign Tax Liability&#34; in Publication 514 Foreign Tax Credit for Individuals[1], which states:&gt;Subsidy received. Tax payments a foreign country returns to you in the form of a subsidy do not qualify for the foreign tax credit.&gt;The term “subsidy” includes any type of benefit. Some ways of providing a subsidy are refunds, credits, deductions, payments, or discharges of obligations.Whether or not furusato nouzei falls under this clause seems to be up for some debate, and AFAIK the IRS hasn&#39;t made a public determination on it either way. I don&#39;t risk it, but I am under the impression there are some that do.Alternatively, the furusato nouzei portion could be not included in the tax credit? But would it be worthwhile...?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This counsels that a young person born and educated in e.g. Gifu move to Tokyo after graduation to earn a living.
&gt; Many, many do. While Japan’s overall population is declining, Tokyo’s increases by about 100,000 people per year.Notably this differs from America in that rent acts as a natural counterbalance here. It’s not common knowledge that a university graduate should move to New York or San Francisco, in fact if you aren’t in a top paying field it’s probably common knowledge that one should not move to these cities.I wonder how much different the population landscape of the United States would look like if NYC, the Bay Area, LA etc had ever figured out how to plan for urban growth in the same way Tokyo did (context: you can afford a small single family home on a middle class income in Tokyo, I think prices there are around 30% over other Japanese cities)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Omoshiroi! This is a really nice write up. Education is indeed very expensive and the towns outside of Tokyo have difficulties surviving, with only older people remaining there. Those towns have to be very creative to attract money and people. You can get a house for free, if you will live there, similar to some Italian towns.In the Netherlands we have similar issue of towns fighting for survival in more rural parts (Limburg). They try to combine schools of several towns to reduce the cost of teachers, and similar combining police stations.Lowering the friction for such &#39;gift tax&#39; is interesting, Japanese are big into all kind of little gifts: if you go on holiday you bring something small, an Omiage. If you attend a birthday party, not only you bring a present (which is usual everywhere) but the guest also get a little gift in return, an Okaeshi."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are a couple of techniques that I have used in the past that have worked well.First, don&#39;t edit the proposed contract itself. Instead, add a rider that specifically overrides the provisions you don&#39;t like. Something like &#34;Intellectual Property. Work produced by employee shall be considered work-for-hire. &#39;Work&#34; is defined as...&#34; Then add a line to the bottom of the rider that says &#34;If any portion of this rider is in conflict with the main contract, the terms of the rider will override the terms of the contract.&#34; The benefit of this approach is that you avoid the back-and-forth niggling over particular words in the main contract, and you often overcome the other party&#39;s resistance to changing the language their lawyers said had to be there. It&#39;s stupid, but it works.The second technique is simply to say, &#34;this contract isn&#39;t large enough to justify these provisions. If you would like to bump the contract, we can talk. Otherwise, no.&#34; This has worked for me in negotiating software licenses. I haven&#39;t tried it in an employment situation. It works because it forces the other side to acknowledge that their demands have costs, and they can have what they want only if they pay for it. They never do.I am not a lawyer.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not certain my experience is relevant in this context, but I’ve been fighting contract language for over 30 years. I’m a pro photographer and producer in the biz for many years. I produce unique content that is quite challenging to recreate.So many contracts contain what I call “rights grabs”. They are attempting to transfer my IP to them for maximum profit. I’ve fought this trend with success for decades.I simply cross out the offending language in the contract and make the license contingent on the agreement proceeding as I describe. I’m happy to abandon a contract if it does not go my way (a luxury not everyone has).My largest checks in the past two years have been from lawsuits brought against copyright infringement. In every case my contract revisions have withstood legal challenge and the defenders/offenders have folded when they proceeded as if the original contract language (before I altered, after they signed) stood.There are lawyers who have pursued this niche to great success and I have lawyer team ready to pursue infringement on a contingency basis. It is quite amazing.More than once now, my lawyers have fought for years when the infringers had deep pockets and a terror of precedent. They paid so many thousands to their legal team but lost. I have prevailed in every case.I recognize this is bragging. But so many of my colleagues have just signed for a short term check while losing in the long run. I might be an obstinate  fool, but so far it’s paid off.We in the photo biz have had to survive a huge paradigm shift in the biz model in the last 18 years. But so many people fold for Pennie’s. “I need this $250 right now to make rent”. But my settlement checks are in the $25,000 range typically (25% after my lawyers and agent get their cut).Last I looked, the average income for a photographer in the U.S, was around $7500 a year. Yes, $7500 (no missing zeros). I make six figures consistently and I’m damn proud of this fact.Most of the conversations on this forum are above my skill set, but you folks are generally paid for deep knowledge and rare skills. Don’t let anyone steal this from you."</p>

I even wrote a similar blog post 10 years ago - it was on the top of HN and the comment section was a beautiful shitshow. For me, this perspective was a good story to tell myself - it justified why I was only investing my time in “work”, and validated me for having “come so far”.Over time, I have reflected and shifted this perspective. That reflection centered around the question the author hasn’t asked himself yet: who creates these expectations? It’s always some loose definition like “society” or “elite”, or some other handy wavy grouping of people.But, to be clear, those expectations are coming from the author. That’s his perspective of what the world thinks, based on his interactions, based on what he chooses to read, listen to, etc. He&#39;s not describing anyone but himself.I found that if I find myself projecting onto social norms, society, or some other loose definition of “they”, what I’m really doing is projecting a part of myself that I haven’t been honest about yet."</p>

Rank speculation and confident assertion with minimal substantive backing?I’d find this statement equally compelling (which is to say, not at all):&gt; Since we stopped using horses as a primary means of transportation, men’s sense of self worth has diminished.  Riding a horse carried a lot of high status connotations: drive, masculinity, towering above the land, and man’s domination over nature.  Now, we drive metal cars, low to the ground, and driving one is seen as commonplace.  All of men’s low sense of self worth stems from this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think there are quite a few alternative explanations for the data cited in the article than the ones the author proposes:&gt; &#34;Today, one in six American men between the ages of 25 and 54 are unemployed or out of the workforce altogether: about 10 million men. This number has more than doubled since the 1970s.&#34;We have this place in the USA called &#34;The Rust Belt&#34; which was once a dynamic and active manufacturing center providing millions of well-paid jobs for these now unemployed American men.  California once had a world-class electronics manufacturing industry (and a garment manufacturing industry) that provided hundreds of thousands of such jobs.  Under the rubric of neoliberal globalization, those jobs were shipped out to Mexico, China, Indonesia, India and other low-wage centers, and the huge cut in labor costs went right into the pockets of a small fraction of now-extremely wealthy Americans. Why neglect that  phenomenon?&gt; &#34;Over the past half-century, the number of men per capita behind bars has more than quadrupled.&#34;Again, we have a robust alternative explanation: the explosion in incarceration under the War on Drugs program launched by Nixon in the early 1970s and continued and amplified by successive Democratic and Republican administrations.  This resulted in the explosive growth of the quite profitable private prison complex (which did not exist before the 1970s), and of course enforcement was highly skewed towards poor and minority groups. These groups were far more likely to smoke crack on the street corner than to snort cocaine in private clubs, and a 100-wt of cocaine powder was considered equivalent to a 1-wt of crack crystal in sentencing.So if the author wants solutions to these problems, why not promote rewriting domestic and international law to exert significant penalties on corporations who outsource manufacturing overseas, and also end the War on Drugs by eliminating incarceration for possession of drugs, and instead focus on a public education approach emphasizing the benefits of getting off drugs and alcohol?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"People are realizing that social media is draining, predatory, and entirely superfluous.Of course there are employees here of social media corporations who would want to stem the tide of this mass exodus, but it&#39;s useless. Social media corporations have overstepped their boundaries and become a net negative on human society.Deleting your social media accounts results in an immediate improvement of quality of life and mental wellbeing. These sites are intentionally designed with predatory psychological mechanisms, they are designed by hackers like ourselves, but the hackers who see &#34;social engineering&#34; as a perfectly ethical practice and not simply psychological manipulation.These services are designed to be addictive, full stop. Addiction is not healthy, and neither is social media. Maybe this will bring SV back to its roots, real technological progress for the nation and not desperate bids for data mining based on cheap psychological tricks.People are growing sickened of the endless scrolls of psychological disturbing viral content combined with the false positivity of human interest stories. It is deepening social divisions, racial conflicts, political partisanship, and general misery. We don&#39;t need social media, what we need is real social connections in an increasingly isolated society, and social media stands in the way of this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve found myself between deleting, deactivating, and moderating my use of these apps for many years of my life.I never found deleting or deactivating to be very helpful. At some time or another you&#39;re going to need said account for something.While deleting is a bit extreme, some of these services will respect the actual deletion and others will not. I suppose the question at the end of the day is...why bother?I&#39;ve found it much more easy to &#34;declutter&#34; by following digital minimalism practices of getting rid of apps, only using browsers, practicing mindfulness of said platforms, and only using said platforms with a specific intention.There&#39;s a laundry list of tips you could use to make social media harder to use or even more bearable, but the most effective approach I&#39;ve used is simple moderation and mindfulness.Also why is Mozilla writing articles about this? I get the privacy angle, but aren&#39;t they also willing to put ads in front of people and other partnerships sacrificing that privacy for users? Like how does Mozilla make money outside of Google search engine being the default? I do know they lay off many of my friends who work on dev tools or even mobile apps there(i.e. browsers)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To protect my mental wellbeing, I find that carefully selecting who to follow on some of these services improves considerably my experience.For Instagram and Twitter, my rule of thumb is to prefer topical accounts to entity ones. That is, accounts that are dedicated to a single topic, no matter how narrow or large the scope, over those of people and/or companies.Personal and business accounts, no matter how focused they are, tend to go off topic very often, and there&#39;s nothing to do about it. A designer or an art studio can still post about politics, religion, or whatever the controversy du jour is about. An account about logo design or some python framework, not so much if ever.This allows me to have a feed whose content I sort of control. With Twitter, it gets even better with lists, so I have ones about dev stuff, others about business topics, etc. and the content there is almost on topic most of the time.Since I started doing this, the impact of social media on my mood almost vanished, yet I&#39;m still able to closely follow what&#39;s happening on topics I really care about.When I want to see what&#39;s happening on the real world, I check my Facebook.I&#39;m sure aware of how bad these companies are with personal data. So it you think it&#39;d be better to delete your account, then, yes, do it."</p>

I&#39;m glad the guy is okay, that could not have been &#34;fun&#34; given the description of the ejection.In Sunnyvale they used to train Orion P3 crews at Moffett field. Of course Sunnyvale and the surrounding towns had a few military contractors doing RADAR development who did not have many military targets to paint, so when a P3 flew over it made for a good &#34;real life&#34; test.On one such flight, the check pilot decided to &#34;spice up&#34; the newbie pilot&#39;s life as they returned to Moffett field by casually flicked on the RADAR threat detector. Sure enough, one of the contractor&#39;s search RADARs was &#39;pinging&#39; them, but unexpectedly they were also testing a tracking RADAR which then subsequently got a good lock on the plane. That made the RADAR LOCK alarm go off in the cockpit and the trainee, as he was trained to do, immediately hit countermeasures without thinking. (That will save your life!)The plane was on final approach to the field, and when it activated countermeasures it consisted of both chaff and IR flares (bits of magnesium, lit and cast to the side to distract heat seekers) These mostly landed on the Sunnyvale golf course which is in the approach path.I used to play that course, and after this event there were a number of burn spots where the flares had landed and then burned out on the ground, and for probably two months there were bits of foil chaff that could be found in various nooks and crannies around the course!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Times have changed in many more ways than one.These days I greatly prefer to own my data more directly, which I accomplish using a NAS. I don’t use Dropbox OR Google Drive, I use Syncthing, which can do stuff that neither of those could ever dream of in terms of syncing between machines.Not only do I not want Google Drive, I don’t even want anything like it.That said, I totally get why it’s still important. I do use Google Drive at work and for that type of use case I would not argue in favor of self-hosting. Syncthing is great for a single person or even a fairly large group of people, but not for a big organization. Not to mention you probably use Google Docs or Office 365 anyways, both of which are integrated with their respective company’s storage offerings. Syncthing won’t give you directory sync, docs integration, or granular ACLs.But that’s actually perfectly fine, because I don’t need any of those things. Hell, I flat out don’t really want them. You could probably get something similar with ownCloud which I did try running, and I’m not even particularly enticed. I’m sure Synology has a full suite as well, but it’s not what I want out of my NAS. Part of being happier with my technology was just as much realizing what I didn’t want as it was realizing what I wanted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love textualize/rich (and charm)!I think this solves some of the web&#39;s browser problems by breaking things out into components:- browsers are way too complicated to build, terminals are way easier- browsers have a huge attack surface, terminals are smaller- browsers lock you into JavaScript (more or less), terminals don&#39;t- browsers have to support tons of backwards compatibility (quirks mode, TLS), terminals have less to support by being more circumspectIt feels like we&#39;re on the beginning of the next cycle a little. First we scattered a bunch of apps to see how we should use the internet, then we focused on the browser, now we&#39;re scattering some more apps to see which solves our new problems better.To that end, presuming we stick with terminals, I wonder if they&#39;re at risk of falling prey to the same problems, or if they have different potholes in their future. One thing in particular I saw someone else mention in a comment in a different thread is that terminals are almost all written in unsafe languages like C, which feels super bad. Something else is auth and identity--something the current web is pretty bad at."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks like a lot of great work went into this.
But I&#39;m not sure I want to see CLI applications continue going down this path. Maybe I&#39;m missing the point of this, but I like my terminal applications simple, small and easy to drop into the rest of the shell ecosystem. This means applictions willing to accept input from either the keyboard interactively or from a stdin input stream of bytes and lines. Output should be a simple, structured, human readable and machine consumable format for easy drop into pipelines and shells scripts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While these are unarguably cool, I really don’t understand why would we want to force an ungodly hack onto a text-based, letter-displaying protocol to display arbitrary graphics. Especially when the people liking it - I assume - has quite a big intersection with those who prefer simplicity over anything else. Reusing Braille fonts and font styles and whatnot is exceedingly harder than.. putting a pixel onto a framebuffer. Especially when we pair it with event handling and the actually hard part of GUIs, they simply loose out on everything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with a lot of what he says.He gets something subtly wrong though: GC barriers are waaaaay cheaper than ARC, in the limit when you optimize them. Libauto had expensive barriers, but as Chris said, it’s not super interesting since it was overconstrained. But the production high-perf GCs tend to have barriers that are way cheaper than executing an atomic instruction. JSC’s GC has barriers that basically cost nothing, and that’s not unusual. It’s true that low latency GCs tend to have barrier overheads that are higher than high throughput GCs, but even then, the cost isn’t anything like atomic inc/dec. The barrier overhead in RTGCs is often around 5-15% except for the esoteric algorithms nobody uses.Also, GCs trivially give you safety even if you race to store to a pointer field. ARC doesn’t, unless you introduce additional overheads.Does what I say mean that ARC is bad? Heck no, ARC is super impressive. But it does mean that it’s a good idea to weigh ARC versus GC as a determinism versus speed decision, and accept that if you chose ARC, you lost some speed.Oh but ARC also let’s you do CoW better than what a GC could give you, so for some languages ARC is a speed win over any possible GC because it’ll let you do fewer copies. I think that’s true in Swift. But if you don’t have CoW then GCs are def faster."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find this whole conversation frustrating or somewhat confusing because it&#39;s a weird distinction: Reference counting is garbage collecting. It&#39;s not a mark &amp; sweep or generational tracing collector, but it&#39;s a collector. And in fact it even traces, though the tracing is explicit (in the form of the declaration or management of references.)My copy of the Jones/Lins Garbage Collection book I&#39;m looking at on my shelf makes this quite explicit, the chapter on reference counting makes it clear it&#39;s one form of garbage collection.When I was messing with this stuff 20 years ago, that was my understanding of it, anyways.There are advantages and disadvantages to reference counting. I think some of the confusion in terminology and some of the frustrations (or opposite) here comes from the rather awkward way that Objective-C implements reference counting as something you have to be explicitly aware of and careful about, even with ARC. My brief stint doing iOS dev made this clear to me.But I&#39;ve used (and written) programming languages that had transparent automatic garbage collection via reference counting, and the programmer need not be aware of it at all, esp if you have cycle detection &amp; collection (or alternatively, no cycles at all). And, there are compelling RC implementation that are capable of collecting cycles just fine (albeit through a limited local trace.)Anyways, he&#39;s right that RC can be better for things like database handles etc. Back in the day I/we used reference counting for persistent MUDs/MOOs, where the reference counts were tracked to disk and back, &#39;twas nice and slick."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Firstly … 25Gbit symmetrical … WOW.Secondly - as a person living my whole life in IT - both passion and professionally - I have no idea what would 25Gbit be good for. I’m currently paying about $80 for symmetrical 1Gbit fiber and have the option to upgrade to 5Gbit for about $180 but it seems so pointless.Here is the reasoning behind my grumpy opinion:1. Living in a home with Cat5 throughout so the best I can do is to route 1Gbit. Running cables in multilevel (American) homes is a major PITA.2. My Wi-Fi (802.11ax) is heavily affected by homes around me so only one AP can run with 80MHz channel width and the rest is 20-40MHz. Throughput ends up being somewhere between 150Mbit-500Mbit, depending on where you are.3. I have a few smaller servers running ..stuff. The trouble is not about server performance or bandwidth.. it’s about reliability. Running any business on consumer line (in the USA) is just signing up for trouble. (Eg. “Is your line down because your modem received a fault firmware? No worries, the tech is going to be there within next 4 days to check your cables…”).4. Things like game downloads on PS5 .. yes, they are amazingly fast (even on 1Gbit. They install faster from internet than from the built-in BD-ROM). But many games need to also “install” (whatever that means on PS5) and that takes 2x the time of download anyway. I can live with that once a month.5. Big fan of streaming services, however many providers limit bitrate on their side so I am still watching the sometimes blurry 4k …Back to original question and with genuine curiosity - what is 25Gbit for???"</p>

I hate you.I just got a notice in the mail that my ISP is &#34;upgrading&#34; their network so now I can pay $200 USD/month to get a whopping 2gbps, which I actually thought was pretty amazing until I read your post. So, thanks.In all seriousness, congrats! You made a good case for why one would need that much bandwidth. Also, we need to catch up here. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has happened to me also (indie game dev) a few years ago.The number is about 20 or so games that have been removed by Apple because they hadn&#39;t been updated in two years. The worked perfectly fine on all the new hardware/software and even work today.On top of that, I know that there is another 30 or so apps I was involved in with clients that have also been removed.These weren&#39;t the biggest apps/games in the world, but they were all high quality finished products that had nothing wrong with them.   Its just the cost of re-publishing each one out-weighed the return, so I didn&#39;t have much of a choice sadly. I do have plans to re-publish some of them, however they have to take a back seat for current work.All that to say, I have a large part of my portfolio of work that is no longer available to the public, which just sucks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Similar to the author of the tweet, Apple removed a working version of my FlickType Keyboard that catered specifically to the visually impaired community, just because I hadn&#39;t updated it in 2 years.Meanwhile, games like Pocket God have not been updated for 7 years now: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pocket-god/id301387274"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am having trouble summoning the outrage I see in the other comment threads here. The App Store is stuffed full of abandonware. Apple should be more aggressive with this, not less. If you can&#39;t recompile your app and patch up support for recent OSes and recent devices on an ongoing basis, then your business model is not sustainable. I know, I used to sell iOS apps.The market right now is absolutely flooded with indie games, some light pruning is probably for the best."</p>

Your experience and personality already lend itself to this effort.You say “the math is insufficient” show us the math!  Show us how it’s insufficient using numerical examples.Scientific outreach has a real “draw the rest of the owl” problem and I think Sabine is perfectly poised to fill the gap.There’s a George Carlin quote I’ll paraphrase ~“never talk down to your audience, they’ll catch up eventually.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you change assumptions to solve a big problem, you don’t necessarily need to measure the big problem to check the assumptions. General Relativity itself was first confirmed with a relatively simple measurement of star displacement during a solar eclipse.The “real solution” to the black hole information paradox will be one that solves the paradox AND provides a “small” way to test the change in assumptions that creates the big solution. This is definitely worth looking for IMO."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s what I&#39;ve never understood. From an outside perspective the black hole will evaporate before the thing falls in. Thus a thing can never fall in. From its perspective the hole will emit more and more intense radiation and finally evaporate just before it hits the horizon.If true, I think you can go even further and say no black hole can completely form; the collapsing matter just gets exponentially closer to being fully black until the effect of the Hawking radiation outweighs the gravitation, but it all evaporates before going fully black. No?(This latter part assumes there&#39;s some Hawking radiation or equivalent from pre-black holes as well).Now, I assume the pre-Hawking radiation would be unitary, since the only reason Hawking radiation is not unitary is because BHs don&#39;t have information, but pre-black holes are not black holes. So doesn&#39;t that solve the info paradox? Without resorting to holographs and whatnot? Where&#39;s the error?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"What many may not realize is that there&#39;s a thriving industry in sending passengers on planes for the sole purpose of them taking things from A to B.Years ago, you could get discounted flights to Europe where you couldn&#39;t check in any luggage. Why? That allowance was taken up by documents for various clients. This was usually quicker than any courier services at the time.I&#39;ve had friends who worked in the oil and gas industry. One story I was told was where parts were desperately needed to repair a drill bit on a gas platform. The best option? Someone would fly halfway around the world, drive to a particular factory, wait for the parts and then fly back. This was cheaper and faster than any courier service, even if you spent $10,000+ on the ticket.This was exacerbated because a person with 200lb of machine parts could walk through customs where a shipment might get stuck in customs for weeks. And each day of non-operation cost hundreds of thousands of dollars."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While the tweet is correct (&#34;It is physically impossible to exceed the 70-pound domestic weight limit for a small flat rate box&#34;) the shortened title here which omits the word &#34;small&#34; is very misleading.  The USPS offers a variety of sizes of flat rate boxes (https://www.usps.com/ship/priority-mail.htm#flatrate), all of which have the same 70 lb weight limit.  It&#39;s only the &#34;small&#34; that cannot be overweight.  The two mediums and the large can exceed the limit with dense contents.  Perhaps the title could be changed to omit &#34;physical&#34; and add back &#34;small&#34;?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"After one year, I-bonds are pretty similar to savings accounts and they are indexed to inflation. Your money won&#39;t grow, but it won&#39;t shrink either -- and as Treasury bonds they are the lowest-risk investment that exists. If you buy some today, they will pay 7.12% for the next 6 months. After that they will probably be adjusted to pay even more, based on the current inflation rate.There are two major catches: you have to wait at least 1 year before you cash them out, and a person can only buy 10k in I-bonds per year.After the first year is over, selling I-bonds and getting access to the cash takes a few business days.I&#39;ve been tiering my emergency savings based on how many redeemable I-bonds I have. I have enough money in the bank to cover emergencies I might need to pay for very quickly -- things like plumbing problems, car repair, etc. The rest of my emergency fund is going into I-bonds.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent the last few years developing software on AWS. I honestly cannot imagine not using it. Once you get good at infrastructure as code (CDK), microservices, and how everything wires together, any other technical stack is just painful. I still believe that engineers are completely underestimating productivity gains in people that are good at AWS. There is just so much less BS in terms of systems working, everything clicks together, you arent stitching a million open source libraries to build a stack. Billions of dollars of effort are behind making it as seamless as possible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree that there is weird cult-like thinking around AWS, when the reality is their base services like EC2 or s3 are pretty great but most of them are just mediocre. Yet, people will insist on using services just because AWS built it, mostly just brand mentality.Running things on prem or on something like Hetzner cloud can be much simpler in some cases, and with Kubernetes now you can provide a great platform anywhere. It just isn&#39;t the solution for every use case."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first half of the post is like blaming the barman because you drank a bottle of Michters Celebration and are stuck with a $30K bill. It’s not hard. Just don’t buy shit that may bankrupt you.And suggesting Hetzner dedicated servers as an alternative? Why not EC2 spot instances if you’re so budget conscious? It’s just Linux (or whatever you put on them).We spent big on dedicated hardware in the early days of our biz. Sure we bought bandwidth at 95th percentile which was cheaper. But as our people became our biggest cost we quickly moved into aws and haven’t looked back. Our bill is $500K per year and we happily pay it because payroll would be way more. However it’s the richness of the toolset and on demand scalability that is the real win.If you need to push a fuckton of bandwidth with little CPU usage you should buy your own metal, colo it and buy bandwidth at 95th percentile billing. We dug up a sidewalk and leased from Zayo to do just that for a specific thing. Most other applications belong in a cloud provider like aws."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another way to put this is that for most pop music, you could often degrade gracefully to three triads of major or minor quality.But even for something discussed previously on HN-- the Beach Boys &#34;God Only Knows&#34;-- this doesn&#39;t work. Wilson really wants a half-diminished seventh chord at the high point of the melody. One could perhaps degrade to a diminished triad in the accompaniment, but he&#39;s literally singing the seventh of the chord so it&#39;s there regardless. Substituting a major or minor triad there is a qualitative change and sounds suspicious.If you&#39;re making your own instrument you might want to be aware that there&#39;s a &#34;suspicious&#34; sound that some types of consistent chord substitutions can have on certain classes of instruments.For example, a bagpiper can make severe simplifications to the harmony or even change melodic intervals to fit what they have available. Audiences generally accept this because the strictures of the instrument have made that a common practice. (Even if you&#39;re unaware of the strictures, you&#39;ve probably gotten used to hearing the result of the common practice.)However, if one consistently employs major/minor triad substitutions on the guitar people are eventually going to hear that as a lack of quality. As in the Beach Boys example, this will often happen during key points. The guitarist may get lucky if the singer happens to fill out the missing note of the chord-- e.g., guitarist plays a minor triad and the singer fills out the seventh at the beginning of the chorus of &#34;Last Dance with Mary Jane&#34;-- but eventually the audience will figure out that the guitarist is missing a vital skill.Anyway, unless your instrument is so novel it doesn&#39;t have any associations with extant instruments, make sure you have some kind of &#34;escape hatch&#34; so that skilled performers can play the chords they need. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The obligatory video is of course &#34;Four Chords&#34; by Axis of Awesome:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5pidokakU4IRick Beato has kind of the opposite video about &#34;the most complex song ever&#34;:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZnRxTW8GxT8The song in question is Never Gonna Let You Go by Sergio Mendes; plenty of videos exist of it; here&#39;s one live:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fOPh3bTglak"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A couple notes&gt; While it&#39;s almost always I, IV, V, and vi, we have both II/ii and III/iii, differing on whether the third is major or minor.This might be a bit confusing as written, because the slash &#34;/&#34; is normally used in roman numerals to indicate secondary chords. For example, the II chord may be written as V/V. (V/V is always II, but not the other way around... the &#34;/&#34; notation indicates that the chord is functioning as a secondary chord, which is something you figure out from context.)The terminology &#34;open chords&#34; is also a bit unusual. The term &#34;open chords&#34; usually refers to chords that use open strings (strings that are not fingered). Chords without a third are often called &#34;power chords&#34;. You can do your entire song with power chords if you&#39;re playing rock music.I&#39;d also add that what chords you get as the three/four chords you need depends so heavily on genre. If you were playing blues, you might pick I7, IV7, and V7 for your first three, and then maybe bVII7 as the fourth. If you were playing jazz, you might pick something like I69, ii9, IVmaj7, V7."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I&#39;ve wondered about are size savings for DEM tiles. Typically elevation values are encoded in RGB values giving a resolution down to fractions of an inch [1]. This seems like overkill. With an elevation range from 0 - 8848 meters (Mt everest), you can use just 2 bytes and get an accuracy down to .2 meters. That seems plenty for many uses. Does anybody know if there&#39;s a PNG16 format where you can reduce the file size by only using 2 bytes per pixel, instead of the typical 3-byte RGB or 4-byte RGBA?[1] https://docs.mapbox.com/data/tilesets/guides/access-elevatio..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Instead of serving a 256x256px image, you can serve a 1px image and tell the browser to scale it up. Of course, if you have to put width= &#34;256px&#34; height= &#34;256px&#34; into your HTML that adds 30 bytes to your HTML!CSS is a thing as well, could just use CSS to force all tiles to the same size, regardless of the image data in them. Something like:  .map img {
    width: 256px;
    height: 256px;

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My sense is that most responses here are only to the title of the submission (the actual article title is &#34;Gender discrimination in hiring: An experimental reexamination of the Swedish case&#34;).Skimming through said actual article, it looks like the &#34;against men&#34; hiring discrimination is ~completely driven by this:&#34;...In female-dominated occupations such as cleaner, childcare provider, preschool teacher, accounting clerk, and enrolled nurse, positive employer response rates were much higher for women than for men. This is in line with earlier findings in different countries...&#34;Which sure sounds to me like &#34;employers try to fill low-status, low-pay, often-crappy female-dominated jobs with yet more females&#34;.It takes a certain sort of mindset to react as if men were clearly the (sole) group being wronged by that.(Or do millions of men quietly aspire to jobs cleaning up dirty toilets, dirty diapers, and dirty bedpans, and I&#39;m just ignorant of their dreams?)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"During my career, I&#39;ve seen enough discrimination in the name of DEI as well. But what bothers me more is the ageism. The number of times an old person has been rejected from a job is too damn high. The reasons have always been &#34;he may not work well with young people&#34;, &#34;seniority complex&#34;, &#34;he is over qualified&#34; etc. Most of the times, they were more than qualified. I fear when I am into 40s or 50s, I will face the same discrimination."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Throwaway.I&#39;m happy to have more women in tech and hope it occurs or continues. However, virtually everyone recruiting in tech has observed some toxic diversity initiatives, I would venture. Some examples I have seen personally or one degree removed from me.- pressure on HMs to hire more women despite 95% of applicants being male- people in interview panels openly saying &#34;but he&#39;s a white 
man&#34; / &#34;do we want to hire more white men&#34; etc.- people championing all women teams as a win for diversity- women getting a salary premium to help companies boost DEI &#34;representation&#34;I think eventually this will be shown for what it is, but it will take a long time. Personally every tech founder I know thinks it&#39;s bullshit but won&#39;t say it in public."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All the handwringing over Netflix subscriber loss seems to be overlooking the fact that they raised their prices - significantly. Of course they could lose subscribers from doing that. But 200k subscribers out of 150 million? Combined with the end of the pandemic and sky high inflation meaning many people have less opportunity to watch and less money to spend. The fact they raised their prices something like 20% and lost less than 1% of their subscriber base in that environment could almost be seen as a positive.The there is definitely a question whether, now that they have moved so solidly into content production, Netflix is actually a scalable / viable company any more. When they were just sending other people&#39;s content around and doing it much cheaper and better that was innovative and different. But content production is an expensive treadmill you can never get off and unless they find a way to innovate on that front, they are up against much more experienced and well established players with no differentiator at all.But reading the sky falling into the current reported figures seems a little over the top."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly for me I just do not know all the content Netflix has because the browsing is so bad. I wish instead of pushing shows to me best on algorithms, it would just let me browse categories and recent additions etc in a simpler way. Maybe categorised by year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting analysis.I find it interesting that so many people spend so much time watching tv in the first place. Growing up, I was one of those people but about a decade ago I lost interest in pretty much anything on television. There are certain shows that I will watch on occasion that get me hooked, but I usually struggle to find anything that is actually worth my time and end up just turning the tv off after surfing the streaming options for 10 minutes. It boggles my mind when I hear things like “golden age” of content.  Sure there is a ton of content, but it’s all so vapid."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The conclusion in the article:&gt; Why so angry?
I know I’ve taken this far too personally. I have no illusions that everything I read online should be correct, or about people’s susceptibility to a strong rhetoric cleverly bashing conventional science, even in great communities such as HN. But frankly, for the last few years, the world seems to be accelerating the rate at which it’s going crazy, and it feels to me a lot of that is related to people’s distrust in science (and statistics in particular). Something about the way the author conveniently swapped “purely random” with “null hypothesis” (when it’s inappropriate!) and happily went on to call the authors “unskilled and unaware of it”, and about the ease with which people jumped on to the “lies, damned lies, statistics” wagon but were very stubborn about getting off, got to me. Deeply. I couldn’t let this go.I am afraid I actually agree with the author&#39;s point.  The anti-intellectual, anti-scientific streak in many poor analyses claiming to debunk some scientific research is deeply concerning in our society.  If someone is trying to debunk some scientific research, at least he should learn some basic analytic tools.  This observation is independent of whether the original DK paper could have been better.That said, I give the benefit of doubt to the author of &#34;The DK Effect is Autocorrelation.&#34;  It is a human error to be overly zealous in some opinions without thinking it through."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Read the actual paper [1], there is so much more than those charts. They ask for an assessment of the own test score and an assessment of the ranking among the other participants to distinguish between misjudgments of the own abilities and the abilities of others. They give participants access to the tests of other participants and check how this affects self assessments - competent participants realize that they have overestimated the performance of other participants and now assess their own performance as better than before, incompetent participants do not learn from this and also assess their performance even better than before. They randomly split participants into two groups after a test, give one group additional training on the test task, and then ask all of them to reconsider their self assessments - incompetent participants that received additional training are now more competent and their self assessment becomes more accurate. This is not everything from the paper and probably also somewhat oversimplified, I just want to provide a better idea of what is actually in there.Everyone is free to question the results, but after actually reading the entire paper I can confidently say that poking a bit at the correlation in the charts falls way short of undermining the actual findings from the paper. The actual results are much more detailed and nuanced than two straight lines at an angle.[1] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/12688660_Unskilled_..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The plot to me always read &#34;People estimate themselves at 60-70% percentile - above average, but not the best&#34;. And then given this broad prior, people do place themselves accurately(because the plot is increasing).So it seems people are bad at doing global rankings. If I tried to rank myself amongst all programmers worldwide, that seems really hard and I could see myself picking some &#34;safe&#34; above-average value just because I don&#39;t know that many other people.There&#39;s also: If you take 1 class in piano 30 years ago and can only play 1 simple song, that might put you in the 90th percentile worldwide just because most people can&#39;t play at all. But you might be at the 10th percentile amongst people who&#39;ve taken at least 1 class. So doing a global ranking can be very difficult if you aren&#39;t exactly sure what the denominator set looks like.So I think it&#39;s an artifact of using &#34;ranking&#34; as an axis. If the metric was, &#34;predict the percentage of questions you got correct&#34; vs. &#34;predict your ranking&#34;, maybe people would be more accurate because it wouldn&#39;t involve estimating the denominator set."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The whole net neutrality saga just exposed the deep regulatory capture between ISPs and the FCC (the Republican Commissioners at least). Pai&#39;s argument for repealing net neutrality was that it wasn&#39;t a Federal government concern. That was originally what prompted California to institute these rules. But suddenly it wasn&#39;t a state issue either.Weird.The US has some of the most expensive Internet access in the world. In most places it&#39;s pretty crap too. Many places have no competition. Some providers are in clear breach of contract in not providing customers service as they promised to do.But apparently all that&#39;s not enough. We get the argument that the likes of Netflix are &#34;pushing&#34; their data at no cost onto &#34;their&#34; network. This is such a ridiculous argument and is nothing more than an effort to extort Netflix and other streaming services because it&#39;s eroding their cable TV services.No one is &#34;pushing&#34; data onto the network. Customers are pulling that data and those customers, by definition, are already paying for the bandwidth and the network access. But this doesn&#39;t stop lobbyists pushing this narrative onto Luddite elected officials. It&#39;s double-dipping. No more, no less.I really hope CAlifornia&#39;s net neutrality laws stand and get copied by other states."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; California&#39;s net neutrality law is similar to the federal rules repealed under former FCC Chairman Ajit Pai. California prohibits ISPs from blocking or throttling lawful traffic. It also prohibits requiring fees from websites or online services to deliver or prioritize their traffic to consumers, bans paid data cap exemptions (so-called &#34;zero-rating&#34;), and says that ISPs may not attempt to evade net neutrality protections by slowing down traffic at network interconnection points.I don&#39;t understand how anyone could oppose this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Net neutrality really highlights the ratchet effect that arises  wherever a  conflict of interest between the general public and special interests exists.They never stop. Legislative lobbying. Massive Legal efforts. Attempts at influencing the executive/government activities.Once they&#39;ve made a gain, they rarely lose it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For those who don&#39;t know web3 is the idea of building a web on a decentralized blockchain.  I think more specifically the idea is to replace the need for name servers with a blockchain protocol. Like anything blockchain there is no real solution for how to handle records becoming stale over time without a central authority that manages disputes.  I find it ridiculous that this idea even got to occupy the name as I think we&#39;d want to reserve it for the next generational change in web technology and not half-baked bs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Web3 makes a lot of sense to me.  The people that got into Bitcoin early are now out and ridiculously rich.  Other people also wanted to get rich, but that exact opportunity feels like it passed (still holding out for my $80 invested in Bitcoin to be worth &gt;$100,000, but I got in kind of late), so people started making their own coins in the hopes of repeating the process.  That had mixed success, Etherium (and maybe Dogecoin) did pretty well, but most didn&#39;t.  The SEC even started cracking down on ICOs.So, there is a legitimate need for some new business model where you print money and keep most of it for yourself.  Web3!  I guarantee you someone will get rich from it.  That means it worked.(I&#39;m being a little tongue-in-cheek here.  I get the actual idea for cryptocurrency and even NFTs if I squint a little bit, I just think that the hype is from people that think they&#39;re going to get rich without doing any actual work.  It does happen, but at the end of the day, doing actual work is probably going to be more profitable on average.  You&#39;re probably too late to the game if you start now intending to be a Web3 trillionaire, anyway.  The hype is to get you to buy some of the money you&#39;re printing with money that can actually be used to buy mansions.  So they can buy some mansions.)"</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.uninformativ.de/blog/postings/2022-04-21/0/POSTING-en.html">Python’s “type hints” are a bit of a disappointment to me</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31114554">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly, I&#39;ve recently written a few 300-500 line programs in Python using type hints and I&#39;m never going back.  And I&#39;m not even using mypy often, if ever.My editor now has a fairly deep understanding of my code, and can tell me of all sorts of surprising errors I&#39;m making before I run the code.  There have been a few times where I found an error, went into the editor and saw I had missed a error message about that line.  Shout out: Using LunarVim with LSP and TreeSitter.The other thing I&#39;m enjoying is that libraries can use them to make things happen more automatically.  I believe it was Typer (the CLI argument parsing library) where if you declare an argument to a function as &#34;files: List[Path]&#34;, it understands that the argument will take one or more files, or &#34;-&#34; to mean stdin.  If you just say &#34;file: Path&#34;, it understands it is a singular file.I was curious about type hints when they first came out, wasn&#39;t really expecting to use them but they seemed cool, but now I&#39;m totally sold."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is so hopelessly mis-informed, that it&#39;s practically hard to read without screaming &#34;that&#39;s not how any of this works!&#34; Most of their main arguments - type hints can be wrong, they can be ignored, and they don&#39;t inform you in a useful way about program state because of this - all evaporate as soon as you start using the correct tooling.My stack is pycharm, mypy, pydantic, sqlalchemy stub, several mypy plugins, black, isort, tabNine completion, and a bunch of custom scripts/Make to automate the common tasks. I&#39;m not even sure I&#39;m on the same planet as the author. I can practically spot incorrect type hints, mismatched types, weakly defined interfaces, from orbit, that&#39;s how well they are highlighted. Since every type is known, between pycharm and tabnine I can type 2-5 keys and spit out entire lines of code. And since it&#39;s all typed, automatic refactor is a breeze.I remember the dark ages, before type hints. It was rough. I lived in the REPL. Write 3 lines, run, Exception. Write 3 more lines, run, NoneType error. Ad nauseum. Now I write for hours on end and don&#39;t wince when I hit execute. And I don&#39;t have to go bug coworkers with questions like &#34;hey what keys are in this dict when we redirect from the oauth endpoint&#34;.Sure, I have my gripes, but it&#39;s mostly with the lack of power of the type system, like lack of higher kinded types. But I&#39;m confident it&#39;ll get there.Come to the typed side. We have less mental fatigue and screaming at neverending runtime oopsies."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Adding type hints to Python has increased my productivity by at least a factor of 10. They allow you to reason about code in a local function without having to track back up dozens of call sites to ensure you&#39;re getting what you think you&#39;re getting. That alone is worth the price of admission. Both when editing code or reviewing someone else&#39;s. It&#39;s fantastic, particularly in a very large code base.The editor experience only increases that factor as you can navigate a lot more freely. Even for small code bases type hints are a revelation. Knowing if something is nullable or not, alone, has caught 100&#39;s of bugs in waiting.Most of the complaints here feel like attacking a strawman, particularly the ones arguing what&#39;s the point if you&#39;re not running mypy. Run mypy! It&#39;s like saying what&#39;s the point of writing unit tests if you don&#39;t run the test suite. For any sufficiently large code base you absolutely should be running mypy with any plugins for your framework of choice added.For heterogeneous dictionaries use `dict[str, object]` and then you&#39;re forced to use the existing duck-typing mechanisms you&#39;re used to. Or, you refactor into better types and/or structures.Is there friction? Sometimes. You don&#39;t have to annotate everything. If the cost is too prohibitive for a particular structure or function, ignore it. Sometimes there are mypy bugs that make writing correct code impossible. # type: ignore[reason] that sucker. Don&#39;t throw the baby out with the bath water.We use a flake8 linter to enforce that all new or modified functions at least annotate their return type which makes interacting with functions quite a bit nicer, and encourages all devs to at least do the minimum. Usually you find that most args are appropriately typed at the same time."</p>
