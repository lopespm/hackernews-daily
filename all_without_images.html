								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This ban seems to heavily take advantage of the current moment, as it&#39;s obvious that he has tweeted worse things in the past.It&#39;s strange that they picked such a poor way to justify the ban when they could have made a significantly stronger case, and in doing so could have convinced millions more people that they are trying their best to apply policies evenly. For example, I have a hard time imagining why they chose to specifically quote &#34;American Patriots&#34;, as if that somehow contributes to the straw that broke the camel&#39;s back. Perhaps they have a strategic reason for going about this how they did, but I think it will have some negative 2nd/3rd order effects. that they haven&#39;t yet realized.I imagine we are still only in the early days of the conflicts that are to come in this sphere (and I&#39;d include just about every company and political faction in them, unfortunately).(Also because apparently I have to state this explicitly in every comment related to Trump: I do not support Trump, his supporters, the recent events that occurred at the capitol, etc etc)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it just my perception, or is their actual justification using the 2 quoted tweets kinda weak? Interpreting his boycott of an event as a call to violence seems like a huge stretch. It seems like they wanted to shoehorn a justification using his 2 latest tweets when the actual reason goes back further."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anybody have a solution to the bigger underlying question of de-platforming and censorship on online platforms?As far as I can tell, there are two general viewpoints:a) Censorship is bad, free speech is good. You should counter bad arguments with better arguments.b) There are types of speech, which are proven to lead to violence in the long-run. Also, some things can be proven as untrue. Lies are bad.I have to say, I agree with both of those points. I think group A is missing the point, that there are echo chambers and people radicalizing within their filter-bubbles up to the point of literal terrorism, while group B is missing that the power to censor can be misused by bad actors in the future and  that silenced people will not just change their mind.Is there a proper answer for someone like me? Where should I stand on this? I am leaning towards group A, while acknowledging that radicalization does happen and dearly worrying about perversion of words like &#34;truth&#34; or &#34;fact&#34; (&#34;your/my truth&#34;, &#34;alternate facts&#34;)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been using Signal for two years now and I love it.However I really, really hope they can work on a good backup and restore process as losing my message history because I have to reinstall the app on my desktop[1] or have to reset my phone is a horrible experience.Just build an encrypted blob and zip it up and pop it on my iCloud or Google Drive or leave it local and let me deal with it but I need something. As my Signal use moves from just messages with friends and family to business contacts I need a reliable way to backup my messages![1] I should state I mean losing the desktop copy as it starts &#34;fresh&#34; and does not import any messages from the phone.Edit: I should probably clarify I am talking about the iOS/macOS applications as these are what I use. iOS does have a migration feature but that doesn&#39;t help if your phone is lost/damaged. I need a proper backup and restore process as well as the ability to import messages from the phone to the desktop app."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue with Signal that annoys me most is the complete lack of any meaningful backup/export on iOS. I lost my entire chat history when I got a new phone because their bizarre &#34;proximity based&#34; solution failed."</p>

That&#39;s no easy task, but it&#39;s much better than having scientists from all over the world rely on it while simultaneously pretending they are dangerous criminals."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rights holders have been trying to get rid of sites like the pirate bay for more than a decade, and if anything PB is easier to find and more reliable to use than ever before.If they really want change, it&#39;s time for them to dispassionately consider their situation. The way to &#34;beat&#34; piracy is to consider it as a competitor, which it is. When I was a kid, everyone downloaded raw mp3s and now that number is a fraction of a fraction because there&#39;s 1) YouTube and 2) Spotify et al. You can listen to music all day with ads and not pay a cent, or you can pay a reasonable fee and get all the HQ music you can eat without ads. Publishers continue to screw content makers, but that&#39;s another conversation.Just trying to ban pirate sources is a wonderful dream for publishers for sure, but there&#39;s no way it can work. Scientific papers are just too easy to share, the need for them high, and the current pricing too insane for it to be otherwise."</p>

Given that most people seem to care more about free services, than they do about privacy, Facebook may see privacy labelling is a pointless exercise that won&#39;t change anything anyway.Or perhaps we are back at Upton Sinclair: &#34;It is difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it.&#34; and Facebook as an organisation is simply unable to acknowledge the problem, because doing so would ruin them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"iMessage seems to be a bit dishonest, because Apple, the owner, has way more information about you through iCloud and Apple ID - contacts, location, payment data, phone number, etc.Forcing Facebook to clearly list all of this for the facebook account is great, but then failing to disclose this for their own account seems like double standard.Just like having their own separate Ad Tracking switch which is on by default.

These were of the Beta-M type, built in the 80s, with an activity of 1295 TBq each. The lumberjacks were scavenging the forest for firewood, when they came across two metal cylinders melting snow within a one meter radius laying in the road. They picked up these objects to use as personal heaters, sleeping with their backs to them. All lumberjacks sought medical attention individually, and were treated for radiation injuries. One patient, DN-1, was seriously injured and required multiple skin grafts. After 893 days in the hospital, he was declared dead after a fever caused by complications and infections of a radiation ulcer on the subject&#39;s back.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I work at Gumroad, mentioned in this article.Sometimes, I read things by CEOs about how a company works on the inside and I wonder if it really looks like that, or if it is a view from the top that doesn&#39;t reflect what it&#39;s really like.This article, with its discussions of the upsides and downsides, is accurate to my experience and my understanding of other people&#39;s experiences. For many people, Gumroad wouldn&#39;t be a great place to work, but for those of us who want to work like this, it is exactly what we need. Very glad to be working at Gumroad and working in the ways the article describes.Edit: Following up with a few FAQs from posts in the thread:* Health Insurance: I&#39;m personally lucky enough to still be covered on my dad&#39;s health insurance until I turn 26, thanks to the ACA, though for supplementary (vision, dental) I make more than enough to afford proper health insurance on the open market. Everyone at Gumroad is paid very well and should be able to afford the same.* Regarding overtime, benefits, etc: we make very competitive rates as contractors. I sincerely appreciate your concern, though.* On the shift from full-time employees to contractors, the company declined and was rebuilt over a period of five years. I&#39;m a relatively recent addition, so I only know Gumroad as it is now, I cannot comment on how it was. All I can say is that it&#39;s not like Sahil went out and fired everyone and then the next day it was a bunch of contractors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work for a large SaaS company with hundreds of engineers and a very healthy revenue. It&#39;s widely acknowledged that the company would continue to function exactly as it is now for a very long time if they fired 95% of the staff. Heck stability and uptime would probably improve due to fewer deployments/no new feature adds. So the graph with declining expenses and increasing revenue isn&#39;t at all surprising.The problem with this model is that you are coasting on the work done by your full time staff in the initial few years, whom you fired and replaced with part time contractors who get no benefits. Even putting the ethical issues with this aside, if a competitor takes interest in your space and has a large war chest, you&#39;d be powerless to compete with them. And when your tech is dated and current/new customers want innovation, your low-price contracting firms working a few hours per week certainly aren&#39;t going to be able to offer that.So while I&#39;m happy things are working in this case, no new company that starts with the environment you are describing is going to be successful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In years to come we will look down on the 5 day working week in the same way we currently do with 15hr factory shifts during the industrial revolution.It absolutely blows my mind that 99% of office roles are still 5 days / week, Monday to Friday - why is there basically no variation on this model? I&#39;d be more than happy to work a job for 80% salary for 4 days per week...So much so, I&#39;m about to launch a website listing remote software jobs with a 4 day work week:https://www.28hrworkweek.com/"</p>

Because as much as I hate that Facebook bought them, they&#39;re part of what I would call &#34;critical social infrastructure.&#34;Asking to leave WhatsApp is like cancelling your contract with your ISP and going offline just because you don&#39;t like the company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Telegram is a great IM experience. The client is good, feature set is good, the stickers are amusing (if you&#39;re into that kind of thing), the feature set is complete and everything is polished. Telegram is, I think, going to be one of the easier sells if you&#39;re trying to convince non-technical users to switch from WhatsApp or FB Messenger.The privacy, security, and governance story is not great though. If you care about such things, I think Signal wins hands down. And the UX is fine, just not quite as good as Telegram in my view.(A third option not in your poll that might be worth evaluating is Wickr. I haven&#39;t used it personally, but I&#39;ve seen it come up in these sorts of discussions.)"</p>

We can not fix closedness.- Not everyone is using it: we can fix it. We can not fix privacy abuse from Facebook.- It&#39;s work to run/manage a server: find a hosting provider (cough https://communick.com cough)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit and all the rest don&#39;t count as broadcast media but I feel like we got here in part because the 1987 elimination of FCC&#39;s fairness doctrine slowly allowed a shift in how we communicate with each other.We went from specious claims and conspiracy theories being the subject matter of newsletters to their public broadcast to millions via talk radio ~and Fox News~, thus allowing people to descend into their own bubbles without ever having their views challenged.  Now people seem to rely on social media to give them the same experience.  When challenged too much people just pull up stakes to insulate themselves: voat, parler, and private facebook groups are only three recent examples.It&#39;ll be interesting to see if whoever replaces Ajit Pai holds a different view on public intercourse over the airwaves.Edit: Well as some people have pointed out, Fox News would have been exempt from the Fairness Doctrine as a cable network, i.e. it doesn&#39;t use the public spectrum.As Wikipedia says &#34;The channel was created by Australian-American media mogul Rupert Murdoch to appeal to a conservative audience, hiring former Republican media consultant and CNBC executive Roger Ailes as its founding CEO.&#34;  So my personal view that Fox (among others) is responsible for a) exposing millions to fact-free content without opposing views and b) people got used to that and don&#39;t like it when it&#39;s challenged created the bubble we have today. I&#39;m wrong that the Fairness Doctrine would have prevented Fox, although it might have prevented talk radio."</p>

This was a fraudulent election but we can&#39;t play into the hands of these people. We have to have peace. So go home, we love you, you&#39;re very special, you&#39;ve seen what happens you&#39;ve seen the way others are treated that are so bad and so evil. I know how you feel. But go home and go home in peace.&#34;I was watching a live stream from the mob and the protesters (the buffalo costume guy, in fact) were trying to get other protesters to leave on the basis of trumps message and people were believing the claim was fake because twitter restricted sharing so the only way to see it was to directly go to the page.Seems like an odd choice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cities Skylines is very nice for such traffic simulations.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yITr127KZtQ (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17182008) (https://www.reddit.com/r/CitiesSkylines/comments/7h6zr0/traf...)https://www.youtube.com/c/BiffaPlaysIndie/search?query=lane+...This is frequently posted here on HN.
E.g. https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25632642."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Things like this are cool. What I would be curious to see though, rather than setting global parameters (i.e., politeness), would be to have each agent have its own politeness score (as well as other attributes). Models like the one linked to here work as if each agent is a particle, rather than autonomous decision-maker adapting to their circumstances locked in long-term, iterated games with other anonymous drivers.This way, agents would adapt their attributes to maximize their own local advantage, and therefore could see how large scale trends develop. I&#39;ve driven in many countries and regions within countries, and it&#39;s just wild how &#34;driving cultures&#34; vary so much. Some places the drivers are so polite to the point it really makes things dangerous, other places the drivers are vindictive (distinct from being aggressive driver). It would be interesting to model how driving cultures emerge.Edit: I guess the short story is I&#39;m really curious why some places, like Bangkok driving is chaotic, dangerous, gridlocked, and no one adheres to traffic laws much or yields to pedestrians, but relatively devoid of road rage (and people will let you merge over if you need to). In DC, people carefully adhere to red lights, stop signs, pedestrians, etc but will go far, far out of their way to block you from changing lanes once they see your turn signal go on.Also, exploring the game theoretic (probably prisoner&#39;s dilemma?) aspects of tailgating and how that seriously depends on the driving culture. When someone tailgates, the tailgatee can slow down (everyone loses), speed up or move out of the way (tailgater wins/tailgatee loses), etc. If everyone slowed down when tailgated, there would be no benefit of tailgating; if enough people give in when tailgated, that keeps rewarding the behavior. Anyway, that would be something fun to explore in one of these traffic simulations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love these little simulators because while they purport to show that slower more polite driving is more efficient, more often than not they show the exact opposite.  Want to shove the most cars through per hour?  Remove the speed limit.  Accelerate and brake like every intersection is a drag race.  Leave absolutely no distance between cars.  And dump any notion of polite lane changes.  NASCAR was right:  Minimize unused pavement.  The most efficient way to move large numbers of cars down a road is at 200mph with only inches between each car."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Some speculate it might descend from PowerVR GPUs, as used in older iPhones, while others believe the GPU to be completely custom. But rumours and speculations are no fun when we can peek under the hood ourselves!As per IMG CEO, Apple has never not been an IMG customer. ( Referring to period between 2015 and 2019.) Unfortunately that quote, along with that article has simply vanished. It was said during an Interview on a British newspaper / web site if I remember correctly.&#34;On 2 January 2020, Imagination Technologies announced a new multi-year license agreement with Apple including access to a wider range of Imagination&#39;s IP in exchange for license fees. This deal replaced the prior deal signed on 6 February 2014.&#34; [1]The Apple official Metal Feature set document [2], All Apple A Series SoC including the latest A14 supports PVRTC, which stands for PowerVR Texture Compression[3].It could be a Custom GPU, but it still has plenty of PowerVR tech in it. Just like Apple Custom CPU, it is still an ARM.Note: I am still bitter at what Apple has done to IMG / PowerVR.[1] https://www.imaginationtech.com/news/press-release/imaginati...[2] https://developer.apple.com/metal/Metal-Feature-Set-Tables.p...[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PVRTC"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This suggests the hardware is superscalar, with more 16-bit ALUs than 32-bit ALUsTo me, it sounds like it might mean 32-bit ALUs can be used as two 16-bit ones; that&#39;s how I would approach it, unless I&#39;m missing something? The vectorization can also happen at the superscalar level, if borrowing the instruction queue concept from out-of-order designs: buffer operations for a while until you&#39;ve filled a vector unit&#39;s worth, align input data in the pipeline, execute. A smart compiler could rearrange opcodes to avoid dependency issues, and insert &#34;flushes&#34; or filling operations at the right time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Yet Metal optimization resources imply 16-bit arithmetic should be significantly faster, in addition to a reduction of register usage leading to higher thread count (occupancy).I believe this is a difference between the A14 GPU and the M1 GPU; the former&#39;s 32 bit throughput is half its 16 bit throughput, whereas on the latter they are equal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are two interesting things in this post.The first is that a senior developer at Facebook believes every single senior developer looking for a role at Facebook can revise the same things. Clearly the author believes that Facebook are looking for programmers who fit a very specific mould, to the point that they&#39;re willing to go out in public and state exactly that. I&#39;d argue that points to a massive monoculture problem at Facebook, but I&#39;m massively anti-Facebook so I&#39;m biased.Secondly, the author believes that senior developers, who likely have 10+ years under their belt if they&#39;re senior, need to spend a solid month revising in order to be successful landing a role there. Maybe that&#39;s worthwhile as FB pay well, but that&#39;s a hell of a time investment if you&#39;re not planning to stay at FB for a long time. That would certainly make me think twice if I was going to apply."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every time I read these posts I find them very depressing. Crunch through an enormous  bunch of algorithm problems in order to perform well on some unrealistic whiteboard programming (I think the system engineering problems are actually more useful though) - as usual we&#39;ve focused on the easy to measure metric rather than anything actually useful. Maybe these things are meant to be a proxy for how good you are at other development tasks, but it has never seemed to work out that way to me. Some of the very successful people I know at FAANG companies have told me that they would not pass the algorithm interviews without months of preparation and that they don&#39;t really use those skills."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Besides the usual advice, this observation is very interesting:&gt; Applying for senior engineering positions (&gt;E4) in FANG companies is one of the best ways to get into them.This comment by a veteran senior engineer confirms to me that Facebook, just like most other FANGs, does a poor job of promoting from within.There are multiple comments to the same effect from many other FANG employees: It&#39;s much easier to get recruited for senior roles from the outside, then get promoted from the inside.The result of this failure is that job-hopping is the most valid career strategy for aspiring seniors."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a Simple customer and incredibly upset by this decision.  For those not familiar with their value add, Simple is essentially &#34;envelope budgeting&#34; built into a banking application.  Sure, it&#39;s a bank and does bank things.  What sets Simple apart is that I can allocate $n/month for an expense and it takes it out of my paycheck and puts it into that expense &#34;envelope&#34;.  When a charge comes in for that expense, it pulls from the envelope.  Other budgeting tools like mvelopes.com and YNAB are great for visibility/tracking, but they don&#39;t move your money around.  The alternative I used prior to finding Simple was having about 10 different checking accounts and manually transferring money every few weeks.  I really don&#39;t want to go back to that setup after tasting the good life.My pitch to the Simple team, or anyone interested in taking this on, is to take the app and build it on top of Stripe Treasury (https://stripe.com/treasury)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know how many Simple employees are in this thread. I&#39;m very sad to hear this news, and I&#39;m sure you were too. Just want you to know that you all made a really meaningful difference in the lives of at least my wife and I. Before I switched to Simple, I had a really hard time budgeting for things/planning for expenses, and was frequently toeing the line of overdrawing my account. I was essentially financially illiterate.Simple made it incredibly easy for me to get my shit together and start being proactive with my money, so there was really no excuse to not do so. Now, my wife and I are well on our way to an early payoff on our mortgage (~18 years early), paying off our vehicle loans early (~2 years early), having a pretty good safety net in the bank, and being otherwise debt free.So if you haven&#39;t heard it above the sadness of losing Simple: thank you. Seriously, thank you. You really did something great and you should all be proud of what you&#39;ve accomplished."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I loved Simple for a long time -- I was one of the &#34;beta&#34; customers -- but I switched away from them over a year ago. I&#39;d already been annoyed with them over something seemingly trivial; I go by my middle name and last name, not first and last, and want my credit/debit card to match that, reading &#34;Middle Last&#34;. Everyone else allows me to do this and Simple did allow that... until we all had to migrate our accounts from Simple&#39;s original &#34;banking partner&#34; to BBVA. At that point they changed my name and refused to change it back after multiple go-rounds (which ended with a rep telling me &#34;sure, we can do this, just fill this out,&#34; filling said thing out, and being told &#34;we can&#39;t do that&#34;).As with some other mentions here, though, it was killing the ability to have Simple send checks to payees that did it for me. I&#39;d been waiting for years to have Simple be able to accept ebills (e.g., receive a bill from a creditor that specifies an amount to pay and paying that, rather than just paying a fixed amount every period), and they never did; instead they regressed.But here&#39;s the thing: while I&#39;d left Bank of America because Simple&#39;s app and design was so much better, I&#39;d never closed my BoA account for the simple (ha!) reason that they could accept ebills and pay them out of my Simple account. This always left me with the niggling feeling that while Simple was better at technology and customer service, BoA was better at... well... banking. And when I checked out BoA after getting fed up with Simple, well, their app was still ugly and had bad UX design, but the functionality had mostly caught up with Simple. It even has goals built into it, if I want them. (I don&#39;t, and never cared about Simple&#39;s equivalent, so I can&#39;t compare the functionality.)And while there are &#34;bank things&#34; I only do once in a blue moon -- deposit at an ATM, get a cashier&#39;s check -- it turns out it&#39;s nice to have a bank that, well, does those things. I know there are other banks (and credit unions) that do them, too, and I&#39;m not suggesting BoA is particularly good (or bad) in this regard.Simple was a promising idea, but I think they made a serious mistake by letting themselves be bought out by BBVA. And while I&#39;d love to see someone else try again, I&#39;m going to be a lot more reticent to move to a new bank just because it gives me a terrific mobile app experience next time around. Simple was a great technology company, but at the end of the day, I just don&#39;t think they were that great a bank."</p>

We had a hardware block that did error diffusion, we had a hardware block that did regular diffusion. We also had a hardware block that did Blue Noise. I was responsible for implementing the firmware that drove those printers&#39; scan/copy path: scan an image in monochrome, run through the dither hardware to create the bit pattern fed to the laser engine.No one could explain to me how to use the blue noise block. I couldn&#39;t understand what the blue noise block was doing. This is the first article that explained, in terms I could understand, how blue noise dithering works.I can die happy. Thank you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such a well-written article: it describes the impetus, it is researched, it has great examples both as code and as output, and it piques interest. In the late 1990&#39;s I contracted with an embedded software company to optimize a dithering algorithm for 8-bit MCUs that was used in most laser printers &amp; copiers, and this paper is a really good overview."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; According to Wikipedia, “Dither is an intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error”, and is a technique not only limited to images. It is actually a technique used to this day on audio recordings […]Dithering as a digital signal processing technique is also used frequently in the digital control of physical systems. One example of this is in the control of hydraulic servo valves[1]; these valves are usually pretty small and their performance can be dominated by a lot of external factors. One of the biggest ones is &#34;stiction&#34;, or static friction, wherein if the moving parts of the valve are at rest it can take a large amount of current to get them going again which translates in to poor control of the valve and in turn poor control of the thing the valve is trying to move. It&#39;s common to use very high frequency/small amplitude dithering on these valves to eliminate the effects of stiction without compromising accuracy which greatly improves the control stability and responsiveness of the servo valves.1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrohydraulic_servo_valve"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some truly impressive results. I&#39;ll pick my usual point here when a fancy new (generative) model comes out, and I&#39;m sure some of the other commenters have alluded to this. The examples shown are likely from a set of well-defined (read: lots of data, high bias) input classes for the model. What would be really interesting is how the model generalizes to /object concepts/ that have yet to be seen, and which have abstract relationships to the examples it has seen. Another commenter here mentioned &#34;red square on green square&#34; working, but &#34;large cube on small cube&#34;, not working. Humans are able to infer and understand such abstract concepts with very few examples, and this is something AI isn&#39;t as close to as it might seem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is simultaneously amazing and depressing, like watching someone set off a hydrogen bomb for the first time and marveling at the mushroom cloud it creates.I really find it hard to understand why people are optimistic about the impact AI will have on our future.The pace of improvement in AI has been really fast over the last two decades, and I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a good thing. Compare the best text generator models from 10 years ago with GPT-3. Now do the same for image generators. Now project these improvements 20 years into the future. The amount of investment this work is getting grows with every such breakthrough. It seems likely to me we will figure out general-purpose human-level AI in a few decades.And what then? There are so many ways this could turn into a dystopian future.Imagine for example huge mostly-ML operated drone armies, tens of millions strong, that only need a small number of humans to supervise them. Terrified yet? What happens to democracy when power doesn&#39;t need to flow through a large number of people? When a dozen people and a few million armed drones can oppress a hundred million people?If there&#39;s even a 5% chance of such an outcome (personally I think it&#39;s higher), then we should be taking it seriously."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow. This is amazing. Although I wish they documented how much compute and data was used to get these results.I absolutely believe we&#39;ll crack the fundamental principles of intelligence in our lifetimes. We now have capability to process all public data available on internet (of wikipedia is a huge chunk). We have so many cameras and microphones (one in each pocket).It&#39;s also scary to think if it goes wrong (the great filter for fermi paradox). However I&#39;m optimistic.The brain only uses 20 watts of power to do all its magic. The entire human body is built from 700MB of data in the DNA. The fundamental principles of intelligence is within reach if we look from that perspective.Right now GPT3 and DALL-E seem to be using an insane amount of computation to achieve what they are doing. My prediction is that in 2050, we&#39;ll have pretty good intelligence in our phones that has deep understanding (language and visual) of the world around us."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something that I find interesting is that career advice coming from professionals having many years of experience focuses almost exclusively on the people aspects and not the technology: communication, trust, teamwork, documentation, clarity. The advice is clear, precise and honest.This is the opposite of what you get from new hires/juniors: they tend to focus on which stacks matter, what to learn, how to develop, deploy and maintain. Not much real advice on the behavioral side, to the point that people often take trainings for behavioral interviews and memorize “leadership principles” and other nonsense."</p>

  Fighting complexity is a never-ending cause. Solutions should 
  be as simple as possible. Assume the next person to 
  maintain your code won’t be as smart as you. When you can 
  use fewer technologies, do so.

This is the one I appreciate more and more as I age. Because frequently, I&#39;m the next person looking at my own code. And there&#39;s no better gift to your future self than well-written, easy-to-understand code that is straightforward to maintain."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very wise:&#34;When I was at GM, you were a failure if your next move was not up—managing more people or taking on bigger, more complex projects. For many, this made for a miserable career path&#34;As I&#39;ve said before, I think this is a corrosive aspect of the perf/promo process at many FAANGs. The &#34;level&#34; system encourages/pushes people to &#34;upgrade&#34; in this manner, and I think contributes to a number of problems. For one, organizational incompetence when people who were valuable contributors where they were are elevated up into roles where they no longer can apply those skills as effectively (i.e. technical team lead to management or architect) leaving a vacuum below. A form of the Peter Principle I guess, except the individual may have competence in their new role but not be happy, or make the team itself less successful.And most importantly, as he touches on: being asked to &#39;level up&#39; and told that this is your mission can lead to an unpleasurable career. Either when you do get that promo and then find that you don&#39;t enjoy the new responsibilities (but become trapped by the position / upgraded compensation etc.) or when you don&#39;t get the promo (or don&#39;t try) and find that your value in the eyes of yourself and others seems less.And finally, I think this type of thing can really take hold in places with a highly academic background / focus / origin (like Google, etc.) as it mimics in many ways the grade / peer review achievement structure of academia. And that reward / grading structure may not at all correspond to either the monetary or cultural success of a corporation.Smaller companies looking to grow/formalize should exercise caution when looking at the rating/performance/promo process @ FAANGs / MS as a model for their own.(I&#39;m at 20-25ish years in the industry, but really feel junior in so many ways when I read the words of veterans like this.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Definitely beautiful and would love for something simple and clean to eat LinkedIn&#39;s lunch.I don&#39;t have much to add in addition to everyone else except this: I am really disturbed by the common meme of faces-inside-circles. Why do we need faces? It just distracts from the content. I love the idea of being able to link former colleagues together - that&#39;s neat - but I&#39;m very anti-face and  there are any number of ways to do it that does not involve people&#39;s pictures.Edit: Wow this got a lot of upvotes. So, I&#39;ll continue for a sec: There is so, so much conscious and unconscious judgment and game playing with pictures, I don&#39;t even know where to start. Let&#39;s leave this to be simple, clean and beautiful without the faces."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started read.cv when transitioning from full time to freelance design in July. I wanted an easy to update &#39;about me&#39; page to link from my website and bio – something simpler than LinkedIn and more dynamic than a PDF.Design wise I focused on legibility and tried to give projects/side projects equal weight to things like education and work experience. A few unique features: tagging collaborators in your experiences, status updates, and print optimized profiles.It took me around three months (Sept to November) to get it out the door, and I&#39;ve been working on making improvements since. Open to any questions or feedback!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good start, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of this the way it is now.First, the font is tiny for my old eyes.  Not all of us, especially hiring managers, are still in their 20s and can read these tiny fonts. I measured it with a ruler and the text is 1mm tall.  Also, the font is gray on white, which is pretty but hard to read. In contrast, Linkedin is three times bigger and black on white, much easier to read.Second, after looking at the example, I have almost no idea what you&#39;ve done.  All I see are job titles.  I don&#39;t see any accomplishments or even job duties.  It looks like I could add those things when I create my own profile, but having them missing on the example isn&#39;t a good look.Third, the face circles.  I see face circles under each job, but they aren&#39;t clickable nor are there tooltips.  I have no idea what those are.  I assume they&#39;re other people who worked at the same place?  Maybe connections of yours who have worked at the same place?  That&#39;s a cool idea, but it needs to be more discoverable.  At the very least a tooltip would be good.Overall, when I&#39;m looking at a professional profile, I&#39;m usually doing it because I want to hire or work with someone.  The main information I want to know is 1) Do we have anyone in common I can ask about you?  2) What did you accomplish at your previous workplaces or otherwise?  3) Have you worked anywhere that I recognize and when, so I can ask my other friends who worked there if they know you?The face circles accomplish #1, so that&#39;s great.  #2 looks possible, but the design seems to minimize the accomplishments, as opposed to Linkedin which sort of puts it in your face.  And #3 seems to be covered but again the design minimizes the information I want most.I would say a good place to start would be asking yourself, &#34;Why does Linkedin look the way it does?&#34;.  A lot of their design comes from customer feedback, and their main customers are recruiters and hiring managers.  Steal their good stuff and leave their dark patterns behind."</p>

I use waste in the sense of like trying to assemble something complicated with the instructions just out of arms reach, not in the sense of doing something pointless.In some cases all companies would have to do is not actively hide or obfuscate things. In others it may take more effort but still just a drop in the huge bucket compared to developing a system in the first place.I love Apple&#39;s hardware, I even (mostly) love the OS. If they too believe that it is solid - why prevent people from running what they want? The majority will come back anyway - I&#39;ve run Linux for years and still ended up on MacOS for simplicity. I&#39;ll still buy Macs and run MacOS because it works for me, it&#39;s not like letting me run Linux will cost them money or something. The vast majority of people don&#39;t  know what Linux even is, there is no threat there.Please note that this comment is not directed at people who choose to spend their time on projects like this.

After the street cred of getting a marginally usable OS up and running evaporates, why continue to take the effort of great engineers and waste it developing an ecosystem that doesn&#39;t care?

Not only do you have less resources to learn and grow, you have a massive handicap to find good work as most work is outside of the country.Only bet is to leave the country but even there you have a very low probability as you basically can&#39;t have a trial period for your job as most companies don&#39;t want to risk having their accounts blocked.Most of us here know how degrading and infuriating the tech recruiting processes can be and now add to it the horrors of working from Iran.Wars are not supposed to have civilian casualties but this one has a generation of civilians being starved of information and experience critical for them to grow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a concern about REPL driven development, which is around how maintainable the result is.The reason people like REPLs is because they can experiment to discover the right way to write the code in a very fast feedback loop. This alleviates a huge pain when you are operating with uncertainties or at the edge of your knowledge - &#39;does this function return null if no matching entries or an empty list?&#39; - etc.The problem is that the reader of your code is not going on that journey with you. They are coming in naively without knowing all of that experimentation you did. The writer now has the opportunity to create code that &#34;just happens&#34; to work by a magic of coincidences and conveniences based on very subtle non-obvious properties of the APIs and systems they are working with. The reader is severely disadvantaged and will have a much harder time to reach parity with the state of knowledge that the writer had. For example, some property of a function or object may not be documented at all, but through the REPL the writer has ascertained it is true. How can the reader know this?So its a double edged sword in that the more you empower the original creator of the code, the greater imbalance you create to the later readers and maintainers of the code. Used well and with great discipline I could see it being very powerful and positive force to make better code. But in the worst case scenario, you&#39;ll end up with extremely unmaintainable code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having used Clojure and Common Lisp professionally, I think advocates for REPL driven programming universally overstate the utility of a first rate REPL.Yes, it’s nicer than Python’s. Yes, it’s convenient. No, I never ended up doing my development in the REPL first. Why? Because editing mistakes in a REPL usually sucks, because a REPL is not a text editor.What I ended up using heavily was REPL to file integration, which gave me the ability to write a function normally, evaluate it in the attached REPL session, and then play around with it in the REPL. This is far short of the “REPL driven development” that’s commonly discussed, and frankly something that’s probably possible with the Python REPL if they wanted to.Editing data and functions in the REPL is a neat trick, but it’s a double edged sword, because a REPL can crash, and it provides incredibly rudimentary support for diffing current state and migrating changes back to permanent files. I would never start with anything more than a trivial “how do I manipulate this list” in the REPL for that reason. Oh, and we had a lot of issues with REPLs getting into a bad state with Clojure due to multi methods and protocols; if you’re doing your primary work in the REPL, then having to restart it due to it becoming unstable really sucks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He&#39;s right to emphasize the properties of the systems that support interactive development with a long-running image. In Common Lisp, the difference between defvar and defparameter is a simple example. Traditional Smalltalk systems only supported image-based development. But I always preferred the moderate approach exemplified by most Lisp systems where the source code isn&#39;t overly entangled with the image state.As a long-time but now lapsed Lisper, I never understood some people&#39;s elevation of the REPL. A command-line REPL is a poor man&#39;s development environment. If you&#39;re doing interactive development in Lisp, you&#39;ll be far more productive if you use a normal buffer with eval-defun, eval-buffer and friends. When debugging, you&#39;ll primarily want auto-updating watch expressions and object inspectors. And when you do have good use for a REPL, you&#39;ll still want it to exist within a proper buffer with persistent history, inline object inspection, etc, instead of the low-effort rlwrap terminal experience which usually passes for a REPL.All of this holds doubly true for Smalltalk environments."</p>

We had a live session via thunderbird but there were no channels of support. Luckily we were able to register her old mobile number to achieve a password reset, thanks to a helpful phone provider and NOT google.My mailserver is marked as spam by gmail, a helpful HN commentor pointed out it may be my lack of ipv6 which appears to be the cause. I have no idea why ipv6 would indicate that I’m not a spammer, I can’t ask google because they don’t have a support line.I understand others have far more expensive (read: &gt;1m$) problems with google specifically, and I know I’m not alone here.I just hope that by continually airing grievances with lack of (useful) customer service by major providers, they end up caving and investing in customer support.Until then, fuck you google."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Taking a look at your site, it seems quite clear where all your traffic went. You have a pretty great backlink profile compared to other affiliate sites ive seen but the content is incredibly thin. Based on this, me or anyone else who visits the site just sees an advertising site. There are no personal experiences with the products, the products are not related and the UX does not make the user want to continue exploring the page they landed on. The content here seems more like a statistics site for products than it is a reviews site.The other comments here mentioning cheap as a flag word are somewhat accurate but not entirely. Its possible to rank a site using the word cheap assuming you&#39;re supporting it correctly with related content about a specific product and proper explanation as to what makes it cheap.Honestly, I am very sorry that you lost all your traffic and your revenue but this seems like a VERY fixable problem considering your backlinks. Take your best performing posts, and dramatically increase the word count, add more photos, add overviews of each product instead of just a single line or two pulled from reviews.Happy to help with additional pointers if you want to shoot me a PM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of several posts I&#39;ve seen on HN lately following a similar trend: sudden and unexpected drops in search engine traffic. On the one hand it must be jarring to suddenly have a drop in traffic. But is it necessarily indicative of a bad administration of a search engine?Popularity of sites shift. People&#39;s tastes change. Even without an algorithm change we would not expect search traffic to remain constant. And algorithm changes do shift attention to sites that previously weren&#39;t getting traffic. Would the world better with static search traffic? The incumbents always win, and newcomers have a tough time getting a foothold. That&#39;s what it would take to avoid situations like these, and I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s an improvement over the status quo. Between living in constant worry that the algorithm might change and shift search traffic, and a world where the algorithm never changes and search traffic remains rather static I&#39;m not sure which is really better. In the latter goodcheapandfast.com might never even have existed.Bing&#39;s blocking mechanism seems pretty crude, though, and not sharing why it was blocked seems particularly wonky. Sure it&#39;s a cat and mouse game between scammers and devs, but it&#39;d be nice if they at least vaguely alluded to why the false positive happened."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;[Line] fixed it by adding a random number to the user&#39;s destinationThis is a imperfect solution. There&#39;s two possibilities: the offset (aka &#34;random number&#34;) is dynamic, or it&#39;s fixed. If it&#39;s the former all you have to do is sample enough times to get through the noise. If it&#39;s the latter, it&#39;s not vulnerable to the previous attack, but if you have a known point of reference (so you can deduce what the offset is), then you can still stalk them (forever?). IMO the only way to do is &#34;properly&#34; is to quantize people into map cells, like how apple does it with their coarse location feature[1].[1] &#34;Apple doesn&#39;t reduce the accuracy of location fixes by adding noise.

Then there&#39;s the geopolitical aspect. Is it fair to impose sanctions on Iran.3. There&#39;s another aspect around GitHub policy that asks if an entire organization be banned for the location of one team member.4. Finally, there&#39;s the aspect of relinquishing control. Your app development is on the cloud. IDEs are on the cloud. Deployments are on the cloud.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The US sanctions on Iran has such a massive impact on Iranians that most of us don&#39;t realise.All US companies have to comply and majority of the tech companies are unfortunately in the US.I know you can use a VPN and configure it on a router level to make sure that you are always connected via a VPN but just the fact that 1 slip-up can result in account level blocks (which google is notoriously good at and can essentially shut down your business) means no company would want to work with someone working from Iran.Coming from a 3rd world country, I know the problems of internet censorship which Iranians also face but being too toxic to touch for everyone outside Iran because the US leadership thinks so is just infuriating and heart breaking.Imagine being a programmer in Iran. Not only do you have less resources to learn and grow, you have a massive handicap to find good work as most work is outside of the country.Only bet is to leave the country but even there you have a very low probability as you basically can&#39;t have a trial period for your job as most companies don&#39;t want to risk having their accounts blocked.Most of us here know how degrading and infuriating the tech recruiting processes can be and now add to it the horrors of working from Iran.Wars are not supposed to have civilian casualties but this one has a generation of civilians being starved of information and experience critical for them to grow."</p>

Crowdsurge were backed by Access (Len Blavatnik who owns Warner). The CEO and COO of Crowdsurge went after Ticketmaster as an exit.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some truly impressive results. I&#39;ll pick my usual point here when a fancy new (generative) model comes out, and I&#39;m sure some of the other commenters have alluded to this. The examples shown are likely from a set of well-defined (read: lots of data, high bias) input classes for the model. What would be really interesting is how the model generalizes to /object concepts/ that have yet to be seen, and which have abstract relationships to the examples it has seen. Another commenter here mentioned &#34;red square on green square&#34; working, but &#34;large cube on small cube&#34;, not working. Humans are able to infer and understand such abstract concepts with very few examples, and this is something AI isn&#39;t as close to as it might seem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is simultaneously amazing and depressing, like watching someone set off a hydrogen bomb for the first time and marveling at the mushroom cloud it creates.I really find it hard to understand why people are optimistic about the impact AI will have on our future.The pace of improvement in AI has been really fast over the last two decades, and I don&#39;t feel like it&#39;s a good thing. Compare the best text generator models from 10 years ago with GPT-3. Now do the same for image generators. Now project these improvements 20 years into the future. The amount of investment this work is getting grows with every such breakthrough. It seems likely to me we will figure out general-purpose human-level AI in a few decades.And what then? There are so many ways this could turn into a dystopian future.Imagine for example huge mostly-ML operated drone armies, tens of millions strong, that only need a small number of humans to supervise them. Terrified yet? What happens to democracy when power doesn&#39;t need to flow through a large number of people? When a dozen people and a few million armed drones can oppress a hundred million people?If there&#39;s even a 5% chance of such an outcome (personally I think it&#39;s higher), then we should be taking it seriously."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow. This is amazing. Although I wish they documented how much compute and data was used to get these results.I absolutely believe we&#39;ll crack the fundamental principles of intelligence in our lifetimes. We now have capability to process all public data available on internet (of wikipedia is a huge chunk). We have so many cameras and microphones (one in each pocket).It&#39;s also scary to think if it goes wrong (the great filter for fermi paradox). However I&#39;m optimistic.The brain only uses 20 watts of power to do all its magic. The entire human body is built from 700MB of data in the DNA. The fundamental principles of intelligence is within reach if we look from that perspective.Right now GPT3 and DALL-E seem to be using an insane amount of computation to achieve what they are doing. My prediction is that in 2050, we&#39;ll have pretty good intelligence in our phones that has deep understanding (language and visual) of the world around us."</p>

I use waste in the sense of like trying to assemble something complicated with the instructions just out of arms reach, not in the sense of doing something pointless.In some cases all companies would have to do is not actively hide or obfuscate things. In others it may take more effort but still just a drop in the huge bucket compared to developing a system in the first place.I love Apple&#39;s hardware, I even (mostly) love the OS. If they too believe that it is solid - why prevent people from running what they want? The majority will come back anyway - I&#39;ve run Linux for years and still ended up on MacOS for simplicity. I&#39;ll still buy Macs and run MacOS because it works for me, it&#39;s not like letting me run Linux will cost them money or something.

After the street cred of getting a marginally usable OS up and running evaporates, why continue to take the effort of great engineers and waste it developing an ecosystem that doesn&#39;t care?

This would keep the rest of the UI snappy.  It could also tint those portions of the UI so users can see which app is the culprit of UI slowness.I hope that Rust can someday be used as the basis of an OS that does not rely on sandboxing for security, but instead uses the compiler to enforce security.  Such an OS could use cooperative multitasking and use a lot less energy and less expensive hardware than our current multi-core CPU + MMU + kernel ring model."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Welcome to Project Lightspeed. This is a project that allows anyone to easily deploy their own sub-second latency live-streaming server. In its current state you can stream from OBS [1] and watch that stream back from any desktop browser.This has been a super fun project which has taught me more than any other project I have done. It uses Rust, Go and React and can be deployed fairly easily on a very lightweight server. For example, I have been doing my test streams on a $5 Digital Ocean droplet and the CPU usage is at around 20%. Granted not a lot of people are watching however it is more lightweight than a solution such as Janus.The point of this project is twofold. First I wanted to learn more about WebRTC and real-time communication in general. Second, I wanted to provide a platform where people can setup their own little live-stream environment. Maybe you just want a place where you and some friends can hang out or you are sick of the main-stream platforms.Anyhow as of writing this post it is v0.1.0 and considered an MVP release. In the coming months I (and hopefully some of you :)) will be adding more features and trying to flesh this out into as much of a full featured platform as possible. Feel free to take a look at the repo and let me know what you all think :)[1] Open Broadcast Software (OBS): https://obsproject.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About the choice of license (MIT): could you share your considerations about it? (if any)It&#39;s a topic I&#39;m interested in. Mainly to see examples (and learn from them) about when people prefer lax licenses on the style of &#34;do what you want with this, including a closed-source proprietary business&#34; (MIT, Apache) which has allowed in the past that big Co&#39;s. benefit from it without giving back (lots of cases in HN), vs. strong copyleft &#34;do what you want except closed-source proprietary stuff&#34; style (generally speaking, the GPL family -- EDIT: I know that this, being mainly a server-side thing, would be more affected by AGPL than by GPL. Bear with me.).If there are no business / commercialization intentions in the foreseeable future, would it make sense to use a GPL license (one of them) to build a strong open-source community?Or it doesn&#39;t matter in practice?

But I was too lazy to do it properly.I ended up with this hack: https://i.imgur.com/jDeMxly.pngRedirect the &#34;Record&#34; button of obs to make ffmpeg output to an http endpoint, which is a small server that just forwards any bytes it receives to connected consumers. They can then play it back with    ffplay -fflags nobuffer -flags low_delay -framedrop -strict experimental https://stream.server/lawl

I&#39;ve found that most of the latency is actually coming from the player. I.e. VLC has way more latency, even if you tell it to not buffer. TCP is a bit of an issue since ffplay doesn&#39;t speed up playback when it falls behind, but it mostly works and you can just restart ffplay if you fall behind too far. When it works (good network conditions) it also achieves sub second latency.Will definitely have to give this a try over my hack."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Reading the judgement the key points are on pages 116 onwards and the extradition is denied under section 91(3) of the EA 2003 which reads:&gt; The condition is that the physical or mental condition of the person is such that it would be unjust or oppressive to extradite him.The judge states:&gt; it is my judgment that there is a real risk that he will  be kept in the near isolated conditions imposed by the  harshest SAMs (special administrative measures) regime, both pre-trial and post-trialAnd goes on to contrast with the conditions at HMP Belmarsh:&gt; many of the protective factors currently in place at HMP Belmarsh would be removed by these conditions. Mr. Assange’s health improved on being removed from relative isolation in healthcare. He has been able to access the support of family and friends. He has had access to a Samaritans phone line. He has benefited from a trusting relationship with the prison In-Reach psychologist. By contrast, a SAMs regime would severely restrict his contact with all other human beings, including other prisoners, staff and his family. In detention subject to SAMs, he would have absolutely no communication with other prisoners, even through the walls of his cell, and time out of his cell would be spent alone.These conditions sound barbaric to me and I&#39;d go as far to describe them as torture. Amnesty International do a better job of outlining the problems with this regime than I can: https://www.amnestyusa.org/reports/entombed-isolation-in-the...Frankly I don&#39;t understand why the UK continues to maintain an extradition treaty with a country which clearly has a poor record on human rights and fails to maintain a justice system that meets the UN&#39;s Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners.She concludes:&gt; I am satisfied that, in these harsh conditions, Mr. Assange’s mental health would deteriorate causing him to commit suicide with the “single minded determination” of his autism spectrum disorder.&gt; I order the discharge  of Julian Paul Assange, pursuant  to section 91(3) of the EA 2003Whilst a victory nonetheless for Assange, it is unfortunate that the entire judgement seems to come down to this point alone. Let&#39;s hope it is not overturned."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there&#39;s anything to learn from Assange and Snowden:1. Our western &#34;liberal&#34; democracies stop being liberal when the government gets angry at you at a personal level.2. With enough propaganda, you can make people believe anything, even that Snowden is a &#34;traitor&#34; to the US.3. Politically vociferous people (the mob) don&#39;t give a shit about you unless you&#39;re instrumental to support the cause du jour"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually don&#39;t think this is such great news for him.Extradition was specifically blocked on the grounds of a particular regime he might be subjected to (to be fair, probably the only legal grounds on which he had any chance of succeeding). That leaves the US with a way out if they want to proceed with the extradition - guarantee a different set of circumstances.If the judge had found on more substantive grounds, those would have been much more resistant to that. For instance, all the claims based on language in the extradition treaty and other international agreements failed and they failed for pretty fundamental legal reasons. English courts only have regard for domestic law and it is for parliament to pass laws consistent with the treaties that have been signed, therefore claims based on treaty language won&#39;t work.That means that none of the claims on the political nature of his activities were upheld and those would have provided a much more robust and durable bar to extradition."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I talk to colleagues in tech about unions I hear a lot of misconceptions, seemingly based in stereotypes about what unions are for and who they serve. People often seem to think of unions as being purely blue-collar operations, and this just isn&#39;t true.For example, I&#39;ve had people tell me that they don&#39;t support unions in tech because they&#39;ll be &#34;paid less&#34;, or less competent engineers will be promoted faster.And it&#39;s strange, because the other major industry in California - the film industry - is heavily unionised, and you just don&#39;t see that happening there. You have vocally supportive multi-millionaire card-carrying members of the Screen Actors Guild, the Writers Guild, and the Directors Guild to name a few. None of these unions are limiting the work their members are carrying out.This is because those unions are serving a very different purpose to the stereotypical union some engineers seem to fear. SAG, the DGA, and the WGA aren&#39;t guaranteeing hours or limiting pay: they&#39;re simply trying to curb abuse in what it a very abusive industry, and putting in place procedures to protect members and resolve grievances.And they don&#39;t always get it right, and I don&#39;t pretend that Hollywood is a perfect utopia of worker relations, but I think it&#39;s pretty undeniable that the industry is a much better place with the unions around."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Don&#39;t think we&#39;ve ever seen Hollywood in the modern era without unions, so not sure how you can claim it&#39;s &#34;undeniable&#34; the industry is better off. We basically have no clue if it&#39;s better off or not.Unions are intended for industries where a worker doesn&#39;t have a marketplace of options as there is a single or just a few employers (e.g. Hollywood, teachers, coal mining towns, hospital staff, etc.). Unionizing at Google makes no sense, as there are thousands of tech companies hiring engineers in the valley -- engineers can &#34;collectively bargain&#34; with Google by simply leaving and working somewhere &#34;better&#34;.The reality is that Google is an easy place to work relative to how much people get paid. People don&#39;t want to leave a cushy job for one where they would have to work harder for their money, so instead, they are trying other means to have their cake and eat it too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems incredibly significant that only 230 people are officially involved with these plans to unionize. As of 2019, Google had nearly 120,000 employees.[0] That seems quite small, relatively speaking.Legally (I think, just learning about this now), to form a union, a majority of workers must show their willingness to form a union. Alternatively, to choose an existing union to join, an election with 30% of the workers support is required.[1]So with that said, am I reading this right? Does this group of 230 people need to find at least ~40,000 more people for this to be a valid effort to form/join a legal union?[0]https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/02/google-employee-growth-2001-...[1]https://www.legalmatch.com/law-library/article/how-to-form-a..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Back when I worked at Marvell Semiconductor (circa 2005), we made laser printer ASICs for HP. We did a lot of dithering in hardware. We had a hardware block that did error diffusion, we had a hardware block that did regular diffusion. We also had a hardware block that did Blue Noise. I was responsible for implementing the firmware that drove those printers&#39; scan/copy path: scan an image in monochrome, run through the dither hardware to create the bit pattern fed to the laser engine.No one could explain to me how to use the blue noise block. I couldn&#39;t understand what the blue noise block was doing. This is the first article that explained, in terms I could understand, how blue noise dithering works.I can die happy. Thank you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is such a well-written article: it describes the impetus, it is researched, it has great examples both as code and as output, and it piques interest. In the late 1990&#39;s I contracted with an embedded software company to optimize a dithering algorithm for 8-bit MCUs that was used in most laser printers &amp; copiers, and this paper is a really good overview."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; According to Wikipedia, “Dither is an intentionally applied form of noise used to randomize quantization error”, and is a technique not only limited to images. It is actually a technique used to this day on audio recordings […]Dithering as a digital signal processing technique is also used frequently in the digital control of physical systems. One example of this is in the control of hydraulic servo valves[1]; these valves are usually pretty small and their performance can be dominated by a lot of external factors. One of the biggest ones is &#34;stiction&#34;, or static friction, wherein if the moving parts of the valve are at rest it can take a large amount of current to get them going again which translates in to poor control of the valve and in turn poor control of the thing the valve is trying to move. It&#39;s common to use very high frequency/small amplitude dithering on these valves to eliminate the effects of stiction without compromising accuracy which greatly improves the control stability and responsiveness of the servo valves.1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrohydraulic_servo_valve"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Definitely beautiful and would love for something simple and clean to eat LinkedIn&#39;s lunch.I don&#39;t have much to add in addition to everyone else except this: I am really disturbed by the common meme of faces-inside-circles. Why do we need faces? It just distracts from the content. I love the idea of being able to link former colleagues together - that&#39;s neat - but I&#39;m very anti-face and  there are any number of ways to do it that does not involve people&#39;s pictures.Edit: Wow this got a lot of upvotes. So, I&#39;ll continue for a sec: There is so, so much conscious and unconscious judgment and game playing with pictures, I don&#39;t even know where to start. Let&#39;s leave this to be simple, clean and beautiful without the faces."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I started read.cv when transitioning from full time to freelance design in July. I wanted an easy to update &#39;about me&#39; page to link from my website and bio – something simpler than LinkedIn and more dynamic than a PDF.Design wise I focused on legibility and tried to give projects/side projects equal weight to things like education and work experience. A few unique features: tagging collaborators in your experiences, status updates, and print optimized profiles.It took me around three months (Sept to November) to get it out the door, and I&#39;ve been working on making improvements since. Open to any questions or feedback!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good start, but I&#39;m not a huge fan of this the way it is now.First, the font is tiny for my old eyes.  Not all of us, especially hiring managers, are still in their 20s and can read these tiny fonts. I measured it with a ruler and the text is 1mm tall.  Also, the font is gray on white, which is pretty but hard to read. In contrast, Linkedin is three times bigger and black on white, much easier to read.Second, after looking at the example, I have almost no idea what you&#39;ve done.  All I see are job titles.  I don&#39;t see any accomplishments or even job duties.  It looks like I could add those things when I create my own profile, but having them missing on the example isn&#39;t a good look.Third, the face circles.  I see face circles under each job, but they aren&#39;t clickable nor are there tooltips.  I have no idea what those are.  I assume they&#39;re other people who worked at the same place?  Maybe connections of yours who have worked at the same place?  That&#39;s a cool idea, but it needs to be more discoverable.  At the very least a tooltip would be good.Overall, when I&#39;m looking at a professional profile, I&#39;m usually doing it because I want to hire or work with someone.  The main information I want to know is 1) Do we have anyone in common I can ask about you?  2) What did you accomplish at your previous workplaces or otherwise?  3) Have you worked anywhere that I recognize and when, so I can ask my other friends who worked there if they know you?The face circles accomplish #1, so that&#39;s great.  #2 looks possible, but the design seems to minimize the accomplishments, as opposed to Linkedin which sort of puts it in your face.  And #3 seems to be covered but again the design minimizes the information I want most.I would say a good place to start would be asking yourself, &#34;Why does Linkedin look the way it does?&#34;.  A lot of their design comes from customer feedback, and their main customers are recruiters and hiring managers.  Steal their good stuff and leave their dark patterns behind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have many fond memories of my first real job as sysadmin/render wrangler for a small animation company about fifteen years ago.Cores and memory were indeed what mattered, and as long as frames could be fitted into memory then the machine was left to render the frame and then save it back out to shared disk. There was no virtualization, just raw compute hardware running at full capacity 24/7. The scene was already split into different layers and rendered as sequences of frames that were then composited into final products.First job, first mini-datacenter in a new building, and there I am asking contractors to knock a hole in the building to fit air handlers due to the heat we were expecting to generate. Was great fun.It taught me a lot about automated systems management."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some ideas on this topic:1. Inconvenience based solutions don&#39;t address the problem: using apps to restrict phone use, physically hiding the phone etc. Once you leave those carefully constrained conditions, you are more vulnerable than ever. Not to mention the contradiction with the core issue that it&#39;s a symptom rather than a cause.2. Turning abstinence as an ongoing status condition (e.g. &#34;X days since I did Y&#34;) is a trap. It sets you up for later failure by burdening you with a perpetually unfinished objective with psychological consequences that only increase as the &#39;highscore&#39; increases. This could work with things that are less easily accessible like heroin, but it&#39;s not going to work with something as easily accessible as a phone or computer.3. The solution that works with 1 and 2 is probably urge surfing as it tackles the issue directly4. It&#39;s easier to think of it as an addiction to browsing rather than an addiction to the phone itself. You have to catch yourself during any browsing moment in any context to eventually make progress. Be intentional in almost every action instead of going on auto-pilot, although obviously resting at the end of the day is fine. It&#39;s more a general philosophy than a hard rule meant to exhaust you.5. The eventual goal is a rich life where you no longer feel the need to distract yourself"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The paper they are basing the opening sentence &#34;phone addiction is one of the biggest non-drug addiction(sic) in human history&#34; on is written by a Doctor of Business Administration, a dean that has &#34;particular industries of interest are banks and non-profit organizations&#34; in his bio and a third researcher with 2 publications total, including the article in question (published 2011).This may in no way weaken the point that some of the brightest minds of today are working on producing digital Skinner boxes, black on top, with humans as the rats, interfaced via phones.But basing an attempt at a strong argument about the addictive nature of cell-phones on an article with low relevance in scientific fields specializing in addiction could be described as suspect (most citations on g.scholar on the piece could be delineated as in the fields of business and management )."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I basically discourage addiction by making things “difficult” for myself on my phone:- Minimal web bookmarks (i.e. I have to type in most web sites I want to visit; this is just enough of an encumbrance that I won’t flip open things like Reddit every 30 seconds).- I never install apps meant for content consumption, I use their web sites.  (This is usually a better experience anyway, since the vast majority of them are somehow worse than their web sites, packed with ads/notifications/spying/crap that no one should want anyway.)- Certain web sites I refuse to use at all on mobile.  This gives me a much larger and more useful view anyway, and I can enforce sanity with a lot more plug-ins that way.- As of latest iOS, I shove most apps into the Library so they are not even on my home screen.  That way, they are straightforward to retrieve with a swipe-down search but not as easy as just tapping them open.  I find that I use them slightly less this way.- I turn off many notifications, since app-makers have long abused them anyway (as virtual ads, or designed in some way to suck people back into their apps for no reason; I drew the line when apps started outright lying about things, e.g. red dots implying messages that were not actually there, etc.).- I set it up so that my lock screen will not show most things without an extra step."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Judge Patricia Millett characterized the DOJ’s argument as giving the government the ability to “unilaterally decide to kill U.S. citizens,” according to coverage of the argument by Courthouse News Service. “Do you appreciate how extraordinary that proposition is?”“DOJ” in this case is the defense attorney. What a shit job. Regardless, the DOJ is not giving the USG the ability to kill US Persons with no judicial review. Judge Millett’s exasperation should be an example of how preposterous this is.The way this post is titled is misleading and is intended to flame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Can someone explain to me how the headline matches up with the content?&gt;The government sought to dismiss the case, invoking the state secrets privilege because Kareem sought discovery on whether he had been targeted, the process the government used to target him, and whether the United States had attempted to kill him. A federal judge agreed with the government.The involvement of state secrets is what is preventing discovery of whether or you were targeted by the government, not whether or not they are allowed to kill you. This seems very different from the government
 provably killing someone, and then claiming &#34;state secrets&#34; as a defense for being allowed to do it.True, it may not be provable that you were targeted if &#34;state secrets&#34; prevents evidence from coming to light, but this is orthogonal to whether or not killing you is legally allowed, which is what the headline is suggesting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The incidents described occurred in Idlib, Syria between June 2016 to August 2016. This was contemporaneous with the US effort to support the Syrian Kurds around Raqqa. But Idlib is quite far away.Secondly, Airwars.org does not show US strikes in that area and the US insists coalition forces in general did not have any air strikes at Idlib during the time in question.Finally, I do not find the title to be a fair summary of their argument for dismissal:&gt;Plaintiff lacks standing to pursue this suit.  Plaintiff alleges that he was in the vicinity of five near-misses in Syria—a nation with an ongoing civil war.  But he alleges no facts specifically linking the United States to those attacks.  The most he offers is an unsupported assertion that one attack involved a type of missile used by the United States, among other countries.  And he likewise fails to plausibly allege that any of these attacks, even if attributable to the United States, actually targeted him."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am one of the few people that inspects the source-code of extensions. It&#39;s easy to do, for Firefox for example, just right-click and save-as in the extensions site, then rename your extension to a .zip file and extract e.g:    addon.xpi --&gt; addon.zip

Then manually sift through the code looking for obvious malicious intent (or not so obvious malicious intent if the author is doing obfuscation). Note: obfuscation is a red flag! A simple scan for `https://` / &#39;http://&#39;  would usually yield interesting URLs where data is sent. I have actually spotted malicious addons in the wild this way and reported them to Mozilla. They were thankfully removed.Note: Obfuscation is NOT the same as minification, and I don&#39;t mean minification when using the word obfuscation!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We need to talk about how difficult it is to monetize browser extensions. Most of these problems occur when a reputable extension gets sold to a less reputable owner, frequently for a relatively small amount of money (4-5 figures). Even very popular extensions have a hard time monetizing. Unfortunately, Chrome has recently made the situation worse by deprecating Chrome Web Store payments, and Firefox eliminated their paid extension store several years ago.If the only way to monetize an extension is to exploit its users for data, this kind of thing is going to keep happening. It&#39;s perfectly understandable how someone who is doing a lot of work for no pay will eventually get tired of it or have other priorities in life, which is what happened in this case. Perhaps we all need to stop taking it for granted that browser extensions ought to be free? Or maybe the browser vendors themselves can find ways of financially supporting extension authors. I feel that money is essential to both the problem and the solution.Of course, paid upfront software gets sold to new owners too. But if the software is paid upfront, the expectation is that the new owner will perhaps do a better job of maintaining and marketing the software, and that&#39;s why the new owner buys it. When the software is paid, the new owner has an opportunity to make money legitimately, without secretly exploiting the existing user base."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I still remember Craig Silverstein being asked what his biggest mistake at Google was and him answering &#34;Not pushing for ECC memory.&#34;Google&#39;s initial strategy (c. 2000) around this was to save a few bucks on hardware, get non-ECC memory, and then compensate for it in software.  It turns out this is a terrible idea, because if you can&#39;t count on memory being robust against cosmic rays, you also can&#39;t count on the software being stored in that memory being robust against cosmic rays.  And when you have thousands of machines with petabytes of RAM, those bitflips do happen.  Google wasted many man-years tracking down corrupted GFS files and index shards before they finally bit the bullet and just paid for ECC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I beg this, every time this conversation comes up it’s the same answer “I don’t see a problem”.It’s so easy to chalk these kind of errors to other issues, a little corruption here, a running program goes bezerk there- could be a buggy program or a little accidental memory overwrite. Reboot will fix it.But I ran many thousands of physical machines, petabytes of RAM, I tracked memory flip errors and they were _common_; common even in: less dense memory, in thick metal enclosures surrounded by mesh. Where density and shielding impacts bitflips a lot.My own experience tracking bitflips across my fleet led me to buy a Xeon laptop with ECC memory (precision 5520) and it has (anecdotally) been significantly more reliable than my desktop."</p>

You look at the code and say &#34;it&#39;s can&#39;t make it here, because this was set&#34; but when you can&#39;t trust your memory you can&#39;t trust anything.And as the timeline goes to infinity, you may also get one of these reports and be asked to fix it... good luck."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apart from those benchmark games a lot of real world C is a lot less performant than people think it might be. I spent a fair amount of time reviewing C code in the last 5 years - and things that pop up in nearly every review are costly string operations. Linear counts due to the use of null terminated strings and extra allocations for substrings to attach null terminators, or just deep copies because ownership can’t be determined are far more common than exceptional. This happens because null terminated strings feel like idiomatic C to most people.Rust avoids those from the start by making slices idiomatic.Another thing I commonly see is the usage of suboptimal containers (like arrays with linear search) - just because it’s there’s no better alternative at hand (standard library doesn’t offer ones and dependency management is messy). Which also makes it less surprising that code in higher level languages might perform better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Once LLVM fixes some bugs with `noalias`, at which point Rust will begin using it again in more circumstances [1], I&#39;d expect to see Rust get even faster in these benchmarks, given that the Rust compiler knows much more about which pointers do/do-not alias than most other programming languages [2] and the myriad optimizations this knowledge allows.[1] https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues/54878#issuecomment-...[2] https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/aliasing.html"</p>

Try searching for Ozonetel on Google. There will be six competitor ads and then our website will show up :)In our early days we used to be scared and bid for it.Lost a lot of money doing that. Then we talked about it and stopped. Again, no change in customer acquisition. Turns out, customers scroll down the ads and still click on our website.Are our competitors getting some of our traffic?Of course.But my business is not built on the assumption that people will not find my competitors.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Stepping back a bit, I feel the argument is analogous to how music is becoming more mainstream and generic, how casual gamers &#34;corrupt&#34; the art form of gaming, how clickbait and stupit stuff is overshadowing lovingly curated independent websites, eternal September etc.One answer to all these propositions is that the valuable stuff is still there, you just have an additional flood of mediocre boring predictable stuff. You can still find enough indie music and games and movies to spend all your free time on.Similarly, if you know where to look and whose papers to watch out for, you can read more interesting stuff. The existence of more bullshit makes the filtering somewhat more effort, but it&#39;s bearable.Most papers are never deeply read anyway, outside of the reviewers. Even citations don&#39;t mean someone really read the paper in depth.So, most medíocre, boring papers get ignored.It&#39;s an illusion to expect that every researcher can pump out multiple really interesting non-boring papers every year. So we pretend. We write, we cite, we present, overiflate, overpromise etc. It must look like there is steady hard noble work and toil. It&#39;s like a ritual. The scientists are writing all these papers so tax payers can sleep well that their money is paid for hard work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing to keep in mind is that some of the papers which reviewers consider very marginal turn out to be breakthroughs. For example Jim Allison, who later won the Nobel Prize:&#34;Allison was hoping to be published by one of the leading peer-reviewed research journals. But nobody at Cell or Nature or any of the A-list, peer-reviewed journals was willing to publish the findings of this junior academic from Smithville, Texas. “Finally, I ended up publishing the results in a new journal called The Journal of Immunology.” It wasn’t Science or the New England Journal of Medicine, but it was in print, and in the world.“At the end of the paper, I said, ‘This might be the cell antigen receptor, and here are the reasons why I think that it is the T-cell antigen receptor,’ and I just listed it out, all the reasons.” It was a bold announcement regarding the biggest topic in immunology. “And nobody noticed it,” Allison says. “Except in one lab.”&#34;https://www.wired.com/story/meet-jim-allison-the-texan-who-j...So you really need to publish the marginal stuff to make sure the breakthrough stuff gets published as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"But on the other hand, with a severe replication crisis in science (https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/21504366/science-replicat...), isn&#39;t it a good thing that we have a bunch of boring papers that are close to stuff that&#39;s already happened? It&#39;s not people replicating others&#39; findings exactly, but it at least gives points of comparison that can help to weed out some of the problematic work out there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Funny, I actually have an open Pinetime in front of me right now. I use it for my masters thesis and it&#39;s a really nice project. If you want to try out some embedded development (that you can actually show to friends who don&#39;t aren&#39;t developers), I think this is the perfect project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be the perfect target for the products of a company like Pine. A long-time geek who uses open-source software on nearly all of his devices, a tinkerer who doesn&#39;t mind recompiling a kernel or picking a solderer to make things work, and someone who seeks for absolute flexibility from his devices with zero corporate compromises.Unfortunately, the mediocre hardware used in their devices keeps holding me back.First came a phone with a 9-year-old A53 Cortex chipset. Then a tablet with the same outdated chipset. Then a laptop that ships with a Rockchip RK3399 with 4GB of RAM, in an era when 4GB barely suffice to run a browser with a few tabs. And now they are releasing a smartwatch with a 64 MHz core and 64 KB of RAM - some specs you would have expected from a very cheap smartwatch released 7-8 years ago.Why should I use a device whose hardware is almost a decade old at the time of purchase? And how do they even expect anyone to actually use these devices as their primary daily drivers, and not as proofs of concept, nice toys to tinker on every now and then or show off to friends?I understand that Pine wants to use 100% open hardware, and that comes with heavy compromises, but are these compromises worth it?If you ask even the geekest user out there whether they prefer a device whose source code is 100% pure and doesn&#39;t contain any binary blobs, or a device that doesn&#39;t start freezing/lagging after a couple of minutes of normal usage, I bet that anyone would opt for the latter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, just to make sure I understand this correctly.- This is basically a commercial smartwach (the Colmi P8) that is based on a well documented SOC, the nordic nRF52832- The open source version comes with an enclosure that is not glued shut, so that it is easy to access testpoints on the pcb.- Development is done by accessing the nRF51 SWD interface with pogo pins or similar. The programming interface can be a standard SWD interface such as an STLink cloneOk, sounds easy enough. It should be possible to just buy one of those smartwatches and crack them open? But OTOH the developer version is not much more expensive.The main question is now: What software to run on it, that goes beyond a few experiments? Is there any kind of open source smartwatch OS that would run on this?Edit: Corrected typo, of course I meant SWD interface, not SWM. (SWM or rather SWIM is for STM8)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a corporation, Facebook truly seems to be trying to improve its behavior for the benefit of society at large, but the company is finding it very difficult to do The Right Thing, because it would reduce future revenue growth, shrink long-term profitability, and hurt the company&#39;s competitive standing against the many other companies that are trying to eat Facebook&#39;s lunch every day.In the extreme, Facebook&#39;s choices appear to be: (a) act in the best interest of society and get f#cked by competitors; or (b) remain a dominant force in the market, but as a side effect, f#ck everybody. All options for Facebook appear to be a mix of those two horrible choices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook is a company that never stood by small businesses. It&#39;s also the company that manipulated users into a free basic services just to create their own walled garden in the internet.Still, sardonically they created two ad campaigns: Apple vs free internet and vs small businesses. Their whole marketing stunt was laughably wrong. No wonder their chief left the company."</p>

Sadly, a whole host of issues specific to my dev environment meant that it was useless as I’d spend more time fixing it than getting any valuable use out of it. More importantly, this became the very reason I switched to arch full time, and haven’t looked back since. I still hope that it becomes what it was promised to be, although I don’t see myself going back to windows any time soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After constantly getting caught in bugs between WSL and Docker, i&#39;m now running Ubuntu Server headless with a Windows VM (with GPU passthrough) on top.The biggest issue across all these things is filesystems. There is simply no good way to share a filesystem between Windows and Linux that is both 1. fast 2. fully correct - i.e doesn&#39;t break some code.SMB/NFS just never work super well because they are slow, or programs think they are local filesystems so things break (e.g VScode won&#39;t detect new files created on the linux side of a SMB mount without a manual refresh). Plenty of details on getting permissions right too. Not to mention extended attributes which differ slightly and break stuff. Network file systems in general are just too different to local FS&#39;s for programs to work seamlessly.The 2 non-ideal solutions I&#39;ve found are 1. keep all files in linux + edit over network using VSCode Remote or IntelliJ Remote support or 2. keep a copy of the dev workspace in windows, and use something like unison (or manual git) to sync."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi everyone, OP here.I used a Seek RevealPro which outputs TIFF files that contain 32-bit floating point values. I created a script that takes in a Seek TIFF and outputs an 8-bit greyscale integer TIFF:https://github.com/dheera/iceland-thermal/blob/master/script...I then panoramically stitched those 8-bit TIFFs together (some with the help of hugin, and some manually with GIMP) and distortion-corrected them as best as I could to a black-and-white visible light image. I also created an artistically-chosen color map for each image. For the final output image, hue and saturation are fully based on thermal data, and lightness is a combination of thermal and visible data. Scripts to generate the final output images, along with the panoramically pre-stitched data, and the color maps I used:https://github.com/dheera/iceland-thermalAlso, my Instagram, which is mostly astrophotography of late, but I did post thermal images there before and I may do so in the future again if I can find another good set of interesting thermal subjects to do this in!https://instagram.com/dheeranet/"</p>

But what&#39;s really weird is it seems to not be available anymore. I&#39;m guessing export restrictions or massive demand for thermal cameras during Covid along with supply chain issues. IIRC it is also 25 frames a second, which is unusually high for thermal cameras due to export restrictions.Edit: Here&#39;s a post on creating panoramic images with therm-app. https://www.flickr.com/groups/therm-app-users/discuss/721576..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The new edition has been split in two parts. The pdf draft (921 pages) and python code [1] of the first part are now available. The table of contents of the second part is here [2].From the preface:&#34;By Spring 2020, my draft of the second edition had swollen to about 1600 pages, and I was still not
done. At this point, 3 major events happened. First, the COVID-19 pandemic struck, so I decided
to “pivot” so I could spend most of my time on COVID-19 modeling. Second, MIT Press told me
they could not publish a 1600 page book, and that I would need to split it into two volumes. Third,
I decided to recruit several colleagues to help me finish the last ∼ 15% of “missing content”. (See
acknowledgements below.)The result is two new books, “Probabilistic Machine Learning: An Introduction”, which you are
currently reading, and “Probabilistic Machine Learning: Advanced Topics”, which is the sequel to
this book [Mur22].Together these two books attempt to present a fairly broad coverage of the field
of ML c. 2020, using the same unifying lens of probabilistic modeling and Bayesian decision theory
that I used in the first book.
Most of the content from the first book has been reused, but it is now split fairly evenly between
the two new books. In addition, each book has lots of new material, covering some topics from deep
learning, but also advances in other parts of the field, such as generative models, variational inference
and reinforcement learning. To make the book more self-contained and useful for students, I have
also added some more background content, on topics such as optimization and linear algebra, that
was omitted from the first book due to lack of space.Another major change is that nearly all of the software now uses Python instead of Matlab.&#34;[1] https://github.com/probml/pyprobml[2] https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book2.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is probably my favorite introductory machine learning book. The fact that he places almost everything in the language of graphical models is such a good common ground to build off.This really sets you up to realize that there is (and should be) a lot more to doing a good job in machine learning than simply minimizing an objective function. The answers you get depend on the model you create as do the questions you can hope to answer.I don&#39;t see a clear list of differences between this new edition. Does anyone know what&#39;s new?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For anybody truly serious about this field, I recommend the below book. It has some poor reviews on Amazon, which I was shocked to see, but it is my favourite book and taught me the core of probability theory and statistics, in a way most books don’t. Your understanding of Machine Learning will be better than 90% of those out there, if you can get through the principles in this book.I topped statistics at the most prestigious university in my country both at the undergrad and postgrad level, and had no problem discussing advanced concepts with Senior PHDs in Quantitative Fields, and I thank this book the most for beginning my journey on this. But, and this is important, make sure to do all the exercises!https://www.amazon.com/John-Freunds-Mathematical-Statistics-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Over the past year I&#39;ve slowly started to realize this as well. What changed? Working for a company that is publicly known enough for people on HN (and Reddit) to comment about it. It has been hilarious and scary to read comments from people who don&#39;t work at the company say completely inaccurate things like they are facts.In this case, it&#39;s easy for me to recognize they are wrong. But what about other topics (or companies) I don&#39;t know much about? I have no easy way of recognizing inaccuracies so I default to mostly accepting them. Sadly, you need to be skeptical of almost everything you read even when the person sounds like they know the subject matter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real world is usually more dynamic, maleable and workable than the internet has you believe too.If you believed the internet, you would believe you can only ever use the best parts in the perfect configuration for almost everything. Be it metalwork, mountain biking, computing, drones or any other hobby regularly discussed online.The reality is you can make do with in so many different ways that if you can&#39;t afford the best you can still have oodles of fun on cheaper equipment. Half the fun is learning all this &#34;expertise&#34; the internet has on your own.Can&#39;t afford a Bridgeport mill? Buy something cheaper and work around the edge cases. Can&#39;t afford a full suspension bike? Get a hardtail and have tonnes of fun.Someone is always quick to add in the caveats, but guess what, a new rider doesn&#39;t give a shit that he can&#39;t send 8ft drops on his hard tail. There are hours of fun on the bike ahead, none of it sending 8ft drops. The new hobby machinist isn&#39;t bothered that they can&#39;t mill titanium, they are just stoked to be getting started."</p>

They are not normal people from a statical standpoint.On average a person does not do any one spicific thing.Everyone online has contributed to the internet, everyone has written something and everyone has excersised.I&#39;ve seen this brought up before that only 2-3% of redditors contribute, like it&#39;s a bad thing or a unique thing.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"KDE on Linux used to have something similar in the late 90s - it allowed you to open a website URL as a directory listing, so you could browse the site&#39;s asset directories and open image files, etc. Think like a client-side generated version of Apache&#39;s index pages, but using your local file manager. It was a plugin to the VFS framework (KIO) the desktop and all the apps use, so it would also work e.g. in Open File dialogs from anywhere within the toolset.I remember using this regularly to mass-download the images embedded into a page - open the page this way by replacing http:// with a pseudo-protocol, copy all, paste, done.KDE always came with a lot of VFS trickery like that. Ripping a music CD into MP3s was similar - you&#39;d open the volume in the file manager and see your tracks along with a virtual folder full of MP3 files. The rip and encoding would happen on the fly, and you could do this e.g. straight from the file attach feature in an instant messenger.Desktop Linux was a lot less friendly to get working smoothly back then compared to now, and feature discovery was by word of mouth more than anything, but it sure felt like living in the future early."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this is awesome!My OS is heavily scripted and keybound, thanks to 15 years of cumulative incremental fixes and a kick-ass WM.  The one thing that&#39;s frustrated me is the relative black box that my browser represents, and writing a shim between my WM and browser tabs has been on my TODO list for a long, long time (through a couple of aborted attempts due to a combination of Chrome&#39;s at-the-time obsolete documentation and probably-necessary security model).I&#39;m cautiously optimistic that this is going to represent a dramatic step function in ease-of-use of my OS, in the same way that i3 was.EDIT: I should clarify that I did read the author&#39;s note that this is experimental, not secure, etc. I&#39;m mainly just excited about having a jumping-off point to play around with and possibly hack on a little."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a brilliant piece of work. As someone who has thousands of tabs open, I&#39;ve always wanted to &#34;close all tabs with a single command&#34;, or view all the open tabs and mass select them and close, for years. Otherwise, going through them one by one and deleting takes forever.

They create ads offering your expert development services, ostensibly competing with your existing website, but with intentionally slashed pricing and a ‘creatively’ misrepresented offering (aka growth hacking). Then they subcontract the job to some crappy outsourcing firm that bungles it, but who cares, they got their cut and you signed the TOS.Now bad reviews are piling up online about the bad experiences people had with your business, your reputation is destroyed, and your business is next.I know it’s not a perfect analogy but try to empathize with the restaurants here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it would have been much better to outlaw misrepresentation and advertising without prior agreement (ie the pizza place that did not agree to partnership should only pop up in the search results if the user searches for it) and there should be a warning mandated like &#34;Startup Inc is not affiliated with the Moms and Pops Pizza. If you proceed, we will place your order by calling PHONE_NUMBER and pick up your order from ADDRESS&#34;. It should still be legal for the end users to have a service do chores for them including picking up food but only if there is no confusion on the side of the user what is happening here (incl. the fact the pizza may get cold through a no  fault of Moms and Pops Pizza).Edit: oh, the law would also outlaw food picking apps from delivering from Walmart too (&#34;The code defines food facility [...] as an operation that stores, [...] or otherwise provides food [...] at the retail level.&#34;)"</p>

Building a workflow engine is one of those things... nearly every enterprise app has one, and normally you shouldn’t need to build one if you can source one... but it is an exercise that makes you a stronger engineer/developer too, deepening understanding of the patterns that lie beneath most systems.Back when I was building, openly available workflow engines, BPML, BPEL etc. were not really a thing yet, so it made a little more sense to be building one.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petri_net"</p>

All the people playing video games have mastered skills that aren’t being taken full advantage of. Anyways, coroutines in Unity can be used to do interesting things over time while attached to the game loop.My point, despite my digression, is just how there are still basic/intermediate topics I have only been able to appreciate recently.

Last years model costs $120 million per piece and you need 10-15 of them for TSMC gigafactory.TWINSCAN NXE:3400C (7 and 5 nm nodes, &gt;170 wafers per hour) is probably the most expensive machine in the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So, first thing when it comes to big dollar (or in this case Euro) numbers: some of these funds will be loans, not grants. In this case the split will be about 50-50.Second, this is not new money, this is part of recovery funds already allocated in July 2020 for combating the economic recession created by the Coronavirus [1]. These funds were already earmarked for environmental and digital initiatives. This declaration is probably a clarification of how much is given specifically to the digital initiatives.This looks quite smart to me. In the US neither the original CARES act ($1.4 TN) passed in March, nor the new stimulus bill ($0.9 TN) has any funds dedicated to cutting edge industries. There were instead funds for airline companies and cruise lines.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Next_Generation_EU#Recovery_fu..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Posting anonymously for obvious reasons.Unlike others, I actually find this story fairly believable.When I first joined Apple, straight out of college - a good program, top three in the country - I was abused similarly. I joined a team that was on a project behind schedule.Our manager was a brusque, no-nonsense sort of dude. But he clearly had anger problems. On the team were 2 senior engineers, me, and a junior engineer that had just completed his internship and was on a work Visa.As the project got closer to the deadline, and the scope increased, the manager got agitated. In our team meetings, he would start yelling at us. People down the hallways would stare at us with those &#34;looks.&#34; In our 1:1s he told us we might not have a job if our product doesn&#39;t ship on time (we were competing with another internal team to beat them to the punch.)The two senior engineers decided they&#39;d had enough and quit the team. The manager told us to work overtime (no overtime pay, but we had to for fear of our job). He promised us that if we did it that we would get a month of vacation on him, and that he could secure it for us.The product released. After countless nights of overtime we did it. Our manager left, our guarantee of a month of vacation evaporated, and for the next three months, us two junior engineers were left on 24/7 primary/secondary on-call for a critical service. It was a nightmare. Calls at 3 AM, 6 AM, on weekends.Our manager got a promotion and is fairly high up at Apple now.Horrible experience. I left for a new company that pays me nearly double."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I dont quite remember the meeting room names in Mathilda 3 over at the Apple on Mathilda Ave, but if the MA03 (in the screenshot) refers to &#34;Mathilda 3&#34;, then this story is totally believable.I worked at Apple and it was absolutely horrible. I remember sitting on the train and actually thinking about killing myself. Reasons were many, but mostly I just didn&#39;t fit in there, I think.I felt like people there were also a bunch of whiny little bitches to be honest. Always having some problem with a hand or a back or some family problem or whatever which demanded that they take days off. There were a few people whom I felt were probably talking some shit behind my back, but I couldn&#39;t really believe it until I read this story. It was just a horrible horrible place and I can also recognize that thing about having a predecessor, who was apparently a &#34;bad person&#34; and thus had to be terminated.Every other day I would have people telling me how great a place it was and how lucky we were to be working in a place so big while still having that startup feeling. I have worked at startups and I always just imagined to myself that 40 year old &#34;dude&#34; who refuses to grow up. That is Apple..Never again.I got dragged through the whole white boarding experience also for the first time and it was fun enough, but in hindsight, they should just have asked me if I would suck Steve Jobs dick, if he came in that door. The answer to that question alone would have provided them with enough information about whether I would have been a good hire or not.I am 45 and have never every experienced a work place like that. Always had positive feedback and never had any problems with colleagues."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is awful. I&#39;m sorry that happened to you. However,  If Apple refuse to take actions, I will interview with major media outlets describing the experience in more details and I will release a list of all individuals involved from senior management to the HR director and all the evidence as public record.

You&#39;re wasting your time if you think they&#39;re going to do anything with this kind of approach. Get a lawyer first before thinking on doing any of that, though.And let this be a reminder to everyone else that HR isn&#39;t there to help you - it&#39;s there to help the company.In this kind of environment it almost feels like one needs to record everything that&#39;s happening in order to defend themselves. Cops use cameras, maybe it&#39;s time for employees to start wearing them too. Maybe."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A fun anecdote from my youth near a US seaboard was that our elementary and middle school buildings were designed by the same person who designed a few prisons around the area.When I bounced around cities later in life, I was surprised at how many of my peers said the same thing as a conversation piece.Maybe they used the same governmental bidding process. &#34;Needed: a building. One food preparation and eating area. Hallways suitable for lining up and proceeding in rows with many small rooms. One yard with sporting facilities.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who&#39;s been to prison and school, lots of comments here sound pretty tone deaf. Prison in the USA is really bad. Yes school is authoritarian, but most popular entertainment on prisons downplays how bad it really gets. Watch some interviews of people who have actually been to prison. Murder and rape is common (I saw it happen), you will get your possessions stolen under the threat of murder/rape, you&#39;ll probably spend 10-30% of your time in solitary confinement for reasons outside your control (torture according to human rights groups: I&#39;ve been there, I&#39;d prefer nonpermanent torture), you have to learn violence and get into fights with people who might be carrying a knife or else get taken advantage of indefinitely, ... It&#39;s bad. And psychologically, you have no freedom whatsoever: no you cannot poop or drink water whenever you want to. You can only poop when your cellie isn&#39;t around (1-2h/day). You will be abused by prison staff (false accusations, physical abuse, food deprivation, ..)The whole thing is an abomination. It serves no useful purpose to society to subject most criminals to prison: it doesn&#39;t serve as a deterrent (based on talking to ~50 prisoners about this), it only radicalizes them further against &#34;the system&#34;, making it easier for them to break further laws.Why don&#39;t we have more outrage against this outdated institution created out of 1600 era values?The amount of human suffering it creates... It&#39;s astounding. Most prisoners would probably rather a super old school punishment like chopping off their arm over the prison sentence they get. And it would be more effective."</p>

They routinely fail to catch harmful junk—I&#39;ve shut down a few top-grossing bogus antivirus apps for Mac, and the publisher of Untitled Goose Game routinely posts screenshots of clones that are trying to make money off confused users.They&#39;ve banned apps like Phone Story and a drone strike tracker for being &#34;objectionable and crude,&#34; yet they don&#39;t apply any content moderation to the Book Store or to Music or TV (or to Safari for that matter). They&#39;ve yet to provide a cogent justification for why they&#39;re inconsistent on this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought I should look at the App Store and see what this app is doing in comparison to similar apps.The logo is basically a big pill and the tagline &#34;Powerful keep-awake utility&#34; which is clearly alluding to the drug. https://imgur.com/a/RJXHaBaThis was consistent with the feedback the author received: &#34;[the] app appears to promote inappropriate use of controlled substances. Specifically, your app name and icon include references to controlled substances, pills&#34;Almost all of the other top apps in the app store in the same category use some reference to caffeine either in the name or tagline or description (e.g. &#34;Jolt of Caffeine&#34; or &#34;Owly&#34; which has a logo of an owl in a cup of coffee) https://imgur.com/a/yySBqELThere&#39;s one other, much less popular app called &#34;Coca&#34; which appears to reference cocaine, but doesn&#39;t also have a drug-referencing icon or tagline, and which only has 15 reviews. By comparison, Amphetamine seems to be the most popular result, at least for the search term &#34;awake&#34;, with 1.37K reviewsThe guideline in question doesn&#39;t seem to consider excessive use of caffeine as problematic to encourage. &#34;1.4.3 Apps that encourage consumption of tobacco and vape products, illegal drugs, or excessive amounts of alcohol are not permitted on the App Store. Apps that encourage minors to consume any of these substances will be rejected. Facilitating the sale of marijuana, tobacco, or controlled substances (except for licensed pharmacies) isn’t allowed.&#34;Overall, Amphetamine did seem to be pushing the drug-use angle much harder than other apps in the category based on the logo, tagline and title, especially if you consider caffeine abuse not problematic.Added: I don&#39;t have a strong opinion on this one either way, other than edgy naming has pros and cons. Word of mouth is easier, but sometimes a problem like this happens."</p>

We made our money back and had some fun with being featured on BoingBoing and Fleshbot. Someone tried to sue us. We sent the last of the Bushplugs to the Smithsonian&#39;s presidential museum.

They didn&#39;t give any reason besides some vague recommendation to review their Terms of Service. A few months later at their F8 developer conference they announced they&#39;ll be launching their own matchmaking service which will work pretty the same way I built my app.Moral of the story: never trust big tech.P.S.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The tweet mentions that you could &#39;just&#39; send an SWF file to someone and it played. Well, if anybody had to fix a computer, or hosted anything Flash-based during that era, then they would know that&#39;s bullshit. Sure maybe with the standalone Flash player it worked allright, but that&#39;s not how people really used Flash. Even in my experience, a single SWF running locally didn&#39;t always work across all versions of Flash player.Flash on the web only worked if you had Flash player plugin installed. Both browser and Flash updates themselves would break the Flash plugin constantly. That was across all browsers and platforms. Keeping plugins updated and reliable was a mess, for a long time there weren&#39;t even auto updates.Flash was a mess the whole time. Let&#39;s not pretend that it ever really &#34;just worked&#34; because it didn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is true but it is a common misunderstanding imo. Nobody is arguing a tool like Flash shouldn’t exist; it should. People are arguing a runtime like Flash shouldn’t exist, and that HTML5 has all of the components that are needed to be that runtime and then some. A tool should give us what Flash did but with the HTML runtime.So why doesn’t that tool exist?Well... as far as I know it does. I’m pretty sure this is exactly what Adobe Animate is meant to be:https://www.adobe.com/products/animate.htmlSo why isn’t it causing a Flash-style revolution?In my opinion... Because of YouTube. Twitter. Etc.Before everyone had heaps of bandwidth, you needed to consume smaller files. A full 1080p video was unfathomable with the codecs, compute and network bandwidth available in the early 2000s. Swf files however were small and easy to distribute. The perfect storm occurred due to the structure of early internet, and communities like Newgrounds flourished.I honestly think Flash just got a bit stale. It stopped being new and exciting, and for animations video sites were probably going to win out anyways. For games, a lot of indie devs now target PCs and game consoles. Unity and Construct export to HTML5. People wanted to do more advanced things to the point where Flash itself started doing things like 3D rendering, at which point the appealing aspects of Flash started to make less sense anyways.Many seem to argue passionately, probably from an emotional place, that Flash was killed. Honestly, I just don’t agree. Flash was dying either way. Everyone just gradually decided to cut off the life support.The era it ushered in will be missed, though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve come across a lot of similar sentiment from ex-Flash devs, who romanticise its heyday as a period of fertile creativity (true) and say that HTML5/JS/CSS/SVG is an inadequate replacement (false).In truth, the fundamental capabilities of the modern web platform matches and typically exceeds anything that was offered by Flash. What these people are really lamenting is the ease of authorship that Flash provided to non-technical users.Macromedia/Adobe provided a suite of powerful tools for authoring Flash animations and applications. There is no free equivalent available targeting HTML/JS. This is not a problem of capability in the platform technologies. It is because there is no economic incentive to make and give away such tools. What equivalents do exist in this sector cost money.When it comes to Flash, the old adage, &#34;if you&#39;re not paying for the product, you are the product&#34; holds true. The Flash authorship tools were free because 3rd party authors creating Flash content were assisting in the promulgation of a proprietary platform that was gradually replacing open web standards. Had they succeeded, Macromedia/Adobe would inevitably have looked to squeeze and monetise their domination of the web.Programmers are often accused of not understanding what Flash offered to artists. Maybe that&#39;s true, but I&#39;ve not encountered many artists who conversely understand the above."</p>

For example, it says &#34;kernel.kexec_load_disabled=1&#34;, and points out the threat which I can understand, but I don&#39;t know what that&#39;s used for in the first place.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me, what sucks about JIRA (and would suck about any well-designed tool that replaces it) is not &#34;feature x&#34; but the entire JIRA mentality. All of it.It encourages micro-management. It encourages more and more process. It is the enemy of getting better at the DORA metrics, which requires streamlining process.tickets in JIRA are not the work itself, never was and never will be, it is a LARP of the work, but it gets taken for the central thing. This is an illusion.  Fixing a bug without filing a JIRA ticket is in itself progress. Moving a JIRA card without any other change is not. Yet the second is what&#39;s visible and therefor what&#39;s rewarded.Any problem gets solved with &#34;more JIRA &#34; which stops working when the remaining problems are caused by too much JIRA. And yet they keep trying, because it gives &#34;control&#34;. JIRA is a like metastatic tumour that will grow until it kills the host.In case the cancer metaphor didn&#39;t make it very clear, I don&#39;t like JIRA much. Yet if JIRA were to die today, the middle management who live by JIRA would replace it with something else equally bad, if not worse.Filling in missing features won&#39;t and can&#39;t fix that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a hundred small issues with Jira, but there&#39;s one huge one:  It&#39;s slow. Really, really slow.Atlassian seems to make a lot of money, so I guess they&#39;re optimising for something that matters to someone, but from my point of view I have a simple process for evaluating tools:1) Can I use it at all? 2) How many of the features I want does it have?I&#39;m pretty sure Jira would score great on the second question, but since it hard fails the first, I&#39;ll never know. And it&#39;s been slow for so many years now, I assume they have no interest or ability to fix it. And their slow drift towards cloud installs over letting people self host isn&#39;t helping them either since, embarrassingly, their cloud instances seem to be even slower.(Incidentally, there&#39;s a lot of competition in that space, but I&#39;ve been pretty happy with Clubhouse. I wouldn&#39;t mind a few more features, but it&#39;s good enough. More importantly, the UI is clean and snappy, and that hides a multitude of sins.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every bullet point says &#34;Missing...&#34;, but I feel like the main issue about Jira is that it has waaay to many features, and that it&#39;s super slow!The only bullet point I do agree with, is that Jira is missing an easy (or IMHO a minimalist / simple) interface. The tool is a mess, and the people using it are probably also using it in the wrong way, making the whole situation way worse.Don&#39;t get me wrong, I like Jira to some extent, but its performance and messy UI are really making my life harder rather than simpler."</p>

(and that&#39;s only if you&#39;re considering software)  when you think about it, it&#39;s staggering.i suspect we&#39;ll be seeing a lot more attention on reproducible and cryptographically secure build environments, similar to the gitian stuff in bitcoin land."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with most of the points raised by the author but as a Venezuelan Bitcoin is a godsend. If you live abroad and want to send remittances to your friends and family it can be pretty easy in a normal country , with wire transfers,western union and so on. If your family lives in Venezuela your options are extremely more limited.These are some of the options Venezuelans have had to use:1. Ask the money to be sent to Colombia with WU and then travel hundreds of kms to get  what usually amounts to a few hundred dollars at most.2. Use Zelle, send dollars in the US, and receive Bolivares in Venezuela. But for that you need to have an US bank account, and find a person you can trust also with an US bank account and plenty of highly volatile Bolivares in Venezuela willing to make the exchange.3. Use paypal, same as above with way higher commissions and the risk that paypal (and the other person) will fuck you.4. Buy Amazon gift cards and use the same schema above, be exposed to scams and high commisions fees.Trading bitcoins in say localbitcoins.com, you have a very liquid market and somewhat secure transactions (Bitcoins are not liberated until you check the money is in the Venezuela account). There are risks of course, especially because of BTC volatility but at least is a fast,convenient,widespread option. I wish something like that, only more stable and with less of that Tulip-craze whiff BTC has."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought my smartphone from Hong Kong, in part because I wanted a specific variant that would be more likely to work with open-source ROM&#39;s.The seller initially requested payment via Transferwise, who sought crazy amounts of personal information and bullied me into a privacy-hostile customer agreement.  Days went by and they still hadn&#39;t activated my account.Growing frustrated, I convinced the seller to accept Bitcoin, which was comparatively instant.  The phone arrived a few days later, meanwhile the Transferwise morons still had their heads up their arses with no movement and no good explanation.  I&#39;m not a financial risk; I&#39;m a good little citizen with no red flags.  Reading between the lines my sense was their staff were overloaded or their onboarding system was simply broken.Bitcoin was incredibly helpful for me that day, and my favorite feature about the phone is the way I paid.  In addition to a great story, I&#39;ve got to admit there was something liberating and empowering about giving what felt like a big middle finger to the slow, decrepit, old-fashioned institution who couldn&#39;t even deliver on their core business proposition.  Like saying &#34;screw you, I don&#39;t need you and your crappy service anymore, come back when you can compete on merits&#34;.Whatever else you criticize about Bitcoin, it&#39;s still &#34;cash you can email&#34;, and even if that&#39;s all it ever amounts to I still find it a bloody useful innovation."</p>

Don&#39;t keep it on exchange. The real thing that is stopping adoption is countries trying to classify it as a commodity and insist to pay capital gains on every microtransaction. Some countries are backwards (US, UK) than the others. Germany and few other countries are forward looking. No VAT on bitcoin transactions and no CGT if held for a year."</p>

And India is not really the most shining example of protecting our workers from unfair and harsh working conditions. So, if such treatments don&#39;t fly here, I don&#39;t think they will fly anywhere else. The kind of labor expectation that these companies have after their stints in China is ethically incompatible with most other countries. So, I can&#39;t see the condition improving in the near future, companies will continue chasing profits at all cost and China will remain the most fertile ground to do that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Traditionally slavery was an alternative to death for the conquered.  I&#39;m morbidly curious what the effects of all Western corporations banning slave labor would be.  I doubt it would result in liberation.  Would working conditions for the slaves worsen when they worked for local, lower-margin factories instead?  I can&#39;t imagine them improving.I have little faith in legal remedies to liberate slaves.  Arming them seems the only long-term effective solution.  Otherwise the man with the gun will order the slave back to work the second the man in the wig isn&#39;t looking.  And the man in the wig will remain silent, to avoid revealing his impotence.Slave labor is inefficient, so perhaps the best way is to topple inefficient slave societies through full-spectrum competition, from military to economic.  This pressure incentivizes efficient human resource utilization.One thing&#39;s for sure:  Individual Westerner guilt over whether to buy the next iPhone will add zero value."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the biggest problems in science (in general) is that your reputation and therefore funding is highly tied to a particular subfield.  Everyone in a subfield knows each other and gives positive grant reviews and external tenure letters to other practitioners.  If you try to move on to new areas of research, your reputation and funding are gone.  The outcome is that areas of research interest become quasi-permanent, even when they are no longer interesting. I talk to the people today that still work in my specialty of nuclear physics (relativistic heavy ion physics) and I&#39;m shocked at how little intellectual progress has been made.  At the risk of offending people it&#39;s time to give up and declare victory, but the consequences would be dire (hundreds of professors all over the world without grants)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In computer science, researchers who had spent decades working on feature engineering for images got completely blown out of the water by deep learning.  All those decades of papers would never get another cite.  Everyone moved on.String theory doesn&#39;t actually do anything though, so there&#39;s no way to say it&#39;s better or worse than anything else.  It&#39;s like someone saying they&#39;re working on solving the halting problem or something and eventually they&#39;ll get there and they&#39;ve been working on it for 20 years without any code that actually works.  At some point, you just have to give up and do something else.  They keep getting grants to work on this stuff though for some reason.  Someone needs to interview the people who are giving out string theory grants and ask them why the heck they are still giving these people money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"1. Don&#39;t try too hard to make science funding more efficient / market lead or whatever - just fund more - double the science budget tomorrow And again every five years for a generation.  We are about to go through a societal refactoring with solar / electric / digital / climate change hitting at once.  Spending a few quid to help out the fundamentals won&#39;t hurt anyone.2. The above might upset people but string theory is a good example - partly yes people are held hostage by funding (much like it&#39;s hard to avoid being typecast as an actor).  But the solution to that is to fund lots more (experimental) movies, not to hope studio heads can pick better winners.I am perfectly happy for a slice of my tax dollar to go on someone thinking about Pram theory (#) for a decade simply because we have no idea whatsoever how to tackle the big ones in physics, so spray and pray is going to be a lot better than most other options.(#) Red Dwarf episode. worth watching episode just for this joke."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Skip the Amazon resellers and order direct from China on Alibaba. Their reputation system is less spammy than Amazon&#39;s.One of my areas to watch: solid state relays.Here we have yet another fake Fotek solid state relay on Amazon.[1] Note the &#34;Made in China&#34;.Here&#39;s the real thing.[2] Note the &#34;Taiwan made&#34; from the real Fotek. Costs a lot more.
That&#39;s because it will actually handle the rated current. The fakes are notorious for overheating and burning out. The real thing has overheat and surge protection, will shut off if it overheats, and can stand a big short term overload for motor starting or when a short is in the process of tripping the circuit breaker upstream.Here&#39;s a similar solid state relay from China, from the actual manufacturer.They actually provide a table which shows how much they
exaggerate the ratings. They&#39;re over-rated by 2X for
a resistive load, and 6x for an inductive load.
&#34;For a motor with rated current of 15A and the motor
is inductive load, the formula is 15A x 6 = 90A, so
you should choose to buy 100A solid state relay&#34;.For a little extra, you can have your own fake label. Minimum order 200 pcs.Here&#39;s a fake Fotek.[4] What&#39;s amusing is that this is the actual manufacturer in China selling the fakes. They&#39;re in Guangdong, and they&#39;re selling under their own name, but with a fake label. No shame.There are legit manufacturers in China selling solid state relays.[5] They put their own name on the product, show pictures of the inside their rather grubby factory, and have realistic numbers on their data sheets, along with pictures of UL certification documents. About 4x more expensive than the fakes. If you&#39;re in China and are building industrial equipment which needs these components, you need ones that won&#39;t fail and shut down a manufacturing line.Here&#39;s a teardown of a fake. [6] The fakes are just solid state switches with power ratings way beyond what their components are good for. UL warning notice about fake Fotek solid state relays.[7] UL issued that notice six years ago, and they&#39;re still on Amazon and eBay.[1] https://www.amazon.com/SSR-25-DC-AC-Solid-State-Relay/dp/B07...[2] https://www.fotek.com.tw/en-gb/product-category/143[3] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/1PCS-SSR-10-DA-DC-Con...[4] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/High-quality-SSR-25DA...[5] https://www.alibaba.com/product-detail/SSR-S25DA-H-DC-TO-AC_...[6] https://youtu.be/DxEhxjvifyY[7] https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/ul-warns-of-solid-s..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps I&#39;m in the minority of frequent amazon users, but I don&#39;t buy anything from 3rd party sellers anymore. There is simply too much fraud. In practice, this means that I often need to skip past amazon entirely and go straight to the product manufacturer, sometimes paying more, just to be sure I&#39;m not being screwed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is by far the best engineering hack of the year:Use off-shelf-chatrooms-software to create rooms but instead of chatting you send ROM game commands to each other and allow for multiplayer gaming!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I&#39;m understanding this correctly this offloads the copyright issue by making it the users responsibility to upload a rom?No one really talks about it but the first iPod had the same approach to letting people play their thousands of mp3 files (which I imagine 99% of were obtained illegally). Apple was eventually able to create a legal marketplace for mp3s but early days it was all napster/limewire/kazaa/etcObviously Playstation/Nintendo roms are not as prevalent but its an interesting thought?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found their NES version[0] just the other day, tried it with a friend, and there was a consistent 0.5-1s delay with button inputs. We both tried hosting, but had same issue and couldn&#39;t play. I have to imagine that PS1 emulation would be worse?But as far as UX, it was incredibly easy get us both into a 2 player game, complete with chat, voice, and video feeds. Their buttons are mapped to keyboard inputs, so Windows users can get a gamepad working with a program like JoyToKey[1].[0] https://nes.party/[1] https://joytokey.net/en/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I switched to a 4-day working week a few years back, taking a 20% pay cut in the process - and I haven&#39;t looked back!There has been no drop in productivity - I guess I procrastinate less, and am more focused on doing things that need done.I have an extra day for family and side projects - 1 day might not sound like much, but having that extra day off feels like my work/life balance is so much better!If anyone else has the opportunity, and can afford the pay cut of course, I highly recommend it.P.S. there was no way to negotiate less than a 20% cut; I work for a megacorp that has rigid rules and doesn&#39;t give half a crusty shit about individuals.Edit: I should have also mentioned that I&#39;m in the UK, where under EU law, employers have to consider reasonable requests for flexible working. I should have also mentioned that I work 7.5h per day, and the only time I work overtime is when I&#39;m travelling to a customer site (which itself is rare, obviously not happening at all now!)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even though we have many luxuries, modern life does require a lot of admin. Most of which needs be be conducted during business hours. I recently took a two week vacation and spent half of it catching up on BS life admin that I had neglected over the last 6 months / year due to a hectic work schedule.I&#39;d imagine many of us are not wealthy enough to afford a personal assistant but live complex enough lives to warrant it. Modern life kind of requires a 4 day work week, if you are salaried slave."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Slightly off topic:Something funny is happening in my native Belgium. Some people drop their fifth formal working day to become bicycle couriers, Uber drivers or whatnot in the &#34;sharing economy&#34;. The reason is taxation regimes.80% or 100% gross wage as a median income employee will hardly make any difference in net wage around there. A friend for example recently got a promotion from an entry level job (with tax discounts) to something more in line with her qualifications (without tax discounts). 600€ gross salary increase translated to 155€ net salary increase. All the rest got eaten by tax and social contributions increases.Belgium combines high formal job taxes combine with a low tax scheme meant to formalise &#34;sharing economy&#34; jobs. These enjoy super low 10% taxation up to 500€ per month. Many people actually do the math. They switch to 80% formal jobs hardly losing any income. Some actually increase their income by becoming pizza couriers or Uber drivers in their 20% time...UPDATED: corrected the net wage delta from 100 to 155€."</p>
