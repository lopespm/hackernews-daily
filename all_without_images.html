								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ars Technica has a sceptical but optimistic/hopeful take on it:https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/02/framework-startup-de...Edit to add quote from Ars article:Framework is promising an awful lot in its very first product—&#34;thin as an XPS 13, repairable as a custom-built gaming PC&#34; is a pretty tall order to live up to. We very much want to believe, but it&#39;s going to take a full Ars Technica teardown before we&#39;re completely convinced.Although we&#39;re skeptical, we are hopeful—the fledgling company does have a pretty solid pedigree. Framework founder Nirav Patel was Oculus VR&#39;s head of hardware from 2012 to 2017, and he was a Facebook director of engineering beyond that. The company&#39;s team also includes design, engineering, and operations people hailing from Apple, Google, and Lenovo."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see any mention of the firmware and drivers efforts for this. Firmware and drivers always end up more difficult to deal with than expected.The Fairphone company was surprised by difficulties upgrading and patching android without support from their BSP vendor, causing many months delays of updates _and_ years shorter support life than they were planning for their earlier models.I purchased the Purism Librem 13 laptop from their kickstarter, and they had great plans for firmware and drivers, but also great difficulty following through. The trackpad chosen for the first models took much longer than expected to get upstream linux support, and it was never great (it turned out to be impossible to reliably detect their variant automatically). They finally hired someone with sufficient skill to do the coreboot port _months_ after initial units were delivered, and delivered polished coreboot firmware for their initial laptops _years_ after they started the kickstarter.So, why should we have confidence in the firmware and drivers that Framework will deliver :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interestingly it was very clear at around $10MM ARR that DO was on a trajectory to IPO. You can thank Moisey Uretsky for a fantastic product idea and his brother Ben for CEOing it for so long. Congratulations to everyone who was involved in building DigitalOcean, it was an INCREDIBLY wild ride in the early days, lots of chaos but through all the chaos and disfunction, I think everyone involved knew this day would come.Personally I&#39;m really proud of the work we did, and I&#39;m overjoyed to have been part of building a business that is going to be a public company.  Thanks to the HN community for being so supportive over the years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love DigitalOcean. The simplicity of their UI, friendly CLI tooling and (as a hosted k8s customer) the frequency of updates to their offerings.BUT:1. Their web UI stability is terrible (constantly hangs and errors out)2. Their hosted DB IOPS aren&#39;t competitive with other PaaS providers. There&#39;s also no way to scale DB size dynamically without upgrading to a new price tier which is overkill.3. Their Kubernetes Control Plane scaling is obfuscated. I had to contact support to realize that the control plane nodes are somehow tied to the size of your node pool when you create the cluster? That&#39;s not documented anywhere and was the cause of many control plane timeouts.4. No ALIAS dns record, no way to serve Spaces from an apex domain. (I know this is a vendor specific implementation but it&#39;s table stakes imo)Again, I&#39;m a (mostly) happy DO customer and wish them the best but if they really want to be seen on the same level as AWS or GCP in terms of some parity, they need to include some of these QoL features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats to DO.Really like the direction DO is going. Which is something in between millions of small VPS firm and giant like AWS. It also forced Linode to React. And proved the space in Cloud Hosting exist, which company like Vultr and UpCloud are now joining. And I think their features are finally close to hitting the perfect spot. With all the essential like DBaS, Object Storage and K8s.They have also ( finally ) introduced AMD EPYC CPU, ( no more explicit mention of Intel CPU on their homepage ). Which is good for their margin since price / core count are cheaper.So DO today is something I would like as an AWS competitor in 2016.  And they are finally here. I am not sure if there are any other low hanging fruit at all. Or what features I would want for a company competing at this space. It will be things that people dont see, like CPU performance, SSD Performance, Services Reliability, Interconnect, Better Network, More Locations, security improvement....There are only two suggestions I could think on top of my head right now.First is the pricing structure and list. It is getting very messy and AWS like. SSD Storage variant should be a simple calculable option, not an extra line on pricing table that tries to bombard me with extra information. And I know Basic Droplet are burst-able CPU resources, but not showing they are vCPU ( a Single Thread ) and calling them CPU doesn&#39;t really rhymes with me.Second is Full BareMetal Monthly option. Something like vultr [1] is offering. I am not sure if below $100 is feasible. Basically it  should be something that offer much better price / performance at a monthly payment that pushes people with low spending to metal for baseline load with headroom as insurance. Pushing up Average User Spending.  It should also be attractive to small business. ( Although arguably Linode and Vultr has yet to expand or launch Metal seems to suggest otherwise )[1] https://www.vultr.com/products/bare-metal/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s a crazy idea: Don&#39;t use analytics at all but focus on your product. If your success relies solely on &#34;improving conversions&#34; by tracking your users and then changing the position and color of your &#34;Checkout&#34; button then maybe try setting yourself apart such that customers want to buy your product even despite an obnoxious purchasing flow. Only then start optimizing it.More serious thoughts: Google Analytics introduces performance overhead for your website and now you have to explain to your users which third party is responsible for processing their data on top of yourself. Why introduce those headaches? Are the insights from Analytics really valuable enough to justify the cost? I personally haven&#39;t seen it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After a recent story on HN about all the horrible tracking Disqus started to do after being acquired by an ad-tech company, I ditched it and Google Analytics on my semi-dormant personal website.  The process of fixing it got me interested in working on my site again and I ended up upstreaming the patches into the Hugo theme I use[1], so now everyone with that theme can benefit easily.  I ended up using GoatCounter[2] after examining several alternatives in the market, predominantly because it was free for personal sites, but also because it was very no-frills which is all I really needed.  I also appreciated that I could control retention rate and other configuration that might affect my visitor&#39;s privacy to collect as minimal amount of information as possible.I don&#39;t think there&#39;s anything wrong with having basic site analytics, but I appreciate that there are now alternatives to Google Analytics that don&#39;t try to do the pervasive tracking that&#39;s become commonplace online.[1]: https://tristor.ro/blog/2021/02/05/ditching-google-analytics...[2]: https://www.goatcounter.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There are a couple mentions but no top comments:
Amazon has installed a mailbox at their facility, this mail piece specifically says to use it.AND this mail piece says &#39;BE DONE by 3/1&#39; when workers have until the end of the month to vote (context: amazon must stop anti-union mandatory meetings etc during voting).This could be a legal violation &amp; is a big deal. I think at a minimum breaks the spirit of the NLRB mail-in voting ruling.HN seems to consider big tech = oppressive surveillance. I&#39;ll let you draw your own conclusions.This is also the latest in a long list of extreme tactics some aren&#39;t mentioned in this article. To name a few:Amazon also fired an activist who was speaking out. It&#39;s been reported Amzn has been penalizing pro-union employees with baseless and unfair management penalties/&#39;strikes&#39; and purposeful last minute over-time demands as punishment. Digital surveillance. Management basically stalking associates in break rooms, asking if they are only there to organize and attorneys and consultants drawing graph person relationship research charts to map their employees. A big propaganda push online &amp; a pretty successful press drive - most of these articles Amazon gets many inches of positive talking points.https://www.vox.com/2019/3/22/18277322/amazon-fired-warehous...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Detailed, 6 step instructions on how to open a ballot and mark no? Thanks, amazon. This is almost as scummy as asking the city to change traffic lights so union organizers have a harder time talking to workers in between shifts.https://www.al.com/business/2021/02/jefferson-county-now-say..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Full disclosure: I&#39;ve always been anti-union for my own personal approach to life. I do see the value in unions, I&#39;ve just always, to this point, been a go-it-alone-and-fight-my-own-battles kind of person. I don&#39;t want to be beholden to a union or their rules any more than I want to be beholden to an employer beyond my contractual obligations for which I&#39;m paid.That said, people should take note of what happened when Walmart used these tactics. Employees then went on to suffer such things as zero hour contracts, contracts where time was just shy of the legal requirement to give them benefits, pay was no more than the minimum required in any given state/province and people became slaves to their jobs because they couldn&#39;t afford the time off to find other jobs because then they wouldn&#39;t be able to make ends meet or there were no other jobs so Walmart had zero incentive to pay any more than absolutely required to by law. etc. etc. etc. because humanity is only afforded if legally required [which I personally find disgusting].These are tactics to prevent a coalition of employees from having their rights heard and maintained... even with this coalition someone is fighting to maintain and win your rights(!!!!!) There&#39;s something very wrong with anyone having to fight for their rights to be given, but that&#39;s another discussion. In a commercial environment that allow employers to behave this way, where the only advantage to winning your rights is in a coalition of the workforce holding employers to account, unions absolutely must not only be allowed but must also be protected.Its okay if you&#39;re bullheaded enough or within your means enough to walk away if your rights aren&#39;t given fair consideration and honoured, but if you&#39;re in a position where you&#39;re a prisoner to your job, i.e. can&#39;t afford to take time off to find another job/other income, or there are no other jobs in your area and you don&#39;t have the means to leave etc. you don&#39;t have any bargaining chip.No employer should ever have the privilege of keeping you prisoner, nor preventing you from having a means to bargain for your very right to fair treatment.Amazon needs to be severely reprimanded for this and taught a lesson about what it means to honour employees&#39; rights."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not a surprising practice, but:&gt; Pretty ironic too when you&#39;ve got Shopify&#39;s CEO tweeting about the unfair 30% cut Apple wants: https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1362411841943711744That&#39;s pretty hypocritical"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a Shopify partner through 3 years, paying 20% of my revenue to Shopify, and every time I have been in contact with &#34;partner support&#34; it has been, to put it mildly, an underwhelming experience.You have to argue your way through an army of outsourced supporters who are equipped with nothing but the public Shopify docs, until you get to a real employee who concludes it with a &#34;sorry, but we can&#39;t help&#34;.Some of my issues:1. If you&#39;re not American, you will be forced to hand over 3% of your 80% revenue cut to PayPal. (Unless your MRR cut is &gt;$30k)2. Sometimes Shopify just kills features, which merchants and partners rely on. Sure, we get a notice that the API will change - but how does that help, when there is no alternative way to achieve the removed functionality? I was lucky enough to get through to someone who knew someone at the dev team, but the response was once again &#34;sorry, you&#39;re not a priority&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I understand this correctly: this OP partner app (not merchant/store) has been evading the Rev Share agreement with Shopify and is complaining because they got caught and are having to pay back their due?  And then they are trying to jump on the furor of Apples 30% rev share agreement to get support from other developers - when the cases are completely different?To me it sounds like this App developer is trying to have their cake and eat it too.  FWIW - I am typically on the small developer side of things but this seems like a case of a bad actor trying to couch it in other complaints..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The one about proxy_pass blindly forwarding syntactically malformed requests and silently failing to process the response is astonishing.It doesn&#39;t appear to be documented.  Looking through NginX documentation at http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html I don&#39;t see anything (e.g. under proxy_hide_header) to say it&#39;s sometimes not applied, and there doesn&#39;t appear to be any option to prevent this blind forwarding.I would never have expected the backend to receive invalid HTTP from NginX, but more importantly it&#39;s not uncommon for backends to send an extra header or two to tell NginX how to serve the response, with NginX removing those headers before serving.How do you even handle this properly?  Checking for valid HTTP might not be enough, as you need to exactly match whatever NginX&#39;s idea of valid is, rather than matching the HTTP spec."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Default for root is &#39;html&#39; according to the docs (which is a relative path wrt /usr/share/nginx), not /etc/nginx. http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_core_module.html#rootI guess it may depend on how nginx was configured during build. But for example on Debian this is not an issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a good example of the trade off between pretty/terse/clever and safe/correct/maintainable.  Nginx is well-respected mature software but it&#39;s hard to see these issues as anything other than a design blunder.  The trailing-slash path traversal thing looks to me like a file system analogue of SQL injection.I think d3.js is another example of this.  It&#39;s obviously written with incredible skill but I could never get on with the ultra declarative and implicit style, it always felt like a fight.These days there seems to be a trend towards a verbose, explicit style, e.g. Zig (no hidden control flow - compare to C++&#39;s operator overload-fest) and Go."</p>

We extended an offer to one Dalia&#39;s classmates and he started yesterday as an intern with high potential for full-time, as our internships usually are since we invest a lot in them.It was such a pleasure meeting you Dalia, wish you all the best. Hope to work with you in the future (maybe when we can offer US visas).P.S. We&#39;re still hiring"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First of all - big props to Dalia. She clearly worked her behind off to earn those offers.Second - this definitely, to me, proves that Manara has a good business model. I actually don&#39;t think the fact that the Manara students are from MENA is all that important though. However, I do think that their extremely hands-on, and intensive &#34;bootcamp for FAANG interviewing&#34; model is clearly an advantage for early career technical candidates.Thinking back to my college days (in the US, mid 2010s) - we were not given any sort of class that focused on professional interviewing. The college career center was also very general, and not knowledgeable about the specifics of passing the coding interviews. The best advice I got was a recommendation from a guest lecturer to read &#34;cracking the coding interview&#34; (which to be fair, was better than nothing).As a result, the people from my school who did the best right out of the gate, were largely people who already knew people already in a FAANG roles and who could rely on that person for a referral, interview advice and practice feedback. Our school was not in SV (or anywhere close), so realistically, that was not an option for most of us. Additionally, I always applied for internships at FAANG companies while I was still a student - but never even got called in to interview - so it wasn&#39;t like I could practice that way either. I ended up doing fine for myself by accumulating a good base of practical experience from local non-FAANG companies before graduating, but I really believe my peers, and aspirational novice engineers of all backgrounds would have benefited greatly from having a hands-on course like Dalia described. I especially would love to see efforts like that extending out to under-served communities here in the US as well (native american reservations, appalachians, rust belt cities)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not much better if you end up being a GCP customer.My company has gone through 4 reps in 3 years. Every time we get a new GCP rep they just want to talk to us about &#34;expanding our use of GCP offerings&#34;. The only thing they want to talk about is starting to use BigQuery - not my business at all.I signed up for a Google Cloud Security summit, and afterwards a sales rep reached out me. It was obvious from the start they had no idea I was a gsuite or GCP customer. They then directed me to a NEW account manager (#4) even though I had been working with a different one. I had worked with the prior account rep going over our architecture to make sure everything was kosher (sustained use discounts etc). I even made them a schematic of our architecture on GCP at their request. Once I provided that to them I was met with radio silence.It&#39;s really insulting, and to me obvious they don&#39;t care about my company at all. We&#39;re looking at other options.I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if somehow this post leads to me getting an email from another rep &#34;Wanting to start over and doing things right&#34;, which will inevitably devolve into the discussion of how can I use BigQuery."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Title should maybe be switched to &#34;Google Cloud vs AWS Onboarding Comparison for YC companies&#34;.Not to say that isn&#39;t a useful article on its own, but it&#39;s hard to draw too many meaningful conclusions for the rest of us when the first line of the AWS bullet points is &#34;reach out to dedicated YC email&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to be a huge fan of GCP and bet on it to power my startup, and have come to greatly regret it.Recently, I needed to increase a CPU-limit quota from a small number (like 16 vCPUs to 64 vCPUs) - nothing crazy. In the past, the quota increase system was more or less automated and would only take a few minutes to process.This time, however, GCP denied my quota increase and forced me to schedule a call with a sales rep in order to process the quota increase. It was the biggest waste of time and kind of goes against the entire point of instant cloud resizing.It also feels like the velocity of new features, instance types, etc has slowed down dramatically in the past year. Also, while I&#39;m ranting, Google Cloud SQL is probably the worst cloud service I&#39;ve ever used  (and it costs an arm and a leg for the pleasure!)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The saddest thing about all of this IMO is they have been working on this for 14 years, and how much money was spent/wasted? Now, read about Skunkworks - they were able to build the SR71 (without supercomputers) in less than half that time and for a fraction of the cost.This isn&#39;t just planes, this seems to be everything nowadays. Fission was discovered in 1938/1939 and we dropped two bombs on Japan in 1945. No chance we could do something like that in this toxic environment of today.I know Peter Thiel is not popular here, but his conversations about technological progress seem to be spot on: we just cant build cool shit anymore. I really did want a flying car, and all I have is 140 characters and promises of AI that never come true.Maybe, you could say there are some exceptions like CRISPR, but that is TBD."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Putting aside the good-plane/bad-plane discussion, this program is the poster child for one of my pet wishes: that the costs of government programs would be expressed in $/tax-payer.  There are about 100M tax payers in the US; this program is expected to cost about $1,500,000M; so the F35 program is expected to cost about $15,000 per tax payer.  True: that&#39;s over 50 years; still, un-discounted, that&#39;s $300/year/tax-payer.The Covid bailout last year was about $60,000 per tax payer (https://www.covidmoneytracker.org/).  How much of your $60,000 did you see?I&#39;m not arguing for or against these programs; I&#39;m arguing for expressing them in comprehensible terms.  $6,000,000,000,000 societal total; or $60,000 for you.  Do you expect to receive $15,000 of value from the F35 program?  I&#39;m not sure I won&#39;t: perhaps it&#39;ll keep oil/energy prices stable and I spent well more than $300/year on energy..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“The F-35 has failed” is a strong statement that depends on what your definition of success is. Did it fail because it couldn’t replace the F-16? Did it fail because it’s expensive and bloated?Do those things even matter?I’m not defending the F-35 but anyone deeply and intimately familiar with the platform knows and understands that it is a Ferrari. You don’t bring your Acura TSX to a Formula 1 race track to win a race. Just like you don’t bring your Ferrari to the farm to haul material (not anymore anyways).The F-35 may be a Ferrari; but the thing about Ferraris is that their technology trickles down. Now we have electric cars with carbon fiber shells. The same is true for the F-35. The technology inside it has and will lead to the resurrection and long standing use of older planes like the B1 and U2. Where the airframe is solid but the tech and stealth is not. It will also lead to revolutionary new planes which are cheaper to make and build.Through the F35s use of distributed computing and treating hardware components and their software as services, we’re not going to be doomed to the same fate as the F16 where we can’t find hardware. Instead, we’ll have more component oriented aircraft systems where each aircraft is no bespoke and can use from a menu of technologies.So did the F35 fail because we spent too much? Depends on how much it saves us later.Did it fail because it didn’t replace the F16? What if it makes the F16 viable again? Did it still fail?Some may see this as a slippery slope. What matters is the objective outcome that comes from this project. Not the success criteria some folks have perpetuated or thrust upon the project."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of nostalgia about Fry’s here. Well, I have a different take. Fry’s was my first job, and my first introduction to wage slavery. They never at any point cared about employee health or well-being. Breaks were the state minimum. Pay was the state minimum. The entire staff (and there were hundreds back in the day, when the checkout line would back up into the store even with 20 registers open) shared one 7x7 beige break room. It looked like something from Prison Architect, just an old tube TV with bent bunny ears (you weren’t allowed to turn it on though, it was for training) and the stale smell of cigarette smoke. Knowledge was irrelevant, it was all about sales. SPIFs (bounty-style sales commissions) and revenue ruled the day. Aside from that, the owners didn’t care; cliques and in-groups ruled hiring and firing in the absence of leadership. Stores were always falling apart even when they were new. I don’t think anything over 7’ up was ever dusted; even 20 years ago, it was so thick in some places you couldn’t see the paint. The repair bar employees would regularly rifle through customers’ hard drivers and keep the juciest pictures.Just another cynical retail empire, pumped hard and drained dry by its owners while the foundation rotted from below. May they build condos on its grave."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not surprised, but this makes me feel incredibly sad. I built my first PC using parts from there. I’m going to miss it.But once Fry’s pivoted to be a consignment store that was mostly empty and selling pallets of bottled water and perfume, it was obvious the business was about to die.Curiously, Microcenter has managed to live on and seems fairly robust. I can’t help but think Fry’s tried to sell too many different products and had a massive amount of floorspace to keep up. Whereas my local Microcenter just sticks to electronics and the store is much smaller and feels cramped in comparison."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I graduated college in 1985 and moved cross country to Sunnyvale for work. Fry&#39;s was a supermarket chain, and at the time there was one and only one location that was trying out carrying computer stuff, on the east side of Lawrence Ave I think, before they moved to the west side of Lawrence.They weren&#39;t yet fully committed to it. Half the store was produce and such -- milk, eggs, lettuce, etc, and the other half was rows of TTL parts, memory chips, diodes, capacitors, and resistors. It blew my mind. I bought a 68000 CPU, 128KB of DRAM chips (64Kx1 density back then), a perf board, wirewrap wire and a wrapping tool, EPROMs, sockets, and built my first computer all from parts I bought at that Fry&#39;s.About 60 seconds away from Fry&#39;s was Computer Literacy -- a really great bookstore that, as the name implies, had nothing but computer related books. It wasn&#39;t 20 copies of &#34;Computers for Dummies&#34; books. The vast majority of inventory were single copies of the most arcane stuff -- all sorts of college level CS textbooks, and you could ask the desk to order just about anything if you knew the title of it.I sent a lot of money and time in both locations. Silicon Valley felt like a magical place back then."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve always wanted to write a book. I have helped write 3  different deeply technical books (and one solutions manual), but I wanted something fun, interesting, and valuable.So I wrote &#34;Everyday Data Science&#34; which is a collection of stories, tutorials, jokes, math, and code all written to inspire people to analyze their personal data.In general, I was also inspired by the challenge to &#34;make $100 online&#34; which I have done in the past month since launching. It was daunting, and I felt quite vulnerable, but overall I&#39;m pleased with what I&#39;ve made.I wrote up this quick post to give you an idea of the process I followed to write the book, and some of the content.I&#39;d love to know your thoughts and am open to (nice) feedback :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"@andrewncThe book looks very intriguing! Before buying it, I wish I could read a bit more about what one could expect from the book. Let me explain :)&gt; This book is for people as untechnical as my Mom or as technical as my Applied Scientist friends working in big tech.&gt; ODEs On A DietDo you present an intuitive explanation of ODEs? Would both your mom and an Applied Scientist find it informative? If yes, I would love to read! A few pages from this chapter would really help in making a purchasing decision.&gt; a solution to Multi-Armed Bandit problems which are significantly more efficient and only takes a few lines of extra code.Does the book include code samples? As someone wanting to learn about, e.g., ODEs through code, I would love it code samples were present in the book.I understand that $7.99 is not a lot in the US, but it is not the case in a few other parts of the world. Given that there are no refunds, having more information about the book would be valuable for international customers.BUT... the books looks great, and big congratulations on publishing it!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you like stocks and are careful with the way you spend your money, you know how much time goes into buying shares of a stock. It’s tedious and I don’t have 24k for a Bloomberg terminal. Which led me to the idea during xmas break to spend the time creating my own terminal. I introduce you to “Gamestonk Terminal” (probably should’ve sent 1 tweet everyday to Elon Musk for copyrights permission eheh).In summary, the Terminal (https://github.com/DidierRLopes/GamestonkTerminal) has 7 distinct menus:
- Discover Stocks
Top gainers; Sectors performance; upcoming earnings releases; top high shorted interest stocks; top stocks with low float; top orders on fidelity; and some SPAC websites with news/calendars.- Market Sentiment
Scrolling through Reddit main posts, and most tickers mentions; Extracting stocktwit sentiment based on bull/bear flags; Twitter in-depth sentiment prediction using AI; Google mentions over time.- Research Web pages
List of good pages to do research on a stock, e.g. macroaxis, zacks, macrotrends, ..- Fundamental Analysis
Read financials from a company from Market Watch, Yahoo Finance, Alpha Vantage, and Financial Modeling Prep API.- Technical Analysis
The usual technical indicators: sma, rsi, macd, adx, bbands, and more.- Due Diligence
Some features are: Latest news of the company; Analyst prices and ratings; Price target from several analysts plot over time vs stock price; Insider activity, and these timestamps marked on the stock price historical data; Latest SEC fillings; Short interest over time; A check for financial warnings based on Sean Seah book.- Prediction Techniques
The one I had more fun with. It tries to predict the stock price, from simple models like sma and arima to complex neural network models, like LSTM. The additional capability here is that all of these are easy to configure. Either through command line arguments, or even in form of a configuration file to define your NN."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The biggest thing you pay for in the Bloomberg Terminal is the chat function, which lets you talk to other people who also have $25,000 a year to spend on a Bloomberg Terminal.But this is still pretty cool :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is it just me, or is the feel of the comment on this post different than other HN posts? There are a lot more snarky jokes. A little more combative. It feels like why I stopped reading Reddit. I hope it doesn’t metastasize to posts on other topics."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For the non-lawyers: as the article indicates (but doesn’t really explain), this is a ruling on a request for temporary relief (called a “preliminary injunction”). This is not a final judgment. It can (and presumably will) also be subject to appeal. Nothing remotely final about this. The judge has simply said: “CA, you can go ahead and enforce your law for now.”Now, this does also mean the judge would quite likely ULTIMATELY rule in CA’s favor. But it is not a guarantee. And, as I said, then there’s appellate and Supreme Court review.For reference, the 4-element test/standard for a preliminary injunction generally accepted in US courts is set out here:“[G]enerally a plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief must satisfy a four-factor test: (1) that he or she is likely to succeed on the merits of his claims; (2) that he or she is likely to suffer irreparable harm without preliminary relief; (3) the balance of equities between the parties support an injunction; and (4) the injunction is in the public interest.”https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/committees/wom..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m hopeful as the judge seems to understand the ISP strategy:&gt; Mendez reportedly was not swayed by ISPs&#39; claims that a net neutrality law isn&#39;t necessary because they haven&#39;t been blocking or throttling Internet traffic.&gt; &#34;I have heard that argument and I don&#39;t find it persuasive,&#34; Mendez said, according to The Hollywood Reporter. &#34;It&#39;s going to fall on deaf ears. Everyone has been on their best behavior since 2018, waiting for whatever happened in the DC Circuit [court case over the FCC&#39;s repeal of net neutrality]. I don&#39;t place weight on the argument that everything is fine and we don&#39;t need to worry.&#34;"</p>

Top rate I’ve paid I think is some close to or just over $100/hour, so it’s definitely not just for low-end stuff.I’ve learned (the hard way) about being very, very clear with deliverables and expectations. Based on the average response I get on Upwork, it would seem the median buyer is much more susceptible to contractors blowing smoke. So one has to be careful.But overall, as several hundred thousand dollars client over the years, it’s been a godsend."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"D3.js is, to me, one of those tools that makes things possible rather than making things easy (although I only use javascript once every year or two so it&#39;s always a slog). This is big: it&#39;s like a zero-to-one step, rather than incremental progress.This fall I made an interactive visualization of the fine-grained plate tectonic model I have built for the Himalaya and Tibet for a research project[0].  The model building process (i.e., finding the relative motions of the plates) is largely solving a system of linear equations, so it&#39;s not immediately apparent what the results really mean and whether they are acceptably realistic.D3.js allows me to explore and understand my own scientific results so much more thoroughly than the static quiver plots that I was making in Matplotlib--being able to pan and zoom a globe (not just a projected map!) and see the tectonic plates move through time is phenomenal. Being able to share the results so trivially as a web page is a huge force multiplier as well.Thanks so much, Mike![0]: http://rocksandwater.net/blog/2020/11/tibet-blocks-js/"</p>

Some people just have unbelievable drive.In other news, I’ve enjoyed using D3 over the years, and always jump on visualization projects as a result.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don’t think it’s bad advice but having shipped multiple (really bad) games, I think it misses the two biggest/best pieces of advice I’ve gotten:
1. GDDs are probably a distraction if you’re a solo dev - prototyping and grayboxing a lot and looking for the fun mechanics without any art/music/story to get in the way or distract is essential 
2. If you’re truly just starting (and don’t already have a sense of fun), absolute best way to start is to carbon-copy a game you find fun, then start adding/tweaking elements. 
This both builds the mindset required to make games, and helps you get into the “fun iteration” loop quickly without getting bogged down in writing a lot of interesting technical systems that don’t end up contributing to the game in a meaningful way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve written some learnings after shipped my first game: https://ruoyusun.com/2018/06/15/guide-for-non-game-dev.htmlAs a professional software dev, I&#39;ve noticed that while both game dev and software dev are &#34;writing code&#34;, they are done in a very different way.As a software dev, the value proposition is more or less clear before you start writing code. As a game dev, you can only start to see your value proposition after you have finished your code - that&#39;s why game code, especially as an indie without clear distinction between prototype and production phase, tend to become spaghetti really quick - and that&#39;s fine. If you spend too much time to make the code look nice, then you are not spending enough time to make the game actually fun.Software usually has some logic behind it - it has to make &#34;sense&#34;. A game doesn&#39;t necessarily have to make sense - it needs to &#34;feel right&#34; and &#34;fun&#34;. That means your nicely designed abstractions actually won&#39;t be reusable - copy &amp; paste is much more pragmatic. You can start to look to refactor after your game is actually successful (or fun at least) but even then you will realize that most of the code is not reusable.A big part of your game code is actually &#34;content&#34;, instead of &#34;systems&#34; - meaning they are closer to a &#34;script&#34; than a well architectured software code. So you write more if-else and less inheritance and encapsulation (unless you are writing your own engine, then in that case, your engine code is actually close to software projects).And if you hate writing UI for software, you&#39;ll hate writing UI for games even more."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot of comments in here about how it&#39;s bad that cookies haven&#39;t always worked this way, but a significant amount of web content to this day still requires third-party cookies to work. And I&#39;m not talking about cookies that are designed for analytics purposes; the discussions here where concern is raised revolve around simple things like logins breaking.For greenhorn web developers, you could say the same thing about TLS certificates. Why weren&#39;t they always free?Well, another reason is because TLS (and formerly SSL) wasn&#39;t (weren&#39;t) just about encryption, but about a &#34;web of trust.&#34; Encryption alone isn&#39;t trust.Many things about web technologies have changed over time; and it&#39;s easy to say that any individual piece of functionality should have worked this or that way all along, but the original intent of many web features and how those features are used today can be very different.One day industry standards may dictate that we don&#39;t even process HTTPS requests in a way where the client&#39;s IP address is fully exposed to the server. Someone along the way might decide that a trusted agent should serve pages back on behalf of a client, for all clients.After all, why should a third-party pixel.png request expose me browsing another website?! How absurd. Don&#39;t you think? And yet, we do it every day."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been following Tether for quite a long time. I have no absolute proof it is a scam but the writing is on the wall. Here are some facts.- The current Market Cap of USDT is 34 Billion Dollars. It was 4B this time last year. Since the value is pegged this means there has been an influx of cash of 30 B into this shady company in the last year alone. Who invested this money? We have no idea since Tether doesn&#39;t disclose, but we&#39;re supposed to believe all this money entered USDT even with the red flags we see.- There&#39;s a correlation between Tether printing new USDT and the Bitcoin Price.- There&#39;s no way to transfer USDT into USD. The few exchanges that say they offer withdraws actually don&#39;t if you go and try.- Daily volume of transaction is in the 100 B mark. Twice that of Bitcoin and 3 times Tether daily volume this time last year.- BitFinex is included in the NY decision because it&#39;s proven now that Bitfinex and Tether are operated by the same people. Note that a few years ago this was not only undisclosed but actively denied by Tether.- Tether initially told its investors it was 100% backed by dollar reserves and that it would be subjected to constant audits. The audits never happened, and they eventually conceded only ~70% was backed by &#34;short term cash reserves&#34;.My conclusion is that the folks at BitFinex came up with a new currency, printed billions of it and used it to wash trade against itself and other crypto, creating an artificial demand that drove the prices up. It&#39;s textbook Ponzi scheme and will inevitably come crashing down, killing Tether, BitFinex and a chunk of the Crypto Market.Crypto folks will counter argue that people has been saying this for years but Tether is still chugging along and crypto is healthier than ever.Personally I won&#39;t touch any crypto with a 10 foot pole until this thing blows over. If that means missing out on a lot of possible gains so be it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m waiting patiently for the whole Tether printing scheme to fall and crush to finally purchase Bitcoin / Ether.
However I&#39;m not viewing them as inflation hedges so long as Bitfinex / etc. are allowed to continue with their obvious money printing scheme.When most crypto trading volume is traded at trustworthy exchanges which actually hold dollars as much as they say they do, I&#39;ll trust $/BTC to be a fair market.It&#39;s dumb escaping from Powell&#39;s printing machine straight into Bitfinex tether printing machine. BTC isn&#39;t the hedge people think it is so long as it&#39;s traded against fictional dollars. Tether&#39;s volume exceeds Bitcoin, so that&#39;s the scale of fictional dollars supporting Bitcoin right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It appears from the link in the settlement agreement:https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/2021.02.17_-_settlemen...Tether wasn’t backed at all times. The argument was that this happened due to asset seizures in Poland and Portugal in 2017-2018.https://www.theblockcrypto.com/post/95207/bitfinex-tether-ne...Seems to me they couldn’t prove malicious intent, so they suggested they stop trading. Frankly this seems a bit of a click-bait title with the whole “illegal activities”.Sure, tether wasn’t backed at all times (probably is now), due to governments seizing their funds. Also banks do this all the time, every time they issue a loan for instance. The bank only keeps 10-30% collateral on your home."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"1. At an individual/hobbyist level this is a fine thing to do, if one is already a cryptocurrency enthusiast.2. At a social/planning level it is important to remember that opportunity costs matter, and this should not be recommended as public policy. One kWh of electricity could either be used for mining bitcoin (creating at most one kWh of indoor heat), or it could be used for running a heat pump[*], yielding multiple kWh of indoor heat due to the magic of heat pumps and their &gt;100% &#34;efficiency&#34;[**].[*] Yes, I realize the OP is already using a heat pump, but assisting it with preheat is inherently less efficient than plowing the same energy into running the heat pump itself.[**] Yes, heat pumps aren&#39;t &gt;100% efficient per a physics textbook, but what most people care about is that you can use them to get &gt;1 joule of indoor heat from 1 joule of energy input, which feels magical when compared to electric heaters, gas furnaces etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did this in an apartment I lived in years ago, and do it now in my house.My computer room in the house is the lowest point in the house, so naturally, it tends to be a couple degrees cooler than the upstairs.  This means that if I set the thermostat so that the computer room is comfortable, the bedroom is too warm.  If I run the house circulation fan constantly, it&#39;s not an issue, but that consumes a decent amount of power.If I&#39;m going to consume that much power, I might as well mine crypto and make a few dollars.  Mining for NiceHash, a service that lets people rent hashing power from miners, I&#39;ll average $100-400/month worth of Bitcoin on my RTX 3080, depending on current hashing prices, and how much of my time I spend gaming, since mining is effectively paused while gaming.  The mining happens while I use my computer with no noticeable loss in performance, and it puts a few watts of energy into the room to heat it up a bit, evening it out with the rest of the house."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago when mining with a single gaming card was more common and viable, I lived in a rented room in a house owned by a live-in landlord who controlled the heating, and wouldn&#39;t turn it on for very long in the winter. Since electricity was included in my (fixed) rent, I was able to keep my room a few degrees higher than the rest of the house.However I must point out that you shouldn&#39;t do this in most circumstances, there are environmentally friendly ways of heating your house."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It would be helpful if we knew eactly what these endocrine-disrupting chemicals were. As is usually the case with such reports, this article is short on specifics.Over the years there have many reports from cleaners to plasticizers, phthalates, and various other chemicals as endocrine disruptors but no one has put a sufficient measure on the problem so that we can move foreword - put regulations in place, etc.As the article points out, what is so problematic is that many of the chemicals that are under suspicion are ubiquitous and not easily avoided.I consider it important that we act quickly for not only public health reasons but also the fact that we&#39;re living in an increasingly chemical-phobic society and worrying the public without solid evidence isn&#39;t helpful to anybody.We need need more research on this urgently.Afterthought: it is essential that we have solid evidence ASAP as billions of dollars are tied up in the plastics industry. Plastics already cause environmental problems (and I constantly curse the fact that I have to get rid of so much waste plastic) but there&#39;s no point deliberately alienating the plastics industry without good cause."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Store food in glass containers, not plastic. Above all, don’t microwave foods in plastic or with plastic wrap on top. Avoid pesticides. Buy organic produce if possible. Avoid tobacco or marijuana. Use a cotton or linen shower curtain, not one made of vinyl. Don’t use air fresheners. Prevent dust buildup. Vet consumer products you use with an online guide like that of the Environmental Working Group.I really want to do this, but it seems impossibly hard. For example, almost all the food I buy is in plastic containers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is the most important part of the essay:   Uncertainty remains, research sometimes conflicts and biological pathways aren’t always clear. There are competing theories about whether the sperm count decline is real and what might cause it and about why girls appear to be reaching puberty earlier, and it’s sometimes unclear whether an increase in male genital abnormalities reflects actual rising numbers or just better reporting.

You should maintain a very low prior probability of this being true without more information. Remember correlation usually != causationhttps://www.gwern.net/CausalityThere are a lot of other possible causes for all the these declines. (obesity and lower physical activity being only the most likely-seeming to me)"</p>

I was almost 12. School was closed for 2-3 weeks because they couldn&#39;t promise there would be electricity to heat the building. The ice kept breaking power lines or crushing the transmission towers from the weight (ice is heavy!). Imagine your car, covered in a 1-2 inch thick layer of very solid ice, encased.People died. The military had to come in to help. My family was fortunate that we had a wood stove in the basement that kept the house warm and cooked some meals on. We lost power a few hours at least every day.Crazy time.Edit: For those interested in this, the Wikipedia article (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_1998_North_American_ic...) has some great photos and description. 1,000 transmission towers/pylons destroyed, 35,000 utility poles. Whole forests devastated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Once at its destination and hooked in, its V12 had to be run at a specific, constant rpm&#39; to generate AC current at 60 hertz, the frequency used by most North American utilities.I don&#39;t think this is exactly right. I&#39;m sure it wasn&#39;t consistent either, but few loads really cared too much.From the article&#39;s link, about a different locomotive doing the same thing:&gt; Conrail actually had a set of standing instructions on how to provide quasi-commercial power from a locomotive.  For an SD40-2, you attach to the bus before the diodes.  Operating in notch 6 runs the generator at 647 RPM.  Since the AR10 is a 10 pole machine, that gives 64.7 Hz power.  You could tweak the governor to get it closer to 60 Hz if you really wanted to, but for powering everything but clocks, it&#39;s close enough.  I think the method for regulating the voltage was to disconnect the load regulator from it&#39;s governor-powered vane motor and dialing the voltage in manually.  The output is 3 phase power.  Max output in notch 6 is about 1000KW.  If the avg home draws 2-3 KW on the avg, that&#39;d power several hundred homes.http://cs.trains.com/trn/f/111/t/194245.aspx"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m also a solo developer and use git in a much less sophisticated fashion. I tend to use it as, &#34;freeze my code here, so in case I f something up, I can get back to a moderately clean state.&#34; It&#39;s kind like a snapshot-based local history.  And, quite frankly, I rarely revert one, but it makes me feel safer. I don&#39;t care if I have a lot of commit messages that say, &#34;interim&#34;. The good ones are clear.Is this a terrible coding practice? I don&#39;t have enough non-me experience to know what an anti-pattern this probably is. I probably won&#39;t change my process, but I&#39;m curious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m happy for this person if this works well for them. For me, no thanks. One of the reasons I feel much more productive as on my solo project than at work is that I don&#39;t have this kind of overhead. I don&#39;t need to write tests for everything (I write them just where they add value). I don&#39;t need to follow some strict branching standard. I can commit in chunks that make sense to me, and adjust as needed for the situation.From my perspective, a lot of this kind of rigid process is important and valuable when you are working with a team, but is counterproductive when it&#39;s just me. I know the tradeoffs of the corners I cut. I have the experience to know, for example, that&#39;s it&#39;s not a safe assumption that I will understand my own code a year (or even a month) from now. But the solution to that is to throw in some freeform comments that jog my memory; not to implement a heavyweight documentation system.Everyone should work in the way that makes them the most productive and happy, but I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea for solo developers to bring in practices that are designed for team collaboration without really understanding what value they will get from the extra effort."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was a new developer and first learned Git, I felt compelled to use Git the &#34;right&#34; way. That is... small commits with clean messages, things described in this and other posts.But, as I spent more time programming, I developed different Git habits for different situations:- Solo explorative work: working on a feature, many small commit messages create nothing but noise. Trying to come up with wording for these commit messages is mostly a drain on my mental energy: there is an infinitesimal chance I&#39;ll need these commits later. In such cases, I prefer to maintain large &#34;checkpoint&#34; work-in-progress commits that are the result of near-continuous `git commit --amend`s so that I can use `git status` to see what&#39;s changed since my last checkpoint, and easily revert to the last checkpoint. If this fails me, I can almost just as easily refer to the reflog to find some changes. The reflog, in my opinion, is an extremely under-utilized tool. `git diff HEAD@{2}..HEAD@{0}` allows me to see what&#39;s happened in the the last two times that I updated my checkpoint. Since this is active work I&#39;m doing right now, I have a good sense of what happened and when, all without tiresomely writing commit messages that will be a bunch of gibberish in two days. When I&#39;m satisfied with with the work on a checkpoint commit, I reset the branch to the previous real commit, and then incrementally create real, meaningful commits from the accumulated work, that have some chance to be useful to me in the future.- Working on patches and bug fixes for live systems or production libraries: small, atomic commits that include tests for the patch are the only way to go. I believe the &#34;correct Git&#34; approach that is widely espouses is targeted to this use case, but not explorative feature work. Or maybe that&#39;s just me.Wondering if anyone else codes like this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I agree with the premise that making is harder than commenting, and this can be frustrating. But I don&#39;t think that telling people not to comment is the right solution.There can be a lot of value in comments, even ones that have not been thought through very deeply. In fact, casual, uninformed comments are often the most valuable as they&#39;re representative of how someone new to your product or project will perceive it.I&#39;ve found that the keys to getting value out of comments without getting discouraged are:1. Not to take comments too personally or get defensive about it. They&#39;re not attacking you. In fact they&#39;re not attacking anything. They&#39;re just making an observation. (On rare occasions, you may get a comment from an asshole who really is attacking you personally, but it&#39;s pretty easy to tell when this is the case and ignore them).2. Take a more statistical view on comments. If one person mentions something, maybe they&#39;re just an outlier. But if 10 people mention the same thing, they&#39;re probably on to something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Roosevelt’s Man in the Area quote sums this up well.&gt; &#34;It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who neither know victory nor defeat.&#34;It&#39;s also a useful metric for deciding who to follow on social media. Is the person showing off their work or are they just commenting on the work of others? If the work/comment ratio drops too low, I stop following them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article is so vague that people can read anything they want into it, and judging from the comments here, they are. My question is, who is the target of the article, who is supposed to avoid commenting? Your coworkers? Your boss? Your paying customers? Your non-paying users? The media? Twitter/HN randos? All of the above?If you&#39;re a maker, then you&#39;re making things for someone. If you&#39;re only making things for yourself, then of course nobody else has a right to comment. But if you&#39;re making things for other people, then it seems to me that those other people have the right, perhaps even the obligation, to comment on the product, right? The article verges on the parodic idea that no maker should ever be subject to any criticism. If that&#39;s not the author&#39;s intention, then the author ought to be clearer what is intended.That&#39;s my drive-by comment."</p>

It was only playing in a single cinema in the world in Paris and only at midgnight. So glad I got to catch that.I am kind of glad to hear that Daft Pank is over and I say this as someone who their music means a lot to. The arc of their art is complete and there is nowhere left for them to go without it becoming forced, awkward or irrelevant: teenagers with attitude and samplers to elder statesmen recording with an orchestra.As this is HN, does anyone remember their more interesting dives into technology: Daft Club [2] and the multi-angle DVD of D.A.F.T. [3]?This quote [4] about Daft Club, and the state of music on the internet, from 2001 is really interesting in hindsight:&gt; It&#39;s great to find a new channel where there is an open access, open door to more, but not more than had to be done before. It&#39;s establishing a connection between people that listen to our music and ourselves. There&#39;s no limits of time, and it helps people get and listen to this music. A track that could have been done today can be online tomorrow. The other thing is to really express ourselves through the Internet.&gt; ...&gt; Napster is a cool thing with us.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; “When they legislate these things, they need to be appropriating enough money to make sure they work,” a source said. They estimated fixing the SB1310 bug would take roughly 2,000 additional programming hours.40 hours a week times 52 weeks is 2080 hours.  Subtract a few weeks for vacations and holidays, and you get a little less that 2000 hours.  So, basically, this is a little more than one programmer-year of effort if the estimate is in the right ballpark.It&#39;s gross that the decision not to fix this carries an apparent implicit economic calculation that one programmer-year is more valuable than the freedom that is being denied to an unknown number of people whom society deems less important.  (Granted the actual situation is more complicated and the state is constrained by their contract with the vendor, which we can reasonably guess is going to charge as much as they can contractually get away with rather than the programmer&#39;s actual salary cost.)At least the Department of Corrections has assigned people to do the calculations manually.  That&#39;s better, but it sounds like they just don&#39;t have enough people on it to keep up."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow. I know firsthand from family how this can severely destroy someone&#39;s mental health in what may not be so obvious; it is extremely heavy on someone every moment past the first hour they go past their release time, then the first day followed by a variety of things that will then be taken advantage of by other inmate and guards while one&#39;s defenses are down.  The fun poked at by other jealous inmates and cruel guards constantly will also weigh down hard on another human being.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I wanted to have compiled [1] financials, PriceWaterhouseCoopers told me to pick a recognized accounting system, then change the company&#39;s business processes to match that.   They said absolutely not to go the other way, to try to customize any software to match our business.I think about that every time I read about another government (or private!) company that wastes tens or hundreds of million of dollars (or euros or pounds) on custom software.It seems like there should be 1, 2, or 3 DMV programs.   The same for building codes, tax codes, etc.   And prison software.   You can be more like Massachusetts or Mississippi or Montana (hypothetical examples) but pick one and harmonize with it.1: compiled is the lowest of 3 standards that outside accountants can do; &#34;reviewed&#34; is higher and &#34;audited&#34; is the highest.  Even at the compiled level they mailed out postcards to a certain number of customers asking if they were customers over the past year and had spent this much money.   It was fairly easy for the acquiring company&#39;s outside accountants to review PWC&#39;s work and bring it up to audited standard."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting, but strikes me as very unrealistic. I don&#39;t think it&#39;d go that way. In fact, it&#39;d be far more horrifying.We wouldn&#39;t bother trying to convince an image of a brain into cooperation, because we simply lose any need to do that very quickly.One of the very first things we&#39;d do with a simulated brain is to debug it. Execute it step by step, take lots of measures of all parameters, save/reload state, test every possible input and variation. And I&#39;m sure it wouldn&#39;t take long to start getting some sort of interesting result, first superficial then deeper and deeper.Cooperation would quickly become unnecessary because you either start from a cooperative state every time, or you quickly figure out how to tweak the brain state into cooperation.And that&#39;s when the truly freaky stuff starts. Using such a tool we could figure out many things about a brain&#39;s inner workings. How do we truly respond to advertising? How to produce maximum anger and maximum cooperation? How to best implant false memories? How to craft a convincing lie? What are the bugs and flaws in human perception? We could fuzz it and see if we can crash a brain.We&#39;ve already made some uncomfortable advancements, eg in how free to play games intentionally try to create addiction. With such a tool at our disposal we could fine tune strategies without having to guess. Eventually we&#39;d just know which bits of the brain we want to target and just have to find ways of getting the right things to percolate down the neural network until those bits are affected in the ways we want.Within a decade we&#39;d have a manual on how to craft the best propaganda, how to best create discord, or how to best destroy a human being by just talking to them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve often imagined what it would be like to have an executable brain scan of myself. Imagine scanning yourself right as you&#39;re feeling enthusiastic enough to work on any task for a few hours, and then spawning thousands of copies of yourself to all work on something together at once. And then after a few hours or maybe days, before any of yourselves meaningfully diverge in memories/goals/values, you delete the copies and then spawn another thousand fresh copies to resume their tasks. Obviously for this to work, you would have to be comfortable with the possibility of finding yourself as an upload and given a task by another version of yourself, and knowing that the next few hours of your memory would be lost. Erasing a copy that only diverged from the scan for a few hours would have more in common with blacking out from drinking and losing some memory than dying.The creative output you could accomplish from doing this would be huge. You would be able to get the output of thousands of people all sharing the exact same creative vision.I definitely wouldn&#39;t be comfortable with the idea of my brain scan being freely copied around for anyone to download and (ab)use as they wished though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As suggested by others the number of taxonomists, people who could accurately identify species (many of which require internal dissection, or molecular methods), who are actually working on collecting and identify species has most certainly declined.  In many groups of insects there is at most a handful of experts worldwide who can take specimens to a species-level identification.This is not to say that species richness is not declining, its to say that in the past 3-4 decades Taxonomists have done a poor (some would say terrible) job at describing to the broader world why they are important, and why they require fixed, institutionally-based funding to actually be able to provide the services that would allow us to confidently state that data like these are because of environmental change (again, they very likely are) rather than a lack of experts in the field actually doing basic research.In other words, it is extremely rare that universities (in the US) actually hire what was once known as &#34;alpha-taxonomists&#34;, in part this is a reflection of taxonomists inability to sell themselves and adapt to new tools (but note that many have evolved) in part it is a reflection of the (I would argue &#34;immense&#34;) short-sightedness of institutions. &#34;We want answers to complex questions!  We&#39;ve neglected to give scientists time to think deeply, and research over decades to answer those questions.  Oh, we see.&#34;"</p>

In the midst of winter I was sure they were all dead. Then a few days ago temperatures shot up to about 18°c and suddenly they were back, basking in the sunlight and buzzing around the hive. Made me so happy...Seriously, I&#39;ve come to understand that contrary to what most of us seem to believe, it&#39;s not about what we can do to minimize our negative impact, but rather what we can do to have a positive impact on our environment.

There’s really very little evidence that this has anything to do with racial slurs.From a quick read: last June, the channel was banned for “harmful and dangerous” content. The ban was removed in under 24 hours. YouTube has not confirmed the reason. And yet:&gt; Experts suspect that it was the usage of words like &#34;black&#34; and &#34;white&#34; that confused the Yutube&#39;s AI filters.Well, if experts said it, it just be true! The experiment they ran is speculative as best and the article just ran with it as absolute fact. If the filter was caused by use of “black” and “white” wouldn’t every chess channel fall victim to it? The filter isn’t new, why was it triggered once last June?A lot of questions raised and an article that has no interest in answering them.

We see same things when Google disables account and you get locked out from your electronic life.I used to think working with governments is very hard.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Barriers to entry are invisible. They are invisible to people on the inside and most frequently invisible to people who have a hand in creating those barriers.I once had a conversation with a founder about their signup flow. This founder had aspirations to be a global player. They said that step 2 of their flow included entering a credit card number. I had to stop them. &#34;What about people who don&#39;t use credit cards?&#34; They were nonplussed. &#34;You know, China, much of Africa ...&#34; they had never actually thought about whether people had credit cards because every single person they interacted with had one.Back to languages. If you&#39;ve never taught an introduction to computer programming for a general audience you are blind to what does and does not matter about a language. You look at things like `foo.bar()` and think &#34;Yeah that&#39;s a simple method invocation&#34; and have no idea how many people you just lost.Never underestimate how much ease of use matters. We, as a community, have selected for decades against people who care about language ergonomics because they get hit in the face with a wall of punctuation filled text and turn away. We fight over where braces belong while not realizing how many hundreds of thousands of people we&#39;ve excluded.Ease of use is the most important part of a language. It&#39;s just that the barriers to entry are invisible and so the people who happen to be well suited to vim vs emacs debates get to talk while the vast majority of potential programmers are left on the outside.We create barriers to entry accidentally because we design for people like us. To us the barriers are invisible."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Going by their first example, the fact that I couldn&#39;t write   list.delete(value)

without realizing it involves a linear search is considered one of the benefits of Go.That said, I agree Go could use a bit for ergonomic and handy methods, while still remaining efficient.The example on Concurrency also has a different answer. Go gives you all the tools, but there are many different ways their problem can be solved. By explicitly avoiding a &#34;join&#34; method and having any default &#39;channels&#39;, Go makes all these possible. What is missing is some of the popular patterns that emerged in the last few years need to make it to into stdlib or some cookbooks.1. If you want a worker model, I would start n=3 go-routines and they all receive from a single channel. They don&#39;t need to much around with a channel of buffer 3, as in the example.2. If the workers already return data from a compute, the read from driver serves as the wait.3. In other cases, there is sync.Waitgroup available to synchronize completion status.4. End of work from the driver can be indicated via a channel close. Closed channels can still be read from until they are empty and the reader can even detect end-of-channel.Designing concurrent system is a bit complicated. Some tutorials do make it sound like a `go` keyword is all you need. All of these can fixed by improving std-lib or cookbooks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"But no one said Go was easy. It&#39;s just simple and easy to reason about. There&#39;s a huge benefit to something doing exactly what it says. No hidden behaviours, no overly complex syntax, nothing like that.I came from C# where I have gotten increasingly frustrated with the amount of additions to the language. Like we now have classes, structs and records. We now have async/await but we also have channels. This is what having a huge toolbox causes. Some people are going to write code using channels, me others will use async. Some people will use features that others don&#39;t care about.I think there&#39;s huge benefit in a simple language. In Go I know that there&#39;s only 2 ways to do concurrency. You either use go routines and mutexes or you use go routines and channels.Generics will bring a lot of helper functions that weren&#39;t possible before which will remove a lot of repetitive code.But otherwise I am super happy with writing Go code. All my pet peeves of something like modern Java or C# are gone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tree Sitter is amazing. The parsing is fast enough to run on every keystroke. The parse tree is extremely concise and readable. It resembles an AST more than a parse tree (ie no 11 levels of binary op precedence rules in the tree). The parse tree emits specific ERROR nodes, so you can get a semi-functional tree even with broken syntax.I can&#39;t wait for the tools to get built with this. Paredit for TypeScript. Syntax-tree based highlighting (vs regex highlighting). A command to &#34;add an arg to current function&#34; which works across languages. A command to add a CSS class to the nearest JSX node, or to walk up the tree at the className=&#34;| ...&#34; position, adding a new className if it doesn&#39;t exist.There&#39;s a nicely documented Emacs package for this [1]. The documentation is at [2]. The parse trees work great. There&#39;s syntax highlighting support and tree-walking APIs. There&#39;s a bit of confusion about TSX vs typescript langs but it&#39;s fixable with some config change [3].[1]: https://github.com/ubolonton/emacs-tree-sitter

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an engineer on the code intelligence team at Sourcegraph.We&#39;ve been busy building out true precise code intelligence/navigation support, but we also have a mode for zero-configuration code navigation based on text search, universal-ctags, and hand-rolled regular expressions (which works surprisingly well!). Tree-sitter would definitely give better results than our current ctags-based approach. It&#39;s been catching our attention more and more lately, and we have plans to use it to upgrade our out-of-the-box, instant code navigation experience.It&#39;s not the exact right fit for our primary goals though, since it&#39;s designed around being extremely fast while editing and robust against errors. Sourcegraph is only used for navigating committed code, so we&#39;re leveraging formats like LSIF to generate complete semantic graphs of codebases and their entire dependency tree. That&#39;ll enable a lot of features that are out of reach for tree-sitter, but is a lot harder to get working out of the box and it&#39;s a much bigger technical investment.It&#39;s very interesting to see the topological space that houses these solutions fill out. Every tool has its own set of unique trade-offs and fall somewhere on these spectrums:- fast vs slow- precise vs imprecise- zero-configuration vs configuration requiredWe&#39;ve visited a few islands in this space but still very curious to see what other islands can be discovered. We&#39;re especially excited about tools and formats like tree-sitter and LSIF around which a large and supportive community can grow so that all the products we love and rely on as developers can all make forward progress."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried to use this to ease the front end work load of students in a compiler project (building a C compiler) for a University course, so that the project could be focused on the more interesting middle and back end parts of the compiler.
However, reported bugs in the C grammar that saw no activity at all [1] made this impossible. From this small sample of experiences, I was left with the impression that Tree Sitter is great for things like syntax highlighting, where wrong results are annoying but not dramatic, but not so suitable for tools that need a really correct syntax tree.---

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on a startup that received seed funding to tackle this. I helped build the platform (using Twilio video) and then answered the first $5000 of calls. Things I learned:- Many entry level programmers at big companies (think Walmart Labs, Target, Goldman Sachs, etc) are too scared to ask managers/team for help. If you work for a large company, make sure new hires feel safe asking questions and seeking help or they will seek it elsewhere.- The really hard questions they&#39;re willing to pay $240 an hour for have too much context for you to grasp. They want you to replace their ORM layer or tell them why their 600 line test case is not working.- Getting customers is not too hard by poaching them from Stack Overflow, Reddit, CodeMentor.- Developers make good money working full time and idly sitting at their desk part of that time. Here you only get paid for active time and the idle time in-between will kill your salary. Your motivation has to come from helping other people and watching them grow, not from $$$."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You&#39;ll need some mechanism to raise rates to attract top developers.Even without the first free minute and time spent reading questions, the most a dev could hope to earn with this service is ($0.75/min)(60 min/hr) = $45/hr. Perhaps for students or devs who barely meet the 100 rep minimum requirement, that might be attractive, but for the experts who&#39;ve written the best Stack Overflow answers, that&#39;s likely to be a (small) fraction of their bill rate.Free contribution is rewarding as a means of helping.Well-paid contribution is rewarding for the $$$.Poorly paid contribution often loses both incentives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d guess that the people at Stack Overflow might have an issue with someone using their name in this way. It should probably be clearer that this is entirely unaffiliated.100+ reputation on SO is also a ridiculously low bar, it&#39;s almost meaningless. Not that any amount of reputation by itself is a sure indicator, but 100 really doesn&#39;t mean anything at all.This kind of site also requires a pretty large critical mass to work, you don&#39;t just want a bunch of random SO users willing to participate, but you need the right users with experience in the right tags to match to the requests in a reasonable timeframe.There&#39;s a good reason Stack Overflow doesn&#39;t allow people to pay for answers, people already cheat enough for meaningless internet points, this will get much worse with real money on the line."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"With interest rates so low (and lots of headwinds for them to increase in the short-term), one has to think that this will be the new normal for a few years at least. The rise of SPACs is another sign - they are disrupting both later-stage VC funds as well as obviously vanilla IPOs.I wonder if the abundance of capital is not evenly distributed through the startup lifecycle, but more heavily-weighted towards later stages.Anecdotally, I&#39;ve heard from founders that SEED rounds are getting harder despite all the frothiness. Even back when we did our seed rounds ~2015, we already heard &#34;today&#39;s seed round is yesterday&#39;s Series A&#34; in terms of $ size but also minimum bar of progress. And these days it seems that is EVEN MORE true. It&#39;s also true it&#39;s easier to start a SaaS company than ever before. But it&#39;s ALSO ALSO true that there is less and less SaaS greenspace. Hmmmm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree, at present, capital is abundant. That is, at the moment:  Σ(capital available) &gt; Σ(investment opportunities)

And this imbalance of demand for and supply of investment opportunities is showing up everywhere as... asset price inflation.You can see it in rising angel valuations, rising early-stage VC valuations, rising later-stage VC valuations, rising growth-equity valuations, rising leveraged buyout valuations, rising stock market valuations, rising cryptocurrency prices, rising home prices, etc. Feeding frenzies and bidding wars for high quality assets have become more and more common. Asset prices keep going up and up and up...The multi-trillion-dollar question:Is this sustainable?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perhaps I&#39;m a minority, but I got A LOT of value from my investors (both pre-seed, seed, and series A). To the point where I&#39;d consider them core partners in my journey of building the business.I know Aaron isn&#39;t saying that the investors don&#39;t matter.But when I think about why VCs hate going through an auction-like process, at least part of it is human nature. Like, we&#39;re about to work together for a long time. Let&#39;s not start off by commoditizing what we each bring to the table. I understand the POV that 99.999% of what VCs bring to the table is the literal commodity of cash... but if you have good ones, they really can help.In our case, we had multiple term sheets for our Series A so I was able to optimize terms and get the partner/fund who I thought would add the most value but at &#34;market&#34; on the other terms. &#34;Market&#34; being what was on the other term sheets. That seemed to work OK as a softer way of actually doing the auction.The real point in all of this is that if the VC&#39;s value-add is true, then you shouldn&#39;t NEED to discount things because of that. If it&#39;s real, then they should be happy to pay &#39;market rate&#39; to invest in you, and the impact of their other value will be that together you build a better business, which is more valuable to them too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I always found it funny that companies will go to extreme Herculean lengths to hire the best programmers, and are incredibly fearful and paranoid that they could be making a &#34;bad hire&#34;, and yet once hired they don&#39;t spend a second making sure engineers aren&#39;t completely running the software product off the rails and killing the company internally. The author mentions trying to rewrite Etsy&#39;s backend in Scala and MongoDB. That probably cost the company X million dollars. Etsy could still be recovering from that.The industry constantly mints senior engineers who have been bitten by complexity, but doesn&#39;t want to hire them, or listen to them. More often than not senior engineers pretend to be excited about complecting the tech stack, because hey, it pads their resume with the latest buzzwords and they&#39;ve given up trying to fight against it anyway.The last line of defense against a rogue engineering team is managers who have studied this stuff. How many engineering managers can spot the common situation &#34;the engineers are bored and they&#39;re rewriting perfectly-good codebases in Common Lisp and OCAML for funsies&#34;? And how many know what to do about it when they see it?Anyway, this is a cool website, and it&#39;ll be useful to point people to it in the future, so thanks for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with the non-boring technology club is that programmers see what problem FAANG companies are solving and wanting to be on the edge on new technology too. But they don‘t have the same problems. Another problem is they want to show what they can do. If they tell in an interview they are working with rails/django and a postgresql database they fear they look incompetent using those old technologies. So they try to convince their companies their products need to be rewritten in mongodb, react with graphql in a micro service stack and many more state of the art technologies.And in the end many developer years are wasted just rewriting a working an existing software in a new stack they are not yet comfortable with and the new product is much less stable than the old one.I love basecamp for their hotwired stack and showing that you can make the great software with old boring technologies and just a little bit of javascript magic pixie dust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way I see it is that one should master their stack.  If you work over and over again with the same stack you will know it well.  You will be able to move mountains with it.  But it takes years to arrive to that.  It takes implementing multiple projects the same way over and over again.You need the wherewithal to stick with your stack and not get lured away.  Maybe this is what boring means.  Maybe boring is different to different engineers based on their background.Sometimes you cannot select the stack cause there might be more senior engineers at a company and they have more sway.  This is fine as long as the engineers picking the stack have picked a stack they have mastered and it is boring to them.  As a regular engineer in their team I would hope to rely on their expertise and would hope to learn from them.I remember at one job a rogue engineer picked a boring backend that would have been fine.  But they fell behind because the other engineers knew their boring stack a lot better.  Ultimately the rogue engineer had to switch to the other boring stack.  The rogue engineer just was not fast enough to master it and implement the features required to keep pace with the demands of management.  These demands were trace centralized logging, security, and of course features.  So while they were still learning the ropes, we were moving on to even more advanced security, logging, and feature requirements.  They just couldn&#39;t keep up."</p>

But it&#39;s down in a difficult to access gravity well. There&#39;s no nitrogen. Far, far, better would be fully funding ARM and starting to despin and drag asteroids to the lunar gateway for study, resources, and eventually living space in space protected from radiation and, if you build sub-surface tracks, enough acceleration to live normally."</p>

There are lots of websites that do this very thing like whatsmyname.app.I personally like running my username through tools like this and aggregating my digital presence. When I was younger, I signed up for lots of sites that were the cool, new thing. Checking myself years later, I am shocked by the wide berth I left. Fitness accounts. Accounts from that time I was getting into studying chess. I’m the type of person who is always on to the next hobby. I go 100% in on something, then pop to the next thing. It was a big wake up call to me looking back seeing how much presence I left. Many accounts are so old I can’t even get into them anymore to clean up what’s out there. Tools like this can be used for good.That said, I totally understand the cyber stalking/bullying concerns. I am also astounded by the cyber sleuth types. In the documentary, Don’t F* with Cats, people spent 100s of hours carefully walking through streets in Google Maps to match a location to a photo they had of a guy who killed a cat on YouTube. It seems to me where there’s a will, there’s a way. It’s scary, and unfortunately a lot of tools we can use to protect ourselves are the same tools that can be used against us.

It&#39;s an extreme flaw of the telephone numbering system. You would think by the 2020s we&#39;d have learned to use a unique UUID designation for every user for any public facing APIs.

Also, I remember that most things we covered in school were completely irrelevant for the real world. So a difficulty to concentrate on school stuff may actually be better than doing the homework.In short, ignoring what society considers normal and instead being super focused on your own things ... sounds more healthy to me than the average &#34;normal&#34; person."</p>

There are endpoint tools which collect MD5’s, network scanners which collect MD5s, and I have heard about actual infosec directors who, upon seeing a blog post like that, would carefully type the hashes in their endpoint management interface to make sure their org is not infected.How on earth can this be effective? It is trivial to create customized binaries in the installer, so no two users have the same file checksum. With a bit of work, one can rig their download server so each user has a completely different installer checksum as well.I remember reading about polymorphic viruses back in the 1990’s - not only those had different checksums for each  computer, they also had no long-ish substrings common between two versions, making signature analysis ineffective. Did malware authors just forgot about all those and went back to trivial “everyone gets the same image” strategy?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;Mistake 3: Communicating something one time is enoughI joined a company once where a particularly skilled engineer had become a manager.   She was very good at her job and I&#39;m fairly certain had something like &#39;perfect recollection&#39;.We were in a meeting and she went on about how she was upset people were doing a troubleshooting process wrong despite having sent out a detailed email.Not wanting to do that thing wrong I searched my email, but couldn&#39;t find it.   I asked about it and she told me &#34;Oh it was before you joined us.&#34;.I had been with that team for two years...People tend to remember important things like it was yesterday, but don&#39;t always realize that other people can only absorb so many important things / don&#39;t always know how important it is... and email is kinda a terrible way to communicate it too.   Let alone 2+ years earlier ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mistakes I&#39;ve seen eng mgrs make:- not acknowledging obvious elephants in the room- not building enough trust early on with their reports that when a problem comes up, the information they get is biased as they are seen as part of leadership/management and not the team- applying pressure in the wrong direction (ie; if the team is moving slow because of stress or fear, making things more stressful will not speed things up)- trying too hard to be friends with all their reports, rather than figuring out the appropriate boundaries on a person to person basis- relaying anonymous information around in an effort to &#34;protect people&#34; and thus making themselves the go-between between all members on a team rather than encouraging people to work things out themselves- for ICs that then became mgrs, staying way too focused on the in the weeds details and not on the bigger picture or people details, up to an including still spending too much time coding or trying to do PR reviews that carry too much weight--I would actually go so far as to say that the best &#34;IC turned managers&#34; I&#39;ve had have been about at par with the most mediocre &#34;good people mgrs that didn&#39;t come through coding for that role&#34;, and the people in that role that excelled at it (a motley crew of former stage managers, teachers, guidance counselors, project managers, etc)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; She was on a steady track to land a senior role. Even after I decided to leave the company, I let the next manager know this person is track for a senior position in the next few months.Its very naive to think, that the manager replacing you will see eye to eye with you. I have seen countless occasions, where the engineer in the team who is ontrack for promotion doesnt get it, because the management above has changed.While being in IC role, I never relied on the company to promote me. Its better to jump ships than reestablish the relationship with new manager. It takes same amount of work anyway. At least jumping ship will give you much higher compensation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Running an alternative OS &#34;natively&#34; on a Mac doesn&#39;t seem very appealing to me. It&#39;s almost guaranteed you will never fully get Wi-Fi, audio, graphics acceleration, the trackpad, etc. working flawlessly, especially on the M1 where almost every component is Apple proprietary and it&#39;s not a matter of loading, say, some common Intel graphics driver.On the other hand, virtualization _already_ lets you run whatever arm64 BSD, Linux, or Windows that you want. The trackpad and everything else will work flawlessly thanks to guest additions. Yes, you make some tradeoffs -- you sacrifice a core, a few GB of RAM, some disk space for an OS you don&#39;t _really_ want to be running. But I&#39;m skeptical that these are not better tradeoffs than constantly using a hacked-together and half-broken OS.To me the ideal solution is not that Corellium or Marcan or whoever reverse engineers the drivers to a sufficient degree. I&#39;d rather see Apple (or the Hackintosh types) release a tiny variant of macOS that contains hardware drivers and Hypervisor.framework and not much else. It could be the next generation of Boot Camp and it would probably take less engineering effort for them to maintain while satisfying the small segment of customers interested in running other operating systems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fantastic. OpenBSD on an M1 Mac Mini would be a great home server.As for desktop, I love cwm on my thinkpads, but macbook touchpads have won me over. That said, if arcan gets to a usable state on OpenBSD, I wouldn&#39;t mind sinking a few weekends (and/or crates of beer) into helping with improving touchpad/gesture support. X11 is just too daunting to have me bothered."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So much for the many remarks made on HN claiming that Apple would use the M1 to further exert control over users’ ability to boot an alternative OS. Between this and Asahi Linux, I’d say things are off to a good start.Btw, Asahi has a Patreon page for anyone who wants to contribute. I’m tossing twelve bucks a month and recommend any Mac users with interest in booting alternative OSes support such projects.Now I’m gonna see if there’s an option to throw money at this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am deeply, deeply romantic about programming. I consider it an act of self-actualization.But answering the question literally, I am not representative of everyone in the industry, and that&#39;s a good thing. It&#39;s easy to feel romantic about your vocation when you have a number of reasonable options for achieving modest financial security, and you thus had the privilege of choosing the one that most closely matched your idea of self-actualization and self-identification.Not everyone in this economy has the same set of choices. For many, programming is the lowest-risk way to put a roof over their head and feed their family. We can make up little myths about how we romantics are obviously more passionate, work harder because it&#39;s our dream, are more deeply engaged, and so on.But in the end, I think we&#39;ll find as we look around that those of us who feel romantic about something that is also an excellent way to make money at this particular place in time and space have won a lottery of sorts, and are definitely in the minority.That&#39;s not a bad thing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While I don&#39;t disagree with the article, this quote better sums up how I feel about programming.&gt; The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination... Yet the program construct, unlike the poet&#39;s words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible outputs separate from the construct itself... The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time.-Fred Brooks, in The Mythical Man-MonthIn deference to the counterpoints in this thread, a lot of the &#34;poetry&#34; we actually encounter seems to have been written by Vogons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Seeing as i&#39;m not as jaded yet as many of the other commenters here towards programming, maybe I can give my views.I understand what the author&#39;s getting at pretty simply, it&#39;s pretty awesome to write some words...lots and lots of words...and you create &#39;something&#39;.It&#39;s sort of the same romance that say would surround something likeA carpenter that builds homes from start to finishOr a mechanic that builds super cars in their garageI think it&#39;s that same thingThe lone programmer hacking away building something awesomeUnfortunately, like the &#39;romance&#39; of most things, the reality isThat carpenter&#39;s working on a crew of 100 people building yet another cooking cutter townhouseThat mechanic works a day job at a shop and spends more time paying bills and dealing with customersAnd...that programmerThey&#39;re part of a team debugging some server code somewhere that a bank or accounting firm relies on or somethingSometimes though, I find it helps just to stop and think of things romantically from time to time, even if you&#39;re disillusioned.By the time I left my prior job, I was kind of fed up with it. But even then there was two ways I could look at it.I could be&#39;A CNC programmer in a granite shop making countertops and fireplaces for rich people&#39;Or&#39;I turned mountains into high end furniture using large machines in a trade that stretches back to the farthest history of humanity.&#39;Looking at it the second way helped on those days you just really didn&#39;t want to be there."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I respect Brave&#39;s efforts to make Tor accessible to the masses, but it also puts people at risk. There&#39;s lot of people with not a great deal of technical knowledge who are aware of Tor and might see it as a means to bulletproof privacy, unaware that using it through Brave on an OS like Windows 10 could easily expose them.Brave does present some kind of warning to users when opening an incognito tab. It just doesn&#39;t make the risks clear enough and will mostly be ignored.I&#39;m not sure what solutions there are for this. Perhaps shipping Tor as part of a regular browser isn&#39;t a good idea.

It would be great if we could legally continue to gather data.So far, it seems these substances are arguably much less dangerous than many illegal substances. I would be in favor of legalizing all of them.Decriminalizing seems to be a necessary step in that direction, but it doesn’t allow for quality control. Legalization allows for real and enforceable disclosure about what I might be putting in my body.I hope we get there someday.Edit: and possibly less dangerous than some legal substances."</p>

He graduated I think the year before I matriculated, but his presence was well known on campus and his house was a legendary house he rented out to a few students every semester.To be clear, MAPS already existed back then, he was already working to get psychedelics (and entheogens such as MDMA) incorporated into therapeutic modalities.Back then the idea of legalized psychedelics seemed like a pipe dream.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This classic passive-aggressive apology — “I felt awful that I had let down so many people in my effort to be loyal and learn from EA” doesn’t exactly ring out with contrition — isn’t even internally consistent; if the development team loved their game so much, why was Origin’s management forced to devise stratagems to keep them from going home out of the fear that they wouldn’t come back? Nevertheless, it does contain a fair amount of truth alongside its self-serving omissionsUgh - those omissions are not self-serving. The reality (which we all see) is that the dev team f*cking hated the game, probably gave up on quality, and everyone knows it.  But saying so is an attack on the people Garriott screwed when he screwed up; the omissions are of other people&#39;s contributions to his faults, not his faults themselves.The apology was _incredibly_ well-written: it highlights all of garriott&#39;s mistakes, in detail, and places the blame squarely on his own shoulders: he could say &#34;EA is evil because they enforce business discipline,&#34; but instead said &#34;they did their job as a business, and I didn&#39;t so mine as a creator.&#34;If anything, this was probably _too_ self-blaming (we all know EA would just replace him if he didn&#39;t bow down, accomplishing nothing). But don&#39;t criticize him for failing to throw his team under the bus.  Knowing very little, I&#39;d love work for this guy, based on that apology alone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pagan was pretty bad. I was one of the superfans at the time, I had played every Ultima on my Apple II and then my PC. I was one of the first people to beat Ultima VI and still have my award certificate from Lord British which I got in the mail. I spent late nights tweaking my autoexec.bat and config.sys to get Ultima VII to run properly. Pagan was unplayable on release, it was actually impossible to across the stones leading across an underground river without falling in. Later they released a patch which fixed the most glaring issues and I completed the game, but it left a sour taste in my mouth.What REALLY killed Ultima was the absolute state of Ultima IX. Also released in an unplayable state, the patches rolled in. Finally after about two months, it was playable but as one progressed in the game, incongruities almost immediately popped out. The lore had been changed, sometimes substantially. And this wasn&#39;t the worst thing - it became clear after not too long that the game wasn&#39;t done at all. This was later admitted by an Origin team member who released the real plot, and later on people attempted to fan-patch the game to make it more like it had been planned originally.Of course, EA is to blame for all of this, but Garriott shares this blame for allowing them to take too much control away from his organization and okaying the releases before they were ready.http://hacki.bootstrike.com/english/nitpicks.htmHacki&#39;s page is still THE internet resource for the pissed off former Ultima fan."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Looks like it uses system webviews instead of bundling a copy of Chromium? This to me seems like the real headlining feature, but strangely I had to dig pretty deep to find it: https://tauri.studio/en/docs/getting-started/technical-detai...I kind of wonder why it took this long for someone to try this approach. It just makes a whole lot more sense on the surface.Interesting thing I just thought about: since users don&#39;t get to choose their system webview, I wonder if this has the potential to broaden browser diversity a little bit?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of makes me think... is there room for a much more stripped down version of Chromium that is suitable for lower memory footprint? Or is this impossible?It looks like Tauri uses system webviews, which use a lot less memory, but the burden is then on the developer to make sure that they build essentially 3 (maybe more) UI&#39;s on platforms that might change under their feet. That&#39;s why the Electron approach is simpler - it trades of performance for uniformity of experience across the major platforms.But I&#39;m wondering if it really has to be this way. Do modern browsers really need 2G of RAM in order to send and receive messages in a chat box (looking at you, Slack)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A more common scenario I see is that people start with a monolith that ends up inheriting all the conceptual debt that accumulates as a project evolves. All this debt builds up a great desire for change in the maintaining team.A champion will rise with a clean architecture and design in microservice form that addresses all high visibility pain points, attributing forecasted benefits to the perceived strengths of microservices. The team buys into the pitch and looks forwards to a happily-ever-after ending.The reality though is that the team now has multiple problems, which include:- Addressing conceptual debt that hasn&#39;t gone away.
- Discovering and migrating what the legacy system got right, which is often not documented and not obvious.
- Dealing with the overheads of microservices that were not advertised and not prominent at a proof-of-concept scale.
- Ensuring business continuity while this piece of work goes on.I would propose alternative is to fix your monolith first. If the team can&#39;t rewrite their ball of mud as a new monolith, then what are the chances of successfully rewriting and changing architecture?Once there is a good, well functioning monolith, shift a subset of responsibility that can be delegated to a dedicated team - the key point is to respect Conway&#39;s law - and either create a microservice from it or build a new independent monolith service, which aligns more to service oriented architecture than microservices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hahaha. I have been saying the same for years but have either been punished by my managers or mercilessly downvoted on HN.Somehow mentioning that microservices might not be perfect solution in every case triggers a lot of people.I have actually helped save at least one project in a huge bank which got rolled from 140 services into one. The team got also scaled down to third of its size but was able to work on this monolithic application way more efficiently. Also reliability, which was huge issue before the change, improved dramatically.When I joined, I have observed 6 consecutive failed deployments. Each took entire week to prepare and entire weekend to execute (with something like 40 people on bridge call).When I left I have observed 50 consecutive successful deployments, each requiring 1h to prepare (basically meeting to discuss and approve the change) and 2h of a single engineer to prepare and execute using automation.Most projects absolutely don&#39;t need microservices.Breaking anything apart brings inefficiencies of having to manage multiple things. Your people now spend time managing applications rather than writing actual business logic. You have to have really mature process to bring those inefficiencies down.If you want to &#34;do microservices&#34; you have to precisely know what kind of benefits you are after. Because the benefits better be higher than the costs or you are just sabotaging your project.There are actually ways to manage huge monolithic application that don&#39;t require each team to have their own repository, ci/cd, binary, etc.How do you think things like Excel or PhotoShop have been developed? It is certainly too large for a single team to handle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with creating a dichotomy between &#34;monolith&#34; and &#34;microservices&#34; is that... well... it doesn&#39;t make any sense. You describe your &#34;microservices&#34; and I&#39;ll explain how it&#39;s really just a monolith.&#34;So let me get this straight, you have a Billing package and an Ordering package. How are these organized again?&#34;-&gt; &#34;We have a distributed system.&#34;&#34;So you you compile them together and deploy them horizontally across many machines? Like a distributed monolith?&#34;-&gt; &#34;No we use microservices. The two packages are compiled and deployed separately so there is no code dependencies between them.&#34;&#34;Okay. So if I understand this right, you develop each package separately but they both access the same database?&#34;-&gt; &#34;No no no no! Microservices are not just about code dependency management, they are also about data ownership. Each package is developed and deployed separately and also manages it own database.&#34;&#34;Ah, so you have two monoliths?&#34;-&gt; &#34;...&#34;You see the problem is that the above terms are too broad to describe anything meaningful about a system. And usually &#34;monolith&#34; is used to described the dependencies between code whereas &#34;microservices&#34; is used to describe dependencies about data. It turns out there is a lot of overlap.Design and implement your systems according to your use-case and stop worrying about how to label them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Really interested to see what this does to Deliveroo. I live in central London on a pretty busy street and it&#39;s really wild how many Deliveroo drivers there are. In front of most of the popular takeaway restaurants there are 3-5 drivers waiting at any given time. The increase in delivery and decrease in normal foot traffic during the pandemic has made this really stick out.Deliveroo already totally robs these restaurants. Even for a click and collect order where I get the food myself Deliveroo takes ~20-30%. I assume this will cause Deliveroo to either increase fees or reduce service which may inspire more restuarants to hire their own delivery people again.Overall I think this is a good thing, especially now. These gig workers have been absolutely essential to society over the past year. People have been able to safely shelter in their home while these guys (it&#39;s mostly guys) go out and take all the risks. Let&#39;s pay them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The court made very specific arguments:1. Uber set the fare which meant that they dictated how much drivers could earn
2. Uber set the contract terms and drivers had no say in them
3. Request for rides is constrained by Uber who can penalise drivers if they reject too many rides
4. Uber monitors a driver&#39;s service through the star rating and has the capacity to terminate the relationship if after repeated warnings this does not improveEven if this does hurt Uber short-term, it sounds like the gig economy will be just fine, as long as companies change their behaviour with respect to the above points."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know anything about how the law works, but it seems to accord with the reality of how people tend to think of jobs.Have you ever met an Uber driver who didn&#39;t give the impression that this was what he did all the time? I haven&#39;t, though I imagine not everyone is full time. It&#39;s quite a way from the idea that anyone with a car can give someone else a ride. For instance, I&#39;ve never met a driver who happened to be going where I was going, or someone who thought they&#39;d just make few extra bucks on their day off. They must exist but it seems to not be the norm.At the same time, we&#39;re shoehorning old ideas of what&#39;s work into a modern setting, because it&#39;s reasonably quick to become a driver, and communications with the employer are minimal. Uber doesn&#39;t seem like the kind of firm where drivers might have a teambuilding excursion, though perhaps I&#39;m wrong."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Raj thought that checking the &#34;principal&#34; checkbox and entering the number of a Citibank wash account would ensure that the principal payment would stay at Citibank. He was wrong. To prevent payment of the principal, Raj actually needed to set the &#34;front&#34; and &#34;fund&#34; fields to the wash account as well as &#34;principal.&#34; Raj didn&#39;t do that.I don&#39;t even have anything to add. The paragraph speaks for itself... You can&#39;t make this up"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The actual work of entering this transaction into Flexcube fell to a subcontractor in India named Arokia Raj.&gt; Citibank&#39;s procedures require that three people sign off on a transaction of this size. In this case, that was Raj, a colleague of his in India, and a senior Citibank official in Delaware named Vincent Fratta.The names of these individuals seems like an unnecessary detail, especially since the article names the software interface as the culprit.  I can&#39;t help but think about the recent NYT/SSC incident."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This really is an awesome example of a bad UI. These are exactly the kind of UIs you see in the enterprise all the time, with the article containing the totally crazy description of what was expected plus the screenshots to show that there was absolutely no way to get this, if not being the programmer who wrote it (and even then, no guarantee at all to get it right). To have a somewhat exact approach of detecting and fixing issues like this, that is what usability is all about.So it&#39;s really the design of the software and not just the style of it that was wrong and had to be improved. A usability professional would have caught that immediately - and would have been way cheaper."</p>

So exited for all the sciencing this nuclear-powered, sample-drilling, laser-zapping behemoth can do when it joins its friends on the only planet (known) to be inhabited solely by robots.Edit: Percy is about to release its two 77 kg Cruise Mass Balance Devices (is this what NASA calls &#39;weights&#39;?) to setup the right lift-to-drag ratio for entry. Mars InSight will be listening for the 14,000 km/hr impacts of these weights, providing useful calibration data.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a great achievement with some really interesting work done on the landing algorithms with terrain recognition and it seemed to have worked exceptionally well.Looking forward for the next landing in May of the Chinese rover and all the science these robots will produce. Also, the test of Ingenuity, the helicopter, will be very interesting to watch, that could really pave the way for a different exploration style in the future.And finally, maybe the next transfer window will already see some Starships, that would really change everything."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was at PowerBI in Microsoft, all the execs hailed it as Startup within Microsoft. Come work here instead of Uber. I worked like a dog, sometimes till 2am in morning. My manager would routinely ask us to come on weekends. I was naive, I thought we are growing customer base, this is what a startup looks like.The ultimate realization was in a startup you have equity, a decent amount in a good startup. At Microsoft it was a base salary and set amount of stock. What we did moved very little of the top revenue metric. It made little difference if I worked like a dog, or slacked. The promos were very much “buddy buddy” system.In the end I realized you can’t have startups in big companies (esp as an engineer you don’t have the huge upside  if the startup is successful, your upside is capped)Startups work because you have skin in the game, when you build something people want, you get to reap rewards proportional to it. That correlation and feedback loop is very important.At big companies you don’t have the the same correlation. Some big shot exec they hired reaps far far more on the work you did.Equity is what builds wealth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mean, sure, but it also misses the point a bit. &#34;Startup in a big company&#34; doesn&#39;t mean &#34;yo take some cashdollar and try build and release something to the public&#34;, but it does mean &#34;hey, take a small team and do your own thing with less oversight and process overhead from higher-ups&#34;.The team I worked in at AWS was like this and it felt a lot like startup teams I&#39;ve worked with. That didn&#39;t mean we could take &#39;brand and legal risk&#39;, and if that&#39;s what you want then definitely go and start your own thing.If you want more autonomy and higher velocity than is normal at corporates, then a &#39;startup within a big company&#39; might actually work out for you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure why everyone seems so focused on the cafeteria thing. I&#39;m not sure people and their attitudes towards amenities are really the problem here.From my understanding, the differerence is the companywide attitude to risk. A startup has a &#34;grow at any cost, or maybe perish&#34; attitude. If things go south, bankruptcy will take care of the leftover excess risk (barring criminal charges). A bigco cannot easily go bankrupt, even less a single department. There are tons and tons of capital to eat through if the accumulated risk is realized in cost. So a bigco has to do something about that risk somehow, because most of the company wants to keep what capital it has, only a small part of it really wants to risk things. So the only means to have a situation where you don&#39;t risk bigco for a single department is not making it a department. Make it a Ltd. in a holding or something."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good riddance, in my opinion. 40 million copies of a thick catalog with glossy pages means a couple shittons of not just trees but petroleum and petrochemicals for production, distribution, and disposal. Every year! And ten years ago, it was nearly 200. https://archive.is/rHAhGCan you even imagine a stack of one million catalogs?That&#39;s space, trees, plants, mammals, birds, insects, mushrooms, ... all being squeezed for a glossy catalog, most of which will get thumbed through once or twice and sent to the landfill to rot.These catalogs do not biodegrade well, by the way, because they&#39;re not just paper.I love paper books, and I enjoyed browsing this catalog just like many others in this thread, and yet I don&#39;t think I will miss this one. Hopefully, other thick glossy catalogs will follow suit.Production of catalogs like this squeezes our biome, and if we don&#39;t turn back, it will pop, and we&#39;ll be left with only enough resources for a small fraction of us to survive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am genuinely upset about this. I have such fond memories of thumbing through endlessly as a teenager and dreaming of having my own spaces that were so wonderfully busy and eclectic. My wife and I were just at IKEA last week picking up a new bed for our growing toddler, I glanced at the catalogs as we passed and decided against picking one up. I hope I can still get my hands on a couple old copies to keep on my bookshelf.Edit: Just placed an order for the specific catalog year I have so many memories of reading. One of my sillier purchases, but it feels like a piece of personal history."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Somewhat unrelated IKEA has been brought to it&#39;s knees during the pandemic and it has made their online ordering completely useless.  For a company shifting focus to online only I would think they would want to be able to ship some things purchased online.Stock is also low in the Portland store, but even the few items available can&#39;t be purchased online and shipped to me. I&#39;ve tried to order a number of things recently and they won&#39;t ship anything to my house."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would normally be appalled by such an action, but the supply issues for RTX 30x0 cards are beyond ridiculous. Mining trashes the environment and, for the majority of crypto assets/volumes, does not provide genuinely valuable economic activity besides speculation (I say that as someone who has put thousands of dollars into crypto in the past). Why should people who want to try some ML/DL at home (maybe they even need it for a class they&#39;re taking), and might also want to play the occasional game, have to pay an arm and a leg to get their (remaining) hands on a modern, efficient card?I really wish Nvidia would do this across the RTX product line.Edit: the &#34;Syrian refugee crossing into Europe&#34; trope might pop up as a counter-argument for crypto. I am Syrian and still have relatives there. Refugees&#39; assets are a drop in the ocean of speculators&#39; mining and HODLing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like it&#39;s time to crack some NVIDIA drivers. I already do it for the video encoding limitations, why not this too? Miners are willing to go to some really hacky extremes, reflashing firmwares, custom fan mods, extreme overclock configurations, etc to maximize hashrates and certainly won&#39;t care if they have to jump through some hoops to patch a specific version of the Linux driver or enable unsigned drivers on Windows, as long as they make more profit.Good luck with this one NVIDIA but you&#39;re playing a losing game. As soon as one un-restricted version of the driver exists, this is as good as useless and demand will be the same as ever for these cards unless they&#39;re able to ship CMP cards at a very high rate, but my understanding is the restriction here is silicon.Let&#39;s not forget that last time they produced &#34;mining only&#34; cards, people managed to crack the drivers to render graphics too... this is no exception.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY4s35uULg4"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Gamers hate miners, they&#39;re driving the price up, make hardware impossible to get ect ... It&#39;s a really problematic situation. Almost 6 month after launching new graphic cards from AMD / NVIDIA good luck gettting an RTX 30xx or 6800.On a side note all those virtual currency are just plain wrong on the environment side, it does not make any sense in 2021 to have a currency that need heavy computation thus increasing power consumption. When people designed those currency they def did not think about that."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A key part of this legislation is the requirements for tech companies to provide selected news organisations with advance notice about changes to ranking algorithms. This has been generally overlooked in the reporting and discussion but I believe it is the actually the most important part of the legislation. It will give the selected news organisations an enormous advantage over other companies not included and protect them from new competitors, basically entrenching the current media landscape for the foreseeable future.Given the current Australian government&#39;s cosy relationship with a particular media company that currently dominates the media landscape here, I don&#39;t think it is coincidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I live in Australia and while I&#39;m excited to see less Facebook use, I see a lot of comments saying things like, &#34;good, Facebook monetized an addiction model and this curbs that&#34;. While true, the proposed law that has pushed them to do this is incredibly dangerous. The law doesn&#39;t just apply to Facebook, it applies to whoever the Treasurer of Australia[0] says it applies to - it isn&#39;t metrics/rules based: https://i.imgur.com/7RSqXDJ.pngThis means you as a business owner may wake up one day to find that you are now classified as a designated digital platform corporation and are on the hook to now negotiate contracts with every registered news business corporation, AND provide each of them with the secret sauce behind your ranking algos. The only thing that needs to be done to do this is for the Treasurer to file a decision in the Federal Register of Legislation[1]. It&#39;s a shocking amount of overreach, lack of visibility to the process, and a single point of failure in the system.Overall I&#39;m very curious to see how this plays out. Facebook took the nuclear option here, and I highly suspect that news corporations will feel quite a sting from the loss of traffic / platform. I truly feel like Facebook &#34;winning&#34; here and having the law dropped is the lesser of two evils.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treasurer_of_Australia[1] https://www.legislation.gov.au/Browse/Results/ByRegDate/Legi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can certainly see a lot of parallels with Oculus / Facebook.Perhaps unusually, I actually wanted FB to impress itself more strongly on Oculus post acquisition because, frankly, Oculus was a bit of a mess.  Instead, Oculus was given an enormous amount of freedom for many years.Personally, nobody ever told me what to do, even though I was willing to &#34;shut up and soldier&#34; if necessary -- they bought that capability! Conversely, I couldn&#39;t tell anyone what to do from my position; the important shots were always called when I wasn&#39;t around. Some of that was on me for not being willing to relocate to HQ, but a lot of it was built into early Oculus DNA.I could only lead by example and argument, and the arguments only took on weight after years of evidence accumulated.  I could have taken a more traditional management position, but I would have hated it, so that&#39;s also on me.  The political dynamics never quite aligned with an optimal set of leadership personalities and beliefs where I would have had the best leverage, but there was progress, and I am reasonably happy and effective as a part time consultant today, seven years later.Talking about &#34;entitled workers&#34; almost certainly derails the conversation.  Perhaps a less charged framing that still captures some of the matter is the mixing of people who Really Care about their work with the Just A Job crowd.  The wealth of the mega corps does allow most goals to be accomplished, at great expense, with Just A Job workers, but people that have experienced being embedded with Really Care workers are going to be appalled at the relative effectiveness.The communication culture does tend a bit passive-aggressive for my taste, but I can see why it evolves that way in large organizations.  I&#39;ve only been officially dinged by HR once for insensitive language in a post, but a few people have reached out privately with some gentle suggestions about better communication.All in all, not a perfect fairy tale outcome, but I still consider taking the acquisition offer as the correct thing for the company in hindsight."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"9 years @ Google, and I too came from a company acquired by Google. (In my case, Google did not keep our product or tech stack around, so.) And yes, I can say many Googlers are entitled. It&#39;s a fair descriptor. And the pace of work is slower than a startup. In general.And I too have many criticisms of Google. But.Google has entirely different revenue constraints. It can afford an entirely different way of working. That pace allows a more sustainable cadence of development. It can be a more humane place to work, in general.Google can on the whole accomplish its revenue goals without being a meat grinder. So why be one? I think there is a bit of a problem with this guy&#39;s POV where he&#39;s come to fetishize the actual process of the making of the sausage versus the sausage itself.Projects need not be run under insane stress if there&#39;s a steady supply of talent and money to make things happen. Google can afford that. Pace will be slower. Perhaps less competitive. But the core business continues to do excellently.For many of us Google is not an &#34;exciting&#34; place to work. But it&#39;s a pretty good job to have and it pays well and gives access to both great benefits and to interesting technology. And that compensation in _most_ people does yield a sense of responsibility for delivery. But maybe not the survival-of-the-fittest-meat-grinder panic that this guy somehow seems to love."</p>

He complains about people being entitled, and at the same time he complains that as CEO of subsidiary of one of the biggest company in the world, he cannot say offensive things in his talks.And most entitled one - he’s sold his company (that he actually didn’t own, from the beginning, like with most startups) and he cannot control it fully anymore? And complaining that he cannot fire people on the spot?He should check his entitlement before complaining about other being entitled by not wanting to put his product vision above their wellbeing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It feels a bit hypocritical when Apple laughs at FB for complaining about their new tracking pop-up yet when the shoe&#39;s on the other foot and Apple may actually have to compete on its own platform they double down and defend their right to be judge, jury and executioner.Apple competing with third party app stores on iOS is going to be amazing. No computer platform should be allowed to prevent sideloading or other stores from competing.This isn&#39;t the case on Windows.
This isn&#39;t the case on Android.Or Linux for that matter.It&#39;s more disappointing it takes 10 years for regulators to step-in and say &#34;that&#39;s bad, no more, open up your platform&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bit OT, but I still fail to grasp why Apple is allowed to restrict all browsers on iOS to the Safari rendering engine. Microsoft had to pay big because they didn&#39;t asked their users properly for alternative browsers, yet Apple doesn&#39;t even give other browsers a fair chance to compete on iOS.Consumers suffer because Apple controls about 50% of the mobile market and if Apple decides a certain feature will not be available in Safari (e.g. Push API), no other browser vendor can even offer a solution.Sounds to me like totally abusing their market position to uphold their anti-competitive behavior."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can hardly wait to use Amazon App Store to install Amazon and then open up the Epic Game Store to install random game and then open up EA Game Store to install random game and then open up Facebook App Store to install Facebook and then open up the Apple App Store to install the Blizzard App Store to install Hearthstone and then go back to the Apple App Store and update the Blizzard App Store so I can get the latest Hearthstone updates.Going to be super fun!My gaming computer is already filled with like 8 different app stores each completely different then the other and a variety of privacy/security issues on each. All of them need their App Store running in order to play their games, so half the time my computer has 4-5 App Stores running in the background so I can play a single game. And they are all electron/qt webkit apps cause nobody builds apps anymore so each one consumes about 500mb of ram.And each App Store also has their own chat system along with the others like discord.I don&#39;t agree that Apple should have a complete monopoly, but the alternative is not better. And while Android does have the main Google Play Store, and there isn&#39;t to many &#34;alternative&#34; App Stores at the moment. Just give it time, the same thing that is happening to TV Streaming/Game App Stores will happen on Android."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As usual, context matters. If you&#39;re trying to convey complex thoughts about abstract matters, then language is the way to do it. If you are trying to convey deep emotional states, then a photo or video is probably better. You cannot convert the 1st amendment into photos, and you cannot convert the Mona Lisa smile into words.Just try to use words to describe either of these photos and see how they fall short:https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-10/19/1...https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2015-10/19/1...Between recorded voice and written text, I personally prefer written language. I like the ability to consume at my own pace, go back and re-read tricky bits, and easily search or quote. Plus it&#39;s much easier to use TTS to convert text to speech than the other way around (at the moment). Maybe someday technology will remove this boundary but currently that&#39;s my stance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The question is whether these advantages are because text is a better communication medium, or because of the limitations of our technology?Take using a computer to type a word versus draw a picture: Effectively everyone who uses a computer can type a word, but I&#39;d bet less than 10% could draw a circle.But put a piece of paper in front of someone and effectively everyone can draw a circle.This points to there being a limitation in the technology for working with other forms of media, not the effectiveness of the communication medium itself.This isn&#39;t to say that text isn&#39;t also a better communication medium, but it is to say, until the technology has improved for communicating with other media, it&#39;s difficult to compare without basing the decision on the limitations of the technology.In other words, most of the perceived advantages of text are really advantages of text being easier to represent digitally (or generally reproduced, e.g., printing press), not advantages of text as a communication medium itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Text is not the oldest - nor easiest to use -, text is a heavy abstraction born somewhat recently in human history.The oldest and easiest is the visual in 3D, then comes the visual in 2D.Those exist since we have eyes.Our brain have dedicated and sizeable infrastructure for that. Children can communicate in 3D (gestures, posture, expressions, objects) and in 2D drawings before learning textural communication with great effort.Text is more regular and reliable in certain contexts (not always, sometimes a pictogram or others are better), when the circumstances are proper for that.Text has its uses, just like all the other forms, not being paramount, not at all!(I&#39;d also argue about that we could read old texts. Sometimes yes, but sometimes we cannot read present ones neither if the cultural and knowledge background is inadequate. Which is just aggravated by the ages)"</p>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26174269">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Imagine having a business model so fragile that your only line of  defense is to obscure the cancellation process through these tactics. Do they really think that they can curve their churn this way?I mean best you’re doing is getting maybe another month or so of revenue from a customer who is just pushing the pain of cancelling because they are busy or lazy.And at the end instead of getting what could be a dormant customer who can sign up later again, what you get is someone who hates your company.What an incredibly stupid way to erode the brand of a publication, whose major asset to survive is precisely its brand."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just cancelled and it was relatively painless, to their credit.When they asked the reason, I said that political coverage was unfair. Left is OK, unfair is not.I don&#39;t consider myself &#34;on the left&#34; but I really don&#39;t mind a publication being left of center or right of center. If it&#39;s good, I will pay for it (I subscribed tp The Atlantic at least twice, and the New Yorker once, and probably others in a mix of print and digital).But the NYT has drifted too far down the path of politically-correct fashions, and away from robust debate and discussion of challenging topics and how they intersect with real events.It feels more like they want to persuade me to hold a set of opinions (which shifts rapidly), rather than informing me and letting me form my own. &#34;Persuade&#34; is even the wrong word; more like &#34;pressure&#34; or &#34;coerce&#34;. If it&#39;s all ads, so be it; but when I pay, I expect that I am the customer and not the product. So I don&#39;t pay as of the end of my billing cycle.Also, the NYT cheers on, and even participates in bullying. Scott Alexander being a recent example, but there are a lot more when it comes to politically-charged topics.I should reiterate that this is not a right-left thing. I would have remained subscribed if the NYT had simply drifted left, and concerned itself mainly with arguments betweed various left-of-center factions. Lots of worthwhile things to discuss and debate there, and lots of events to tie it to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had a similar issue with the Wall Street Journal a few years back, and despite having spent the majority of my career working on Wall Street, I’ll never buy a subscription again.I signed up for a really good deal for 6 months of digital + paper delivery, but my paper always arrived a day or two late, so before my 6 months were up I tried to cancel, but couldn’t figure out a way to do so on their website. I messaged support asking them to not renew my subscription, and told them that the paper always arrived late. They responded back that they were going to give me a free subscription until they could figure out the paper delivery. I should have held firm and cancelled, but it seemed lke they were trying to provide good customer service.Nothing changed with delivery, and I followed up a few times to see what was going on. I was told they were looking into it.One day, out of the blue, I received a large bill from them. I called to see what was going on and I was told that my trial was up and since I hadn’t cancelled that it had renewed. A proceeded to tell the about my problems with delivery and that customer service was supposedly working on fixing the problem and not charging me until they could. The person on the phone told me that that’s not possible since they don’t provide same-day delivery to my address. I recounted exactly what had happened, and they basically told me I was a liar, and would not refund the charge because the user agreement says they don’t have to, even though I called within a few hours of the new charge and subscription renewal.The part that really stung was that I was a PhD student and could get an entire year for less than what they charged me for a month. I’ve never had a company treat me so poorly before."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am sorry about the position you&#39;re in. For the last several years I have been balancing taking care of my terminally ill wife who recently passed away, all while working remotely in the web hosting industry. It&#39;s hard to balance. Harder than you think. Setting boundaries will be vital to being successful in any WFH role.Now that that&#39;s out of the way: You need to focus. You&#39;ve described your abilities and that&#39;s fine, but you lack focus. Your qualifications are great, but your presentation is all over the place. You need a single one page resume that focuses on one aspect of your knowledge and experience, and lightly mentions the others. Make multiple resumes, each with a focus on one thing. Use the resume that&#39;s best for the job. I recently saw somebody who must have had 20 different resumes to match the jobs they were applying for. It worked.Also, you might consider looking into the Web Hosting business. If your temperament is as you describe, and you like talking on the phone or live chat, most web hosts will overlook any technical gaps. Those can be taught. In fact that can lend to your focus! Focus on the fact that you know things that can&#39;t be taught: Customer Service, talking down angry customers, talented writing, friendly and always willing to find a solution under dire circumstances. Those are GOLD. Once those are on the table, the rest is negotiable. I&#39;ll email you a link to at least one that is hiring full remote entry level.Additionally, you need to step up your confidence level. Let an employer know that your family is important to you and that you&#39;re dedicated to working hard so that you can support them- and leave it at that. They don&#39;t deserve the other details, and they aren&#39;t relevant.I hope this helps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hey anon, I feel for you, and most of the answers here are giving you a 12-month plan when you need a 1-month plan.If you know Linux well enough to configure Wordpress, how about tech support for a hosting company?  Try making some short email approaches to old-school hosting companies (I used to run one).  They might be flexible enough to take a chance depending on how confident your approach is.They have lots of customers bashing away at Linux, making mistakes, often without the patience to see their own problems through.  Their business problem is that these customers need hand-holding but only pay a fixed, monthly fee.  (the hope is eventually they stop asking and keep paying for years).The combination you can offer those companies could be basic Linux knowledge (no need for advanced cloud stuff) and whatever flexibility you can offer them - especially if they&#39;re not in your time zone.The larger ones might be a tall order, all listing locations by default (Gandi, Leaseweb, GoDaddy, Hetzner etc.), but maybe someone here will have an inside track.I agree with other posters - never mention difficult circumstances in a job application, particularly a cold application.  Just talk about how keen you are to solve their difficult customers&#39; problems, how well you work in a team, and keep the initial approach brief.Good luck! And please update us if you can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just an anecdote for you- in 2009, I wanted to drop out of college because I preferred partying. I obviously needed income and was dissatisfied with the jobs I’d had in the past (fast food, waiting tables and hotel customer service). Like you, I had always been a tech “nerd” and had built websites and recycled computers for my church/charities in the past. One day I came across a job post for a small SEO firm that was looking for a “web developer” aka clicking around Wordpress, writing some CSS, and writing SEO content. It paid $11/hr. I sent an email and he agreed to interview me. I must’ve charmed him because he agreed to give me a 90 day trial. It worked out and I worked for him for about 2 years before a recruiter found me and got me a job at a “real” software company on a team of 15 engineers. After a couple years there, I founded my own SaaS side business (which went viral on HN circa 2014). It grew to become much, much more than a side business and was eventually acquired by a PE firm.I just wanted to say to keep your head up, remain persistent, keep learning and stay curious. It can be done and hard work (usually) pays off.Stay flexible - even if a job doesn’t seem super relevant to your core interests you never know when it’ll come in handy later. For example, my experience in fast food gave me great insights into POS systems (which I ended up building) and my time working at a luxury boutique hotel taught me how to provide excellent customer service even in difficult situations (one time I didn’t call a customer’s room at the request wake up call time and he missed his flight- eek).Best of luck to you!Ps- just sent you an email"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I previously submitted this story a few days ago[1], where it garnered some discussion and a bit over 100 upvotes, but never made the front-page due to some down-weights in HN&#39;s algorithm. I&#39;m reposting this story at Daniel&#39;s suggestion. He agreed it deserved a second chance to break out.--I noticed that it&#39;s commonly accepted that Bloomberg&#39;s 2018 stories on the Supermicro hack were bogus, costing them a huge amount of reputational damage. However, Bloomberg stood by the stories. I&#39;m very curious to see how this one will be received. I was never quite convinced by the naysayers or the denials by the government, Apple, or Amazon. I think it&#39;s quite likely that Bloomberg will be proven right in the end, this story having been accurate but suppressed for &#34;secrecy&#34; reasons all along.Notably, one of the criticisms at the time was that Bloomberg didn&#39;t name credible sources with first-hand accounts of the events — understandably given the sensitivity. This time, it seems they have been able to do so.Either way, I&#39;m thrilled to see an outlet do original reporting and stand by their work in the face of universal condemnation. We are better off for having strong dissenting views informing us and expanding the narrative. I&#39;m finding myself increasingly distrustful of the work of journalism outlets, but this (and those gone independent on Substack) gives me hope.[1]: Previous discussion here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26112436"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Its weird to see a follow-up to this that doesn&#39;t even begin to acknowledge the broad skepticism of claims except for saying that the previous push-back from the alleged targets was a drop in the bucket.I don&#39;t doubt there are highly-targeted supply chain attacks that happen at the whims of state level actors but the specifics presented by this and its previous reporting still are difficult at best to believe with the reporting as it is presented."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;They shared one other trait; U.S. spymasters discovered the manipulations but kept them largely secret as they tried to counter each one and learn more about China’s capabilities.Putting aside the concerns with the believability of this particular Bloomberg article... how many legitimate security holes are ignored in software purely on the basis of &#34;the NSA figures it&#39;s NOBUS (nobody knows but us) and it&#39;d be good to use it on China?&#34; I&#39;m personally convinced that the spymasters are more worried about keeping a good stock of security holes in reserve instead of actually securing infrastructure."</p>

I&#39;ll have to play with it more, but I was set up in mere minutes and it works at extremely low latency.The fact that this does bidirectional audio is icing on the cake; can&#39;t wait to share this with some quarantined bands.Magic, well done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll chime in with the same intense positivity. In the early days of the quarantine I set up a &#34;walk in theater&#34; on my property where I wanted friends to be able to watch the film without bothering my neighbors with a massive stereo system. The natural option was headphones and I chose between setting up an FM transmitter and trying to get everyone to buy a walkman... or... trying to come up with a network streaming solution. I found the open source implementation of VBAN and tried to write a python script to launch the server and manage finding new connections. It failed absolutely miserably and I ended up setting up an amplified audio system in the rain, much to the trouble of my neighbors also.Needless to say, I love this. The only thing that&#39;s stopping it from being truly wonderful is an Android app &lt;3"</p>

I designed a pair of nice 3D printable headphones [1] and my plan was to make them Wifi headphones so I could roam the house while listening to them. I made a battery powered raspberry pi zero with a nice DAC and set up shairport sync as an Apple Airplay device. That works fine for Spotify, but there’s instances (watching videos while walking in and out of the office) where the latency is a problem. Maybe this will work for me![1] https://github.com/tlalexander/reboot-headphones"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; during the first year of grad school I realized that AI, as practiced at the time, was a hoax.I had a similar realization during grad school about a lot of the popular topics at the time (early 2000s). I even used to call them &#34;the hoaxes of computer science&#34;. Things like grid computing or formal methods of software engineering had a lot of resources behind them, but nobody was able to use the results. Instead, very different formats of these ideas are what took root: cloud computing and advanced type systems.&gt; the low end eats the high end: that it&#39;s good to be the &#34;entry level&#34; option, even though that will be less prestigious, because if you&#39;re not, someone else will be, and will squash you against the ceiling.I wish every grad student had been forced to memorize this statement. Build something useable, not clever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This comment really resonated with me, I found myself in this exact situation at 25, in a &#34;very prestigious and selective place&#34; for AI nonetheless. It took me a couple years to realize the smart people are just playing the game, the unsuspecting losers are &#34;playing it straight&#34; and getting endlessly frustrated. I found my balance by, frankly, taking advantage of a system that is FUBAR. Incidentally, I also took some art classes and because they were not for credit, I just flowed and drew ( https://lingxiaolingdotus.firebaseapp.com/art ). Tbh I felt more alive placing some hasty marks on paper than I ever did doing &#34;research&#34; in a lab.&#34;I&#39;m only up to age 25 and already there are such conspicuous patterns. Here I was, yet again about to attend some august institution in the hopes of learning about some prestigious subject, and yet again about to be disappointed. The students and faculty in the painting department at the Accademia were the nicest people you could imagine, but they had long since arrived at an arrangement whereby the students wouldn&#39;t require the faculty to teach anything, and in return the faculty wouldn&#39;t require the students to learn anything.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did an internship with a very profitable Swedish mobile game before the pandemic, and it was really interesting to see the doublethink: everyone knew we were making a drug, but people avoided speaking of it in that way. It was always &#34;our most engaged players readily spend on in-game items&#34;, and never &#34;the most addicted users spend money so they can continue playing&#34;It was a great workplace, but I don&#39;t think it was adding much value to the world."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d add that algorithmic feeds are another part of the triad (quartet?), and probably the worst offender. Personalized addictive content is on the rise (tiktok, YouTube, even Facebook and Twitter curate your newsfeed &#34;for you&#34; ), and these ml-determined feeds drive engagement to the highest possible levels, leading to an incredible waste of time, a distorted world view (mostly the posts with the highest engagement will be those that call for outrage, which leads to radicalization [1]), and just in general a society where our information consumption is determined by black boxes with opaque goals that do not optimize for the common good.I attribute a significant part of the political rift and radicalization that has occurred in the western world in the past few years to specifically this feature, the algorithmically determined, engagement maximizing, feed.[1] https://www.nature.com/articles/s41599-020-00550-7"</p>

I&#39;ve been trying to break away from Facebook for a while, and recently (the past year or so) I started realizing that my Facebook feed always shows me the exact same posts in the exact same order for days, to the point where I know exactly what post will be first when I open the website.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazon has a problem with fake reviews and it seems they are ok with it.I bought a replacement screen from Amazon and it wasn’t working properly. I thought I did something wrong so I contacted the seller/manufacturer and they told: oh yeah, it‘s defective, we‘ll just give you your money back. I agreed and then the person said „cool, now in order to process your request, please click these buttons on Amazon” and they sent me a screenshot showing how to leave a 5 star review. wtf.I refused and asked them to process the refund. First they said they can’t process the refund technically without me pressing those buttons and then that their job depends on it.I requested a refund through Amazon and tried leaving a 1-star review saying that the product was defective and the seller tried to condition me into giving them a 5 star review. This review was not accepted by Amazon, saying that seller feedback should be given on the seller page.  This does make sense if you have multiple sellers selling the same product, but it was not the case here. These guys were the only ones producing and selling it and if the score of 5-star reviews is from people being coerced to leave a review, then it should be there, not on the seller page where it’s very easily buried.In the end I also contacted Amazon support with screenshots and I had to explain the problem 3 times as the customer representative said they didn’t understand what more can they do since I already received my refund. I’m the end, they said “they forwarded the message to the proper department, have a nice day”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon loves fake reviews as long as they are 5 star. The more it looks like people buying stuff using amazon are happy, the better that marketing is for Amazon. Look at all these people who are so happy to be buying stuff on Amazon, so much better than the alternatives.Amazon could clean this up and then watch the average drop. From the removal of the fake fives but also it makes it look more &#34;socially accpetable&#34; to leave 4 and 3 star reviews. So it costs Amazon to do the right thing by the people parting with money for stuff so they don&#39;t.Amazon are well aware of /their/ incentives and when their incentives align with what looks to me a lot like fraud they&#39;ll play the plausibly deny game.Or perhaps I&#39;m wrong they don&#39;t know and there&#39;s nothing they can do. Amazon employees will probably confirm that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like the fake reviews are merely the tip of the iceberg.Over the last 5-10 years, Amazon&#39;s main shopping website seems to have gone from a reasonably reputable location to an internet cesspool to rival ebay or craigslist.For example, looking for an item one is presented with a wide variety of almost identical products from a wide variety of almost identical, completely unknown brands, with no trust or confidence in any of them.Now obviously, these brands/products are most likely nothing to do with Amazon, they&#39;re just using Amazon as their storefront, and sometimes fulfilment, but it still reflects upon Amazon, and ultimately taints their brand with the same brush.Maybe Amazon makes more money in this way, by taking a cut of this flow through various service fees, but for me it makes Amazon less useful to go to when I don&#39;t know exactly what I want already, and more often pushes me to go direct to a more trusted source."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you haven&#39;t tried SQLite, please do. For years I ignored SQLite and used MySQL (it does the job) but once you see how fast SQLite is, and advantages of having a DB contained in a single file... just go play around with SQLite instead of ignoring it for years like me. It&#39;s neat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting consequence of this characteristic of SQLite is that it makes it a really good fit for GraphQL.GraphQL has the N+1 queries problem pretty much baked into it. You can work around it to a certain extent with a lot of effort implementing data loader patterns, but someone will still likely be able to cow up with a query that triggers a cascade of SELECTs.Or, because &#34;many small queries are  efficient in SQLite&#34;, you could use that instead.I built a Datasette plugin that exposes a GraphQL API to an existing SQLite database and it works so well that I switched from being a GraphQL skeptic to a GraphQL advocate.https://simonwillison.net/2020/Aug/7/datasette-graphql/Here&#39;s an example nested GraphQL query that executes 32 select queries. It&#39;s pretty snappy: https://datasette-graphql-demo.datasette.io/graphql?query=%7..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The Appropriate Uses For SQLite page says that dynamic pages on the SQLite website typically do about 200 SQL statements each. This has provoked criticism from readers. Examples:&gt; &#34;200 SQL statements is a ridiculously high number for a single page&#34;&gt; &#34;For most sites, 200 queries is way, way, way too much.&#34;&gt; &#34;[This is] bad design&#34;Funnily enough, at a recent workplace the guideline was &#34;if it only does 200 queries, you&#39;ve optimized it enough&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wonder how difficult it would be to implement a language for specifying Factorio factories without worrying about physical layouts. This post provides a lot of good insights into how that could be done. Once a factory is specified, a compiler could turn the high-level specification into a blueprint or a valid save file to be loaded up in the game.Of course, the compiler would have no way to lay out the factory with respect to available resource deposits. Maybe that would have to be part of the specification as well? Or maybe the programmer (player?) could pass an empty map file as a compiler argument.Also, this doesn&#39;t give any consideration to the tech tree or enemies within the game. I guess those could be compiler flags, as long as we&#39;re dreaming.Look, all I&#39;m saying is that it would be really cool to be able to check factories into version control."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can definitely see the point the author is trying to make, and I agree that it naturally lends itself to a functional model of how the game works.On the other hand, and this is speaking as someone who has played the game for an embarrassing number of hours all the way into endgame &#34;megabase&#34; territory: my mental abstraction of the game isn&#39;t really functional. It&#39;s directed graphs. Sure, the two views can be equivalent representations, but I find thinking about the game as a directed graph (and reasoning about throughputs in a graph representing a network) to be the perspective that gives actionable insights most readily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Factorio is a genre-defining game, and I think the number of clones is a testament to that.Factorio is often compared to programming, but it&#39;s closer to Excel where the logic and the output live in the same space. The game does a great job letting the user build with programming-like constructs without them ever having to understand any theory."</p>

It&#39;s very hard to stop even in a two-person household, because so many of the &#34;products&#34; most people in the Western world are used to buying and using since an early age are violators. I am blessed with being quite sensitive to most of them, so it&#39;s an endless struggle with partners and cohabitants.Basically anything bought new has it: furniture, clothes, cars, anything plastic, dyed, glued, particleboard.&#34;Cleaning&#34; products: sprays, detergents, most &#34;soaps&#34;, shampoos, creams, conditioners, have this type of crap in them.Even most stuff which claims to be &#34;eco-friendly&#34; is bullshit, and has all the same crap in it if you look at the ingredients.And it feels like online there is a whole army of &#34;rational scientific defenders&#34; ready to jump into action anytime I mention it. It feels like there is a whole playbook for discrediting this type of comment, and calling into question how &#34;scientific&#34; it is, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Keep in mind this is a meta-analysis using data published in papers that are up to 30 years old and from overseas including China, then applying it to California&#39;s carcinogen list (prop 65) and California commute times.I am sure a followup study will be done to see if this is actually a problem in the USA in 2021.The article is published here (Open access) : https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016041202...Edit: I found this news article from 2003 discussing the issue of carcinogenic new car smells and how manufacturers were trying to eliminate the the dangerous smells while simulating what consumers expect a new car should smell like:https://www.caranddriver.com/features/a15133792/new-car-smel..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So here&#39;s what I&#39;d love if other people here could help me understand.Sensitivity to VOC&#39;s is extremely dependent on the person. My father, for example, had the carpet redone cheaply in his office, and worked there happily 8 hrs/day without smelling anything and without any ill effects.For me, on the other hand, the smell was noxious but bearable, but I&#39;d start to feel lightheaded after about 15 minutes in there. My brother would get a terrible headache after just 5 minutes. (And this is us as adults, same size as him.)Memory foam (e.g. in a pillow) also affects me, even after it&#39;s offgassed for weeks. I don&#39;t smell a thing, but it gives me a burning sore throat after I&#39;m close to it for a couple of hours. But again, zero effect on my dad.And so my big question is: I&#39;m well aware that people have drastically different responses to VOC&#39;s. But does that mean VOC&#39;s harm people differently too, or are we all harmed the same?In other words, does my dad have some kind of &#34;protective&#34; genes where the VOC&#39;s don&#39;t bother him because they harm him less, so he doesn&#39;t avoid them? Or are my brother and I better off because we&#39;re super-sensitive to them, so we escape the harm he might be suffering?It seems like such an urgent public health problem, especially given how many people use memory foam mattresses and pillows. It just boggles my mind that I get a sore throat after just a couple of hours with one, while other people sleep peacefully all night."</p>

 Dunno whether they fixed trying to create such a basic measurement for Texas plants, but it doesn&#39;t seem like it.If you want to know some of the specifics about what &#34;winterization&#34; means in practice for a power plant including natural gas ones, you can read some of the details in that report.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love this. I started laughing when I read the description. I laughed because a Harvard physicist (funded by people like Bill Gates) had the same idea to use cooling towers for their DAC project in Carbon Engineering (linked in your post). But as you say, it is still expensive. They are bragging that their design took hundred of man years!And then you two guys come in with the idea that in hindsight seems completely obvious, use all the cooling towers already out there! The most start up thing ever.I used to be an engineer at an ammonia plant. Many of them already capture and sell CO2 from their process. So they have the infrastructure to compress and sell CO2 already on site. The plant I worked at was in Augusta, GA. Might be worth checking out ammonia plants as a growth market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huh, smart idea to piggyback off existing infrastructure. Have you contacted Stripe Climate? They are directing money from stripe businesses to fund carbon removal, and they just put out a call for new companies to contact them.Believe I saw it within past 7-10 days on Patrick Collison’s twitter. Here’s the link. Has details and an application: https://mobile.twitter.com/orbuch/status/1359926307149148162Btw for anyone with a business using stripe: stripe climate is now open for anyone worldwide. I set it up to contribute 1% of my revenues. And it should be deductible as a marketing expense: Stripe let’s you out it on your checkout, invoice and receipt. The founder of Nomadlist found it increased his conversions. Haven’t tested it personally but plausibly it’s actually profit generating.Probably the most impactful climate decision you can make with your business, takes 30 seconds to set up, and may boost your revenue.https://stripe.com/climate"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re not injecting the CO2 underground in a stable form, how does this reverse climate change? It sounds like it&#39;s simply a cheaper option in some circumstances for sourcing CO2 from the air (compared to traditional solutions by Airgas). Not to take away from your efforts! I think this is a fine improvement to CO2 process needs if you can replace more expensive air extraction techniques, but it doesn&#39;t contribute to improving climate change without sequestering the harvested atmospheric CO2."</p>
