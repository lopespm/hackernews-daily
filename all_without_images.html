								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I know the privacy approach Apple has been pushing was just marketing, but I didn&#39;t care too much because I enjoyed my iPhone and M1 macbook.Because of this decision (and the fact that my iPhone more-or-less facilitates poor habits throughout my life), I&#39;m considering moving completely out of the Apple ecosystem.Does anyone have any recommendations for replacements?* On laptops: I have an X1 carbon extreme running linux, but it&#39;s entirely impratical to take outside of the house: it has terrible battery life and runs quite hot.  I also cannot stand its trackpad.  Is there any linux-capable device with an okay trackpad?* On phones: are there any capable phones out there that aren&#39;t privacy nightmares?  All I want is a phone with a long lasting battery that I can use with maps, a web browser, and texting.* On cloud: I&#39;ve considered executing on a NAS forever, but I&#39;m unsure where to start."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why do people still think they have _any_ power over user-hostile corporations and its proprietary code?Apple can (and likely will) say they won&#39;t do it and then do it anyway. It&#39;s a proprietary platform. They already have it, now. All they are claiming is an excuse not to be caught in a certain way they wouldn&#39;t like at a later point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently listened to a Darknet Diaries episode on messaging app Kik. This app is apparently being used by many people to trade child pornography. In this episode, there was some criticism expressed on how Kik doesn&#39;t scan all the images on their platform for child pornography.I would really like to hear from people who sign this open letter, how they think about this. Should the internet be a free for all place without moderation? Where are the boundaries for moderation (if it has to exist), one-on-one versus group chat, public versus private chat?To quote this open letter: “Apple is opening the door to broader abuses”. Wouldn&#39;t not doing anything open a different door to broader abuse?Edit: I would really love an actual answer, since responses until now have been &#34;but muh privacy&#34;. You can&#39;t plead for unlimited privacy and ignore the impact of said privacy. If you want unlimited privacy, at least have the balls to admit that this will allow free trade of CSAM, but also revenge porn, snuff-films and other things like it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The issue here has nothing to do with children, they would always use &#39;children&#39; as excuse. The issue here is installation of Spyware Engine.The very fact of existence of such Spyware Engine has effect that each person would behave as &#39;someone is looking&#39;.This means zero privacy. This means &#39;no privacy&#39; feeling. Everyone is more &#39;careful&#39; when people around. And this has prolonged effect on society&#39;s freedom, democracy and rights of individual because independent thinking happens when true privacy is there.Even a fear of false triggering the system and exposure of one&#39;s private thoughts/pictures/events to other people during &#39;sorting out false alarm&#39; would make people behave differently. Even if they have nothing to do with any children the fear that their private moments can become public just because some AI would decide so would make each person think twice about each step.This is a huge attack on privacy of individual and should not be taken lightly. The effect will be also huge. Just imagine what they will do next if they get away with this. Just imagine what other companies will do once this is accepted for apple devices.I think this can/should also be considered as a fraud because when one bought apple device one was never told that spyware would be installed some day later.Edit: I think it should be illegal/made illegal to install any spyware on any device for any excuse without warant. Spyware is a Search of &#39;home&#39; without warrant to some degree, isn&#39;t it? Done through the hands of some private company under some excuse...  What about Fourth Amendment?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Im really starting to develop a visceral hatred for Apple.They are talking sanctimoniously about privacy out of one end of their mouth, put on a family friendly face by banning anything offending prude sensibilities, while having no qualms about doing as much business as they possibly can in China. Now this.They are the ultimative dystopian corporation, I find them even worse than Facebook in that regard, at least Facebook has some interest in free speech and does not operate in China.I guess the reason I am so angry is that I like the devices and engineering marvels they can produce. But I cannot be a customer of this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know about you, but I just decided to switch from an iPhone back to a Nokia feature phone (where is mobile Linux when you need it?) and start backing out of Apple&#39;s ecosystem. I&#39;m quite positive I can live without apps, just as I used to before Y2K. And, in case you&#39;re wondering, no: I have nothing to do with illegal adult imagery. [Edit #1] This article gets (at least) one thing right: when it comes to certain kinds of crime, an accusation is ALL it takes to destroy your life. [Edit #2] I used to laugh at all the &#34;we have your password, send Bitcoin or...&#34; spam. The first &#34;you have a picture of a gray cat on your phone, send Bitcoin or...&#34; message would give me a friggin&#39; heart attack."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"CalyxOS is an awesome project. I have worked with the lead developer a bit over the past few years and it&#39;s been such a pleasure. We share some bits of code between our projects here: https://github.com/AOSPAlliance.If anyone is interested in building their own custom android OS in the cloud (AWS) with same ability to lock your bootloader like CalyxOS, you can checkout my project I&#39;ve been maintaining for a few years now called RattlesnakeOS: https://github.com/dan-v/rattlesnakeos-stack.And if you prefer to not build in the cloud, there is also a really great project called robotnix (https://github.com/danielfullmer/robotnix) which provides a way to build many flavors of OS (AOSP, GrapheneOS, LineageOS, etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I purchased a Pixel phone to test this stuff on.I installed LineageOS and found I couldn&#39;t run some google apps. I reinstalled LineageOS with https://opengapps.org added during the install and made the mistake of transferring from my old phone which brought all the google services and everything back to the phone (mostly).I then installed CalyxOS - much easier install process than lineage. Really liked the defaults. Could not get many apps that relied on google play services though. If I didn&#39;t need so many Google-tied apps I would pick this as my phone OS for basic stuff like messaging and browsing.Installed LineageOS again, found there were a couple apps I could not get working after all (50 different apps installed).In the end I gave up and re-flashed Google firmware back onto the phone. I spent about 10 hours on all this stuff and simply ran out of time for now. I though I could get away from Google but I didn&#39;t realize how much my apps needed Google."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you&#39;re unfamiliar with the context: Calyx Institute is a 501(c)(3) with a digital privacy and security mission. For a while they&#39;ve offered, for a few hundred dollars a year donation, unmetered access to sprint&#39;s network. I don&#39;t know the details but I think they have retained access to the network through the merger due to some non-profit provision (something like the sprint merger was allowed with stipulation that certain agencies using the network for certain purposes would be grandfathered over). There&#39;s apparently more history related to the founder previously running an ISP under gag order, which drives their mission.Access to the network is only possible through wifi pucks. I asked if I could register the IMEI of my ThinkPad&#39;s modem/radio, but they wouldn&#39;t allow it citing the usual &#34;we are responsible for the behavior of the devices on the network so you have to use our certified device&#34;. Sadly, these phones do not participate in Calyx&#39;s data network, they require a traditional carrier. Maybe it&#39;s part of their roadmap to eventually offer their data services on these handset form factor devices? But until then, I don&#39;t see a huge point. It would be really awesome to say &#34;I get my network access through a privacy oriented non-profit&#34; (:"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This reeks like a con-artists rephrasing perfectly normal and mundane observations into scary-sounding situations so that people would buy the air-filter companies that are funding your research.I&#39;m all for cleaner air and I don&#39;t doubt that the already well-established negative effects of high CO2 or VOC concentrations on us, but can we at least keep any discussion to non-anecdotal, strong scientific evidence? None the articles linked both here show any rigorous statistics that pinpoint cause and effects, it&#39;s all handwavy conjectures with &#34;common sense&#34; evidence and statistical dressing to show correlation. Correlation doesn&#39;t even necessarily mean causality. Some of the articles even have *may&#34; in the title, you can be the judge.Probably an unpopular opinion given the large amount of anecdotal science already posted.Dust on carpet is bad and particularly if you don&#39;t clean it and let stuff grow - we all know that already and we don&#39;t need a laser pointer to show kids how scary it is. Just because you can see it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s worse, and just because you can&#39;t see it doesn&#39;t necessarily mean it&#39;s better.It&#39;s just insanity that everyone is suddenly a scientists with a few anecdotes or links to articles that show correlation but not causality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve been harping on this since learning covid was aerosol based early 2020.I like to tell new parents a trick that worked well for us: use a nice filter-based air purifier for white noise. It has deep bass, and it keeps the air near the child extremely clean. We have been doing this for our kids for almost 10 years now since birth.A fun experiment for kids: if you have a laser pointer, shine it close to the ground indoors and kick up dust near the floor. If you see any light in the air, that is all stuff you are breathing in (works really well on carpet)…Air quality associated with:Alzheimers: https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/the-new-alzheimer...Cancers, plural: https://www.aacr.org/patients-caregivers/progress-against-ca...Sperm Quality: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4443398/#sec995...Female Fertility: https://www.newscientist.com/article/2207560-exposure-to-air...Autism: https://www.sciencealert.com/particulate-matter-in-air-pollu...Bipolar/Depression: https://www.nationalgeographic.com/environment/article/air-p..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do they look at the relative contribution between CO2 and VOCs? These two require very different solutions. The first is about ventilation in closed spaces, and the second can be solved with only a $300 air purifier.EDIT: Here is the original study: https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1510037I really don&#39;t understand their methods pertaining to VOCs. Maybe someone can fill me in. Their method pertaining to CO2 seems straightforward."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A somewhat oversimplified summary of the new UUID formats:UUID6: a timestamp with a weird epoch and 100 ns precision like in UUID1, but in a big-endian order that sorts naturally by time, plus some random bits instead of a predictable MAC address.UUID7: like UUID6, but uses normal Unix timestamps and allows more timestamp precision.UUID8: like UUID7, but relaxes requirements on where the timestamp is coming from. Want to use a custom epoch or NTP timestamps or something? UUID8 allows it for the sake of flexibility and future-proofing, but the downside is that there&#39;s no standard way to parse the time from one of these -- the time source could be anything monotonic."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a quick reference for readers:The UUID specs use the terms &#34;variant&#34; and &#34;version&#34; a little funny; &#34;variant&#34; is essentially the revision (so all modern UUIDs have variant=0b10 to specify RFC 4122 UUIDs), and &#34;version&#34; is a 4-bit number identifying the sub-type within that variant:    UUIDv1 time-based
    UUIDv2 legacy DCE security thing, not wideley used
    UUIDv3 name-based with md5 hashing
    UUIDv4 randomness-based
    UUIDv5 name-based with sha1 hashing

This draft registers a few new sub-types:    UUIDv6 sortable time-based, Gregorian calendar
    UUIDv7 sortable time-based, Unix time
    UUIDv8 sortable time-based, custom time"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The problem of hash or NN based matching is, the authority can avoid explaining the mismatch.Suppose the authority want to false-arrest you. They prepare a hash that matches to an innocent image they knew the target has in his Apple product. They hand that hash to the Apple, claiming it&#39;s a hash from a child abuse image and demand privacy-invasive searching for the greater good.Then, Apple report you have a file that match the hash to the authority. The authority use that report for a convenient reason to false-arrest you.Now what happens if you sue the authority for the intentional false-arrest? Demand the original intended file for the hash? &#34;No. We won&#39;t reveal the original file because it&#39;s child abusing image, also we don&#39;t keep the original file for moral reason&#34;But come to think of it, we already have tons of such bogus pseudo-science technology like the dogs which conveniently bark at police&#39;s secret hand sign, polygraph, and the drug test kit which detect illegal drugs from thin air."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Given all the zero day exploits on iOS I wonder if it&#39;s now going to be viable to hack someone&#39;s phone and upload child porn to their account. Apple with happily flag the photos and then, likely, get those people arrested. Now they have to, in practice, prove they were hacked which might be impossible. Will either ruin their reputation or put them in jail for a long time. Given past witch hunts it could be decades before people get exonerated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do not know as much about perceptual hashing as I would like, but have considered it for a little project of my own.Still, I know it has been floating around in the wild.  I recently came across it on Discord when I attempted to push an ancient image, from the 4chan of old, to a friend, which mysteriously wouldn&#39;t send.  Saved it as a PNG, no dice.  This got me interested.  I stripped the EXIF data off of the original JPEG.  I resized it slightly.  I trimmed some edges.  I adjusted colors.  I did a one degree rotation.  Only after a reasonably complete combination of those factors would the image make it through.  How interesting!I just don&#39;t know how well this little venture of Apple&#39;s will scale, and I wonder if it won&#39;t even up being easy enough to bypass in a variety of ways.  I think the tradeoff will do very little, as stated, but is probably a glorious apportunity for black-suited goons of state agencies across the globe.We&#39;re going to find out in a big big way soon.* The image is of the back half of a Sphynx cat atop a CRT.  From the angle of the dangle, the presumably cold, man-made feline is draping his unexpectedly large testicles across the similarly man-made device to warm them, suggesting that people create problems and also their solutions, or that, in the Gibsonian sense, the street finds its own uses for things.  I assume that the image was blacklisted, although I will allow for the somewhat baffling concept of a highly-specialized scrotal matching neural-net that overreached a bit or a byte on species, genus, family, and order."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have to say, LÖVE 2d holds a special place with me because it&#39;s the first &#39;real programming game engine&#39; (as in language only no accompanying ide or such) I ever actually developed anything that I would consider a fully fledged completed program I made entirely by myself with.This looks pretty awesome and all but I can&#39;t see the benefits over something like unity or unreal or the amazing for the cost and features Godot.I really like Lua. I&#39;ve always recommended it to beginners or anyone curious about programming for fun over every other language. I&#39;ve used it myself extensivelyBut in this day and age, I can&#39;t really see recommendating this or even LÖVE2d anymore to anyone interested in getting into game programming.There&#39;s just too many high quality alternatives these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This framework is what I use for most of my hobby projects. There are some videos here: https://twitter.com/j_miskovI went through Unity and Godot before picking it up. I like LOVR because it&#39;s so code-based, with boring boilerplate parts hidden away. I&#39;m no artist and I prefer simple code editor to full engine IDE. The Lua API is easy to understand and remember, and even the framework code is simple to read and modify as needed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is cool, but I find it hard to find any use case for it. I did plenty of work as an indie game dev in the past, shipped and made money out of games based on my own C++/OpenGL game engine and also shipped a few indie games with some external indie game engines. Then I moved away from gamedev, but recently started playing around with Unreal engine again and was blown away by how much Unreal does for you. It felt like with Unreal engine, game dev is mostly about art and game design and not so much about programming anymore. Given game dev has become so much more competitive and harder to do than in the old days, and the fact that you can get a AAA game engine like Unreal for free (and only 5% royalty after 1-5M in sales), it doesn&#39;t make any sense to use anything else other than Unreal/Unity IMO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here, thanks for posting.Here&#39;s some more color on the reflection on comments, straight from the Linux Kernel documentation that capture my intention much better:&#34;Comments are good, but there is also a danger of over-commenting. NEVER try to explain HOW your code works in a comment: it’s much better to write the code so that the working is obvious, and it’s a waste of time to explain badly written code.Generally, you want your comments to tell WHAT your code does, not HOW. Also, try to avoid putting comments inside a function body: if the function is so complex that you need to separately comment parts of it, you should probably go back to chapter 6 for a while. You can make small comments to note or warn about something particularly clever (or ugly), but try to avoid excess. Instead, put the comments at the head of the function, telling people what it does, and possibly WHY it does it.&#34;[0][0] https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.h..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with almost all of these viewpoints. The comment one though isn&#39;t quite right.Sometimes you just need a comment. For example, I was writing some code to an API and the company was offering a private experimental feature. The API was JSON, but this one feature was enabled by adding a small stringified JSON object to a field of the larger JSON post body. If a developer looks at it, they&#39;ll think &#34;this must be wrong&#34; but with a comment that briefly mentions why, everyone will be saved some time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Know when to break the rules. For rules like &#34;don&#39;t repeat yourself,&#34; sometimes a little repetition is better than a bit of dependency.Glad to see DRY called out here. I&#39;ve seen so much crazy code simply to avoid breaking, The Rule."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So I was scratching my head for a good couple of minutes trying to figure out how this works, being familiar only with HTTP Response Splitting/HTTP Cache Poisoning.So it seemed that somewhere along the years while I haven&#39;t been paying any attention to websec, it became a common practice to send requests from different clients through the same TLS connection. And due to the non conforming way HTTP 2/1.1 interop was implemented by these webservers/load balancers request boundaries were not delimited correctly, making it possible to inject requests on behalf of followup clients.Fine I get the issue. Sounds like another &#34;good enough&#34; optimization that backfired.What is the solution aside from playing the patching wack-a-mole game? Should maybe a HTTP2.1 protocol work without a strict TLS requirement so that protocol downgrades aren&#39;t necessary to squeeze out extra performance (unless I misunderstand why the HTTP2/HTTP1.1 bridge was in place). Or is the problem that some application servers still don&#39;t support HTTP2 out of the box?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"@albinowax_, can you say anything more about how widely you have investigated the prevalence of the &#34;H2.X via Request Splitting&#34; vulnerability?Although all of your attack vectors are fascinating, this seems to be the one which is particularly terrifying. It seems like one single request can basically mess up user authentication across an entire website, and for every active user, until the server becomes resynchronized somehow. If I were running a large public-facing site or application, checking for this vulnerability would be my #1 priority this morning."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems most of the vulnerabilities here (at least, the first several that I read in the article) come at a point where an HTTP/2 request is transformed into an HTTP 1.1 request. So the insecurity seems to come at the point where a translation occurs and there is redundant information that can be handled in several ways, meaning that there&#39;s lots of room for bugs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been maintaining a spare phone running lineage os exactly in case something like this happened - I love the apple watch and apple ecosystem, but this is such a flagrant abuse of their position as Maintainers Of The Device that I have no choice but to switch.Fortunately, my email is on a paid provider (fastmail), and my photos are on a NAS, I&#39;ve worked hard to get all of my friends on Signal. While I still use google maps, I&#39;ve been trialing out OSM alternatives for a minute.The things they&#39;ve described are in general, reasonable and probably good in the moral sense. However, I&#39;m not sure that I support what they are implementing for child accounts (as a queer kid, I was terrified of my parents finding out). On the surface, it seems good - but I am concerned about other snooping features that this portents.However, with icloud photos csam, it is also a horrifying precedent that the device I put my life into is scanning my photos and reporting on bad behavior (even if the initial dataset is the most reprehensible behavior).I&#39;m saddened by Apple&#39;s decision, and I hope they recant, because it&#39;s the only way I will continue to use their platform."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember an Apple conference where Tim Cook personally assured us that Apple is fully committed to privacy, that everything is so secure because the iPhone is so powerful that all necessary calculations can happen on the device itself, and that we are &#34;not the product&#34;. I think the Apple CEO said some of this in the specific context of speech processing, yet it seemed a specific case of a general principle upheld by Apple.I bought an iPhone because the CEO seemed to be sincere in his commitment to privacy.What Apple has announced here seems to be a complete reversal from what I understood the CEO saying at the conference only a few years ago."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m really conflicted about this.For context, I deeply hate the abuse of children and I&#39;ve worked on a contract before that landed 12 human traffickers in custody that were smuggling sex slaves across boarders. I didn&#39;t need to know details about the victims in question, but it&#39;s understood that they&#39;re often teenagers or children.So my initial reaction when reading this Twitter thread was &#34;let&#39;s get these bastards&#34; but on serious reflection I think that impulse is wrong. Unshared data shouldn&#39;t be subject to search. Once it&#39;s shared, I can make several cases for an automated scan, but a cloud backup of personal media should be kept private. Our control of our own privacy matters. Not for the slippery slope argument or for the false positive argument, but for its own sake. We shouldn&#39;t be assuming the worst of people without cause or warrant.That said, even though I feel this way a not-small-enough part of me will be pleased if it is deployed because I want these people arrested. It&#39;s the same way I feel when terrorists get captured even if intelligence services bent or broke the rules. I can be happy at the outcome without being happy at the methods, and I can feel queasy about my own internal, conflicted feelings throughout it all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So if I understand correctly, they want to scan all your photos, stored on your private phone, that you paid for, and they want to check if any of the hashes are the same as hashes of child porn?So... all your hashes will be uploaded to the cloud? How do you prevent them from scanning other stuff (memes, leaked documents, trump-fights-cnn-gif,... to profile the users)?Or will a huge hash database of child porn hashes be downloaded to the phone?Honestly, i think it&#39;s one more abuse of terrorism/child porn to take away privacy of people, and mark all oposing the law as terrorists/pedos....also, as in the thread from the original url, making false positives and spreading them around (think 4chan mass e-mailing stuff) might cause a lot of problems too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s funny to see anyone here could find this acceptable. I wonder what&#39;s comments would be after Apple start to scan phones for anti-censorship or anti-CCP materials in China. Or for some gay porn in Saudi Arabia.Because you know in some countries there are materials that local government find more offensive than mere child abuse. And once surveillance tech is deployed it&#39;s certainly gonna be used to oppress people."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cuomo also sent thousands of elderly people to their deaths by forcing them back into nursing homes.And yes, I mean forcing.Do you remember the hospital ship?  The field hospitals?  Javits center?Did you know the hospital ship went home after being almost completely unused?  Did you know it treated IN TOTAL 182 people?  With a crew of 1200 and 1000 available beds?Did you know that javits center never even got remotely close to full?  In TOTAL in treated about 1000 patients and had 4000 beds.And yet he’s forcing these elderly back into nursing homes because it makes him look in charge, and fuels his idiotic feud he had going with the federal government over who was more leadery.  He won an Emmy for it!Cuomo should be facing prison.  The people who have been helping him cover up killing thousands of elderly people as a political play should as well.The fact that he was transferring state employees around so he could kiss them on the cheek and touch their face should get him disgraced and fired.  It is absolutely a distraction from the horror he has inflicted upon thousands of people.  Imagine him sending your grandmother to her death so that he could look good on television.  Absolutely evil."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt; Dani Lever — who had worked in Cuomo’s press operation since 2014 but left in August 2020 to join Facebook as a communications managerThis is the sort of hire that drives me nuts.  I&#39;m sure this person is a fully capable communications manager, but what Facebook really purchased was political access.  Is it no surprise then that long after beginning work she was doing favors for her former employer?  Maintaining a connection to powerful politicians might well have been in her job description.&gt;&gt; Prior to joining Cuomo’s office in 2014, Lever worked as a press assistant for President Barack Obama’s 2012 presidential campaign and worked in press relations at the Clinton Foundation, among other roles, according to her LinkedIn profile.Which is more valuable to Facebook: her skills as a &#34;communication manager&#34; or the fact that she probably has the personal numbers for half of Washington?After some quickly googling: she appears to be the daughter of a prominent NYC attorney, which might have something to do with her previous work, as a student, for NY&#39;s attorney general.  And for NYC&#39;s comptroller general.  I would have killed for such jobs during law school.  She seems to have bounced between them while an undergrad.&#34;Lever, who grew up in Quaker Ridge, graduated from [redacted] and the University of Wisconsin-Madison also worked for state Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, President Obama&#39;s 2012 campaign, and Clinton Foundation. She is the daughter of Joel and Debbie Lever of Bradford Road.&#34;https://scarsdale10583.com/about-joomla/the-project/5776-sca...I love that &#34;Bradford Road&#34; reference.  That is New England code for an old and well connected family.  (The implications of her highschool are just inappropriate and so I redact it.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The shocking thing about Cuomo is how blatant it all was. Not just the sexual harassment but his character across the board.This is a guy who wrote a book about his leadership in the covid pandemic during the covid pandemic. That&#39;s like Churchill writing his memoir of World War II during The Blitz.We ought to have a culture where someone who behaves like this is laughed out of the building."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s so irritating to be an American that has moved overseas. Basically the only country in the world that charges taxes on money you make and spend somewhere else, just because of where you were born. Thanks to IRS regulations, 90% of investment firms will just reject me outright rather than deal with the paperwork. Getting someone to help file my inordinately complex taxes costs thousands of dollars more than I actually pay in tax. I can&#39;t have a proper retirement account here since America doesn&#39;t recognize the local pension providers, so my government mandated pension is deducted from my salary here and then also taxed as income in the USA. If I ever want to leave, the IRS charges a small fortune for the privilege of not being a citizen too.I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a small number of rich people gaming the system, but for the vast majority of expats the citizenship-based taxation system is almost cartoonishly cruel."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting facts about renouncing American citizenship:- There is renunciation fee that has to be paid and currently stands at $2,350 (the highest in the world).[1]- A final tax return will sill need to be filed. [1]- An Expatriation tax is payable if [..] Your net worth is $2 million or more on the date of your expatriation. you will be treated as having disposed of your assets the day before your expatriation and will be subject to capital gains tax.- The highest capital gains tax bracket in the USA is 20% [2]Now there will be ways this is avoided but it would seem that the IRS is trying very hard make this process unappealing[1] https://www.expatnetwork.com/how-to-renounce-us-citizenship-...[2] https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/taxes/capital-gains-tax-r..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m an &#34;accidental American&#34; who has navigated this issue and it&#39;s incredibly easy. Just don&#39;t file. Every professional that writes blogs about this has a professional duty to give legal advice but the practical advice is just don&#39;t file. Look into what exactly triggers data to be sent to the IRS under your tax treaty and the policies of your financial institutions. Being &#34;accidental&#34; is the key here. If you tell your bank you aren&#39;t an American and you have a non-American birthplace and birth certificate they have absolutely zero way of knowing and your information will not be sent. If you have an American birthplace you can lie and say you renounced, but this carries some risk as the IRS maliciously publishes lists of renouncers so it&#39;s possible they could guess you lied. FATCA and FBAR are egregious violations of your rights. Not even the NSA has the right to spy on Americans abroad, but the IRS can do dragnet surveillance on American financial data from foreign countries with no probable cause and no warrants. You have a duty not to comply."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was doing research for something else and found this great anecdote about Kid Pix that I&#39;ve saved.&#34;Other product teams do not have the time or resources to work with children as often. In the case of Kid Pix, when it was first released back in 1989, Borderbund sponsored their first Kid&#39;s Day. It was a weekend testing day for 20 children to try out Kid Pix. Developers offered their testers cookies for a break and a crafts table with paper, glue, glitter, etc.--just in case the testers got bored. According to Broderbund employees, few cookies were eaten and almost none of the crafts were used. It was determined that Kid Pix would be a hit (Druin and Solomon 1996).&#34;"</p>

The company was run by a self-made millionaire who was notorious for scamming people.He&#39;d randomly lay off huge numbers of the sales team, and the first anyone would know about it is when the door code would be changed and we&#39;d have to ring the &#34;office manager&#34; (ex-SAS) for the new code.His grand idea to save the failing online learning platform was &#34;pivoting&#34; to selling personalised dog food online........... (and I mean personalised in the sense of just slapping the dogs name and their face on some generic crap dog food, not actually nutritionally personalised to the dog)Left that place being owed 3 months wages (which I never got).Last I heard he was being investigated for fraud. (this was the scum bag in question: https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/sep/04/barclays-sm...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is eerily similar to a job I had. I also worked for a young asshole CEO called Andrew, with multiple rubbish businesses, pretending to have more money than he had, having no idea what he was doing, and faced jail time a few years after I left.If you replace &#34;property market&#34; with &#34;education sector&#34; and &#34;UK&#34; with &#34;Australia&#34; we could have almost written the exact same article.I wonder how many of these companies are out there. Be wary of CEOs that don&#39;t bring anything other than money to the table. The more useless someone is, the more of a cunt they can be. Obviously this guy was struggling to pay his rent so he was going to take whatever job came up, but if you&#39;re entering startups and have the privilege of a bit of money in the bank and time on your side, try and pick the one with founders that are actually doing the work themselves. Look for some proof that they&#39;ve built, designed or sold something substantial, before you agree to do all the work for them. Because if they haven&#39;t even begun to do the hard yards themselves, they&#39;re not likely to respect any of your work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My first paid developer job was writing backend code for what I would later learn was the Canadian mafia. I was doing some backend and embedded work to build super shitty gambling kiosks for them. They already had some person &#34;managing&#34; project and the Indian contract house that was building flash games for the kiosk. He was useless, so I was stuck figuring everything out. Including getting things running on a then obsolete HP Itanium Integrity server with an old insecure version of Fedora on it. Plus figuring out how this was all going to work in the Dominican Republic where power was not a given at any particular time nor was connectivity. These kiosks would be scattered across 10&#39;s of casinos down there.Eventually things got weird, and I figured out that it was probably a form of scam against their investors. Since they wanted things very insecure and unlogged. Then they wanted me to come down to the DR and help with setup there. I bounced at that point, I was unwilling to give them that sort of power over me. They were in with the former president down there and I would have been at their mercy.10 ish years later I would hear from the &#34;manager&#34; again. He wanted me to help with an automated locker system. I helped a bit but once he begged me to go to an ATT store and recharge his prepaid phone I was done with him. (I did recharge his phone because I am a sucker for a sob story)If someone seems scummy, DO NOT work for them. Your gut is probably telling you something.That said, a good work ethic and a baptism by fire where you have to do everything can be an effective way to get your start."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The value of work is not in the work done; it&#39;s in the decisions being made. It&#39;s the ability to handle edge cases, to work your way through ambiguity, to &#34;unstuck&#34; a stuck situation, and to resolve tricky unforeseen issues.If you build a robot that only handles the main workflow and can&#39;t handle any of the exceptions, you&#39;re not automating anything; you&#39;re building a convenience tool. Basically, you&#39;re removing some of the labor part of the job, but still keeping the decision making part of the job for humans.This is both economically unviable and largely unpopular. You&#39;re not reducing labor costs by much, because you still need humans around. And workers lose control over their job, and have to &#34;work around&#34; the robot&#39;s limitations. Instead of being freed up to do more work, they become babysitters of machines that they have to oversee so it doesn&#39;t mess up everything.This is why partial robotic systems don&#39;t really exist; either it&#39;s a nifty tool that speeds up a small repeatable process of your work, or it&#39;s building the entire house."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The question I would have around automated building construction is &#34;why use bricks?&#34;.Bricks are great for humans to build with, they are just the right size and weight for the human hand to manipulate and place.  They are not optimised for machine manipulation.I would guess that if you wanted to automate construction you would start by making things like walls on an automated production line, then ship the largest practical piece to the construction site.  Once there I&#39;m guessing some automated cranes could move them into location far more easily than thousands of slightly randomly sized pieces of hard clay.Work out what problem you are trying to solve.  Do you want cheap construction?  then why choose a material that requires thousands of operations just to build a wall regardless of if it is a human or machine doing the building.  There are far more efficient building materials used every day... Just see how fast commercial buildings can be constructed and you can be sure that they are optimised both for speed of construction as well as (hopefully) energy efficiency and ease of maintance after construction.The problem seems to be people have a emotional idea of what a dream house is, an idea that is firmly stuck in the red brick house of 1970&#39;s sitcoms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you think bricklaying is a simple task, you&#39;ve probably never laid bricks, or likely ever worked a construction job.There is _a lot_ that goes into laying a brick wall. From excavation, base compaction, material choice, mortar composition and viscosity, wall type, overlap patterns, leveling, overhang patterns, set time, and much more. Using an incorrect overhang pattern for instance can allow water drops to fall and contact the relatively soft surface of bricks and destroy them in a few years. Having an incomplete mortar seal allows the elements to penetrate through what would normally be waterproof, especially in places with high wind. An improper excavation, compaction material or compaction of said material, improper leveling, and many more factors will lead to failure within just a few years.The best way to learn about this stuff is to go try it! One could volunteer for Habitat for Humanity or a local shelter that builds homes and get some time with the tools. None of this stuff is simple, straightforward, or easy, and there are a million ways to do it incorrectly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"While the article is correct, it omits most of the actual function of CUPS. Many printers are capable of accepting various types of documents directly over the network, with postscript, HP PCL, and PDF being commonly supported---and ASCII pretty much universally supported.The problem is that few printers support _all_ of these standards. Postscript, for example, is surprisingly complex to implement in practice, which leads to a lot of inexpensive network printers actually lacking postscript support. Further, printers are very slow at rasterizing, and so while support for PDF rasterization is very common you probably don&#39;t want to use it. You can easily see a minute per page for printing modest PDFs. In-printer PDF rasterization is also of very uneven quality, and I have seen issues like completely broken kerning in documents due to the printer&#39;s poor handling of embedded fonts.One of the key functions of something like CUPS is to address this problem: CUPS standardizes the format of all printed documents to something that is well-supported by the printer, and performs much of the rasterization ahead of time on the much faster print server. This saves time and improves reliability since you don&#39;t need to figure out if a given document is supported by the printer. For most printers these days some variant of PCL is the preferred language for jobs, as it&#39;s simpler and easier to implement than Postscript. It also presents fewer security concerns.Of course the other major problem CUPS solves is the management of the queue, including across multiple users. That&#39;s an important feature but not one that matters in a lot of home situations. That said, if you don&#39;t use a printing system you can and will run into annoying situations where you cannot print a document because you are waiting for the previous one to complete sending, which often gets blocked on the printer&#39;s memory space or rasterization."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hah. I had a similar moment of enlightenment with FreeBSD when somebody explained that you can just cat a wav file into /dev/audio (or /dev/dsp? forget the exact name). And that you can produce white noise by catting /dev/random to the same destination. With no barrier to the sound card like that, I was free to experiment with programming dfferent noise algorithms and figuring out how digital audio works. I eventually did things the proper way with OSS and finally sndio on OpenBSD, but direct, universal interfaces like files invite that initial exploration and help you get things done quick and easy.netcat is also a secret weapon around the house. My girlfriend runs macOS, but it&#39;s way more reliable to just nc files to each other over wifi than deal with all the cloud and airdropping bullshit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FWIW, the Internet Printing Protocol (and IPP Everywhere in particular) make printer setup in CUPS far, far easier, but distributors seem reluctant to encourage it.

Facebook was fined a record $5 billion as part of a settlement with regulators.That&#39;s a reasonable explanation for their action, right? Even if it&#39;s not 100% true, if you&#39;re a manager at Facebook, and the situation isn&#39;t 100% clear cut, you&#39;re still going to act, so you can show it as an example the next time the FTC tries to fine them.And they did offer an alternative:&gt;Clark said Facebook offers targeting data sets for political ads, and has suggested the NYU group use that information."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The debate on who has control over data typically creates two parties: the individual user who it is related to, and the corporation providing the platform or product.We ought to add another party: the public. Perhaps data should be able to be used for the public good, and we should be able to participate in deciding what data is collected and how data is used.In this case, having data about what ads are seen, by whom, and why they see those ads, seems like it could lead to us better understanding how FB and other companies algorithms are segmenting the population and how certain ideas proliferate within those segments. This seems beneficial to the public, since as we&#39;ve seen over the last 5 years or so, these platforms and the way they choose what information we see can have drastic effects on the economy, politics, etc. If I had a choice, I would choose to continue collecting data about the behavior of advertisers and the platforms that serve them for that kind of analysis. But we don&#39;t have a choice, because facebook &#34;owns&#34; that data.A number of people in this thread have referenced Cambridge Analytica. When Facebook does choose to share data with other parties, we have no say over what data is shared with them or what they may do with it. We don&#39;t even get a choice in how Facebook internally uses our data. Instead of democratizing the decision of what data is collected and how it is used, the FTC applied the rules of private property and fined FB for lack of privacy.The public got nothing out of that situation. Facebook now is more defensive of their ownership over our data, which also precludes us using it for the public good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; And finally, something that would, in my opinion, really add to the realism and historical flavor of a medieval-themed city builder would be the introduction of mechanisms in which agricultural surpluses are skimmed by the church and the feudal lord. Tithes, taxes and rents! Instead of merely abstracting the taxes into an income modifier or letting the player be the extractor himself, we could be shown the tax collector visiting the village, counting the sheaves by the side of the road, selecting the calves and chickens. This way, the experiences of our medieval forebears are visualized and may help to educate the public about medieval village life.This is the part that&#39;s most interesting to me. I always feel tax policy &amp; land use is very rarely explored in games; in most of these games if you can set tax rates at all it always seems to be a straight tax on productivity so you just have to pick the amount of deadweight loss you&#39;re willing to accept to generate the revenue you need to run your government. There&#39;s also very rarely any distinction between government spending and private spending, and how government spending on public goods influences the asset values of private interests. You could make an entire game about just that subject.EDIT: As a follow-up, I found this history of land &amp; tax policy in Denmark going back to the middle ages to be quite fascinating and might be a useful point of contact for this sort of thing: https://bibliotek1.dk/english/history/centuries-of-experienc..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would love a building game where you can&#39;t build roads. All of those building games so far allowed that, but I think it would be more fun to just allow for constructing building, and roads/pathway would form depending on their connectivity inside the production chain. I.e. you wouldn&#39;t connect your farm to a butcher, but pathways would form and eventually turn into street based on the amount people from dependent shops walking to it (also depending on terrain and usage of i.e. horse carriages)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hrm.  My opinion is that complete accuracy isn&#39;t all that fun.  Folks have used tax records to do analysis of, say, how many farmers it takes in a village for a blacksmith to be present, and so on and so forth.  It was a lot more than you might imagine.On the other hand, looking at the D&amp;D 3.5 Dungeon Masters Guide 2, they have finally fleshed out Saltmarsh.  Bizarrely, a town of less than four thousand people actually has an assassins&#39; guild, with roughly ten members.  Do they take turns, each assassinating one person a year?  Because that&#39;s roughly how infrequently it would have to occur for their little club to escape notice.  Hardly worth paying dues for, sitting around, discussing that murder you managed five years ago and how you look forward to one in another five.Take a look at city-building ... in most games you rarely see the hub-and-spoke develop around a port city, despite that being a prevalent pattern, or the unique feel of isoheight versus steep streets in a hilly region (the San Francisco pattern).  If you watch city maps over hundreds of years, many forces are at work, and I think they might be simulable but I don&#39;t know if the end result would be enjoyable enjoy to warrant it.If you look at our actual cave ecosystems, troglobionts, which are adapted for living strictly in caves, are typically quite tiny.  There&#39;s simply no food down there!  Resources are scarce.  Hence you would get no gelatinous cubes or hook horrors or carrion crawlers stumbling around the caves, lurking about, waiting for adventurers or the average bear.  Instead you get some very small, pale shrimp.  This is not exciting for the adventurer.  Some handwaving of a source of energy called &#34;Faerzress&#34; eventually takes place and is only vaguely acceptable if one does not look hard, serving as kind of a bottom trophic level for the game.The balance between actual plausibilty and what one might call &#34;fantastical satiation&#34; is quite difficult.  Your large-sized dragon, perhaps your standard-issue Vermithrax Pejorative, would need something like a log flume ride of virgins delivered straight to its gullet to sustain its bulk, not to mention the caloric expenditure.  Clearly, this isn&#39;t very satisfying for your story-telling, either.The balance is rough and I suspect that nitpicking in the name of accuracy can undermine most of what is constructed."</p>

Makes me sad that we can&#39;t have a calm discussion about the merits of the policy.From what I can tell, you might be opposed to this policy if:1. You have fears about getting a vaccine, moreso than for coronavirus. If this is you, do you prefer a mask mandate? And if so, how do you enforce this in a restaurant, where anyone eating takes off their mask right away?2. You have fears about the privacy implications. If so, what are those fears? Perhaps your vaccination status can lead people to make inferences about your health?3. You are not particularly concerned about the community spread of coronavirus (and the implications of that)There aren&#39;t a lot of choices. You can 1) avoid high-risk areas and escape infection/spreading disease, in which case, this policy doesn&#39;t really directly affect you. Or 2) you can take your chances with coronavirus, which you will get sooner or later, and spread it. Or 3) you can &#34;take your chances&#34; with the vaccine which, statistically and biologically, is safer than getting coronavirus and reduces spread.This policy allows people to choose from 1) and 3) but not 2), which is in all ways the worst decision. Unless, of course, you think that the vaccine is more dangerous than coronavirus. And then I don&#39;t really know what to say.(lightly edited for clarification)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Vaccine requirements have been in place for decades. 
For pre-K in NYC kids need shots for PCV and Hib.For kindergarten they need more shots: Hep B, Polio, Chickenpox, and Measles, Mumps and Rubella.Going to middle school? Then you&#39;ll need more shots, the TDAP and meningococcal conjugate.These are all vaccine requirements. Is it an invasion or privacy to demand children&#39;s records? Is it the nanny state? We could go down that road, but who wants to live in a world where we lose herd immunity to all of those diseases because 30-40% of people choose to opt their children out?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To preface: I got the vaccine months ago (as soon as I had access), I&#39;m a big believer in vaccines.With that being said, this policy doesn&#39;t sit well with me. None of the currently available vaccines in the US are FDA approved. Of course, a lot of people have received those vaccines, but I also don&#39;t necessarily fault individuals for feeling hesitant (the nuance here is that I think people ought to get the vaccine).  mRNA is a new, unknown technology, and the vaccine was rushed faster to public access than any other vaccine before. We have absolutely no idea if there are any long term side effects of these vaccines.Both candidates Biden and Harris expressed the need for full trials and transparency in regard to the vaccine before they were in office, then changed their tune after (see: https://twitter.com/pbhushan1/status/1416969060890210305).  Biden says:&gt; When we finally do, God willing, get a vaccine, Who’s going to take the shot? Who’s going to take the shot? You going to be the first one to say, “Put me — sign me up, they now say it’s OK”?If the vaccine is as effective as it seems, then this decision feels positively nanny state to me. It takes away an individual&#39;s agency to inform themselves of the risks on both sides and make an informed decision."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In case anyone is interested, this is what it looks like on Internet Explorer 5 in Windows 9x: https://i.imgur.com/g668yBy.pngWhat&#39;s happening is that the &lt;h3&gt; tags are all nested, since they don&#39;t auto-close in this situation, and modern browsers define the &lt;h3&gt;&#39;s size as &#34;font-size: 1.17em;&#34; which of course adds up over time. I&#39;m not sure how IE5 interprets the page. Maybe I can get an older embedded version of Firebug to check.I think it&#39;s important to not break even older websites even if they have totally busted HTML, but this is probably such a rare case that no one ever thought of it, and at this point it&#39;d probably be much more disruptive to try and &#34;fix&#34; it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The font-tags are getting unfairly blamed!The increasing size is due to the unclosed &lt;h3&gt; tags combined with unclosed inline level tags. This is parsed into a nested structure, with h3&#39;s nested into h3&#39;s deeper and deeper. The font-size of h3 is defined as relative increase, so the nested h3-elements get increasingly larger size.The effect can be reproduced with this HTML snippet:     &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;hello
     &lt;h3&gt;&lt;span&gt;hello
     &lt;h3&gt;hello

Which is parsed as:     &lt;h3&gt;
       &lt;span&gt;hello
         &lt;h3&gt;
            &lt;span&gt;hello
               &lt;h3&gt;hello&lt;/h3&gt;
            &lt;/span&gt;
         &lt;/h3&gt;
       &lt;/span&gt;
     &lt;/h3&gt;

Usually a h3 would be automatically closed when a new h3 (or any block-level element) is encountered, but because of the unclosed inline element (span in the above example) it is instead parsed as a nested structure. In OP it is unclosed font-tags which cause the h3&#39;s to nest, but it has nothing to do with the semantics of &lt;font&gt; per se, it is just because they are unclosed.So why did it look correct in old IE? I think this comes down to the built-in browser style-sheet. I suspect h3 is defined with an absolute font size in the IE browser style sheet which means nesting does not increase the size."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m kinda just pulling this out of the swamp of 25-year-old web design knowledge, but the unclosed code on that page consists of &lt;font&gt; tags, which are long since deprecated, and those font tags have size=&#34;2&#34; / size=&#34;-2&#34; attributes. I&#39;m pretty sure the old behaviour was that &lt;font size=&#34;[signed int]&#34;&gt; affected the size relative to the parent in the same way that CSS &#34;font-size:200%;&#34; or &#34;font-size:50%;&#34; would do. So nesting them doesn&#39;t create any new block elements, but it modifies the font size within a &lt;td&gt; or &lt;p&gt; relative to the parent. Just at a look, that seems like the explanation for the increase in font size, in this admittedly odd document.[edit] I believe the page would look as intended if each &lt;font&gt; tag overrode the prior unclosed &lt;font&gt; tag, rather than treating it as a parent, and that was probably how IE 6 interpreted it. In fact I think old browsers would auto-close &lt;/font&gt; if you wrote a new &lt;font&gt;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Printers. Yeah.Herewith, my standard advice.Buy a Brother monochrome laser with duplex, an ethernet port, and BRScript/3 (their PostScript clone). Even if you&#39;re sure you will never need one or more of those features, get them all. Wifi and Bluetooth and NFC are strictly optional, and probably not worthwhile.If you need color printing, send it to a printing company. There might even be a local one. It will be done at a higher quality, with better ink and good paper, than you can do at your office or house -- unless you are big enough to utilize a whole flock of printers, or you are a professional. If you are a pro, you don&#39;t need this advice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There should be a law that states for any subscription product I should be allowed to buy a fixed-term version with no auto-renewal. In the past two days I&#39;ve had the following experiences:  * Wanted to buy a Font Awesome &#34;Pro&#34; license for their icons. The only way to do this is a 99/year subscription. Reading the fine print says that I can buy it and cancel it the next day and still have lifetime access to the version at the time of my purchase. Why make me jump through the hoops?
  * I wanted to support a writer on Substack by subscribing for a year. But I can&#39;t, I can only start a perpetual sub. So I subbed and canceled 1 day later. Then I got a &#34;why did you cancel?&#34; email. I didn&#39;t really
  * I saw a cool open source project I liked and wanted to donate. They only had a Patreon link. Patreon only has recurring subs. So I had to email them and ask for their PayPal so I could send them $100.

I really wonder how much of SaaS revenue is people who have forgotten to cancel. I would guess 25% industry-wide."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t think that it&#39;s good to just delete the packages. Same goes for Android Apps in the Google Play Store or for Chrome Extensions.These compromised packages should have their page set to a read-only mode with downloads/installs disabled, with a big warning that they were compromised.This is specially troublesome with Chrome Extensions and Android Apps, where it is not possible to get to know if I actually had the extension installed, and if I had, what it was exactly about.Chrome Extensions getting automatically removed from the browser instead of permanently deactivated with a hint of why they can&#39;t be activated again, and which was the reason why the extension got disabled, is a problem for me. How do I know if I had a bad extension installed, if personal data has been leaked?This also applies to PyPI to some degree.----Eventually the downloads should get replaced with a module which, when loaded, prints out a well defined warning message and calls sys.exit() with a return code which is defined as a &#34;vulnerability exception&#34; which a build system can then handle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why our build systems don’t use public repositories directly, and why we always pin to an exact version. Any third party dependencies (js/python/java/c/you-name-it) are manually uploaded to our Artifactory server- which itself has no internet access. All third party libraries are periodically checked for new versions, any security announcements etc, and only if we are happy do we update the internal repo.It has been a bit of a challenge, especially with js &amp; node and quite literally thousands of dependencies for a single library we want to use. In such cases we try avoid the library or look for a static/prepackaged version, but even then I don’t feel particularly comfortable.I should really start specifying checksums too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems to me like one low hanging fruit to make a lot of these kinds of exploits significantly more difficult is protection at a language level about which libraries are allowed to make outgoing HTTP requests or access the file system. It would be great if I could mark in my requirements.txt that a specific dependency should not be allowed to access the file system or network, and have that transitively apply to everything it calls or eval()&#39;s. Of course, it would still be possible to make malware that exfiltrates data through other channels, but it would be a lot harder.I am not aware of any languages or ecosystems that do this, so maybe there&#39;s some reason this won&#39;t work that I&#39;m not thinking of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To chime in with my own anecdotal opinion that is likely to anger some people... in my experience most developers do their best work after about 6-8 months of starting a job at a new company, and that comes to an end after about 24-36 months of working at the same company. After that the vast majority of people just stagnate, get complacent, the job stops being interesting to them and they move on.After observing this I don&#39;t really mind hiring people to work for 2-3 years and then have them move on to another role, and most people I hire I do so with the expectation that I&#39;ll get a good two years of work and not much more.A very small percentage of people continue to improve over the long term, and those people I am happy to continue increasing their pay, but I don&#39;t really go out of my way to retain employees and I don&#39;t think it&#39;s particularly worth it to do so.This blog post mentions a kind of impact based compensation structure, and while I can respect the idea behind it, I am skeptical that they&#39;ve managed to find a deterministic and impartial way of measuring &#34;impact&#34;. I don&#39;t presume to have such a system so I pay based on what I observe in the market and let the market decide what the value is of software developers. For example, I genuinely don&#39;t know if software developers have more of an impact than the product designers, or the legal department even though I pay software developers much much more. What I do know is that it&#39;s much easier for me to hire a competent lawyer or UX designer than it is to hire a competent software developer and there are many more competent lawyers and designers out there... so I pay them less, regardless of whatever objective measure of impact may exist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t really understand this article, or the current trend of job hopping. I&#39;m from the generation where you have one job, maybe two, and that&#39;s it: I&#39;ve had 7, but I really only ever wanted one good job.For some perspective: when I left Intel circa 2010, I was a Senior Staff Engineer fighting to get promoted to Principal Engineer (followed by Senoir Principal, then Fellow, then Senior Fellow, hahaha). FYI I loved Intel for the first 10 years, and hated the last 12.I made $130k base salary, $70k typical bonus (EB+ECBP), and stock options (most of which were worthless). This was after over two decades there, started in &#39;88.Recently, a friend (12 years younger than me) was hired by Intel to work in one of the ML groups. He asked if the starting salary was fair: they offered him $400k. I was angry, jealous, and shocked. I have friends that are STILL there, grinding away at sub-200k base salary after nearly 30 years, and they are too scared to leave.So this idea of coders flitting from job to job just seems so alien to me. I&#39;m obviously from a different generation. I don&#39;t even know what I would ask for pay if I ever left consulting. Headscratcher."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The hard truth that many companies struggle to wrap their heads around is that they should be paying their long-tenured engineers above market rate.From an ethical point of view, maybe. From a rational point of view, maybe not.Jobs are &#34;sticky&#34; — it&#39;s a pain to apply for jobs, arrange interviews, deal with the possibility of getting rejected. And if you do get an offer and accept you will be leaving colleagues that may be friends, risk your position being less stimulating, have to move house and/or deal with a new commute.There is a very real salary range between &#34;low enough that I&#39;ll think about applying for other jobs&#34; and &#34;so low I&#39;ll actually start applying for jobs&#34;. Employers are aware of this and are paying salaries accordingly. It sucks for everyone in that salary band but — ethics and long-term viability aside — it&#39;s still the rational economic choice for employers. Every now and again someone will quit and get their deserved 40% increase, but many will delay leaving for years, or simply put up with it indefinitely, saving employers tons of money.Of course this may not be the case forever. It seems like recently the cohort of people who find interviewing and changing jobs more tolerable (the so-called &#34;job-hoppers&#34;) is increasing in size. If you happen to be a part of this cohort, then congratulations, you&#39;re winning the job-market pain-of-change-vs-salary arbitrage game and will enjoy above-average year-on-year salary increases for at least the near future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s a bit of a story behind this. Oculus is owned by Facebook, but the Facebook website and the Oculus headsets/software are by different teams working in different states. When Facebook bought Oculus, they decided to get rid of the Oculus-specific account system and use only Facebook accounts. The Facebook account requirement took effect with the launch of the Oculus Quest 2, which launched in October 2020.October 2020 was the month before the US election, and the peak of both disinformation/influence campaigns, and of Facebook-the-website&#39;s efforts to combat those campaigns. So the spambot detector sensitivity was turned up to max that month, and if you tried to create a new account, there was a large chance you&#39;d be mistaken for a bot and banned immediately. So a bunch of people who weren&#39;t Facebook users got fancy new VR headsets, tried to create Facebook accounts in order to be able to use them, and got immediately banned. The support department for Facebook-the-website was not at all up to the task of dealing with this. This kind of wrecked their product launch; instead of the press coverage and public reaction being about how great their hardware was, it was about all the people who couldn&#39;t use their hardware because of account issues.So now Oculus has a completely separate support department for Facebook account issues, which acts less like it&#39;s supporting a free website and more like it&#39;s supporting a $300 piece of hardware. And if you have an account issue with the website, and you want to use that support department instead of the bad one, then buying a Quest 2 is not such a bad idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FB had an internal help system called &#34;Oops&#34;. It was meant for employees to get help for friends they knew in real life. It was discontinued not long ago (EDIT: maybe not according to a child comment). There were just too many requests for help.Facebook has a corporate structure that simply will not prioritize any effort longer than 6 months unless a senior company executive (Mark, Sheryl) supports it. Even if it affects the bottom line - and there were plenty of examples where large customers could not spend significantly more money with Facebook because of software bugs - they won&#39;t do anything about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Utility services start off as luxuries, and are private and unregulated.  This was true with telephone and electric companies.  When these services get to a certain point where there are real consequences for not being able to access the system, they need to have public regulation to ensure access and customer service.  ISP internet service has definitely reached this point, and I think that there&#39;s a strong argument that Google &amp; FB accounts (particularly for businesses) have reached this point as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is more than a privacy disaster. It is so far so vaguely worded (maybe deliberately?) that the government can target everyone in the ecosystem with penalties:While the language is still evolving, the proposal would seek to expand the definition of “broker” under section 6045(c)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to include anyone who is “responsible for and regularly providing any service effectuating transfers of digital assets” on behalf of another person. These newly defined brokers would be required to comply with IRS reporting requirements for brokers, including filing form 1099s with the IRS. That means they would have to collect user data, including users’ names and addresses.The broad, confusing language leaves open a door for almost any entity within the cryptocurrency ecosystem to be considered a “broker”—including software developers and cryptocurrency startups that aren’t custodying or controlling assets on behalf of their users. It could even potentially implicate miners, those who confirm and verify blockchain transactions. The mandate to collect names, addresses, and transactions of customers means almost every company even tangentially related to cryptocurrency may suddenly be forced to surveil their users."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The downsides listed are just cryptocurrency lobbyist talking points.“Require new surveillance of everyday users of cryptocurrency;”What everyday users? There’s nothing you can do with this stuff except speculate, gamble and build obfuscated Ponzis.”Force software creators and others who do not custody cryptocurrency for their users to implement cumbersome surveillance systems or stop offering services in the United States;”Not offering these services seems like a positive outcome.”Create more honeypots of private information about cryptocurrency users that could attract malicious actors;”Losing your money to malicious actors is a standard part of the crypto experience already. Endless scams and ransomware don’t seem to worry the author.”Create more legal complexity to developing blockchain projects or verifying transactions in the United States—likely leading to more innovation moving overseas.”Ah, blockchain innovation, which is somehow so vital to the shining future of mankind, yet has utterly failed to produce anything of technological or economic value with the billions already invested. Overseas sounds like a fine place to continue this pseudoinnovation charade."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anybody who has followed cryptocurrency in the last year knows that major US financial institutions and hedge funds have become heavily involved. The regulations coming are entirely to do with making the legal burdens of individual custody onerous enough that users place their coins on completely centralized exchanges to manage legal risk, all so these institutions have access to these coins for manipulation purposes like borrowing for shorting. The ONLY regulation you will see is on the average user so they can suck up coins like Daniel Plainview drinking your milkshake, NOT on market manipulation or trading habits of institutions which is the key driver of malicious activity and harm in the cryptocurrency space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Because my engagement with unions has only been positive, I am interested in the amazing number of people who seem motivated to say how negatively they feel about unions. I get that in an oppositional sense, if you don&#39;t want what a union wants, then they tend to cast into the bad, but for the middle ground who are not VCs, owners, Managers, and are candidates for union membership, I find it really strange how much people cast them into a class of &#34;money grabbers for no benefit&#34;Do people feel the same about life insurance, car insurance? Its not that you actually intend being harrassed or sacked (fall ill, have a car accident) It&#39;s that you don&#39;t want to find yourself on the wrong side of an employment dispute (accident claim) without some insurance.Unions may be taking your hard earned money. They may be doing things which you don&#39;t like (do I love my car insurance company?) But, they have a neccessary role in risk management.We talk about risk management in the ICT sector all the time. Why can&#39;t we talk about risk management for labour hire?Amazon used &#34;dirty tricks&#34; to win this election. I am sure the Union bust some minor rules too, but overall I am reasonably confident that the vote was neither free, nor fair. I also do think there is no latent 100% pro-union vote out there, and that a large number of the polled workers don&#39;t want a union, or the cost of the union, or the risk of jobloss from Amazon if they join the union (which is illegal but still has a risk of happening) -So I don&#39;t for a minute believe a re-vote will magically reverse the signal with an overwhelming result.What interests me, is the basis for opposition to the union in the first place. Do people really think the garment workers in  New York were backing the wrong horse? Do people think the machineguns which Ford arranged to turn on a union march in Detroit didn&#39;t happen?&#34;oh, that would never happen now...&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congratulations to the Vue team, this is definitely a big win for them.Reading through the RFC is really interesting. They specifically call out the dependency on Facebook as effectively being React&#39;s Single Point of Failure, citing their negative experiences with HHVM.And for all of the love that people give React&#39;s big shifts (like hooks), the RFC specifically counts this against them, given that best practices have shifted so drastically in the last few years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like I&#39;m in an alien world when it comes to Vue - it has this weird pattern of making strings do loads of heavy lifting.The Github Commits[1] example on their documentation has a load of stuff that just doesn&#39;t sit right with me.Things like    v-for=&#34;record in commits&#34;

to loop over something is insane to me - this isn&#39;t code, this is a string inside a html attribute! How can you get any sort of good type analysis/variable checking/syntax highlighting inside this?Similarly, accessing properties like    :href=&#34;record.html_url&#34;

has the exact same issues - what if there&#39;s a typo here? My IDE can&#39;t highlight that this is wrong because it&#39;s *not code* and is just a string.Maybe I&#39;m just the odd one out here, but vue (and angular) love to use strings as a makeshift programming language, which to me is a major smell.^[1]: https://v3.vuejs.org/examples/commits.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d clap harder if Vue weren&#39;t so desperate to become React and focus on their own strengths. React certainly appealed to a lot of devs who at best disliked working with HTML &amp; CSS, but Vue welcomed everyone with an excellent gentle slope to gently move devs away from direct Dom manipulation and embrace reactive paradigms. Folks with small shops could now refactor their codebases with relative ease.If only the Vue team could understand, we don&#39;t want React features. We&#39;ll use React when we want them. We want Vuejs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"China is not &#34;smashing its tech industry&#34;. It&#39;s cracking down on private Internet companies that acquired too much power through network effects. This is completely consistent with CCP doctrine. Anything that central has to be state-owned.Xi declared this year that while digitization is important, “we must recognize the fundamental importance of the real economy… and never deindustrialize.” Right. China, remember, has a national industrial policy. It&#39;s expressed in the national 5 year plan, which is taken seriously and used to set priorities.What those priorities are is no secret. The current 5 year plan, the 14th, lists them.[1] Specific technology goals are in blue boxes.  Semiconductors, gas turbines, biotech, new energy vehicles, robotics, advanced agricultural equipment. Internet services are mentioned in the Plan. One key line section out here: &#34;We will strengthen the economic supervision of internet platforms in accordance with laws and regulations, clarify platform enterprise positioning and regulatory rules, improve the laws and regulations concerning the identification of monopolies, and crack down on monopolies and unfair competition. ... We will intensify anti-monopoly and anti-unfair competition law enforcement and judicial efforts and prevent the disorderly expansion of capital.&#34;If you think this isn&#39;t to be taken seriously, go back and look at the 13th 5 year plan and check off the completed items.[1] https://cset.georgetown.edu/wp-content/uploads/t0284_14th_Fi..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; China may simply see things differently. It’s possible that the Chinese government has decided that the profits of companies like Alibaba and Tencent come more from rents than from actual value addedExcellent observation, and I hope, for China&#39;s sake, that this is the reason.The United States is likely in for a long-term rude awakening when it finally realizes that an economy predicated on negative-value-add activities like clicking heart icons on photos, repackaging financial securities into products with impossible-to-detangle risk profiles, advertisement and addiction optimization, and political outrage, will not remain any definition of &#34;global superpower&#34; for long.Facebook and Netflix are excellent examples of companies that contribute greatly to our GDP whilst simultaneously draining our reserves of actual capital and mental health."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There are certainly those in America who believe that Facebook and Google produce little of value relative to the profit they rake in; maybe China’s leaders, for reasons that will remain forever opaque to us, have simply reached the same conclusion.Arguably, capturing most of your country&#39;s top talent with absurd salaries and putting them to work on world-critical challenges like... how to generate more revenue from advertisement or... how to create as many &#34;phone-addicts&#34; as possible... could be quantified as producing tons and tons of negative value.If China&#39;s crackdown on &#34;consumer-facing tech&#34; is about this, that could be a very good thing for China long term.I grew up wanting to work on NASA and putting stuff on space, and during university got offered 10x the NASA salaries at FAANG companies, and was to week to just say &#34;no thanks&#34;.10 years later I am starting to wonder what my legacy is going to be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My one and only Google interview went this way years ago.  Each round they&#39;d send me more books to study, which frankly I couldn&#39;t be bothered to read given the circumstances.My experience ended when an interviewer in round 3 or 4 asked me an obviously scripted question.  I answered sarcastically, he got peeved, and I never heard from them again.I&#39;m not claiming I&#39;m Google caliber, whatever that means.  Obviously I&#39;m not because I don&#39;t have the patience for their interview questions.To be clear, the entire question was:
What&#39;s not in a Linux inode?My answer was:
Lots of things...dinosaurs, the moon...The interviewer told me very matter of factly that it was in fact, the filename.I honestly lost all respect for the process, sorry Googlers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ah Amazon... 14 interviews, an additional 5 hour technical test, spanning a total of 3+ months. Only to be informed at the end that I was too technical for the role they had in mind but they were offering me a Senior Principal SDE role instead.By the time we got to the end of the process I&#39;d already concluded that the hiring process was a reflection of their internal decision making and that this was not a company (or department) I wanted to work for.Then I was hired elsewhere and I saw something similar happen to a candidate and realised that this was truly an indication of the indecision. We had lots of roles, just none shaped in a way that fitted the person, and what we should&#39;ve done is reject the person but on that occasion we hired and it was a terrible decision. They were a good person and very capable, but not a fit for the role finally offered. I had the sense that if I had accepted the Amazon role that would&#39;ve been true for me too.An interview process of more than 3-4 defined steps that takes longer than a month to schedule, is a bad sign.Top tip for candidates: Ask what the process is, if they cannot conclusively tell you then double down on interviewing at a company that can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What’s happening is that companies want to completely remove risk from the hiring process.In the real world, you cannot remove risk. You can manage it, but you cannot remove it. Asking candidates to go through 6 interviews before making a decision and not telling them when a decision will be made signals a risk adverse culture that cannot make decisions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For reference, I&#39;ve never seen the built-in Windows VPN protocols exceed ~70 Mbps in any scenario. Maybe it&#39;s possible with a crossover cable between two Mellanox 100 Gbps NICs, using water-cooled and overclocked CPUs, but not over ordinary networks with ordinary servers.I have gigabit wired Internet to a site with gigabit Internet. Typical performance of SSTP or IKEv2 is 15-30 Mbps. That&#39;s 1.5% to 3% max utilisation of the available bandwidth, which is just... sad.It&#39;s not the specific site either, other vendor VPNs can easily achieve &gt; 300 Mbps over the same path.It&#39;s a year and a half into the pandemic, there are record numbers of people working from home, and Microsoft is the world&#39;s second biggest company right now.Meanwhile, volunteers put together a protocol in their spare time that is not only more secure but can also easily do 7.5 Gbps!That needs to be repeated: At least ONE HUNDRED TIMES faster than the &#34;best&#34; Microsoft can offer to their hundreds of millions of enterprise customers that are working from home.Someone from Microsoft&#39;s networking team needs to read this, and then watch Casey Muratori&#39;s rant about Microsoft&#39;s poor track record with performance: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99dKzubvpKE"</p>

not a lot of effort has yet been spent on optimizing it&gt; Jonathan Tooker reported to me that, on his system with an Intel AC9560 WiFi card, he gets
~600Mbps without WireGuard, ~600Mbps with wireguard-go/Wintun over Ethernet,

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Now I feel old. I remember vividly running around with my first camera, looking for objects worthy of being photographed. The film cost money, so did developing it into pictures. I really had to weigh the pros and cons of taking a particular picture. And in a class of ~25 kids, I was one of three who owned a camera. Not that it was such a luxury item, but most people weren&#39;t into that.These days, (nearly) everyone carries a camera around all the time, and one that is quite probably much better than the one I had in 1992. They can take dozens, even hundreds of pictures without breaking a sweat, and it does not cost anything.Nostalgia is a very warped mirror. Back then, I did not miss the ability to take dozens of pictures at no cost, because the option did not exist. Was it better? Worse? Neither, I think. But this is the first time I feel old and appreciate it for the history I have lived through. Getting old is weird, but it sure is interesting. (For reference, I&#39;m 40. &#34;That&#39;s not old&#34;, I hear someone say, but I have never been this old before, so for me it&#39;s all new.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I miss more than anything else is having an attention span. Years of abusing social media has left my brain pinballing all over the place. I am a collection of unfinished thoughts. Even as I write this, I can feel my mind needing to latch onto something new."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">" The second paragraph is funny to me:&gt; I memorized phone numbers, jotted things down in notebooks, had conversations with taxi drivers, talked to random people at bars, wrote checks, went to the bank, and daydreamed.I did all of these (except the phone number one) in the last week.More than technological advancements or anything else, all of this nostalgia is really just about getting old.&#34;The human civilization peaked when I turned 12 and started declining when I crossed 25. I pity today&#39;s youth.&#34; – every generation ever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you look at the history of the Public Broadcasting Act [1] that established the CPB and eventually PBS, it seems clear that it was passed in response to poorly-funded educational programming not being able to compete with high-budget commercial network TV. Its authors wanted to make it easier for smaller, non-commercial entities to produce and distribute high-quality educational content.In that regard, the Internet (aided by inexpensive video gear and editing software) has succeeded far beyond their wildest dreams. The breadth and depth of educational content available just on YouTube is incredible.The same forces that make it easy to produce and distribute educational content also make it easy to produce and distribute misinformation. This is a problem, but&#39;s unclear how a &#34;PBS for the internet&#34; would solve it.For example, if you look at the one concrete piece of legislation mentioned in the article:&gt; The Local Journalism Sustainability Act takes a different approach to the government grant model. The bill would, for example, give a tax credit to people who donate to nonprofit newsrooms, or to small businesses who buy advertising at a nonprofit outlet.It&#39;s not clear to me why people wouldn&#39;t just choose to donate to or buy advertising in outlets that promote whatever form of misinformation or partisan information that suits their tastes.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Broadcasting_Act_of_196..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well there is:https://www.pbs.org/video/Also PBS has a great kids games app(s) that are free with games that are fun / no ads.And PBS kids video app is again free, great content, no ads.If you&#39;re in the US and care about that content, I suggest contributing to your local station.  The quality of the content from kids to adult is outstanding.   It&#39;s not usual for me to browse a few streaming services and just end up watching PBS&#39;s content in the end.Maybe when it comes to the article they mean more accessible?  But I&#39;m not sure as they seem to ignore the PBS content available."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would like to note that PBS does actually publish Youtube videos via PBS Digital Studios[0][1]. They have great creators making PBS quality content but in &#34;Youtube&#34; style formats with a wide range of topics (science, popular culture, art, food, news, and music).[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBS_Digital_Studios

These regimes can’t be bought with money, because some of them like Saudi Arabia and UAE have plenty of money.

Graphical artifacts, freezing, stuttering, and even full OS reboots.Sometimes I read this thread and scratch my head. I get enthusiasm for FOSS, but enthusiasm to the point of delusion? Honestly, Linux is not up to par with windows in terms of running games that are basically designed for windows.

Their permit was due to be renewed but due to the low quality of their environmental impact study the court was unable to determine if the mining might impact the local residents groundwater. So just a week or so ago a Swedish court decided Cementa muts cease mining operations some time in October. And as I said this mine/factory produces 75% of Sweden&#39;s cement.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My git productivity hack is `git diff --color-words`. Instead of showing the line-by-line diff, it shows only the words that changed. Especially useful if you have long sentences where only a comma changed or some other typo. With git diff, the two lines are shown, with --color-words, only the changed symbol is highlighted. The option --color-words also works with git show. I even made aliases for them: git cshow and git cdiff.Other than that, I recommend that people learn to use git properly. In my work, I often have problems with people overwriting their commits and trying to handle merge requests of commits where one commit message is &#34;did some updates&#34; and the other commit is &#34;some fixes&#34;. Getting to know git for an hour, may have prevented both issues. But I am biased, since I use git since my bachelor thesis."</p>

git switch -c new_branchIt&#39;s like they had a design meeting where they discussed this and said &#34;so  I propose switch -b newbranch to create and switch to a new branch&#34; and the objection was &#34;nah that would make it consistent with checkout, which is against the project policy&#34;"</p>

A few years ago a couple of students decided to make a contribution to GNU ls. The change was to have the output color independent of capitalisation (it is based on filename extension). Their code was accepted. It was a tiny tiny contribution, but it&#39;s probable that these few lines of code are and will be executed a few thousands times more than all other contributions my other students made."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Quite a few years ago as a (very) junior FE dev I used mammoth.js to automate the generation of a biennial report. Three months had been earmarked for the task as this is what it had taken in previous years (due to bad tools and lack of expertise). I had it done in less than a week by using mammoth. Mike was also very accommodating with questions I&#39;m pleased I cant remember as I&#39;m sure they were embarrassingly simple.The project still took three months as it was one of those special type of organisations, but it wasn&#39;t due to the HTML generation :)Thank you for mammoth.js!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Companies isolate devs from customers by using Product Managers. PMs interview customers and then decide what to build. By the time the tasks get to the dev it’s hard to understand the motivation and impact. The best companies I’ve worked at put the engineers and customers in close contact so they understood the impact and shortcomings in their work. Alternately you need to foster a culture of shared purpose where you have “faith” that your work has impact."</p>

I’ve had a lot of friends, mentees, and coworkers get huge bumps on total compensation even as relatively senior engineers and managers. Pay is jumping and companies aren’t doing a great job keeping that up for their people who have been around for a few years. As an employer, that should be the top worry, keep comp up, don’t lose your people because you’ve become complacent on pay and don’t understand that the market is changing right now"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An interesting corollary is that certain types of business are no longer economically viable. If I have a business that competes with advertising companies for niche talent, my business model has to be able to generate the same outsized returns on that talent if I want to be able to afford them, so this limits the work I can do.I don&#39;t think people should work for below market wages, only observing how it can change what kinds of products and services are available.

Don’t qualify for the jobs I see I think I’d enjoy, and don’t even qualify for the jobs that meet my salary preferences that I’d otherwise dislike. I also would have to be looking at immediately remote roles which just makes things harder. I also am about 90% I could not perform on interviews at most places. Digging myself out of the aforementioned stagnation and prepping for interviews is likely to take years at this point and who knows what the market will look like at that point."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The more project management tools I have to work with, the less likely I am to work for or with a company.I have a somewhat similar stance on software architecture. Sure, I’m TOGAF certified but if you actually expect me to work with notation correct Archimare/UML/whatever and not just draw boxes on a napkin you’re either insane or sell a product with no competition.This is anecdotal of course, but after 30 years of working with hundreds of companies to supply our municipality with software, we have yet to see a correlation between quality and “best practices”. It doesn’t matter if companies do this or that testing and use the full confluence suite or if they just pull spaghetti out of their asses and support is a phone call… the quality is the same over time, hell, often we get more from the spaghetti companies than the “best practice” ones. You might think that it’s a short term thing and that the spaghetti and no testing catches up, but it doesn’t. Maybe because we don’t have to fund those 8 people, that you never really learn the role off but it sure isn’t technical, that sit in on every meeting as opposed to talking directly with the spaghetti slinger and a sales person? I’m not sure, and I’d love to tell people that following this or that “best practice” is the way to go, but that’s just not what our data shows."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I still think David Allen nailed it in Getting Things Done. Not the system necessarily, but he nailed the diagnosis of why we fail to get things done: an inability to be honest with ourselves about (1) the full scope and scale of the commitments we make, and (2) just how little time and attention we have at our disposal in meeting those commitments.Really, it’s the same sort of problem that is described in The Goal and The Phoenix Project, but on a personal level. Calendar timeboxing feels like a solution that actually addresses the real problem, although it is challenging to implement for people who are low in conscientiousness (or have ADHD)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good. When we die, we will still have a giant todo list, and that’s OK. That doesn’t mean we haven’t done things, it just means the list didn’t capture the entirety of our desires and goals.Maybe the point of writing them down is mostly reflective; to contextualize them as much as possible and do the ones that we find most important by some unconscious heuristic. That means there will always be uncompleted things.Also we have to see when we itemize things to do, we also objectify ourselves as a doer of those things. Which is OK for making things graspable, but ultimately we are not mere doer of things, we are humans in an existential context.Maybe it is a good thing that we left todo items unchecked, maybe that is our protest against being reduced too much, maybe that procrastination is an attempt at gaining our humanity back, maybe that resistive Netflix binge has some unconscious meaning that needs to be honored."</p>

Most people don&#39;t have the income to support &#34;voting with their wallet&#34;, and even those who do don&#39;t always have the option.  IF the best solution out there happens to use single use plastic, you&#39;re not going to opt for a worse solution just because it doesn&#39;t.And even if one company cares enough to do something, they will change their tune when they have to start charing more.The only way this will get better is if the external costs of single use plastic are borne by the companies that make them and consumers are subsidized to absorb the extra cost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pre pandemic, I&#39;d go often to trader joe, and they would give samples.  It was maybe a small bite of a food (ice cream, salat, or whatever else), and use a plastic fork for it.Just one bite, and you had to throw it out. It was more plastic than food.  Whole Foods was the same.  I think it is a crime against environment and I started feeling bad about it, and stopped taking samples when there were plastic utensils.It think behaviour like this should be legislated out.  For something like a sample, just a small wooden  spoon, or anything else renewable, should be enough.The externalities of that plastic, is something that neither Trader Joe or Whole Foods pays, but we all do in some way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The pioneering 2015 study of marine plastic didn’t include illegal dumping and export of plastic waste. In the new analysis, the team considered those actions, but only for the U.S. They say data for other nations were inconsistent or didn’t exist.&#34;Doesn&#39;t this seem like it&#39;s saying illegal + legal plastic waste in the US is greater than legal plastic waste in other countries?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I’m always curious about is why we are so concerned with plastic waste.My local grocery store recently switched to paper bags. So I got curious. Turns out you have to re-use a paper bag 43 times for the energy use to be the same as plastic grocery bags. This is impossible since they are made of paper. Aluminum and glass bottles require several hundred times more energy to produce as well (between 170-250x).Then when you look at plastic pollution and see that for the most part North America is quite good at properly disposing of plastic you wonder why we are so obsessed with this as a problem.Plastic waste really isn’t a big problem unless you’re talking about developing nations. North America is responsible for about 3% of mismanaged plastic waste. Asia and Africa account for 86% of it.Don’t get me started on plastic straws. They make up 0.03% of plastic waste in the ocean.If we want to make a difference here we should be helping developing nations to better manage their plastic waste so that it doesn’t end up in waterways.The Yangtze and Ganges are releasing plastic into the ocean at a rate far greater than all of North America combined, and our response is to expend huge amounts of energy produced by fossil fuels trying to recycle our plastic instead of burying it in a landfill where it is unlikely to pose a major ecological threat.Like many environmental initiatives I worry that we’re more concerned about making ourselves feel better than actually solving the problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was thinking these days, that when I was a kid some 20 years ago, people were all the rage against paper, because you had to cut trees and whatnot, everything was switching to plastic so you could &#34;save the trees&#34;I still wonder what that was about, all it did was screw the paper companies that had their own private forests, and cause the stupid plastic patch on the pacific ocean, and now everyone has to switch BACK to paper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Pressure is also building for “polluter-pays” laws that would shift the cost of waste collection from taxpayers to the companies that make and use plastic. Earlier this month, Maine became the first U.S. state to pass such legislation… The American Chemistry Council (ACC), an industry group whose membership is dominated by plastics makers, says polluter-pays measures would hurt the economy.This is the kind of solution that seems to appeal to HN and appeals to me personally. It’s a system-wide incentives problem. So just change the incentives and price in the externality, right? Same goes for carbon taxes. I hope these kinds of laws catch on."</p>

I disagree. A lot of the &#34;fluff,&#34; as the author describes it, is excess capital finding its way to things people find pleasurable, whether it be dope, travel, beauty, or rock and roll. Purveyors of such pleasures have proved to be remarkably adept at creating &amp; providing these opportunities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The ultimate tool for corporations to sustain a culture of this sort is to develop the 40-hour workweek as the normal lifestyle. Under these working conditions people have to build a life in the evenings and on weekends.I slightly disagree with this point. The 40 hour work week is a rather recent development; in the past, people had to work a lot longer with no or only one day of. The trend actually goes in the direction of reducing it further (at least here in Germany), where 35 or 32 hour weeks are getting more common (depending on the job, of course). Plus, there are alternative models, such as 4x 10h days + 3 days off.Sure, the current model serves corporations, but it is by no means their invention. And while they are a big part of why it still is so large, the reason is most likely that they need the labor hours, not the specific consumption behavior."</p>

Regarding that benchmark article, I spent many years in academia, so the quality of content problem is familiar to me. In other words, I don&#39;t take such articles seriously.
CRDTs are fast enough, that is not a concern.[1]: https://github.com/gritzko/citrea-model[2]: https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.09511"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a meta-level, does anyone else think that the whole idea of writing a peer reviewed paper that is just a benchmark of different algorithms should be really rigorously reviewed before being accepted? Writing good benchmarks is hard, and so highly contextual that writing fair comparisons beteen algorithms (or data structures) is almost impossible unless you&#39;re an expert in all of the algorithms involved."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By the way, as someone who has published academic papers, if you&#39;re ever bothered about a paper or have some comments, don&#39;t hesitate to mail the authors. (Their e-mail addresses are always on the paper; especially target the first author because they have normally done the work.) We are happy to hear when someone has read our work and I at least would&#39;ve liked to have known if someone found a problem with my papers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"That&#39;s one lovely trick.If I may suggest one thing... instead of range requests on a single huge file how about splitting the file in 1-page fragments in separate files and fetching them individually? This buys you caching (e.g. on CDNs) and compression (that you could also perform ahead of time), both things that are somewhat tricky with a single giant file and range requests.With the reduction in size you get from compression, you can also use larger pages almost for free, potentially further decreasing the number of roundtrips.There&#39;s also a bunch of other things that could be tried later, like using a custom dictionary for compressing the individual pages."</p>

They&#39;re certainly not flashy, but they can be great quality-of-life improvements.And they&#39;re difficult to write! They require using APIs that are often woefully under-documented, and terribly difficult to debug. I wanted to write an app that would slowly lower your device&#39;s volume over time (so you could raise the volume for a song that you like, but then not accidentally spend the next 30 minutes with the volume super loud), and even doing simple things like listing audio devices and getting their names was endlessly frustrating."</p>

The 16 in this example is the &#34;block size&#34;, and could be anything. But this notion of expressing computation over blocks of dense data seems to be the big difference from other approaches.A very exciting result of the incredible performance that Triton achieves, is the ability to fuse NN operations such as Matrix Multiply + LeakyReLU + Batch Norm. Previously, you needed to rely on cuBLAS for fast hand-written Matrix Multiply kernels, and then your LeakyReLU would need to read that result out of memory, and then your Batch Norm would read the LeakyReLU out of memory again.The ability to write very fast kernels, and especially being able to fuse them together, to avoid unnecessary memory round-trips is a big deal!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was a cryptologic linguist for the army and went through a 16 month course of 6-7 hours of classroom instruction per day M-F, native speaking instructors, tons of immersion, and a couple hours of homework each night and left still feeling like I hardly knew the language that I was supposed to be interpreting. Unless your major in college is a specific language, you probably won&#39;t achieve any sort of fluency in your target language from taking a course in it, either.Language learning is hard and a multifaceted thing that no single application is going to adequately prepare you for. Speaking and listening are related skills yet speaking is much harder than listening, and both are much harder than reading (for the vast majority of languages). Rote memorization is necessary. Immersion is necessary. Comprehensible input is necessary.Language learning apps like Duolingo sell the idea of learning a language which is an extremely attractive idea to a lot of people. They also make it a fun activity and incentivize engagement with humor and gamification. The problem is that you can&#39;t possibly become fluent in a language with an app like it and there isn&#39;t any single app that will.I suppose in the end Duolingo&#39;s valuation is more a reflection of people&#39;s desire to learn a language rather than people actually learning a language, though."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I am an AI skeptic. I am baffled by anyone who isn’t. I don’t see any path from continuous improvements to the (admittedly impressive) ‘machine learning’ field that leads to a general AI- I share the skepticism towards any progress towards &#39;general AI&#39; - I don&#39;t think that we&#39;re remotely close or even on the right path in any way.- That doesn&#39;t make me a skeptic towards the current state of machine learning though. ML doesn&#39;t need to lead to general AI. It&#39;s already useful in its current forms. That&#39;s good enough. It doesn&#39;t need to solve all of humanity&#39;s problems to be a great tool.I think it&#39;s important to make this distinction and for some reason it&#39;s left implicit or it&#39;s purposefully omitted from the article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a confused and muddled post, trying to touch on psychology, philosophy, and mathematics, and missing the mark on basically all three. I&#39;m quite bearish on AI/ML, but calling it a &#34;parlor trick&#34; is like calling modern computers a parlor trick. I mean, at the end of the day, they&#39;re just very fast abacuses, right? Let&#39;s face it: what ML has brought to the forefront -- from self-landing airplanes to self-driving cars, to AI-assisted diagnoses -- is pretty impressive. If you insist on being reductive, sure, I guess it&#39;s &#34;merely&#34; statistics.Bringing up quantitative vs qualitative analysis is just silly, since science has had this problem way before AI. Hume famously described it as the is/ought problem†. And that was a few hundred years ago.Finally, dropping the mic with &#34;I don&#39;t think we&#39;re anywhere close to consciousness&#34; is just bizarre. I don&#39;t think that any serious academic working in AI/ML has made any arguments that claim machine learning models are &#34;conscious.&#34; And Strong AI will probably remain unattainable for a very long time (I&#39;d argue forever). This is not a particularly controversial position.† Okay, it&#39;s not the same thing, but closely related. I suppose the fact–value distinction might be a bit closer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What baffles me is the number of humans who think they are in the personal possession of some super special sacred form of magical and unexplainable intelligence. &#34;AI is just stats&#34; yes, indeed, but so is human intelligence. In many ways, AI from 2010 was already better than human intelligence.Three remarks:- The task many people seem to be benchmarking against is not just a measure of general intelligence, but a measure of how well AI is able to emulate human intelligence. That&#39;s not wrong, but I do find it amusing. Emulating any system within another generally requires an order of magnitude higher performance.- The degree to which human intelligence fails catastrophically in each of our lives, on a continuous basis, is way too quickly forgotten. We have a very selective memory indeed. We have absolutely terrible judgment, are super irrational, and pretty reliably make decisions that are against our own interests, whether it&#39;s with regard to tobacco use, avoidance of physical exercise, or refusal of life-saving medications or prophylactics. We avoid spending time learning maths and science because it&#39;s not cool, and we openly display pride in our anti-intellectual behaviours and attitudes. We&#39;re all incredibly stupid by default.- AI researchers need to work more closely with neuroanatomists. The main thing preventing AI from behaving like a human is the different macro structure of human NNs vs artificial NNs. Our brains aren&#39;t random assortments of randomly connected neurons: there&#39;s structure in there that explains our patterns of behaviour, and that is lacking in even the most modern AI. We can&#39;t expect AI to be human if we don&#39;t give it human structures."</p>

For our everyday workhorse typeface, we exchanged Roboto for Inter.

It looked good and it was widely available free of charge. Tack själv, Rasmus!

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It’s a really powerful article, and it’s hard to argue with any of it. What a nightmare it must be to have what happened to Amanda Knox happen to you. A totally innocent person, who was not only imprisoned for years for a crime she had nothing to do with, but also had her name dragged in the mud by the global press for years. To such an extent that most casual observers still think she had something to do with the crime.It’s clear that the filmmakers have no legal obligation to Knox (and she acknowledges as much in the article), but I think it is equally clear that they have a moral obligation to not slander her using a thinly veiled fictional character.It’s a shame too, because the real “Amanda Knox saga” would make for a much more interesting movie: what is it like to have your roomate murdered, your life destroyed, and your identity robbed from you by the global tabloid press? That’s the real Amanda Knox story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fascinating article.  I thought she was exaggerating when she complained about people accusing her of being a media whore, until I scrolled down to the [flagged] [dead] and saw someone doing just that.But I don&#39;t think she has a choice.  In the past, it would&#39;ve been possible for someone in her shoes to choose obscurity.  In the past, the real Amanda Knox and the idea of Amanda Knox that exists in the collective unconscious of the media and media consumers would&#39;ve drifted apart.  Now, it&#39;s hard to imagine how that could happen.  Even if she invented a new identity and moved to a small town in Alaska (which would be a new kind of prison sentence in some ways), it&#39;d be newsworthy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to me how the truth got lost, and how uninterested people are in the aftermath.  The real killer ended up with a sentence almost half the length of what Amanda Knox got.  And he is already out of prison.  Italy&#39;s justice system is very different from the US&#39;s, for better or worse."</p>

If Amazon continues to grow at current rates, it will surpass Walmart&#39;s figure within 2 years.Looking at these figures, it&#39;s evident that these three entities are far larger, wealthier, more connected, and likely more powerful than the vast majority of US cities, the vast majority of small countries in the world, and maybe even a few smaller US states."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not sure why everyone continually romanticizes brick and mortar retail. Its terribly inefficient, and wasteful of time, energy, space etc.Think of all the Walmart, Dicks, Big Lots parking lots and strip malls that could be converted into better space. Think of how much waste there is when you have to pack, unpack, stage and repack merchandise.Amazon’s distribution is a superior business model which is why it is popular. I’d also reckon that the carbon footprint per package is lower if you account for the driving that is required for more traditional shopping.I’d rather see more competition using a similar business model than a return to concrete strip malls full of big box retailers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author of the referenced blog (and library) here. This is great!The full text search engine in SQLite is sadly not really good for this - one reason is that it uses standard B-Trees, another is that it forces storing all token positions if you want BM25 sorting, which is a huge overhead for articles as long as Wikipedia&#39;s.But that doesn&#39;t mean full text search isn&#39;t possible in a very efficient manner with statically hosted data! I wrote a proof of concept of making the Rust-based tantivy library work in the same way, which has a lot of internal things that can make the index much smaller and more efficient than SQLite&#39;s. It&#39;s also &gt;10x faster in creating the search index.Here&#39;s the demo also for Wikipedia: https://demo.phiresky.xyz/tmp-ytccrzsovkcjoylr/dist/index.ht...
I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s more efficient than the SQlite version in this form, but it definitely has more upward potential and is more fun to work with.And the corresponding draft PR: https://github.com/tantivy-search/tantivy/pull/1067I sadly haven&#39;t gotten around to working on it more and writing an article about it.Other people are also working on using this stuff to make Sci-hub and LibGen more available by using this in combination with IPFS for distributed and &#34;uncensorable&#34; hosting which is pretty awesome.Edit: Just realized that the OP demo only searches in article titles, while mine searches in full article contents by default. You can search in only the titles in my demo by querying `title:harry title:potter`"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The new particle contains two charm quarks and an up and a down antiquark. Several tetraquarks have been discovered in recent years (including one with two charm quarks and two charm antiquarks), but this is the first one that contains two charm quarks, without charm antiquarks to balance them.This is not the first time a tetraquark has been measured, but instead it&#39;s the first time a tetraquark with two charm quarks and no charm antiquarks. That&#39;s still nice work, but I was initially confused by the headline (&#34;didn&#39;t they discover those already?&#34;)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Quarks are the fundamental building blocks from which matter is constructed.&#34;I sometimes wish would include &#34;In our current model&#34;,
&#34;We now think that&#34;, or some other qualifier.Such absolute statements have been made frequently prior to our current understanding.I have no special knowledge to lead me to believe that quarks are not the end all of parties.But I was happy with atom being the fundamental thing, 
and then electrons, neutrons, protons were the thing as well.The other day I read about Fractons &#34;quasiparticles or Partial Particles&#34;, so now I have to figure those out as well.I have lost track if the graviton has been found yet.
I dont think it has.From a purely layman&#39;s sense of esthetics the current model for particle physics is messy and a little spooky.I have an odd hobby.
I collect old paper encyclopedias from pre 1970
For every language that I speak.  
It takes up MASSIVE amounts of space.The oldest I have been able to acquire on a limited budget
Is 1880.It is always fun to track concepts over time.They all state what the world is like, and how it works as bombastic facts.Yet over time, most of it gets replaced or at least highly refined
and things are removed.Particle physics is an active field with much still to learn or figure out.
Let us keep that in mind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"We&#39;ve gone full circle - CSS components to inline CSS-in-HTML back to CSS components.But I actually think I will use this. A big problem with CSS is that you end up making overrides no matter how composable you make the classes. And some simple things (e.g. responsiveness) are unintuitive and / or annoying to do in CSS. Hence Tailwind&#39;s &#34;CSS-in-HTML&#34; mini classes. But that doesn&#39;t fill the core purpose of CSS, bigger general-purpose classes to avoid repetition. Combine the two (general classes + mini classes for slight case-by-case fixes) and you get the best CSS experience I&#39;ve seen so far (at least I think, I haven&#39;t tried it yet)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not saying this is ugly but the visual execution of some of these components is poor. No good usage of padding in some examples, poor ratios between the typography and the containers, inconsistent use of different line widths and border radius, weird and incosistent design choices in spacing and proportions…I mean. This looks alright and it will certainly make any UI look pretty decent, but the execution is not superb like the actual TailwindUI library which is incredibly well thought from a visual design perspective. Those components are perhaps less shiny than these but they are incredibly functional and way more intentional.This is a good effort though and I hope to see it improving."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ok, I&#39;ll guess I&#39;ll be the lone voice of dissent here. I don&#39;t like it. I think it goes against the concept of utility classes / functional CSS. As soon as you start making component-level classes, things begin to become opinionated and you lose the universality.My understanding of the functional CSS approach was that you&#39;d make a button component, and use the variety of &#34;atomic&#34; classes to style it. If you&#39;re using a &#34;btn&#34; class etc, it muddles the distinction of where the semantics live, and things get harder to reason about / debug."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Beautiful. The nostalgia hit me very hard with this.I remember in the original version you had all sorts of options, and could even combine screensavers.For people who may not remember: screensavers used to be a neccessity as old CRT tubes would &#39;burn in&#39; an image if they held it static for too long - leaving a shadow of the static image permanently. Screensavers kicked in after a few minutes and displayed something dynamic so as to save your screen from burn in.In the 90&#39;s, having a cool custom screensaver was cool (around the same time that having a custom ringtone on your 3210 was cool), and you&#39;d pay money for software like After Dark."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://uxfactor.ca/1151/I know one of the authors of Flying Toasters and sent him the link. Here&#39;s what he had to say:&#34;It&#39;s a rough approximation, which is super cool, but misses all of the nuance.&#34;You see, back in the day, there were very strong competitors to After Dark that had as much or more animations. The thing that set After Dark was a &#34;je ne sais quoi&#34; that felt like an elevated experience. Both the customers &amp; the competitors thought this was some sort of accident, or that the animations were important, but neither of these things was true.&#34;The secret was that people loved the nuance of interacting with the product (&amp; subtlety in the animations) and it was very carefully designed with cognitive science. I pushed the team very hard before I would let anything be released because I insisted on the nuance.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was a kid in the 90s learning to program, writing screen savers was one of the best ways to demo your &#34;skills&#34;. Also just something creative to do when you didn&#39;t really have a project in mind. I still think they&#39;re an underappreciated art form, and it&#39;s kind of disappointing that OSX only ships with a couple really basic ones. Apple should bundle in all the AfterDark modules (there were several releases).There was also an amazing set of screensavers which I don&#39;t remember the name of, but one of the set was called &#39;kaos&#39;, and a lot of them were based on fractals. If anyone recalls the name of that software...[edit] I found it! DarkSide of the Mac by Tom Dowdy. Brilliant. http://poubelle.com/DarkSideDocs.html"</p>

I&#39;ve had a home office.  I&#39;ve worked from bed.There are tons of good ways to do it.Lately I swap between a kitchen table and a chair on my porch. I no longer use multiple screens, I&#39;ve just gotten really fast at swapping windows on my 15&#34; laptop; I&#39;ve gotten good at figuring out how wide my terminal window breaks should be and where my browser dev tools should sit.Surely there are more optimal ways of doing stuff.  Odds are that there is a Taylorist approach that would pull more productivity out of me.  But much like my typing speed (~50WPM) isn&#39;t really the limiting factor in my programming skill, screen real estate isn&#39;t a big factor in getting stuff done for me.But the big thing for me is that, in the end, it&#39;s fine for me to switch stuff up on a monthly or quarterly or yearly basis.I could never have done that when I was in an office.  I couldn&#39;t take 20 min and play banjo or accordion and come back to my problem with a fresh eye.  I couldn&#39;t put on my laundry and hang it up while I listen to other folks on the daily stand up.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"For the past 2 weeks, I&#39;ve been working from a treadmill. It has been incredible. I got a small under-the-desk treadmill for my standing desk and I walk at about 2.5km/hour and get around 20,000 steps in per day. It has improved my mood, my clarity, and also has improved my sleep (because I&#39;m tired of walking). I also find it easier to focus on tasks for some reason.If you can make a setup like this work for you, I highly recommend it. Your body will thank you in the long run.EDIT&gt;&gt; A few of you are asking about the model. I actually bought 2, one for myself and one for my partner, who also loves it.This one is mine https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07V7F8QYK. I got it when it had a $100-off coupon, so the price wasn&#39;t as steep. No real complaints so far, except you can&#39;t store it upright. I just roll it out of the way when I want to sit.The one for my partner is https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0895DRWVY. She likes it. It&#39;s a little smaller and can be stored upright and out of the way, which is nice. There have been complaints about the remote (and it only comes with 1), but the manufacturer claims to ship new remotes free of charge if yours breaks.They&#39;re both a little quirky with a very simple LCD screen. Supposedly mine has an app integration for step counting, but I just use my phone in my pocket. They both get the job done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Survey seems pretty flawed and potentially biased. The survey was done by a contractor/home improvement company so maybe they used customer&#39;s as their population?While SWEs might need/want a good desk setup, many office jobs just don&#39;t need it. I&#39;m not sure people are really improvising but rather find sitting with a laptop is how they normally work anyway.And working in the bedroom can be misleading... it&#39;s often a private place you can put a proper desk.I WFH and went from living alone to having 3 roommates who all WFH. I have my bed, desk, and theater setup all in the (master bedroom). It&#39;s actually better than a 1bdr apartment, it&#39;s quieter (no leafblowers!) and I don&#39;t have dirty dishes right behind me.I have a small desk but a 4K 32&#34; monitor and a vertical 1080p one. A microphone on an arm and NO webcam; I use screen sharing 90% of the time but I don&#39;t need to see peoples faces. (I really wish video calling didn&#39;t compress &gt;1080p screens so much). If I need a webcam, I use my laptop.Maybe the pandemic changed things but you could get decent chairs for $20 at goodwill.I guess I&#39;m just skeptical that a majority of people have difficulty working from their home... You know the place you live and pick your own furniture."</p>

That was the one where the cats were showing up dead all over the tavern floor, and it turned out they were ingesting spilled alcohol when they cleaned their paws.I think that bug explains very well just how deeply complex Dwarf Fortress really is.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Making the item system polymorphic was ultimately a mistake, but that was a big one.Q: Why was this was a mistake?A: When you declare a class that’s a kind of item, it locks you into that structure much more tightly than if you just have member elements. It’s nice to be able to use virtual functions and that kind of thing, but the tradeoffs are just too much. I started using a “tool” item in the hierarchy, which started to get various functionality, and can now support anything from a stepladder to a beehive to a mortar (and pestle, separately, ha ha), and it just feels more flexible, and I wish every crafted item in the game were under that umbrella.We do a lot of procedural generation, and if we wanted to, say, generate an item that acts partially like one thing and partially like another, it’s just way harder to do that when you are locked down in a class hierarchy.Preach:https://ericlippert.com/2015/04/27/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/04/30/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/05/04/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/05/07/wizards-and-warriors-part...https://ericlippert.com/2015/05/11/wizards-and-warriors-part...I have certainly committed all of these sins, too."</p>

More importantly, does everyone actually believe that they can be easily manipulated, or do they just think that everyone else is so easily manipulated, but somehow they&#39;re above the fray?And at what point does the censorship to protect me from manipulation become manipulation itself?Facebook is fighting a losing battle if they think they will survive a battle with their own users. This is way past censoring Alex Jones. You can&#39;t possibly censor every crackpot conspiracy theorist. Actually, we&#39;re probably all crackpot conspiracy theorists in some way. We probably all believe some conspiracy about 9/11 or the NSA or elections or vaccines or masks or aliens or royal families or whatever.The rate of censoring is almost certainly accelerating faster than facebook&#39;s growth, and once you&#39;ve been censored once, you&#39;re likely to radically curb your use of that platform. I can&#39;t imagine that FB doesn&#39;t have stats on how many people keep using FB after they&#39;ve been censored just once.FB only works when you and 99% of your social group are on there.And the network effect works in reverse, too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I cut my teeth on Diablo, and played Diablo II for probably fifteen years after its release off and on as a way to stay connected with a friend who loved it similarly. More recently, I have consistently played Starcraft II since its release and enjoy a sense of mastery over that game unparalleled by my experience in any other.I haven&#39;t purchased new Blizzard products since the Hong Kong censorship debacle[1] and quit playing Hearthstone at that time. However I had still played some of my other old favorites, reasoning that I was not providing them further financial support. The recent announcements about their terrible, sexist culture had challenged that notion for me, and I was not sure what to do.This news is the straw that breaks my back. That Activision/Blizzard would double down on their despicable behavior and stance in this way is completely beyond the pale, and I for one will never again fire up those games that I loved so much.Thanks for ruining that for me, Blizzard.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blitzchung_controversy"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Steve Jobs quote on why Xerox failed [1] strikes again. The finance people have taken over Acti-Blizzard and they&#39;ve been coasting for 10+ years on their original franchises. All we have is annual CoD releases and Blizzrad coasting on their old properties where Blizzrd hasn&#39;t had a significant original release in 10+ years.This effort seems like it&#39;s part of the ruthless approach to controlling costs that slowly strangle a company from within.I believe WoW is the #2 property (after CoD) at Acti-Blizzard and it&#39;s clearly changed from one of delivering a game to simply extracting as much money as possible from each customer much like how almost all mobile games do.The state of California&#39;s complaint is bad. I mean really bad. The fact that 3-4 different people from AB all released different statements in the last week should tell you exactly how bad it is. That&#39;s classic panic mode. There should only be one.This latest move tells you the company believes it will blow over and they&#39;re looking to do the minimal required to appease the detractors and get back to business as usual without having to pay people more or pay out a bunch of lawsuits.Honestly, the heads of J Allen Brack and Bobby Kotick in particular should roll over this lawsuit.[1]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NlBjNmXvqIMEDIT: commenters have noted (correctly) that I overlooked Overwatch. This was a significant release but it seems to also have waned in popularity and Overwatch 2 is inextricably going in some weird PVE direction.Other than that you have a poor received Diablo sequel, a series of lackluster to bad WoW expansions, a disastrous Warcraft 3 remaster and complete abandonment of the RTS genre that propelled them to success in the first place.WC3 Reforged (&#34;Refunded&#34;) was significant in that it was not only underwhelming and plagued with problems it made the original game worse with a forced download and loss of functionality.The most significant change however was Blizzard not wanting a repeat of missing the MOBA boat with Dota 2 by adding a condition that all the IP for third-party maps belong to Blizzard, completely killing that ecosystem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Clickbait title for a highly opinonated piece that would never see the light of day in a respectable publication like the Washington Post, WSJ, NYT, Economist, etc. WilmerHale is a well-known top-100 law firm with a long history -- it&#39;s definitely not a &#34;notorious union-busting firm.&#34; I&#39;m flagging this story because it doesn&#39;t belong on the front page of HN, IMHO."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No relation to the link, but does anyone else remember these books?Algebra the Easy Way - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6781.Algebra_the_Easy_Wa...Trigonometry the Easy Way - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/2077099.Trigonometry_the...Calculus the Easy Way - https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3074478-calculus-the-eas...I read these in 5th grade or so and learned most of middle school and high school math just from those.They&#39;re written as a fantasy novel in which the characters discover the relevant math concepts as part of the story. I know, you&#39;re thinking that&#39;s a silly gimmick and it can&#39;t possibly be any good, but it was actually done quite well. At least until the later parts of Calculus where the situations have to get pretty contrived.Highly recommended, at least for precocious kids who like math and fantasy novels."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Speaking of books about calculus, I like Robert Strichartz&#39;s The Way of Analysis. Robert develops intuition and motivation of key concepts in an amazingly detailed way. He often starts with an intuitive but flawed idea, and then gradually revises the idea to a mature definition or proof. The whole book focuses on &#34;why&#34;: why real numbers are defined that way, why limit uses the delta-epsilon notation, why we need to topology, etc and etc. Reading the book is more like an adventure than following a set path. The author explains his approach eloquently: &#34;Mathematics is more than a collection of theorems, definitions, problems and techniques; it is a way of thought....My goal in writing this book is to communicate the mathematical ideas of the subject to the reader. I have tried to be generous with explanations....I believe that what you learn through a process of struggle is more likely to stick with you than what you learn without effort....Understanding mathematics is a complex process. It involves not only following the details of an argument and verifying its correctness, but seeing the overall strategy of the argument, the role played by every hypothesis, and understanding how different theorems and definitions fit together to create the whole. It is a long-term process; in a sense, you cannot appreciate the significance of the first theorem until you have learned the last theorem.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When learning Calc, I always appreciated anyone who could teach the main points without slipping into formal textbook descriptions and terminology. The more advanced one gets in Math, (eg, your teacher or professor with an advanced Math degree), the more they tend to do it, even of they try not to.I like this text - reminds me of &#34;the complete idiot&#39;s guide to calculus&#34; which I used as a companion to my Calc textbook (Stewart) when learning. Not sure I would have faired as well without it.https://www.amazon.com/Complete-Idiots-Guide-Calculus/dp/002...It gives a great and sometimes humorous understanding, which formed a nice framework when I moved on to Vector Calc, Differential Equations, etc later on. At that point in your math career, you can&#39;t (or shouldn&#39;t try to) rely on mindless algorithms/processes to solve problems like you may have in high school. You&#39;ve got to understand what you&#39;re doing.Ps, I doubt many on HN really needed to hear that, but it may be a useful note for somebody."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a VIM-only dev, spend all my day in a Tmux session, and I use the command-line probably a lot more than average.The single best improvement to my command-line workflow I&#39;ve done in the last few years has been switching shells. First I moved from Bash to ZSH, but about 2 years ago I switched again to Fish.Why I love it:
- history completion searches by default, so I can just type part of a command, hit arrow-up and look through only the relevant results (ZSH also did this, but Fish is better)- tab completions are shown to you in advance (in light gray in front of your cursor)- Basic configuration (which is good enough, honestly) can be done via a web browser. Just run &#34;fish_config&#34;, and it starts a web server, pops open your browser and any changes you make there are saved to your actual config files. No more looking up syntax.- aliases (which are called abbreviations) are actually expanded after typing, so the full command appears in your history. You can also edit the full command before running it, if you need."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I just want my own office. That&#39;s all. I&#39;d be pretty okay with going in if I had my own office with 4 walls.First job of my career, they told me I would have an office of my own. First day I come back do for full time (I had interned there too with my own office), they tell me they&#39;re switching buildings to go open office in about a month&#39;s time. I got a precious few weeks with a personal office, and then it was all gone. I hated this change of scenery mmediately, but I guess I got used to it after a few years.Working from home took me back to that zen. I didn&#39;t even know how much I missed it - how much I needed my own space to feel productive.I&#39;ve since changed jobs, and I kinda dread having to go to the open office nightmare once this is all over. The facilities are way nicer than my last job, but it&#39;s still an open office.Open. Office. As. Implemented. In. Our. Industry. Is. Stupid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like the relationship is dysfunctional in both directions.On the one hand, the employer set up a panopticon in the office, with crappy furniture, lots of interruptions, a crappy office kitchen, no decent food (i.e. needing to bring food from home). Garbage in, garbage out. Of course nobody is happy to sit in traffic to come to an environment like that.Then we have the author, who has the mistaken idea that the number one most important thing that you do at your job is your directly measurable productivity. Not relationship-building, just pure &#34;shut up and let me sit down and get my work done.&#34; Personally, I&#39;d prefer it if engineering work didn&#39;t go the way of Amazon warehouse workers, because if &#34;productivity&#34; is the sole metric of an employee&#39;s performance, just wait until your employer decides to try and optimize it.Best of luck to the OP at the dice roll that is the next company he works for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I noticed is that while more experienced people are productive working from home, it is devastating for fresh starting employees. Work from home eliminates learning through osmosis. If anyone has a work around this let me know. I am surprised no one else has mentioned it here."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At my last job I made a feature to deploy arbitrary user code (most likely a trained model in Python) to a subdomain running a JS server that could take input parameters when called at that URL and would respond with the answer from the model. This effectively cut down DS deployments from potentially days to about 45 seconds. It was seen that be hard and I had a good amount of help from our awesome devops person and worked through a number of issues with the lead dev. When this was delivered everyone loved it, lots of kudos and compliments because it was seen as hard. I felt like a bit of a fraud as I felt I had a lot of help and it really was a team effort, I made efforts to highlight this.I also worked on my own (with the exception of some nginx issues) on a feature to keep an in browser file browse up to date for all users via web sockets. This was really a view on a git repo accessed through the Gitlab api, it was a nightmare to deal with because of the way Git tracks (or doesn’t really) folders. This feature was seen to be easy and I slaved on it for days and eventually weeks because of edge cases and feature creep to no kudos or compliments. Which is fine, it’s my job.It matters, I think, not if the task is easy or hard but if management/product view something as easy or hard."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ouch. This hits close to home.I _constantly_ get passed over for the interesting work, despite being _extremely_ qualified for it.  (e.g. I keep getting told I don&#39;t &#34;have a scientific background&#34;, so I&#39;m not qualified to work on problem X, despite the fact that I have a PhD in the field and extensive experience on closely related problems)It&#39;s because I&#39;m seen as a technician, not an engineer or a scientist.That&#39;s because I&#39;m the person everyone picks for the &#34;hey, just whip up this quick demo / generate this report / prototype this idea for me&#34;, and therefore I get critiqued when it&#39;s not fast enough / polished enough, despite it being a &#34;drop everything and have this done by 10pm&#34; situation every time.The big things I&#39;ve accomplished, other people have _always_ gotten credit for.  The things that fail, I get the blame for.So serious advice from someone who&#39;s too old to change it now:  SAY NO TO URGENT ONE-OFF REQUESTS FROM MANAGEMENT!!!  Once you start, it&#39;s a trap that&#39;s really hard to get out of and gets you nowhere career wise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A classic &#34;easy&#34; thing that appears &#34;hard&#34;: write a little bit of assembly. Note, a little bit[1].Writing assembly, again, in small amounts, is exactly the kind of thing that is difficult to start, and fails spectacularly if you have little experience. Debugging is a pain. But you can totally get the hang of writing assembly, and as long as you are doing it for the right reasons (TM), it&#39;s justified, and heroic. The key is you need to write and debug a little at a time.Case in point, I wrote an entire Wasm interpreter[2] in x86-64 asm over the past few months. I wrote it a little at a time, had lots of unit tests, and am working in an engine that was already completely functional (with a slower interpreter).[1] If you find yourself writing more than a hundred or so assembly instructions in a sitting, you are going to fail. If you find yourself writing more than a few thousand assembly instructions, total, you have probably have already failed.[2] https://github.com/titzer/wizard-engine/blob/master/src/engi..."</p>

She pierced two layers of latex gloves and drew blood&#34;Later in the article:&#34;&#34;We conduct research only on mouse-adapted sheep prions, which have never been shown to be infectious to humans,” Aguzzi [neuropathologist at the University of Zurich] says.&#34;It sounds like the assumption that mouse-adapted sheep prions can&#39;t infect humans may be flawed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Prions are weird.  I was at UCSF during the time they went from a fringe theory to an established fact and a nobel prize.  The professor who studied them (Prusiner) had to overcome tons of resistance and the experiments were heroic (often waiting months for mice to die).  It&#39;s really funny that everybody resisted it until somebody mentioned that there was a plausible physical mechanism of refolding catalysis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article talks about the case of Émilie Jaumain that got contaminated by prion while cleaning a device used to slice mouse brains. She died 9 years later of a prion disease. After several cases of exposure across the world, France decided to block prion research for 3 months to try to study the issue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ads should be relevant to the site, not the user.For example, I buy hot rod magazines to get the advertisements selling hot rod parts in those magazines. I don&#39;t buy them to read toothpaste ads. I even pay money to get those ads.But if I was visiting a site about dental hygiene, I&#39;d be interest in the toothpaste ads.I&#39;ve tried to configure context-sensitive ads from Amazon on my web site to be books on programming. But Amazon would insist on showing:1. batman movie ads2. the same ad for a C++ course over and over and over and overSo I wound up removing those from the site. Instead, I created a list of good programming books myself, and would randomly cycle through that list to show an ad.It would be so much better if I could enable:&#34;Only show books from this category.&#34;as my aim is to only show advertisements that would be of interest to the people reading the site.Google has context sensitive ads, and one would think this would work. But it doesn&#39;t. For example, I have a page on the American Revolution. Google&#39;s context sensitive ads are usually for travel agencies, presumably based on the place names on the page. Actually relevant ads would be for history books. I tried meta keywords, etc., nothing worked. I gave up. Google&#39;s context algorithms are worthless and the site owner should be able to provide guidance."</p>

Sadly we&#39;re still only focused on developers, and Techdirt&#39;s content is very wide ranging, so we were only able to propose running ads on a subset of their content currently. We&#39;d love to be able to support them when we are able to expand our audience to a larger tech-focused site in the future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Orbiter Space Simulator (http://orbit.medphys.ucl.ac.uk/) has been one of the major realistic-ish space simulators of the decade.Development has slowed down in the last years due to the obligations of its sole author, so seeing it be open-sourced with a free license (MIT) is a great opportunity to rekindle its development! It seems that the first priorities would be to upgrade the code to 64-bits and transition to a more recent version of DirectX."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh, fond memories of it. It was the first time when I understood that when you fly to the Moon, not only you have to cross the Moon&#39;s orbit, but you have to do it when Moon itself is nearby. If you are 1/4 orbital period ahead of it, you are screwed.It also ruined space movies like &#34;Gravity&#34; for me, because pointing the nose to the space station in 50 km and applying thrust towards it turns out to be a sure way to NOT get  to that station!Edit: fixed the thrust direction"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have some experience on this field. Around two years ago i was a DevOp for the company running Dagbladet, Norways #2 newspaper. One of the things I did was keep an eye on mysterious traffic.I managed to find a huge spam network that set up a proxy service that delivered normal content, but injected &#34;you  can win an iPhone!&#34; spam to all users visiting them.Since I was in the position of being able to monitor their proxy traffic towards many sites I managed. I could easily document their behaviour.In the same time, I wrote a crawler that visited their sites over a long, long time. I learned that they kept injecting hidden links to other sites in their network, so I did let my bot look at those also.By this time, I also got a journalist with me that started to look at the money flow to try and find the organisation behind it.My bot found in excess of 100K domains being used for this operation, targeting all of westeren Europe. All the 100K sites contained proxied content and was hidden behind Cloudflare, but thanks to the position I had, I managed to find their backend anyways.We reported the sites to both CF and Google, and to my knowledge, not a single site were removed before the people behind it took it down.Oh, and the journalist? He did find a Dutch company that was not happy to see neither him or the photographer :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google search has progressively deteriorated in quality over the last 10 years, to the point where I see it becoming useless in the relatively near future. And it&#39;s mainly not even their fault.I&#39;ve been using Google search for all kinds of research for 15 years. There used to be a time when you could find the answer to pretty much anything. I could find leaked source codes on public FTP servers, links to pirated software and keygens, detailed instructions for a variety of useful things. That was the golden age of the web.These days, all the &#34;interesting&#34; data on the Internet is all inside closed Telegram chats, facebook groups, Discords or the rare public website here and there that Google 
doesn&#39;t want to index (like sci-hub, or other piracy sites).The data that remains on SERPs is now also heavily censored for arbitrary reasons. &#34;For your health&#34;, &#34;For your protection&#34;. Google search is done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen the same here in Germany but they do appear only if you use the results within the last 24h functionality.
It looks like the German content is generated through GPT2 or 3. It makes no real sense if you read it.
If you go on the page you are immediately redirected to a scam just like the article mentions.
Interestingly they use &#34;.it&#34; domains here. It also looks like the domains might have been hacked or are expired domains that have been bought.For example if you check havfruen4220.dk on archive.org you can see that it appears to have been a legitimate business website before. https://web.archive.org/web/20181126203158/https://havfruen4...How do they rank so well?I&#39;ve checked the domain on ahref and it has almost no backlinks. But if you look closely you will see that all the results that rank very well have been added very recently.
On the screenshots in the article you can see things like &#34;for 2 timer siden&#34; which means 2 hours ago.
It looks like google is ranking pages that have a very recent publishing date higher.Edit: Here is what the content of such a site looks like: https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:Bk0VsM..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For folks interested in this space, there&#39;s a few other resources of which I&#39;m a fan.First, there&#39;s Micro.blog (https://micro.blog/).  They can host a blog for you, or you can publish to their service for free using your own blog by pointing Micro.blog at your RSS feed (I do the latter).  Think blogging but with a social element, facilitating both interaction and content discovery.Second, there&#39;s the IndieWeb movement more broadly (https://indieweb.org/), which advocates for a whole ecosystem of distributed, open technologies for enriching the blogging ecosystem and encouraging interoperability.Third, believe it or not, webrings live on!  The indiewebring (https://indieweb.org/indiewebring), for example, is a fun way to find additional bloggers out there.As you can tell, I&#39;m a fan of blogging and the IndieWeb movement... :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Awesome, I agree, personal blogs are great.I can&#39;t help but notice all the blogs tagged &#34;software&#34; in the list (so far). In fact, I think if there was a filter to exclude software blogs, there might be only a few remaining?I missed out on the whole RSS thing when it was popular. My sense was that it solved the problem of knowing when, among a whole bunch of blogs, a site had new content.Perhaps it exists, I want an app/site that will scrape a list of sites I give it (blogs for example) to show me any new content each day. A personal home page with titles and perhaps a hundred or so words from each site I track that has new content.In the broader picture, I feel overwhelmed by the amount of technology these days, spend too much of my time browsing, etc. (HN, case in point). So I am looking for something I call TRAoT, The Right Amount of Technology.Maybe it&#39;s a &#34;magic mirror&#34; that displays this overview, home page. Interactivity is minimal or nil. No ability to comment, follow links, etc. Like the morning newspaper of old, I spend a little time in the morning with it and then go about my day &#34;offline&#34;.In short I am looking at ways to take the open-ended and stress inducing (anxiety inducing?) relationships I have with technology and replace them with a more staid, maybe even serendipitous, relationship that allows me back more free time, less stress.Maybe this &#34;Solar Punk&#34; thing is something of the Zeitgeist of our time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am afraid to blog. I could write about my career and my hobby, but those do not seem to be interesting for others. My opinion may be interesting, but it is risky because something I write may come back to offend others one day, or get me in trouble. One time ago I considered blogging anonymously about the economy but doing so anonymously felt disingenuous."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sumatra, alongside maybe Everything and IrfanView, is my favorite piece of software on windows. Incredible speed, great customizability and awesome compatibility.I really missed it when I made the switch to Linux, but not enough to consider installing WINE. Still, absolutely wonderful project deserving of the highest praise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s amazing to see the drive of &#34;I know what I want to make and I do it the way I want&#34; carry the project for so long. More than any development ideology just having the passion to continue working on whatever it is you&#39;re doing is an extremely powerful force for creating useful software. And SumatraPDF is definitely useful software, has been for a long time.&#34;ideology doesn&#39;t matter as much as doing&#34; being said the syntax valid semantic invalid error at the end of this excerpt in the section on extensive tests being overrated gave me a chuckle:&gt; Dogma is powerful. Sometimes in my corporate life I felt like writing tests was just going through motion. Maybe we should spend more time writing code instead, I though?In all seriousness I agree though. In a project where you write the majority of the code it is possible to overdo tests in a way that you are wasting more time than you&#39;re saving yourself and in a passion project efficiency isn&#39;t always as important as interest anyways."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; I&#39;ve wasted many an hour combing through Google and my search history to look up a good article, blog post, or just something I&#39;ve seen before.This is the fault of web browser vendors who have yet to give a damn about book marks.&gt; Apollo is a search engine and web crawler to digest your digital footprint. What this means is that you choose what to put in it. When you come across something that looks interesting, be it an article, blog post, website, whatever, you manually add it (with built in systems to make doing so easy).So it&#39;s a searchable database for bookmarks then.&gt; The first thing you might notice is that the design is reminiscent of the old digital computer age, back in the Unix days. This is intentional for many reasons. In addition to paying homage to the greats of the past, this design makes me feel like I&#39;m searching through something that is authentically my own. When I search for stuff, I genuinely feel like I&#39;m travelling through the past.This does not make any sense. It&#39;s Unix-like because it feels old? It seems like the author thoroughly misses the point of unix philosophy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My version of this is https://dogsheep.github.io/ - the idea is to pull your digital footprint from various different sources (Twitter, Foursquare, GitHub etc) into SQLite database files, then run Datasette on top to explore them.On top of that I built a search engine called Dogsheep Beta which builds a full-text search index across all of the different sources and lets you search in one place: https://github.com/dogsheep/dogsheep-betaYou can see a live demonstration of that search engine on the Datasette website: https://datasette.io/-/beta?q=dogsheepThe key difference I see with Apollo is that Dogsheep separates fetching of data from search and indexing, and uses SQLite as the storage format. I&#39;m using a YAML configuration to define how the search index should work: https://github.com/simonw/datasette.io/blob/main/templates/d... - it defines SQL queries that can be used to build the index from other tables, plus HTML fragments for how those results should be displayed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this idea, but the name “digital footprint” sort of implies it’s what effect you’ve had on the Internet for helping keep your online persona under control: your tweets, comments, emails, et cetera.But this is a great idea! Having a search engine for vaguely _anything_ you touch very much does look like it’d increase the signal:noise ratio. It’d be interesting to be able to add whole sites (using, say, DuckDuckGo as an external crawler) to be able to fetch general ideas, such as, say, “Stack Exchange posts marked with these tags”."</p>
