								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It was a mistake to attack the business side of the oil company, because it created what could be sold as reasonable doubt to shut down the pipeline.As a result, the ransom had the optics of an attack on infrastructure. As evidenced by the coverage of Americans desperately filling up containers.This created the impetus for the US to treat this as an incident far and above the ambient ransomware activities leading up to this.It also gave the US an opportunity to show how effective it could be when it had the political cover to do so."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The REvil representative said its program was introducing new restrictions on the kinds of organizations that affiliates could hold for ransom, and that henceforth it would be forbidden to attack those in the “social sector” (defined as healthcare and educational institutions) and organizations in the “gov-sector” (state) of any country. Affiliates also will be required to get approval before infecting victims.Statements like this seem to point to ransomware activities being far more coordinated and &#34;business-like&#34; than they often get credit for.I do wonder if ransomware is (in a strange way) a(n illegal) free-market response to what is perceived to be an under-valuation of tech skills - aggrieved people who can carry out attacks and gain access to deploy ransomware are likely to be able to earn more through this route, even factoring in their &#34;risk of being caught&#34;.If a market correction occurs (ransomware becomes a real fear, organisations rapidly start to value security skills more and pay &#34;megabucks&#34; for the skills and hire them at-scale), the risk/reward of being caught starts to mean access brokers reduce in number, and the compensation reaches a free market equilibrium (accounting for the &#34;getting caught&#34; risk of criminal activity).A lot of the time I still see people trying to hire entry-level people into live/ operational security roles, without the experience they&#39;d need. I wonder if this is partly due to a desire to cut costs, rather than accept the need to pay rock-star compensation?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “There’s too much publicity,” the XSS administrator explained. “Ransomware has gathered a critical mass of nonsense, bullshit, hype, and fuss around it. The word ‘ransomware’ has been put on a par with a number of unpleasant phenomena, such as geopolitical tensions, extortion, and government-backed hacks. This word has become dangerous and toxic.”I am... flabbergasted.  What?  Ransomware has always been a brand of extortion; it&#39;s right there in the name.  Extortion has become dangerous and toxic?  You have got to be kidding me.  I wonder what&#39;s next for these folks.  A life of simple, honest, pleasant and non-toxic crime?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Congratulations!I always have great respect for Scala because itself and the community tried to adopt and push the novel idea in the industry. Take a look at the changes, they&#39;re no joke to design and implement. At the same time, they&#39;re also trying to make the language consistent and simple. (Yes, I mean simple, not easy or single-paradigmed)They are taking the hard way, and not only there are not enough people to appreciate the effort, but also attract some hatred from time to time. I hope Scala 3 would bring us and itself a bright future, and inspire more languages to move forward.(For example, there are a lot of type features added to TypeScript in most releases because it needs to do the typing on existing dynamically typed languages, it may also be a hint that dependent type actually makes sense in mainstream languages)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so psyched about this. I&#39;ve followed the development of Scala 3 for pretty much the whole voyage, and I think they&#39;ve done an incredible job bringing the community along through some pretty radical changes to the language. It has definitely not been an easy process herding a community with very big, informed, divergent opinions on the language.In the end, I think they did an awesome job. Many, many sacred cows of old Scala were confronted. I think the result is a much more approachable language, where simple things are easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazing!!! Great to see Scala improving at such a fast pace!I&#39;m especially excited about union/intersection types. I think we could all witness how well they work out in typescript and I believe that every language with the concept of subtyping should have this feature. It is one of the things that make working in a statically typed language feel much more dynamic/lightweight without giving up on safety guarantees."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27149123">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Apart from the threading model, I love Zulip for its openness.
It&#39;s quite sad Slack and Discord are often the first choice for open communities. They are siloed and unless you are deliberately searching in a specific workspace, you&#39;ll never run into the information in a search engine.In comparison, Zulip:- provides HTML export functionality https://github.com/zulip/zulip-archive#zulip-html-archive (example https://leanprover-community.github.io/archive )- URLs are nice and encode meaning (e.g. https://memex.zulipchat.com/#narrow/stream/279601-hpi/topic/...)
  ... compare with Slack/Discord meaningless character sequences- I&#39;m excited about https://github.com/zulip/zulip/issues/4817 , which would allow viewing workspaces in &#39;guest&#39; mode, without registering at all"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was skeptical about Zulip when I first tried it. What is it supposed to be? A chat? A forum? Why is the UI so ugly?But after using it a while I now really dislike Slack et al, both in professional teams and for open source communities.Zulip can give you the best of both worlds. It&#39;s a regular chat. But the threading model also encourages long-form, more forum or email like discussions.Threads are easily discoverable and it&#39;s trivial to catch up on all the relevant discussions that you missed, while skipping everything that doesn&#39;t concern you.You can still have some regular chat channels for typical ephemeral discussion that no-one is expected to read. It&#39;s really a great tool.The only downside is the very subpar UX when compared to Discord or even Slack."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;threaded&#34; part is key here. Slack threads are useless compared to Zulip. In Zulip you can create threads on the fly from existing messages, so if discussion starts diverging you can turn it into a new thread. It&#39;s just a fundamentally superior model."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fell prey to this. Might have been the exact same website, too. Had had a drink with dinner, thought heck why not file for my EIN for an independent consulting LLC I was creating? Was using a fresh OS install where I hadn&#39;t yet installed Firefox with an adblocker. Usual defenses were weakened. Boom, $250 down the drain before I really thought it all through. Fortunately I was able to get it refunded by initiating a chargeback and telling their website support that I believed they were misrepresenting themselves as the IRS. It really was a &#34;welcome to the real world&#34; moment, though - my very first act as a new business in the US was to get scammed. This theme has continued. 90% of the business mail I get are scams masquerading as official government mail to get business licenses or whatever. These websites are run by scumbags who should all be arrested. And Google, of course, should pay actual penalties because it&#39;s been all upside for them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a hard time trying to understand why governments don’t address these scams more proactively.There is a related issue when you register a new company here in Germany: As soon as the new entity is added to the company house (called “Handelsregister”), you will start to receive fake invoices from scam companies.These invoice look very similar to official ones and some even use the official seal of the state (see https://www.firma.de/en/company-formation/beware-of-fake-han... for examples).If you don’t pay close attention you can easily mistake these invoice for official ones.This scam is quite well-known and has been going on for years. To further add to the insult - the companies that send these fake invoices are usually German entities as well, not some obscure shell companies in remote islands and yet besides warnings from the government it seems that little is happening.I find it infuriating and don’t understand why it is even allowed to send another party that you never had any relation with an invoice for a service that you actually haven’t performed yet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I teach everyone in my family to never trust the first few sponsored results now matter how convincing they may be. As far as I’m concerned Google know exactly what they’re doing and are actively complicit in perpetuating online scams against one family and friends. Are we seriously supposed to believe a company of their size, with their talent pool, and their money, can’t filter out such blatantly obvious crap? Sure."</p>

I&#39;ll probably be more inconvenienced by the mitigations that will surely result that make it that much more painful to actually launch a URL scheme, sadly.I&#39;ve actually never checked the &#34;Always open Slack for slack:// links&#34; or similar checkboxes, precisely out of predicting shenanigans like this would happen eventually :)I wouldn&#39;t be too offended if browsers changed the way they handle schemes: always open a &#34;how would you like to handle  this link&#34; dialog for any protocol (even if unhandled - like how Windows shows the &#34;how would you like to open this file&#34; dialog), to disguise whether the protocol is handled or not.  Not sure I have the answer for user convenience though if someone is used to things automatically opening. That&#39;s the &#34;inconvenience&#34; aspect of any potential mitigation, we probably have to get rid of that &#34;remember this choice&#34; checkbox (well, my point is that &#34;have to&#34; is debatable here)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love Syncthing. I have abysmally slow home internet, so any cloud storage service simply takes too long to sync, and trying to do the first sync of 150 GB takes many weeks. Besides, none of these services (dropbox, onedrive) support ignore files, so they&#39;re constantly syncing node_modules folders, etc.Instead, I have Syncthing set to sync a half-dozen folders (Pictures, desktop, documents, audiobooks, etc.) between my phone, laptop, and desktop over the local network. In total, I sync more than 150 GB of files and it works almost instantly and seamlessly. I use the SyncTrayzor GUI for Windows and the Syncthing app for Android. The Android app occasionally needs to be restarted manually, but that&#39;s the only problem I&#39;ve had with it.Importantly, I keep local copies of everything on all of my devices, including my phone (256 GB storage plus a microSD card slot which I have yet to need). Lack of support for Syncthing on iPhones is one major reason I stick with Android, even though there&#39;s a lot to like about the platform. Once it gets too big I&#39;ll move a bunch of old stuff to backup/archive drives, but I don&#39;t expect that to happen for a while.Now, I use Google Photos to selectively share photos with others, and that&#39;s it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Unsurprising, but still disappointing. Actually I&#39;m glad someone is trying to hold them accountable. It seems silly tho that we need to pass a law to uphold what&#39;s already written into the constitution. It highlights that the constitution only has teeth in some legal contexts, primarily where a court case is being heard on a citizen being prosecuted. Conditionality seems to not have any bearing on preventing agencies from violating the constitution or stopping them when they&#39;re found out, nor punishing those responsible for the violation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing I still can&#39;t fathom, all these years after Bush II and then Snowden, is just how little human beings really care about mass surveillance. Yeah, the Snowden leaks made a splash, but the media cycle turned over a couple weeks later and everyone moved onto other things.It&#39;s like, if you&#39;re of a certain age, you had to read 1984 or whatever in school. You&#39;d think &#34;well, no one would stand for that sort of thing in real life!&#34; Okay, so we don&#39;t live in that society, exactly, but time after time, we&#39;re shown the breadth of government surveillance and the reaction from the broader public isn&#39;t to call for anyone&#39;s head on a pike -- it&#39;s not even to vote anyone out!Outside of little communities like this one, people don&#39;t give much of a fuck. I guess that was Orwell&#39;s real point."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t like how this article buries the important parts of this story. There is good reason to think that this surveillance by public info is legal currently, there was a court ruling stating that&#39;s the case.A law is necessary to codify that this practice is a violation Fourth Amendment, and Wyden is currently one of a handful of senators trying to get it passed.The story eventually mentions this, but the beginning focus on confidentiality makes it seem like they&#39;re hiding evidence of their crime."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Quick summary: the biggest electricity provider in the country (ENEL) made an app (Juicepass) to find and manage their charging stations across the country. The Android Auto functionality of the app has been rejected by Google for non disclosed &#34;security concerns while driving&#34;. The antitrust ruled out it was because Google wanted to sabotage competitor apps to the charging stations finder built-in in the Google Maps app. On top of the fine Google will need to provide the SDK to integrate their app with Android Auto."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way antitrust is working in recent years is kind of ridiculous. Google in Europe is becoming a rich case study in antitrust meh.You find that adwords engages in a blatant &#34;monopolistic abuse&#34; in some specific sense. In the Adwords EU case for example, Google was both monopsonising (google search) and monopolising search advertising. But, the actual violations are specific, like exclusivity requirements and other technical infractions buried in their take-it-or-leave-it contracts with &#34;partners.^&#34;Google get a fine. They deny culpability. They pay a fine and move on. Whether it&#39;s 100m or 2bn doesn&#39;t really matter. Google are demonstrably willing to pay far more (eg acquisition, browser kickbacks, etc.) to maintain a monopolistic position. Besides minor tweaks, there&#39;s no reason for them to change.What&#39;s the point? Antitrust can&#39;t be useful as a violation-fine paradigm. These cases/fines don&#39;t affect the monopoly or free the market in any useful sense.IMO, we need some way to declare a company &#34;Big&#34; and apply special rules to them. If those rules are onerous, that might create some organic pressure to split and/or help smaller incumbents  compete.There is no point to antitrust if its totally reactive, handing out fines for moving violations. The point of antitrust is trust-busting, to affect market structure. The point if to have a competitive market.All the 1990s stuff is playing out. Just like the MSFT case, we see that operating systems, browsers (now app stores) are monopoly prone and that it&#39;s a big deal. On the other side, the 90s &#34;portal&#34; concept is fully realized now. In the digital economy, controlling the windows of consumption is everything. None of the costs, all of the profit... literally all in a lot of cases.^Newspapers didn&#39;t have the advantage search partners had in their monopoly claim, because Google doesn&#39;t have agreements with them. No contract, no abusive clauses. The take it or leave it offer is &#34;give us your content for free, or go away.&#34; Formally, Google isn&#39;t even doing business with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"allegedly, Google did not approve Enel X charging station finder app Juicepass on the Android Auto store due to security and standards concerns. I do not understand why Google did not provide a clear exhaustive explanation on the specifics but just a generic &#34;We have strong standards for the publishing of apps on our Android Auto store&#34;. They are not even trying to justify or defend themselves because they don&#39;t need to - they will pay the fine and move on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Big fan of notion. Not a fan of the data lock-in or haphazard security. For tools like this, SaaS will almost always beat open source just by virtue of elbow grease and a product direction. So I’m willing to forego the open source alternatives. But I really wish Notion gave me more options for how to host my data. AFAICT they offer no “dedicated storage” or “on premise” plan, even if you want to pay for it.In fact I heard a rumor that the entirety of Notion runs on a single unsharded database. If true, combined with the fact that this API took so long to ship, I have to assume that there is a crippling amount of tech debt in their stack. Hopefully it’s growing pains and they’re sorting it out, but it doesn’t make me feel confident about the security of my (most sensitive) data.It’s maybe also a cautionary tale about what happens when you dismiss too many early decisions as “premature optimization.” You ship fast in the beginning but a few years later you’re buried in all the debt you generated.Granted, it’s a good problem to have. If the choice is between a profitable, popular company buried in tech debt, or the perfect stack with no customers, I’ll take the debt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I initially signed up for Notion, I did so thinking the API was already usable. It was used as a selling point for their premium service even though it wasn&#39;t implemented. This was a year and a half ago or so.I felt pretty burned by it and killed my subscription. Hopefully this turns out well for the people who&#39;ve been waiting for it, but that experience left a terrible taste in my mouth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve recently started using Notion and I&#39;m surprised at few things that I find incredibly annoying with it so far. Since it seems there are some Notion staff here I&#39;ll take this as a change to give some feedback to hopefully improve the product.* No read-only mode. I like to have documents default to a read-only mode so I don&#39;t accidentally typo random characters, or delete something when try copying. etc.* No floating table of contents. There is a ToC block but it&#39;s at a fixed position, where it&#39;s not terribly usable especially for long documents having a giant ToC at the top isn&#39;t great. I&#39;ve tried using columns but it just squishes the rest of the document way too much* Floating heads. When you have multiple collaborators the avatars zooming up and down the left side of the document is incredibly distracting. I&#39;d love a way to disable this completely. I don&#39;t care where in a document other people are reading.* Database/Table horizontal scrollbar. Almost every database in our documents end up with this giant scrollbar that spans edge to edge, looking like a horizontal rule, breaking up the visual flow of the page significantly. I keep thinking it&#39;s some kind of page break.These are just some of my initial impressions. I do think it&#39;s a very visually nice product and has a lot of neat features but I&#39;m pretty surprised by some basic QoL stuff missing and hope to see it further refined."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"My hot-take having watched the culling from an invested position follows. Disclaimer: i hold both BTC and ETH.While the market in general is down, the major losses in this crash were Bitcoin, Doge and Shiba. Bitcoin is an obvious result given the news. Doge and Shiba have had pretty spectacular gains over the last ~30d and seeing them lose considerable value is unsurprising if you follow crypto markets much. Seemingly new money has been racing in lately (see big rises in Eth Classic and Bitcoin Cash as well), i find these dips also unsurprising given past behavior.As a somewhat meta analysis, i feel BTC could have an interesting summer. BTC plateaued at $1.1T in market cap. Meanwhile, Ethereum has been on a steady rise from 250-500B+. Talk of &#34;the flippening&#34; has returned in a way i didn&#39;t anticipate, certainly not this early on.While this news impacted the whole market (the market still follows big BTC swings to some extent), i have found my personal sentiment shifting to be increasingly bearish on BTC and bullish on ETH."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, that&#39;s incredible.  Goes to show that people do walk away from plane crashes with some regularity.  My father was a pilot[0].He sold his plane about 15 years ago (to a group of owners, one of which was a priest, I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a joke in there).  A few of winters later, he was called out to Romeo Airport; the pilot flying the plane that was formerly his had crashed the aircraft a few miles short of the runway in bad weather[1].  He was traveling with his daughter, a friend and, I think, his wife.  He died, but his daughter was able to get free and make her way to a nearby farm to call for help.  Looking at the plane, the fact that anyone survived at all let alone walked to a nearby house with minor injuries is pretty miraculous.It&#39;s hard to impress upon folks who have never been in a small plane like that just how ... yeah ... how much it feels like you&#39;re hanging onto a kite.  I have no idea the kinds of structural technologies are involved in the aircraft but I know his plane was made in the 70s and was light enough that he only had a pole which attached to the front landing gear to pull it out of the hangar.  The weight is so critical that the 7-seat plane can realistically only seat 4-5 adults.  I remember being shocked that they had to weigh the paint they applied when he had the plane re-painted.[0] I&#39;ll spare the details as I have left many comments in the past about his experiences.[1] https://aviation-safety.net/wikibase/43894 - &#34;Pilot Error&#34;; I recall my Dad saying &#34;all plane crashes are pilot error&#34;[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piper_PA-32_Cherokee_Six"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So multiple people have noted that the environmental concerns were exactly the same and very well known when Tesla originally started taking bitcoin as payment.So what changed? Well I think the biggest notable difference between then and now is then bitcoin seemed to be going only up. Now it seems to be going down. When bitcoin continues to  steadily go down, it is a significant concern because Tesla will have to take losses on the cars it sells and will have reduced gross margins, which will result in their stock price tanking.Musk smartly decided he did not want to risk his half a trillion dollar company on random bitcoin fluctuations. It is probably the right decision (although certainly covered up with false reasoning) but he should have never reached this stage. Tesla should have never taken bitcoin without provisions for automatically converting it into one of the currencies it pays its costs in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Speaking as one of the original three authors of Google Docs (Writely), but zero involvement in this project (I left Google in 2010): I&#39;m seeing a lot of comments asking how JavaScript-on-Canvas could possibly outperform the highly optimized native code built into the browser engines. It&#39;s been a long time since I&#39;ve really been involved in browser coding, but having written both Writely and, farther back, several native-app word processing engines, here are some thoughts.Word processors have extremely specific requirements for layout, rendering, and incremental updates. I&#39;ll name just two examples. First, to highlight a text selection in mixed left-to-right / right-to-left text, it&#39;s necessary to obtain extremely specific information regarding text layout; information that the DOM may not be set up to provide. Second, to smoothly update as the user is typing text, it&#39;s often desirable to &#34;cheat&#34; the reflow process and focus on updating just the line of text containing the insertion point. (Obviously browser engines support text selections, but they probably don&#39;t expose the underlying primitives the way a word processor would need. Similarly, they support incremental layout + rendering, but probably not specifically optimized in the precise way a word processor would need.)Modern browser engines are amazing feats of engineering, but the feature set they provide, while enormous, is unlikely to exactly match the exacting requirements of a WYSIWYG word processor. As soon as your requirements differ even slightly from the feature set provided, you start tipping over into complex workarounds which impact performance and are hell on developer productivity and application stability / compatibility.This is loosely analogous to CISC vs. RISC: browsers are amazing &#34;CISCy&#34; engines but if your use case doesn&#39;t precisely fit the expectations of the instruction set designer then you&#39;re better off with something lower-level, like Canvas and WASM. (I don&#39;t know whether Docs uses WASM but it would seem like a good fit for this Canvas project.)Frameworks in general suffer from this problem. If you&#39;ve ever had to fight with an app framework, or orchestration framework, or whatever sort of framework to accomplish something 5% outside of what the framework is set up to support, then you understand the concept.Also, as noted in many comments here, browser engines have to solve a much more general problem than Docs, and thus have extra overhead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In 2009, I joined Mozilla and started working on the Bespin[1] project, which Ben Galbraith &amp; Dion Almaer had brought to Moz. Bespin was built with a canvas-based renderer. Bespin was way faster than other browser-based code editors at the time.Then the Ajax.org/Cloud9 folks came along with their Ace editor[2], which was DOM-based and still very fast. We ended up merging the projects. edit to add: and switching to DOM renderingRik Arends[3] was one of the Ajax.org folks and he&#39;s been working on a WebGL-based code environment called Makepad[4], which is entirely built in Rust and has its own UI toolkit. He&#39;s complained a lot about how difficult it is to make a performant JS-based editing environment.My point in all of this is just that there are absolutely tradeoffs in performance, accessibility, ease-of-development, internationalization, and likely other aspects. If raw performance is what you&#39;re going for, it&#39;s hard to beat just drawing on a canvas or using WebGL. Google Docs needs to worry about all of that other stuff, too, so I&#39;ll be interested to see how this shapes up.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozilla_Skywriter[2]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ace_(editor)[3]: https://twitter.com/rikarends[4]: https://makepad.dev"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t build extensions or work on much front end web lately but this reads like Google wants more control over their stuff. The web is becoming less open.&gt; By moving away from HTML-based rendering to a canvas-based rendering, some Chrome extensions may not function as intended on docs.google.com and may need to be updated.&gt; If you are building your own integrations with Google Docs, we recommend using Google Workspace Add-ons framework, which uses the supported Workspace APIs and integration points. This will help ensure there will be less work in the future to support periodic UI implementation changes to Docs.This is basically putting an API on top of an API as far as I&#39;m concerned. The web renders markup and executes javascript to produce experience. Putting an API on top and using canvas to render your content creates a more closed system.For those more deep in web technology, I&#39;d like to know if there are reasons to move to canvas for strictly technical merits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The number of comments here that are negative is just staggering to me.These images are within a hair&#39;s breadth of being indistinguishable from reality. It&#39;s an enormous leap. An enormous leap from the previous techniques and an enormous leap towards photorealistic realtime graphics.You don&#39;t want your games to look realistic? Go play pacman or outrun.You want to use path tracing instead? You have no idea how much cheaper this technique is. And on top of that the neural network is also fixing up the unrealistic texture work on all kinds of things in the scene.The first games to use this are going to be from small game studios with less investment in the status quo and they are going to blow the competition out of the water."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am especially impressed by how much more realistic the lighting ends up looking despite the network probably having less information to work with than the engine! Though it ends up turning the lighting very flat. I guess that is an effect of the source images they were using.As others have said, using this directly in the engine (tuned to work with the intended art style etc) could probably produce almost miraculous results, if it can be made to work at a reasonable frame rate.That would also allow the developers to use high-quality rendered images instead of these green-tinted, low-contrast &#34;automotive grade&#34; camera images as source of truth (there are good reasons these images look like that ... but they don&#39;t look pleasant)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Impressive, but I think that photorealism is not necessarily what you would want to strive for in games, as it is not true realism. It emulates the deficiencies of the camera that we perceive it as realistic, because we are trained on thousands of photo images and video footage. I prefer visionrealism instead of photorealism in my games and don&#39;t really find that lens effects like flares, chromatic aberration, and depth of field enhances the experience of realism. It feels like I&#39;m looking through a camera rather than being there myself. For me it breaks immersion instead of enhancing it."</p>

This ESP32 AirTag emulator could send out battery level and bilge pump data any time someone sailed by, without the need for a dedicated modem. Might have to try this out!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As there&#39;s a limit of 16 AirTags per Apple ID, and each AirTag&#39;s keys rotate every 15 minutes, presumably Apple can detect if anyone is abusing the system by sending more than 16 different &#34;messages&#34; per 15 minutes. They can&#39;t detect this when the fake airtags are sending, but can detect it from stored message timestamps when you query.  If they start to see this being abused a lot, they can then block Apple IDs.  To avoid Apple being able to see this, you probably need to either use multiple Apple IDs, or send less than 16 bits per 15 minutes."</p>

Doing that made me realize that typing a character is a very specific and atomic action (compared to writing by hand), as well as an automatic one (once you learn how to touch-type).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The biggest technical hurdle is the inability to run external processes on iOS and iPadOS.&gt; Apps on iOS and iPadOS must use Apple’s Javascript interpreter, JavaScriptCore.Both of these really suck because they are policy, not technical, decisions. Even setting aside the arguments of whether JIT code is a security concern (it is not unless your security model is one where codesigning exists to prevent the addition of new native code) that you cannot spawn a new process, nor can you ship another JavaScript interpreter, is really unfortunate.Allowing apps to spawn new processes is easy (I mean, just inherit sandboxing rules and resource limits…) and allows for a lot of new usecases, like robust crash reporting, web servers, privilege separation, and more. That Apple allows this on macOS and even uses it for its own apps on iOS just shows how useful this can be and how little it affects the security model of iOS.Likewise, not allowing other JavaScript interpreters is just…annoying. Regardless of your opinions of JavaScriptCore, this is an unfair limitation on an already slanted playing field. Coupled with the fact that the JavaScriptCore interpreter (which the framework uses for anything you run in-process) is literally designed for low resource consumption instead of than performance makes this even more infuriating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a different view of this than most in this topic. I am disappointed, though not surprised, that Panic is abandoning yet another of their iOS apps. They’ve done it several times before and while I am grateful they’ve continued to provide some bug fixes, feature work stopped years ago.In my view, the biggest hurdle does not seem to have been technical, but ideological/business. These old school Mac developers like Panic and Omni have had a very difficult time adapting to (or failing to) the iOS/mobile era. 
I know we all hate subscriptions, but continued app development and management requires continued labor so subscriptions seem like the only business option that makes any sense to me. Panic and Omni want paid upgrades but Apple has never, ever even hinted at providing that as an option. The option is subscriptions. Even on desktop Sketch, Adobe, and Microsoft are going with subscriptions. (We’ll see how Affinity does. They charge a lot more for their apps and seem to be in a growth phase so I imagine their sales at the moment are fast enough to make up for the fact that each sale is only a one time source of revenue).Honestly, Panic and Omni and other old school Mac developers really, really need to adapt to the modern era. They’ve had years and it feels like the runway is about to end (see Omni’s recent layoffs.) Wishing for paid upgrades and writing “only AppKit apps are real Mac apps” blog posts isn’t going to change anything."</p>

This doesn&#39;t solve the problem,I used to donate to Babel, before they made it apparent they are just interested in funneling the money to one developer. 11K per month?! That is absolutely bananas and same reaction I had the last time this came up, but this time I cannot do anything as a reaction as I&#39;ve already pulled my funding.But my guess is that a lot of people feel the same way, as the donations seems to be going down. 11K per month could pay for many developers if you hire people outside of Sillicon Valley, which since you&#39;re doing open source, you should really really consider.Open source is not &#34;VC fueled develoment&#34; and I don&#39;t think we should go that way either. Make your operation nimble and survive on little, otherwise you&#39;ll soon disappear. Optimize for sustainability, not for paying the one of the highest salary in the world (minus SV bubble of course).It&#39;s not wonder Babel is going the way it&#39;s going, as the economy you&#39;ve setup for yourself is nowhere near sustainable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This whole thread is basically a testament as to why the OSS model, unfortunately, is broken. Very competent people are expected to write widely used software for a salary that basically merely guarantees subsistence. It never ceases to amaze me how great software engineers allow themselves to be exploited in such a way. If you consider the societal impact that some of these projects have and the skill set that some of their maintainers have, which pretty much dwarfs the skill sets of people in other well paid professions such as lawyers or doctors, it&#39;s frankly ridiculous that they are expected to work for significantly less money. Not to mention that the abstractions some of these people wrote basically allow a significant number of people to enter the industry in the first place."</p>

I&#39;d look out of touch with the realities of running a business and the request would be roundly shouted down.If there&#39;s some value I can get then it&#39;s a much easier sell. For example, if there is a Babel job board then I can choose to use that over alternatives when I next hire. Jed Watson proposed https://budgetforopensource.org/, which puts this type of thing in the employee perk category so that I can justify it using hiring as a goal.

After Apples recent move in the same direction with their „find my“ mesh network of apple devices being used to introduce a whole new mode of operation to support their Air Tags the Question of Net Neutrality has to be extended from just ISPs to Dominant Platforms that have the ability to create derivative Mesh-Networks."</p>

When 802.11bf will be finalized and introduced as an IEEE standard in September 2024, Wi-Fi will cease to be a communication-only standard and will legitimately become a full-fledged sensing paradigm... tracking can be done surreptitiously because Wi-Fi signals can penetrate walls, don&#39;t require light, and don&#39;t offer any visible indicator of their presence.IEEE 802.11bf paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14918Papers on device-free wireless sensing (DFWS): https://dhalperi.github.io/linux-80211n-csitool/Remote sensing with low-cost ESP32 and 802.11n: https://academic.oup.com/jcde/article/7/5/644/5837600"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the industry response[1]:&gt;  &#34;It’s important to note that there is presently no evidence of the vulnerabilities being used against Wi-Fi users maliciously and these issues are mitigated through routine device updates once updated firmware becomes available.&gt; &#34;Like many previous vulnerabilities, FragAttacks has been academically well-researched and responsibly reported in a manner allowing the industry to proactively prepare and begin to roll out updates that fully eliminate the vulnerabilities. This set of vulnerabilities requires a potential attacker to be physically within range of the Wi-Fi network (or user device) in order to exploit it. This significantly reduces the likelihood of actual exploitation or attack.&#34;[1] https://www.commscope.com/blog/2021/wi-fi-alliance-discloses..."</p>

This means that the mixed key attack and the fragment cache attack, on their own, will be hard to exploit in practice, unless Wi-Fi 6 is used. When using Wi-Fi 6, which is based on the 802.11ax standard, a device may dynamically fragment frames to fill up available airtime.Why does this feel like Spectre?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dr. Martin Loetzsch did a great video, ETL Patterns with Postgres. He covers some really good topics:- Instead of updating tables build their replacements under a different name then rename them. This makes updating heavy-to-compute table instant. Works even for schemas: rebuild a schema  as schemaname_next rename the current to schemaname_old then rename schemaname_next to schemaname.- Keep all the source data raw and disable WAL, you don&#39;t need it for ETL.- Set memory limitis high.And lots of other good tips for doing ETL/DW in postgres. It&#39;s here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=whwNi21jAm4I really appreciate having data in postgres. It&#39;s often easy to think that a specialised DW tool will solve all your problems, but that often fails to consider things like:- Developer experience. Postgres runs very easily on a local machine, more specialized solutions often don&#39;t or are tricky to setup.- Learning another tool costs time. A developer can learn postgres really well in the time it takes them to figure out how to use several more specialised tools. And many devs already know postgres because it&#39;s pretty much the default  DB nowadays.- Analytics queries often don&#39;t need to run at warp speed. Bigquery might give you the answer in a second but if postgres does it in a minute and it&#39;s a weekly report, who cares?- Postgres is boring and has been around for many years now, it will probably still be here in 10 years so time spent learning it is time well spent. More niche systems will probably be superseded by fancier, faster replacements.I would go so far as to say don&#39;t necessarily need to split out your DW from your prod DB in every case. As soon as you start splitting out a DW to a separate server you need some way to keep it in sync, so you&#39;ll probably end up duplicating some business logic for a report, maintaining some ingestion app, shuffling data around S3 or whatever. Keeping your analytics in your prod DB (or just a snapshot of yesterdays DB) is often good enough and means you will be more likely to avoid gnarly business-rules going out of sync between your app and your DW."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A new Postgres-based darling is TimescaleDB.  It’s a drop-in for Postgres.It is a hybrid row column store with excellent compression and performance.It would be interesting to see how it compares if narrator would try it out.  Benchmarks would be cool.One very neat feature I am enamored  by is “continuous aggregates”.  These are materialized views that auto-update as you change the fact table.Continuous aggregates are a great idea.  InfluxDB had “continuous queries” (but the implementation of influx generally is not so neat), and firebolt has “aggregate indexes” which are much the same thing.I think all olap dbs will eventually have them as staple, and that they will trickle down into oltp too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Avoid Common Table Expressions (or upgrade to 12)Upgrading to 12 (or 13) seems like the better option here, whenever you&#39;re able to do so. The improvements are very much worth it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The aspect I find most interesting and internationally relevant is that as these local rulings proliferate, they kinda make it visible to what degree companies finance their operations by selling user data.  The more the business model relies on this, the more likely companies are to get hit with a ruling like this — and it&#39;s not just the ruling that&#39;s interesting, but also what Facebook&#39;s reaction will be.  If they stop offering or reduce WhatsApp services in Germany (or India), that&#39;s a great indicator that the service isn&#39;t profitable without the sale (or other commercial exploitation, Facebook is an ad company after all) of large amounts of user data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another Source - https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-11/facebook-...&gt; Johannes Caspar, who heads Hamburg’s privacy authority, issued a three-month emergency ban, prohibiting Facebook from continuing with the data collection. He also asked a panel of European Union data regulators to take action and issue a ruling across the 27-nation bloc. The new WhatsApp terms enabling the data scoop are invalid because they are intransparent, inconsistent and overly broad, he said."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is pretty vague. What does it even mean to ban Facebook &#34;from using data from WhatsApp users&#34;?Facebook &#34;uses data from WhatsApp users&#34; to support basic features like authentication, is that banned now? What about sending a WhatsApp message to a contact, doesn&#39;t that &#34;use data from WhatsApp users&#34;? Facebook has to look up some internal user ID (user data), then route the message to their devices, probably by device ID (also user data). How do you do that if using data banned?I suspect there&#39;s more to it but this particular article isn&#39;t telling the story in a particularly clear or helpful manner.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the US tax payer gets a significant stake in the chip fab venture, I would be OK with this. We want to secure national security via chip manufacturing and you want billions of dollars? Give us some upside.I don&#39;t want to hear it creates jobs, it generates blah blah blah, a real equity stake and possibly repayment of the capital. Creating jobs should be a happy by-product of subsidizing an industry that is probably more well capitalized than any other in existence.According to (https://startupanz.com/5-tech-giants-hold-588b-cash-reserves...) Amazon, Apple, Google, and Microsoft had 526 billion dollars between the four of them in cash reserves. They have over half a TRILLION dollars in cash. If this were life or death, they could afford anything.But the calculus is offload risk onto the tax payer (despite being a shareholder directly in all those companies or indirectly via mutual funds/etfs), I don&#39;t want to be left holding the bag with no upside beyond the general sentiment of &#39;national security was secured&#39; while private companies reap all the benefits."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing to consider is royalty rate. If you sell 5000 copies for $20 and earn a dollar per copy, you&#39;ve earned $5,000. (This math is based on 10% royalties on the publisher&#39;s portion, which is about half of retail. And no, fiction books don&#39;t sell for $20 typically, but I&#39;m using this number to make the math easy.)Now, if you sell 5000 copies of an ebook for $20 and earn 80% royalties, you earn $16 per copy, and earn $80,000. This is the royalty rate on Leanpub (disclosure: cofounder), but with Gumroad or blog + Stripe approaches you&#39;d earn an even better percentage (if you want to run your own store).For fiction, however, the dream combination is probably publishing in-progress with subscriptions. Currently it seems that Substack is the best for that. If you can get a few thousand people to subscribe for a few bucks a month, you could do well.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It would be interesting to have a timeseries plot of this sort of information. Did it used to be easier to make a living as an author? Presumably there was some point at which the ease of making a living as an author peaked. This article suggests that time is in the past, but how far in the past? Has the absolute number of people who can make it as an author decreased, or just the relative fraction of the human population? So many questions.I do also think that the expectation/standard of a $100k/year salary is a bit high. That&#39;s almost double the US median household income, for a job that can be done (some would argue is best done) from a house in the woods. I also know that some authors are turning to Patreon. N.K. Jemisen famously started a Patreon that allowed her to quit her job and begin writing full-time. I personally have donated &gt;$100 directly to favorite midlist authors who have made a big impact on my reading life.FWIW, I used to read more, but I still buy at least three or four full-priced books a year."</p>

DNS is a vital piece of infrastructure, and we should take steps to ensure it keeps working. Putting together task forces to make sure it is secure therefore sounds like a very good idea.Root servers might be out of scope to some degree for this however. Interestingly enough the root servers also aren&#39;t mentioned in the proposal itself, nor in the annex listing essential services. They&#39;re only mentioned in the lead up, which is the argument for why it&#39;s needed. It somewhat feels like they left it in accidentally, especially with the parliament immediately amending to scrap it from the lead up as well."</p>

At least if one wants to track any changes (seldom seen).I always have a copy of the current root.zone file.  If the public root servers all ceased operation I would not see any noticeable effects.However if the .com servers went down, I would have to use a local copy of the com.zone which is a much larger file to download (via FTP, HN&#39;s favourite protocol to make fun of).An easier alternative is to keep a custom zone file with all the domains that I use regularly.  Does any single end user really need access to the entire www.

This seems especially true at the junior level, which depresses junior salaries relative to other tech companies.Also, comparing compensation against US FAANG hiring is beyond insane. They pay ridiculous salaries due to the extremely limited and competitive market for hires that meet their caliber. This has driven up salaries, but should NOT be treated as an indicator for what &#34;reasonable&#34; pay looks like across the entire industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just to have a bit of a counter argument from me, a game developer who loves games and has worked in the US games industry for the majority of my 20 years career:If your argument is &#34;You can make more at a FAANG company&#34; - well yeah, you can. You don&#39;t work in gaming because you want to make the top salary. You work in gaming because you love games and you enjoy having all your coworkers also love games and being able to talk to all of them about games and having your company culture revolve around games and gaming. It&#39;s games all the way down! It&#39;s a completely different work environment. As someone who loves games, the best years of my working career were when I was working on game teams, not at tech companies.Also, developer salaries in games is still plenty good. It&#39;s still great money. I never felt like I was losing out.Also the argument that it&#39;s &#34;grueling 80+ hour weeks day in and day out is&#34; is bullshit! The only time I ever worked 80 hours in a single week was when I was starting out in Quality Assurance and I was getting paid hourly so I was happy to make the extra overtime. As a salaried developer I don&#39;t think I was ever expected to work more than 60 hours a week, and then after the crunch was over we always got 1 or 2 weeks of extra vacation (&#34;comp time&#34;). To be clear, the normal working schedule was 40 hours per week. Crunch time is like 1 or 2 times a year, for maybe 1-2 months each time. And like I said, depending on how much you crunch, you would get extra paid time off afterwards. So for me, that was a pretty good trade. I&#39;d much rather work my ass off for a couple months and then get an extra 2 week vacation at the end of it.Maybe some game companies treat their employees like dirt and work them into the ground, but the ones I&#39;ve worked for, I never felt that way. Don&#39;t work at those terrible companies! There are plenty of &#34;good&#34; game companies out there who pay good salaries and have good working conditions.As someone who is older now with kids, my priorities are definitely different than when I worked in games during my 20s and early 30s. I would no longer be happy working those 60 hour weeks. I want a better work life balance. So I don&#39;t know if I could work on a game team like that anymore. But do I regret working there before I had a family? Absolutely not. #gamedev4life"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I stayed in a small town outside Chablis, France, many years ago. I rented a room above the only restaurant in town. There were a few businesses, mostly food-related and clothing repair. Everything just seemed slowed down. I watched a man in waders unload a dead boar he had just shot to the butcher at 9am. I watched two other men repairing brickwork on a foundation. I watched another woman tending a large garden, then go to work at a bar/restaurant. The stores were open for just a few hours. The shelves were free of random plastic trinkets and gadgets.It just seemed like it was 1/10th the normal speed, somewhat Luddite... and every task seemed oddly fundamental.I&#39;ve also encountered towns like this in Spain, Greece, Austria, Mexico, Guatemala, Chile, Uruguay, Thailand and Cambodia.After reading these comments, I would never have believed that so many small towns exist that seem untouched by 24-hour stores and everything cheap and on-demand. It sounds inevitable that everyone is eventually pushed into hyperinflationary always-working mode. But yet, these places persist. I might even chalk it up to depressed economies and &#34;third-world&#34; nature, but my samples include all sorts of economies.I think we choose what kind of lifestyle we want, but it needs to be done at the community level. Without going all &#34;we should all be farmers hippie dippy portland nature fetishist&#34;, it does seem like decisions have consequences and it is possible to steer away from hyperactivity."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The roots of this phenomenon can be traced back to the &#39;Protestant work ethic&#39; in the 16th Century - a worldview held by white Protestants in Europe that made hard work and the quest for profit seem virtuous. Sally Maitlis, professor of organisational behaviour and leadership at the University of Oxford, says that &#34;later, the drive for efficiency that arose out of the Industrial Revolution&#34;, as well as the way we prize productivity, have &#34;further embedded the value of consistent hard work, often at the cost of personal wellbeing&#34;.The roots of the valorization of work may well have been religious, and maybe Christian (though I very much doubt it&#39;s exclusively Christian in its origin), but it&#39;s definitely spread throughout much of the world, even among the non-religious and even atheist population.I can&#39;t count the number of times I&#39;ve heard people praise others as &#34;hard working&#34;... in all sorts of contexts, in many different parts of the world, native or immigrant, hard work is praised to the heavens and one of the best things you can say about a person is that they&#39;re hard working.I almost never hear the value of working hard being questioned, except when the subject turns to burnout.  Then everybody nods sagely and agrees that overwork is bad.. the next day they go back to praising hard workers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Six-day work week was standard like, what, 100 years ago? Now it just seems savage. And so will the five-day work week.I had the luck of getting a four month severance when a company closed, full salary, full benefits. I lined up a new job and just said I will start later.Let me tell you, going back into a tech job, 10 to 6-ish PM every day was no joke, after three months of not giving a fuck. It was torture. I could not understand how I did it until then. And there was that painful realization of &#34;what am I doing here for eight hours a day? I am clearly not using all of it. Give me four hours and I will do the same amount of work and go live my life&#34;.And that&#39;s when I knew that I am not going to be the guy on his deathbed, realizing that he worked too hard and didn&#39;t live, after winning the cosmic lottery of being born on such a rare place as planet Earth."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Roger Cicala knows a lot about lenses and pushed lens manufacturers to have better testing and quality, he created https://www.lensrentals.com/ because he got sick with low quality checks of lenses:When I started Lensrentals I had a lot of conversations with service centers that went like this. Me: &#34;That lens you repaired still sucks&#34;. Person at service center: &#34;No, it’s within specs&#34;. Me: &#34;What are the specs?&#34; Service center: &#34;We can’t tell you&#34;. One day, after I raised hell with a factory service manager, he patted me on the head and said, “testing lenses is complicated; you don’t have the background to understand.”Any of you who has ever seen a physician after someone says something like ‘you wouldn&#39;t understand; it’s complicated’ knows what happened next. I had no option but to spend a couple of years buying testing equipment, offering internships to really smart optical engineering students, and developing a lens testing center and methodology that was as good as anything in the industry.He is also capable of writing about hard topics in a way that most people can understand them.Anyone interested in camera lenses should read also his previous posts https://www.dpreview.com/members/1329131098"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a bunch of full frame lenses.Recently I looked at some very old ones I haven&#39;t used in a long time. I thought they are faulty (soft).After some diagnosing I found that it is not the fault of lenses but rather in the meantime I have started looking at images at 1:1 in Lightroom and gotten used to ridiculously sharp images from new cameras.Have you ever watched an old TV show and despaired how unwatchable it is because of low quality of image? Yes, that&#39;s the same thing -- our tastes change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a couple of other big reasons related to differences between film and digital sensors.First film is much less sensitive to the angle at which light strikes it. There are some great, sharp old lens designs from leica, zeiss and others that show heavy light fall off in the corners on digital sensors. This is a big part of why even f1.8 or 2 lenses need to be more complicated.Next film grain itself has sharp edges which effectively sharpens images a bit and also limits the resolution and generally has a pleasing effect when viewed at high magnification. With digital you don&#39;t get that and lens flaws get a lot more obvious."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think a lot of this analysis is tautological -- meaning that when you boil it down, you&#39;re just saying that things are as you have defined them to be.For instance, take a Big Five trait such as agreeableness. How do we know that a person is agreeable? Because we define agreeableness in a certain way and then measure the degree to which someone conforms to the definition. If that measurement includes questions such as, &#34;Do others find you easy to get along with?&#34; then of course there&#39;s going to be a negative correlation with loneliness, because you&#39;ve essentially defined it that way.I am the author of Correlated.org, which commits many different types of statistical errors for humor&#39;s sake, so this leaps out at me. By the way, for a surprisingly vast number of things, agreeableness is quite predictive. Food preferences, public policy positions, and even willingness to answer poll questions :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author is making a subtle mistake; evolution doesn&#39;t mean like-parent-like-child.Evolution is likely selecting for, eg, people who have children at a certain ratio of introverted-extroverted.Introverted, disagreeable, high-contentious types make, for example, great scientists. A population (call it A) that produces a reasonable number of such people is at a huge advantage compared to the alternative that only produces extroverted agreeable types (call them B).Population B will be more competitive at breeding, but population A will win any conflict with B because they&#39;ll have a bunch of weirdos in the back room producing a lot of high quality science (a classic stereotype with some foundation in truth).Note that men are much more likely (something like 4x) to be &#34;completely homosexual&#34; compared to women [0]. I&#39;m betting this is because having a few men who opt out of the race to pass on their genes and focus on other stuff is a massive advantage to the society that hosts them. Look how much of a force gay men have been in culture for example.Locally catastrophic for breeding, globally optimal for society. The equilibrium isn&#39;t for all offspring to maximise their chance of breeding. The optimum is for the community to thrive.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_sexual_orienta..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of all of the personality traits I have attempted to change over the years, my introversion has remained the most stubborn.  It&#39;s a shame, too.  I can briefly emulate extraversion, at an enormous cost of mental energy and feel like a dog walking on its hind legs.  Nor do I seem to be able to extract the purported benefits of it.  And the list of approaches I have exhausted is, in retrospect, more than a little shocking.  It&#39;s the one area where &#34;fake it until you make it&#34; seems to have failed me utterly."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Pair programming generates visceral responses due to it being introduced as if it were fact, which for me always triggers my spidey senses. People who didn&#39;t like it were told &#34;you&#39;re doing it wrong&#34; or &#34;you didn&#39;t give it a proper chance&#34;. Dismissing criticisms out of hand only furthers distrust, regardless of the actual value of the idea.I played along and paired for awhile, but now steadfastly refuse to pair, ever. I work best within my own mind, and the distraction of talking to someone breaks my concentration such that I&#39;m unable to keep the big picture in my head anymore. The irritation of being that close to someone and having to engage with them for even half an hour is draining, and I took more frequent and longer breaks because of this (much to the annoyance of my pair-partner, who couldn&#39;t work while I was away).There may very well be people who work well in pairs, but rest assured that there are those who aren&#39;t built that way. Don&#39;t disparage them, don&#39;t discriminate against them, and don&#39;t play the moral superiority game with them. Accept their diversity and be a better team for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also worked at a company where pairing was mandatory for 8 hours a day. Plan was concocted by two tech leads who, of course, didn&#39;t pair themselves.The exhaustion was visible, and productivity was very low. Since everyone vocally thought it was a &#34;waste of time&#34;, there was a Fight-club-style &#34;rule&#34; where we couldn&#39;t talk about the downsides in public or even in Scrum meetings. We missed several deadlines for an MVP, code quality was abysmal and the product barely worked.It stopped when the CEO took issue with it. He gathered the team to ask &#34;why is the productivity so low?&#34;. There was an awkward moment where a junior dev was trying to answer but a tech lead was trying to tell him &#34;don&#39;t break the rule&#34;.It was an absolutely surreal experience, but not out of place in that startup.EDIT: I also remember one of the tech leads complaining during a Sprint Retro that some of us weren&#39;t reading Slack fast enough, and we said &#34;well, I was paring, I wasn&#39;t at my computer&#34;, to which he became a bit agitated and visibly angry. It was an awful place to work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’ve had incredible experiences pairing.There were whiteboards, snacks, rating each other’s themes, and jokes.What worked very well was to pair for conceptional problems, like architecture and defining modules and their interfaces. Commit some types and pseudo-code.We’d then break away and work at our own speed and in our own style using the common foundation.Come together to integrate and discuss.Pairing is also worth it’s weight in gold for debugging. It’s like a rubber duck, but doesn’t feel wrong.It is of course of utmost importance that both parties enjoy it. Else it’s pain and a waste of everybody’s time. I had a colleague who hated it like the plague. In which case short code/review cycles worked best.A good tool, if employed correctly. Like most things, really. And fuck management if they force it down on me."</p>

By that time it was already more useful to me than the Encyclopedia Britannica, and getting better all the time. The trajectory was clear.It seems like, of all the exciting things from the early web, Wikipedia has been one of the only things that actually panned out the way it was intended. It didn&#39;t get commercialized, but it didn&#39;t go broke either. It didn&#39;t become a cesspool, or try to consume all of my attention. It just does the thing it&#39;s supposed to do. If there was a fire on the internet, and I could only save one website, it would be you Wikipedia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wikipedia is one of, if not the best thing(s) to happen to the internet. It achieved basically what the internet&#39;s aim was: to democratize information.Even when I have to learn something, ANYTHING, I&#39;ll go to Wikipedia, after which I read the sources of the article for in depth research. And while I dislike their political articles a lot, the science, math, history and arts articles are genuinely incredible to read."</p>

This is different, and more toxic, than all of the in—app purchase stuff — you’re telling indie developers that no matter how hard they try, they won’t be able to match the functionality of Apple’s special friends.Otherwise, well, there goes your narrative of having a level playing field. The problem with this is, the loss of trust results in a slow, unending decay that only becomes obvious in retrospect.It may not seem like it, but billions of dollars of value are at stake with little things like this. If you work at Apple, you should raise the alarm."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another weird example is how Apple&#39;s own &#34;Clips&#34; app has a special private entitlement that bypasses the permission prompt for camera access.Would it hurt them so much to prompt for camera access the first time the app is started after installing it from the app store?I found that extremely worrying as it means I can no longer trust the app store to provide a safe sandboxed environment. Suddenly there&#39;s an app with this special no-cam-permission entitlement and your mugshot is uploaded when you believed the ios camera permission system would have protected you.Oh, but Apple would only ever grant that permission to its own apps? Better hope we&#39;ll never get a repeat of the PsychicPaper exploit!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is what bothers me most about Apple devices and software. They probably have the &#34;best&#34; devices out there in terms of user experience. I use an iPhone and iPad every day because of it. But they keep very tight control over what software can be installed and run on it in order to safeguard their views on UX and security/privacy.This means for me as a developer that it&#39;s hard to write software and tools for my own devices without having to deal with Apple in some way or root the devices. Some things are even clearly impossible because of these private entitlements: There is no way for me to explore the CarPlay API&#39;s to experiment with my own ideas.A small part of me hopes that the Epic lawsuit and recent developments can lead to more abilities for sideloading on iDevices."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Robin Hobb is one of my favorite authors. Her masterwork is a series of series (four trilogies and a quadrology) known as The Realm of the Elderlings.She published the first trilogy, which begins with Assassin&#39;s Apprentice, starting in 1995. I saw the books when they first came out and I assumed from the title and the cover that it would be a cheesy fantasy by the numbers, so I never bought it. But I kept hearing about these books from other people who liked SFF, so I finally picked up the first trilogy.I was completely wrong. It&#39;s not at all by the numbers. While it&#39;s not trope-free (nothing is), there are all sorts of interesting ideas, from the political to ecological. As you read the later series, the world opens up quite a bit, and it gets even more interesting. The final trilogy brings so many elements together, and the ending is shatteringly powerful.While this is epic fantasy, it&#39;s _not_ at all grimdark. Bad things definitely happen, but it&#39;s more hopeful and humane than something like Malazan or Song of Ice and Fire.I can&#39;t recommend these books highly enough. Even if her writing is slowing down, I hope that she&#39;s satisfied with what she&#39;s done. This series alone is an enormous accomplishment. To build a world across so many books, across so many years, and have it come together so well in the end is massively impressive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"70?  My animal is only 33 and is very tired.  Writing this as it lays in bed, 3 in the afternoon, because even a standard chair sounds more exhausting to it.It seems to have no motivation or energy to do much besides lay here.If I force it, it will get stuff done but at a huge cost.  It will yearn the entire time to just lay back down.It&#39;s interest in things seems to be fading quickly.  What desire it used to have to work hard and succeed, has slipped away.  It seems these days it has only enough energy to lay in bed and scroll through the internet.  Not sure what is wrong with my animal, but this is no way for it to live.I was hard on the animal in its early 20s, but no harder than the average animal.  The past 7 years or so have actually been pretty calm, good food, semi regular exercise,  stable job, etc.It&#39;s scary to imagine how the animal would feel at 70 if this is how it feels at 33.  Maybe the pandemic was a straw to its back, and the isolation has worn it down more than anything else possibly could."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Better food, more exercise, more relaxation... but I also wonder if it would have made any difference.Yes. I&#39;m only half OP&#39;s age but working out and eating well (well for me means much more) has made all the little aches I started to have in my 20s go away and made me much calmer, I can also sleep pretty much anywhere and at any time.More interestingly though,Me, and the animal I live inside.there is no animal you live inside, this is not a meat vehicle for something else, your body is you, it&#39;s not some machine you merely inhabit. Its/your gut will affect your mood, its limitations are your limitations, being physically strong will make you feel strong and keep anxieties at bay."</p>

Yes, you can diy it in your garage, here&#39;s a wonderful implementation. http://sam.zeloof.xyz/first-ic/But take a look at the specialized tools they used. Heck, think about proper handling of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrofluoric_acid and this is just a simple amp. imagine trying to make something with lots of gates?Making a single chip is _hard_. And that&#39;s just for a one off. doing that at scale requires an amazing amount of process control. And that diy chip is, according to the author &#34;5µm (1975 tech. level)&#34;Anyway, yes, you could make a chip in your garage, but it&#39;d take a lot of time to ramp up, and you&#39;d only have 1."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Classically trained pianist here (since 7 years old), I like the article&#39;s advice.&gt; Use the correct fingering, dynamics, articulation, etc. from the very beginning; you are never going to get around to “fixing” it later.When I was an impatient kid my piano teachers would keep insisting I play sections slow on a first pass, which annoyed me (it was like reading a book out loud slowly), but it was only until many years later when I played pieces like Un Sospiro[0] which are intractable if you do not start practicing at something like 16 times slower than performance tempo.  If you start out correctly, the rest will follow, and IME, sight reading greatly improves as well.&gt; [...] you may reach a point where you can’t play any faster, no matter how hard you try. What is likely happening is that the hand motions you are using—which come naturally at the slower tempo you started with—simply will not work at such high speeds.This is completely true, for instance, in ragtime, the left hand makes big, quick jumps and there is often no time to look at where it will land (which one likely does when playing slowly), so repeating a bar over and over again to incrementally refine your distance estimate is crucial.This applies to things like typing on a keyboard as well, if you focus on correct finger placement (and correct use of the 4th and 5th fingers), your WPM might take a hit for a few days or a week, but in the long term it really helps.[0] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=po_a1SmZKLs"</p>

Performers want to present a piece as if it was never practiced and was all made up on the spot, and yet we do have to practice a piece day after day. Losing vitality and &#34;becoming rehearsed&#34; through over-practice is a real problem.The book &#34;A Soprano on Her Head&#34; by Eloise Ristad, who was a piano teacher, really helped me with my dance &amp; acting practice. I restructured a lot based on that book (added improvisational elements, reduced forceful drill-like elements, more self-observation, less verbal cues), and my technique and enjoyment both improved a lot during covid lockdown.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve wondered what the effect our modern digital economy has had on consumer price inflation.Normally, an increase in money supply would cause consumer goods to increase in price, since more people are able to buy them and there is a limit on how much of any particular physical good is available.This isn&#39;t the case, however, for digital goods. If there are suddenly 100 million new people who want to buy a Netflix subscription, it isn&#39;t like we are going to see the price of a Netflix subscription go up because there isn&#39;t enough Netflix to go around. The marginal cost for a new subscriber is practically zero, so there should be no price increase caused by a shortage.It would be easy to see that inflation would be essentially zero if ALL goods people wanted to buy were digital ones... no amount of demand can eat up the supply, since supply is practically infinite.Of course, in the real world, some goods are digital and some are physical. If you gave everyone $5000, some of that would go to Netflix subscriptions, which wouldn&#39;t effect consumer prices, and some would go to buying TVs to play Netflix on, which WOULD cause inflation.I am curious how much of our current &#34;low inflation even with an increasing money supply&#34; is caused by our increasing spending on non-exclusionary goods."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some personal anecdotes. I grew up during the hyperinflation days in Brazil (80s, early 90s): talking about 60% a month.People would get their salary and run to the supermarket and buy everything they needed for the month, because if they waited a single day the prices would have changed. A lot of people internalized that habit and still do that nowadays (not in the sense of running to the supermarket, but buying a lot for the whole month).This was before barcodes, and every item had a price label on it. Supermarkets had people employed full time just to be remarking the items. I remember running to pick up an item on one end of a shelf while the employee was remarking the items coming from the other end, so you could buy the item at yesterday&#39;s price.I lived through 6 currency changes. Usually when prices started being in the scale of millions, the government would announce that in a very short period (sometimes that being next week), there was a new currency with a new name and 1000 OLD = 1 NEW. Until the government could replace all existing bills, the old bills would be accepted as if they were the new bills (at 1/1000 of the face value, of course). Old bills passing through the banking system would be stamped with the name of the new currency and the new value before being put back into circulation.Contracts like rentals were all indexed: there was a clause saying the price would be corrected every month using the official index that tracked the inflation. Or were pegged to the dollar. This by itself fed into the positive feedback loop that was perpetuating the hyperinflation.The government tried some bizarre measures to tame inflation. Often they would try freezing all prices, but that was never sustainable for long. The craziest one was probably in 1990 when the government simply froze 80% of everybody&#39;s money in the bank for 18 months to reduce the amount of money in the economy. This was a total disaster and even caused many suicides.In 1994 hyperinflation was finally tamed when the current currency, Real, was introduced. It was the culmination of an ingenious plan that actually worked.Feel free to ask me more, if you&#39;re interested."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It always amuses me that large cats are no different than house cats, they seem to act exactly the same including sitting in boxes [1].Only difference is when the large cat gets annoyed for unknown reasons it kills you rather than just scratching your arm up and that’s just due to a difference in size not behavior it seems.1. https://www.pinterest.com/pin/404268504021009708/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very sad I can&#39;t view the figures, which appear to include at least a couple of shots of cats sitting in things. It looks like the Kanizsa square illusion they&#39;re referring to is this: https://puzzlewocky.com/optical-illusions/kanizsa-square-and..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obfuscated Javascript didn&#39;t render here (Chromebook), found what looked like the abstract:&#34;A well-known phenomenon to cat owners is the tendency of their cats to sit in enclosed spaces such as boxes, laundry baskets, and even shape outlines taped on the floor. This investigative study asks whether domestic cats (&lt;em&gt;Felis silvestris catus&lt;/em&gt;) are also susceptible to sitting in enclosures that are illusory in nature, utilizing cats’ attraction to box-like spaces to assess their perception of the Kanizsa square visual illusion. Carried out during the COVID-19 pandemic, this study randomly assigned citizen science participants Booklets of six randomized, counterbalanced daily stimuli to print out, prepare, and place on the floor in pairs. Owners observed and videorecorded their cats’ behavior with the stimuli and reported findings from home over the course of the six daily trials. This study ultimately reached over 500 pet cats and cat owners, and of those, 30 completed all of the study’s trials. Of these, nine cat subjects selected at least one stimulus by sitting within the contours (illusory or otherwise) with all limbs for at least three seconds. This study revealed that cats selected the Kanizsa illusion just as often as the square and more often than the control, indicating that domestic cats may treat the subjective Kanizsa contours as they do real contours. Given the drawbacks of citizen science projects such as participant attrition, future research would benefit from replicating this study in controlled settings. To the best of our knowledge, this investigation is the first of its kind in three regards: a citizen science study of cat cognition; a formal examination into cats’ attraction to 2D rather than 3D enclosures; and study into cats’ susceptibility to illusory contours in an ecologically relevant paradigm. This study demonstrates the potential of more ecologically valid study of pet cats, and more broadly provides an interesting new perspective into cat visual perception research.&#34;Thought that might be of interest to other who, like me, couldn&#39;t grok the headline."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something like this is so sorely needed.I&#39;ve been doing some work in ag-tech for the past few years (having previously worked in ISP/telco, general SME web/mobile development, then consumer travel tech).The tools available to farmers/growers for what should be quite basic things - i.e., web-connected weather stations and monitoring systems for soil moisture, frost alarms and irrigation control are terrible.The industry is full of small players who take a look and think &#34;I know how to build stuff with [Arduino/Raspberry Pi/Zigbee etc], I can build an ag-tech monitoring/control product easily&#34;.So everyone builds a hardware product from scratch, then as a quick afterthought, a web app with an SQL database and Highcharts to show data graphs. You have an MVP within a few months, then a few paying customers in your local community, then suddenly your customers start asking for features you&#39;d never thought of, like sensor inputs you didn&#39;t know existed, or combined displays of different kinds of data you&#39;d never considered anyone would want, or needing it to be faster (SQL turns out to be really slow for this kind of data) or more reliable (bugfixing is hard when your devices are hundreds of miles away and connected via weak 3G/4G data links), and you realise your hardware and software architecture doesn&#39;t support any of this, and you&#39;d have to completely start over to actually deliver something that customers really need, but you&#39;re out of money and energy.The result is a lot of farmers/growers dissatisfied/frustrated at never being able to get the monitoring systems they need (some of them having tried 3+ different vendors), and a lot of new companies trying to build new solutions and going bust.I&#39;ve been thinking there needs to be some widely accepted open standards in the industry for hardware and software platforms, so solutions providers can avoid trying to re-invent everything and instead focus on integration of tried-and-true building blocks.If this initiative brings that about, it would be a big win for everyone in the industry."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Of interest to me because I have been doing agricultural process monitoring and production control systems for about 30 years. And most of my clients&#39; systems are at least semi-custom and re-invent wheels for no other purpose other than to do it their way; that is, silos (pun not intended). But where NDAs and IP agreements allow, I have attempted to standardize some architectures.But was disappointing to see the way the LF is organizing this - no representation from the ag industry&#39;s heavy hitters and no specific and attainable goals.Should this be done by an Operating Systems organization? Other than centralized control and logistical systems, ag engineering is not the realm of microprocessors and operating systems, and code monkeys. Ag engineering is a world of hardware, micro-controllers, FSMs, and scheduler stacks.But then, if not the LF, whom has the organization to do this?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It is a ridiculous feature of modern C that you have to write the super verbose &#34;mask and shift&#34; code, which then gets compiled to a simple `mov` and maybe a `bswap`. Wheras, the direct equivalent in C, an assignment with a (type changing) cast, is illegal. There is a huge mismatch between the assumptions of the C spec and actual machine code.One of the few reasons I ever even reached to C is the ability to slurp in data and reinterpret it as a struct, or the ability to reason in which registers things will show up and mix in some `asm` with my C.I think there should really be a dialect of C(++) where the machine model is exactly the physical machine. That doesn&#39;t mean the compiler can&#39;t do optimizations, but it shouldn&#39;t do things like prove code as UB and fold everything to a no-op. (Like when you defensively compare a pointer to NULL that according to spec must not be NULL, but practically could be...)`-fno-strict-overflow -fno-strict-aliasing -fno-delete-null-pointer-checks` gets you halfway there, but it would really only be viable if you had a blessed `-std=high-level-assembler` or `-std=friendly-c` flag."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rust gets this right. These primitives are available for all the numeric types.    u32::from_le_byte(bytes) // u32 from 4 bytes, little endian
    u32::from_be_byte(bytes) // u32 from 4 bytes, big endian
    u32::to_le_bytes(num) // u32 to 4 bytes, little endian
    u32::to_be_bytes(num) // u32 to 4 bytes, big endian

This was very useful to me recently as I had to write the marshaling and un-marshaling for a game networking format with hundreds of messages. With primitives like this, you can see what&#39;s going on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is why, in 2021, the mantra that C is a good language for these low level byte twiddling tasks needs to die. Dealing with alignment and endianness properly requires a language that allows you to build abstractions.The following is perfectly well defined in C++, despite looking like almost the same as the original unsafe C:    #include &lt;boost/endian.hpp&gt;
    #include &lt;cstdio&gt;
    using namespace boost::endian;

    unsigned char b[5] = {0x80,0x01,0x02,0x03,0x04};

    int main() {
        uint32_t x = *((big_uint32_t*)(b+1));
        printf(&#34;%08x\n&#34;, x);
    }

Note that I deliberately misaligned the pointer by adding 1.https://gcc.godbolt.org/z/5416oefjx[Edit] Fun twist: the above code doesn&#39;t work where the intermediate variable x is removed because printf itself is not type safe, so no type conversion (which is when the bswap is deferred to) happens. In pure C++ when using a type safe formatting function (like fmt or iostreams) this wouldn&#39;t happen. printf will let you throw any garbage in to it. tl;dr outside embedded use cases writing C in 2021 is fucking nuts."</p>

Walking through a formula example would be helpful, and formaluae exist to communicate exactly this kind of clumpy-wumpy-lumpy-timey-wimey awkwardness language clods through in its quest to communicate mathematical structures."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This probably isn&#39;t the right place for this question. But the right kind of people will be reading this thread so I will ask it.In college physics my teacher insisted that, despite gravity being popularly referred to as a force, it is not a force. Weight is indeed a force, but gravity is more like a field. I understood it like this: Say you have a point mass in an isolated system. There is certainly gravity all around that mass, but there are no forces anywhere in the system. Not until another mass is introduced into the system do you have any forces. It is apparent from the formula for force since then you have that new mass times the acceleration of gravity.Or is this just being pedantic and does it even matter?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Most theorists assume that gravity actually pushes us around through particlesIs this true, and if so, why? The interpretation of gravity as something that warps spacetime very elegantly yields its “gravitational force” via its effect on the action integral, and is easily understood using a path integral style framework. It seems like a particle-based framework would necessarily be a lot more complicated, although maybe it’s necessary for some reason I don’t know."</p>

Eventually people will tire of writing backflip code to sidestep pitfalls in the Intel HT design and simply return the responsibility to Intel, where its existed since day one.It could be argued Intels mouthpiece has already lost its ability to convince major datacenter and cloud customers that HT is even remotely safe as a continued investment.

He had a plastic bucket that he put them in with some old newspapers scraps in the bottom. I heard that before the war they didn&#39;t even need money. He&#39;d simply bring a bucket of milk, and he&#39;d get a bucket of eggs in return. But it was of course a lot simpler to bring money. It was far cheaper than in the store too.My grandfather knew what all the birds were singing. Every bit, plus their behaviour. He&#39;d especially heed the magpie, because it&#39;s a smarter bird. If it warbled this way, it meant that the weather would stay warm. If they warbled in another way, it meant that it might become rainy. He said that the birds knew, because their lives depended on it.Another more commonly known sign is dependent on where the magpie makes its nest. If it it&#39;s high in the tree, then it will most likely be a warm and sunny summer. But if it is tucked way down in the tree, the summer will be cold and wet. It makes sense. There&#39;s more protection from the elements further under the leaves, but it&#39;s also colder there. If I were a magpie, I&#39;d want to make a warm and nice nest for the summer, but all that could be ruined if I didn&#39;t heed the weather.One day, the grouse was seen perching atop the family house. When I told this to my grandmother, she went silent at first, and then she told me that it means someone will die in the family. This was of course terrifying news to me. But it also turned out to become true, because my grandfather also died that year. May he rest in peace."</p>

He leaves behind him more of a legacy than many of us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Happiness - he&#39;s found it.Sure, he&#39;s an extreme and very few want to emulate it because there&#39;s a mild element of delusion. But, he&#39;s found the thing so many of us work our entire lives for only to never find.Part of life is letting happiness find you, part of life is finding happiness, and part of life is pushing away things to find happiness in what you have.I say, well done."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"First thing that came to my mind when I opened this: hey let&#39;s test if maximization is just as broken as in real MacOS. And oh my god it is indeed! Safari won&#39;t maximize to the entire screen, just like in the real thing, and other apps like the terminal maximize correctly. Wow, this level of attention to detail is really crazy! :-)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can even open the website recursively within its own &#34;Safari&#34; window. The recursion depth seems to be limited to one though. Nice easter egg nonetheless.Edit: It&#39;s possible to bypass the recursion limit. First open the &#34;Blog&#34; bookmark on the Safari start page. Use Inspect Element on the &#34;portfolio&#34; link at the top right, and remove    target=&#34;_blank&#34;

from the HTML. Open the portfolio and enjoy infinite recursion."</p>

Not only Sci-Hub is an undeniable disruption, but also an amazing technical feat that many startups would envy.[0]: https://greenelab.github.io/scihub-manuscript/[1]: https://translate.google.com/translate?sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=https...[2]: 3 articles × each 2 MB × per 400k users ~ 2.4 TB.P.S.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Small business near me never seem to have online catalogues or stock levels.Hunting for a specific product (for example a washing line) might involve walking into 3 different shops and guessing which shop might sell what you need.  When you arrive in the shop, they always arrange aisles differently so unless you have 20 minutes to hunt you might not find it either.Whereas online it&#39;s a simple search and click &#34;buy now&#34;.  It&#39;s probably cheaper too.Bricks and mortar shops need to do a lot of work on the shopping experience before they&#39;re competitive.   The only time bricks and mortar shops win are when I need something right now or groceries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’d be happy to support local merchants, but they have to get the overall value proposition somewhat competitive. For the most part, they aren’t. Maybe it’s pricing, selection, policies, hours of operation, or some combination, but other than grocers and large chains, I’m not even sure they’re trying.Amazon is winning by serving the customers. Local shops will continue to have a hard time if the primary value prop is “we’re more expensive and not as good, but we’re your neighbor, so you owe us!”I try every so often to use a local shop. Maybe I need a common appliance, lawn mower, or small engine part. If they have it on-hand, I’ll pay 5x the online price to get the job done today. I can only recall one time where that worked. “We can get it for you” only to find out that means a week and 4x the online price. “No thanks; I don’t want to be a bother...” &lt;tap, tap, wait 2-3 days, done&gt;Our dishwasher door broke last Thursday; I fixed it in 30 minutes that Saturday afternoon with a $30 part I ordered on Thursday. Don’t even know how long it would take to setup a $150-200 repair appointment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a really good idea! I love my small businesses but being coddled by the internet is so real, you get used to immediately finding exactly what you want. With local stores, you have to put in some work sometimes, and ghasp talk to real people, potentially a few, at different stores, to get what you need. It sounds like a lot written out like that, but the important bits are that the people you talk to, you learn things from, and that makes you better at finding things.This tool is kind of like that effect, or an easing into it from someone who may have just bought the first-worst thing on Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great, I will eventually uninstall it when they make me. I only keep it around to deal with people that haven&#39;t switched to Signal or Telegram yet. I have all three on my phone. Whatsapp usage has dropped a lot lately in my circle of friends. I removed Facebook Messenger ages ago (nobody I know uses that anymore). Just like the Facebook app and instagram. Whatsapp is the last bit of Facebook software on my phone.I&#39;ve been watching this corporate stupidity train wreck play out over the last few months. Every time I open whatsapp I get an obnoxious dialog urging me to pretty please accept their T&amp;Cs. I click it away because I can. The fact that I can amuses me because it signals a certain amount of despair by Facebook. It&#39;s not normal for an app to be usable without accepting the terms and conditions.The dilemma Facebook has is the very real problem that people are opting to uninstall rather than accept. Their users are angry and disgruntled. Which is why they are allowing people to use the app without accepting the terms and conditions. Which is of course highly unusual. From a legal point of view, until I agree, the old T&amp;Cs apply. Basically they are saying those were actually fine and nothing really changed and it&#39;s all cosmetics but bla bla bla could you please accept the new ones anyway. It&#39;s a very weird position to take legally.Either the old T&amp;Cs were fine and there never was a reason to change them or the new ones materially change the old T&amp;Cs and they should just state in plain language why and how. Instead we get this months long weaseling that is no doubt partially inspired by the fact that they are under a lot of scrutiny by authorities in the EU and US for privacy violations, monopolistic tendencies, data leaks, etc. The real issue is that the new T&amp;Cs are of course designed to carve out some legal wiggle room there for Facebook to do user hostile things like ads and tracking. So they are in fact a change and they need users to swallow that."</p>

I&#39;ve tried, yet they always message me through WhatsApp. They&#39;re not people i can really ignore either.Anyway, i guess this is mostly a rant.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The following was posted on Macrumors. Definitely not a perfect user-first response from Apple, but didn&#39;t seem terrible either. Particularly because Apple wasn&#39;t the source of the issue, the issue was people downloading an unofficial XCode tool not made or hosted by Apple. Apple discovered it (just like many researchers did) and made various (non-perfect) efforts to mitigate it. And according to Macrumors, the attack did not really lead to any serious consequences. Not sure if that&#39;s true but I haven&#39;t seen any evidence to the contrary either.&gt; Apple did ultimately inform users that downloaded XcodeGhost apps, and also published a list of the top 25 most popular apps that were compromised. Apple removed all of the infected apps from the  App Store , and provided information to developers to help them validate Xcode going forward.&gt; XcodeGhost was a widespread attack, but it was not effective or dangerous. At the time, Apple said that it had no information to suggest that the malware was ever used for any malicious purpose nor that sensitive personal data was stolen, but it did collect app bundle identifiers, network details, and device names and types."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember there are some laws about disclosing breaches. Did this happened before those laws or the letter of the law does not apply in this specific case.For the anti-regulation guys, please explain how free market helps in this or similar cases and why a law to demand transparency for this cases is also evil. (I am still waiting on other threads an explanation that regulation that only forces transparency and what is tracked and shared is bad and free market solves it better)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As for why anyone would download this &#34;counterfeit&#34; copy of Xcode (quoting from TFA):&gt; XcodeGhost billed itself as faster to download in China, compared with Xcode available from Apple.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a huge milestone for the Starship team and SpaceX, so massive congratulations.This was also fun to watch. Fun in part because while SpaceX had it on &#34;tape delay&#34; the enthusiast channels were showing it live. It will be fun to have them do it without the low cloud cover but I&#39;m guessing that without the disassembly at the end they may have some on-board recordings that are recoverable.To whomever does telemetry for these things, the frequency bands you are using are blocked by clouds. It makes it hard to keep a live signal. Ask the FCC for a temporary operating permit for 900Mhz or so. You will be much happier with the results.I was paying close attention to the area of &#39;heat shield&#39; tiles. That is the next really big hurdle. If you recall getting the grid fins on F9 to survive re-entry was a big challenge. Getting tiles that don&#39;t break because the various expansion coefficients don&#39;t match is a big challenge as well. That is critical to having enough fuel left over to stop when you get back down inside the gravity well.It is easy to forget the scale of this thing without visual cues but its like flying skyscrapers around. They are very big. And the booster will be larger still.Also super curious how the lunar lander version will work. That is awfully high up there, could be a long ladder down to the surface. That, and given its mass, means that when it lands on the moon the dust it kicks up will hit escape velocity[1] which will be interesting.All in all though, so much progress in space after so much non-progress. Quite the thrill![1] https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.12312"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the previous tests Spacex used 2-3 rocket engines for the initial landing burn.For SN15, the rocket used 2 engines throughout the landing procedure. I wonder if this is a sign of their confidence in the improved design.The landing was smooth as butter and nothing went noticeably wrong, although I did noticed that the rocket landed dangerous close to the edge of the concrete pad."</p>

I was shocked when I first saw these living if()s in the server-side C++ code but then realized it was vital for debugging in production.People also used to prefer table based jump over long if-else-if chain for anecdotal performance reasons. That has gradually changed over the evolution of CPUs with various optimizations like the branch prediction. Now some JIT impls like tracing JIT replace virtual function calls with if-elses.By the way, I&#39;m glad that the article is so thoughtfully written that it doesn&#39;t include any ambiguous &#34;best practices&#34; at the end. It could have created yet another myth. The three top tips in the article is more about stating facts. I admire the author taking that stance."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The headline is true but suggests a far more sinister implication than what is actually going on.A few things that need to be taken in context here.- The materials in question were sent to China, Taiwan, Canada and Ireland.- As others have mentioned, Honeywell sent commercially-available schematics to the above countries, not classified information. The article mentions that Honeywell sent parts relating to the engine, this could literally just be a valve or bearing component. I doubt this kind of information is usable unless you have a ton of additional documentation describing their function and utility as a sub-assembly.- Honeywell reported this themselves. A bunch of articles on this topic use the phrase &#39;Honeywell admits...&#39; as if this was some kind of smoking gun.The knee-jerk reaction claiming that Honeywell has committed treason or something like it is unreasonable. Methinks incompetence from the sales department is to blame here rather than malice.See Reddit threads discussing same topic:https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/n5vglg/honeywell...https://www.reddit.com/r/technology/comments/n5tcqg/honeywel...https://www.reddit.com/r/Military/comments/n4gwma/honeywell_...https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/n5n1jc/honeywell_admi...

The orginal plant based food that gets processed into a beyond burger.If you really care about the planet why are you buying processed anything?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am an avid meat-lover but it does play on my conscience that I am in fact eating a former sentient being and potentially contributing to environmental devastation.I would appreciate answers to the following two, albeit simplistic questions that always plaque me when I consider stopping eating meat products:1) Is it really unethical to eat animals when the natural trajectory of most animals lives was likely to be eaten by other animals or die some horrendous death in their natural environment? Isn&#39;t it better for an animal to live its best life on a free range farm being grass fed, then get quickly and humanely slaughtered?2)If I made a personal decision to stop eating meat, would there be any significant impact at all on the overall environment realistically? For example, I recently watched the documentary Seaspiracy which showed the negative effects of commercial fishing. However, the reality is that me (not) eating a bowl of sashimi once a week makes no difference in the context of, say, countries like Japan slaughtering millions of fish daily (regardless of any change in behavior on my part or my small circle of influence)?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s nice to see hard evidence of this, but anecdotal evidence is plain to see on Amazon.com reviews. For example, a product gets a lot of 5 star reviews stating that the buyer bought it for their child/relative/friend and they are just sure that they will love it... 5 stars! Or &#34;I just got this delivered yesterday and I haven&#39;t used it yet but it looks really great!&#34;... 5 stars.These are then immediately followed by a 1 star review along the lines of &#34;This is the biggest piece of junk I&#39;ve ever bought online. Will be returning to Amazon. DO NOT BUY!&#34;These aren&#39;t to be confused with the indiscriminate idiots who can&#39;t be bothered to use their brains, who leave mindless reviews such as &#34;This is junk but it was cheap and kinda works... 5 stars!&#34; Right.Most times this trend of 5&#39;s followed by 1&#39;s is seen even in the first page of reviews. It&#39;s a serious problem with the platform. I usually search for reviews written by people who have had the product for a week or two and give the pros/cons along with a less than 5 star rating. That helps me avoid the fakes and the idiots.This makes me wonder why Amazon, in all their analytical genius, isn&#39;t cracking down on this when it&#39;s so blatantly obvious."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s gotten to the point where a product with thousands of reviews and an average 4.5 - 5 star rating immediately raises a red flag with me.And Amazon appears unmotivated to do anything about it. As a personal example, I had purchased a mouth guard that had over six thousand 5-star reviews. It was listed as high quality, FDA approved, etc. When I received it, it was a piece of plastic junk with inkjet quality instructions in English and Chinese. Along with it came a note promising a $10 Amazon gift card if I left a 5 star review and emailed them proof of it.I took a photo of the note and forwarded it to Amazon expecting some action - instead I received a canned response about &#34;we take these issues seriously&#34;. A year later, that seller is still there with dozens of products, all with thousands of 5-star reviews."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Last year, I posted a negative review of an inexpensive (~$10) electronic device on Amazon. A few weeks later, the seller contacted me with an offer of a $20 Amazon gift certificate to take it down. I didn&#39;t respond. A few days later, they offered $30, then $40, then $50."</p>

A part from their conclusion:More than a year after the initial documented cases in Wuhan, the source of SARS-CoV-2 has yet to be identified, and the search for a direct or intermediate host in nature has been so far unsuccessful.The low binding affinity of SARS-CoV-2 to bat ACE2 studied to date does not support Chiroptera as a direct zoonotic agent. Furthermore, the reliance on pangolin coronavirus receptor binding domain (RBD) similarity to SARS-CoV-2 as evidence for natural zoonotic spillover is flawed, as pangolins are unlikely to play a role in SARS-CoV-2′s origin and recombination is not supported by recent analysis.At the same time, genomic analyses pointed out that SARS-CoV-2 exhibits multiple peculiar characteristics not found in other Sarbecoviruses.A novel multibasic furin cleavage site (FCS) confers numerous pathogenetically advantageous capabilities, the existence of which is difficult to explain though natural evolution...source: https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10311-021-01211-0"</p>

Most of this was known in March 2020, and nearly all of it by the end of 2020. How does it take so long for the truth to win?I published a meta-analysis covering much of the same ground in November 2020 and this was only after waiting and expecting for several months that someone with a better platform would do so first. The article above covers the most important points but the story does go deeper: https://followtheplot.org/covid19"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The origin of COVID-19 is going to be one of the biggest news stories in 2021-22 IMO. China&#39;s global reputation is going to take a hit. I don&#39;t think they did this intentionally. I think everyone had the best of intentions and either they found something deep in a bat cave or there was a lab mishap. I&#39;ve gone down the rabbit hole on this issue. Here are some interesting links https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=R01AI110964&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sd... is the papers done by a NIH grant to Eco Health Alliance. This shows they were looking for new variants of Coronavirus at the Wuhan Institute of Virology. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7089274/pdf/114... This shows they were artificially synthesizing Coronaviruses and incubating them in monkey cells. Dr. Peter Daszak seems to be in the center of a lot of this and IMO had a conflict of interest being on the WHO COVID-19 origins report."</p>

S3 can be cost efficient, but only if you don&#39;t touch data :)Their price calculation doesn&#39;t mention cost of S3 requests, which very quickly adds up and is often neglected.It costs $1 for 2.5M GET requests to S3. They have 180 shards, in a general case query seems to fetch all of them. Presumably they don&#39;t download full shard per request, but download an index + some relevant ranges. Lets say that is 10 requests per shard. So that would be 1800 S3 GET requests = ~1400 search queries cost them $1.Assuming their service is reasonably popular and serve 1 req/second on average, that would be $1,440 per 30 days in addition to advertised $1,000 spent on EC2 and S3 storage.Seems comparable to AWS ElasticSearch service costs:- 3 nodes m5.2xlarge.elasticsearch = $1,200- 20TB EBS storage = $1,638"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this speaks to the power of defaults. 96% of users have not turned this on because they didn&#39;t even know that its disabled, and when an app asks you if they can track you, the response is going to be a strong no. The reality is that FB&#39;s entire business model has been predicated on the default being that tracking is allowed.If this holds, this will be cataclysmic for FB. You can&#39;t have a huge portion of your wealthy user base just disappear and expect advertisers to keep paying what they were paying previously.BTW, this is also why the covid exposure notification apps failed miserably. They should have always been opt-out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Based on Apple’s job postings I’m beginning to suspect their stance on ads and tracking was nothing more than a clever ruse to weaken competitors while they build their own a personalized ad business for iOS:https://i.imgur.com/y1s9F4JThey also just hired Facebook’s first ads targeting product manager to work for their ad platform. I don’t think Apple ads won’t be limited to the App Store within a couple years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Why would you enable it? What possible benefit is there in doing so?The ads won&#39;t get better regardless of the data they have on you. They aren&#39;t exactly using ML or AI to help you get better ads. Its really just boring data queries in SQL or some graph language. That&#39;s the sum total of most advertising intelligence. Its not 21st century high tech. Its mostly relational databases with some NoSQL to make that table linking faster and cached. In cases where they do actually bring out that NoSQL it is to reimplement all the relational smarts just with extra steps. Then its at least shiny and cool.The whole thing is really just about storing and gathering a profile on you as part of them building an asset they can later resell. Creepy technology for creepy uses. An asset full of subtle errors about you that can likely never be seen or fixed. Much later they will invariably then leave all or some of it on a usb stick or some poorly protected cloud server. After that your details will end up in the hands of some scammer or other miscreant to enable them to send you endless emails full of typos, lies, emojis and if you&#39;re exceptionally average like the rest of us: an interesting tale about long lost nigerian princes just needing a bank account. If you&#39;re lucky.So, yeah, leave it disabled. There&#39;s really no point in doing otherwise."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great resource. At Splitgraph, we index ~40k open data sets, and we make sure to include structured metadata for each one, so we show up in these results. (example [0])One cool aspect of this metadata is that it allows a dataset to have multiple sources. So if two sites index the same dataset, there is no duplicate content penalty like there might be with textual content. If you search for a dataset, it will include links to all its sources (whether canonical or otherwise).For most of the data we index at Splitgraph, the canonical source is 
an open government data portal powered by Socrata (e.g. data.cdc.gov). We noticed that Socrata powered a lot of portals, so we wrote a Socrata plugin for Splitgraph, along with a scraper to index the metadata. The plugin basically implements a Postgres FDW so that Splitgraph can translate from SQL to the upstream query language. In this case, the plugin translates to Socrata&#39;s bespoke API language. But for private deployments we also have plugins for Snowflake, Postgres, some SaaS services, etc.If you find some data on Google Dataset Search with Splitgraph listed as a source, please take a look! Our &#34;Data Delivery Network&#34; (DDN) is implemented on top of the Postgres wire protocol, so you can connect with any Postgres client (or use our web editor). All the Postgres query syntax is available to you; you can even JOIN across any of the other 40k+ datasets indexed at Splitgraph. That includes &#34;live data&#34; like Socrata portals, but also versioned snapshots of data called &#34;data images.&#34; Here&#39;s an example of a point-in-time query across two snapshots (basically a diff) [1], and another query that joins across tables at data.cityofchicago.org and data.cambridgema.gov [2].[0] https://www.splitgraph.com/cdc-gov/distribution-of-covid19-d... – &#34;View Source&#34; to see the Schema.org metadata[1] https://bit.ly/3epvxcj[2] https://bit.ly/3f1ll8K(Sorry for the bit.ly links.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Can confirm. I’m friends with a group of very smart distributed systems engineers who were excited to launch an actually useful crypto project that gets talked about here from time to time.As much as they’re excited about the technology itself, very few people are actually interested in using it. Instead, their business seems to revolve around the value of the utility tokens for their project.Few people are buying the utility tokens to pay for the service. They’re buying them to horde so they can resell to other speculators when the price goes up. They have a lot of tokens in circulation, but only a small number of them get used to pay for the service. Many of them are sitting in the wallets of exchanges where they get traded back and forth but never come near the blockchain.Investors only care about getting more press releases out so they can pump up the price of their discounted tokens, which have a shortened lockup period relative to something like stocks. It’s almost like a pump-and-dump scheme for investors.Maybe their underlying project will become popular in the future, but the volatility of the token price makes it increasingly unattractive for companies that want to actually use it."</p>

You aim to build a community, but in reality 90% of your telegram/discord are scammers and people asking why price is going down/accusations that you and your entire team should go to jail.I&#39;m consistently repulsed by the lack of thoughtful discussion in crypto communities. For a space littered with intriguing technology it&#39;s endlessly frustrating that there&#39;s no HN-like forum. Instead, any community that started off that way is now filled with speculators and shillers.Take your pick for where to source your news: 1. crypto influencers on YouTube who are paid to shill, 2. forums likw Reddit filled with speculators and conmen, 3. pump and dump groups on Telegram.The greed and FOMO on display in the crypto gold-rush is deeply depressing, and for the majority who join the craze at the peak of the bull run, it&#39;ll surely end in tears."</p>

It&#39;s not &#34;crypto&#34;. It&#39;s blockchain.Sure, it&#39;s your shorthand for &#34;cryptocoin&#34; or &#34;cryptovalue&#34;. Which are again newspeak for blockchain, and we could argue that given its limits and usage of the last years they should be called crypto-investment, at best.Which is still like ordering a pizza and forcefully referring to it only as &#34;food&#34;. I want a pepperoni-food please.Sorry for the rant, but it really feels like it&#39;s just a way to further embellish something with dubious values like the post points out"</p>

It&#39;s when technical people look at what seems like a groundbreaking idea, seem unimpressed, and say &#34;couldn&#39;t you just _____&#34;, were the blank is filled with something a nontechnical person doesn&#39;t understand or considers very cumbersome.The web: couldn&#39;t you just transfer a file to an open port and use a rendering tool to view it?Blogs: couldn&#39;t you just update a web page?Wikis: couldn&#39;t you just update a web page?social media: couldn&#39;t you just set up group view preferences and use RSS?youtube: couldn&#39;t you just upload a video and use tags for search?twitter: couldn&#39;t you just not?

This kind of black and white thinking is pervasive in PG essays, and always lead to a cute conclusion. You can have two domain experts that disagree. You can have an idea that spans multiple domains, and there are no (or few) experts in all of them. Maybe the Crazy New Idea seems brilliant to experts in one domain, but only because they don&#39;t grasp the others."</p>

I&#39;ve never clicked on an internet ad.  Youtube advertising might as well be targeted to an alien race.  What in the hell keeps this whole business afloat at it&#39;s current level?  Am I being programmed to buy that mechanic&#39;s vise because they threw up an after-the-browse ad?No doubt there&#39;s some sort of backend telemetry that proves the value of all this trouble, but I just don&#39;t see it.  Maybe the emperor really is nekkid.edit:  It may well be that the real marketing genius in the advertising industry is not it&#39;s value in increasing sales, whether it&#39;s old school print media/OTA/tradeshows or the newfangled spying-on-you internet variety, but in convincing it&#39;s customers of advertising&#39;s value.  Anything beyond pushing you up a search engine&#39;s ranking strikes me as a sketchy proposition."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author writes that you can either pay with money or you can “pay with your attention”. What’s left unsaid is the cost of that attention. I believe that cost is very high and it isn’t just ads, it’s the design of countless products including social media sites, games and even the site you’re reading this on right now. It’s all designed to extract as much attention as possible, and the cost is people’s ability to concentrate, learn and get shit done. The cost is, in other words, staggeringly high."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As the person who originally asked &#34;why&#34; I feel like I ought to respond, though much of it is covered by other comments. I used to work in more trad advertising, so my question wasn&#39;t so much an objection to working in advertising itself, but specifically Google&#39;s version of advertising, which I see as gross overreach into people&#39;s personal lives.In other comments people have mentioned YouTube subscriptions as being an alternative, it really isn&#39;t - OK, you don&#39;t see any adverts, but they&#39;re still harvesting and selling you. That a privately owned corporation is allowed to read your messages and sell what they find to the highest bidder is vile and honestly makes me wonder how we got here.I quit advertising after only a couple of years because it blackened my soul. If I was helping to harvest people&#39;s personal lives for private profit I can only imagine it would have been worse."</p>

You have to decide where you&#39;ll put that blocking piece so that you can hopefully clear it later. This might be an unexpected car repair bill or a death that you aren&#39;t emotionally capable of addressing ... You&#39;re in control, you have a good job, a great partner, and yall are saving to buy a house -- basically waiting for an l piece to complete your `Tetris`...&#34;Anyway, this game of (ha)Tetris is a lot like a lot of people&#39;s lives, just roadblock after roadblock. While the normal version where you start from zero on level one is probably an upper middle class life. And Id say that the majority of people in the world start on level 6 with the board halfway filled with a bunch of gaps and the pieces move at a speed that is barely controllable (im thinking of the classic gameboy version when I imagine these boards)Hatetris is cool.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Open-ended homework for those who are interested: solve the same problem, but with actual Tetris rules.I&#39;ve seen a bunch of those &#34;adversarial tetris&#34; variants, and they all operate under the assumption that any of the seven pieces can appear at any time, and with only one preview.Modern Tetris has 3 previews + hold, and pieces are drawn randomly &#34;from a bag&#34;, without replacement (more formally, if P[i] is the sequence of pieces, each aligned subsequence of 7 pieces must be a permutation of the tetrominos).This would be more interesting to make/play. Note that under such rules there exists a strategy that allows infinite play if the well is at least 17 tiles high."</p>

It doesn&#39;t have the staying power of more modern online games where new content is added continuously.They stopped development on HotS, which never achieved the same level of pull as League of Legends.Overwatch faces stiff competition from Valorant and other competitive small team FPSes, and also has overlapping audiences with battle royale FPSes.Starcraft 2 is basically dead. WC3 remastered flopped. The RTS genre writ large is definitely in a waning phase.IMO, when a gaming company doesn&#39;t make new games, it is going to see some losses in the playerbase. To me it&#39;s more remarkable that they&#39;ve only seen this much of a dropoff."</p>

They fell into that classic trap of &#34;If we [do something that will alienate all our customers] we can get 10x as many customers from [untapped market]&#34;    As anybody should have been able to foresee, the old customers were indeed alienated and the new customers never materialized."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Blizzard died the day it was bought by Activision. It has been descending into mediocrity ever since. Many executives left, and many studios/teams inside Blizzard have been shuffled around and between projects, unlike Blizzard&#39;s doctrine of old (tight teams focused on a project until it&#39;s great or must be stopped -- Blizzard&#39;s infamous &#34;Soon(tm)&#34;).World of Warcraft is still being milked till it dries up (and I&#39;m saying that as someone clocking 560+ days in game). Diablo has been abandonned (see the announcement of a mobile Diablo game last year¹, and its reception by the player base). So has StarCraft. Overwatch is stagnant (no new hero for a year) and Overwatch 2 is probably in development hell (pure speculation on my part I&#39;ll admit). Heroes of the Storm is also pretty stagnant (the game went from a hero every month to only two last year, nothing in 2021 so far).In the meantime, there has been a very heavy push for e-sports with Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm (though I have not followed any of those). These efforts seem, to me, extremely centred on American audience, unlike League of Legends which has multiple leagues around the world. I&#39;m sure a ton of money has been poured into this venture, but I&#39;m unsure it has improved the games...Anyway, the last time I launched Battle.net was for Destiny 2... and it has migrated to Steam in the middle of 2019!¹Wow OK, that was in 2018 o_O Time flies, especially with a global pandemic, it seems..."</p>

					<h3><a href="http://mobileatscale.com/">Show HN: I wrote the book Building Mobile Apps at Scale</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27050801">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m excited to share that Building Mobile Apps at Scale: 39 Engineering Challenges is out. It&#39;s my first-ever paperback book and one that is free as a PDF for the rest of the month[1].I had worked for years at Uber, first as a mobile engineer, then an engineering manager. Despite being a mobile-first company, I could not shake the feeling that non-mobile engineers and managers consistently underestimated the complexity of large-scale mobile development. I&#39;ve been in so many meetings where an engineer, a PM, or a director would say, &#34;oh, compared to the backend, the mobile part should be simple enough... it&#39;s just another frontend, right?&#34;.I found myself explaining again and again to PMs, engineers, and stakeholders all the hoops the mobile team needs to jump to ship things in production. How mistakes are very expensive - and thus, we need to ship almost all changes behind feature flags. How the build train means that the changes we make today will take at least 2 weeks to get to prod. How devices being offline is something we need to actively support, and anticipate... and so on. I noticed similar &#34;aha moments&#34; each time. Talking with other mobile engineers in similar environments, they were having similar conversations, and battling similar assumptions on mobile being relatively simple.I had been collecting the numerous challenging areas that I planned to publish as a blog post. After I shared the draft on Twitter[2], I got an unexpected amount of interest in people offering to contribute. The contents became too long for a post, and so this book was born. Several people asked for a paperback version[3], and I decided to create the book in print as well, as I felt the contents warranted it.I hope you find this book useful - both if you&#39;re a mobile engineer or if you work with mobile teams. And I&#39;d love to hear any feedback![1] https://www.mobileatscale.com/#pricing[2] https://twitter.com/GergelyOrosz/status/1335305213394251780[3] https://twitter.com/elevenetc/status/1335595203411972097"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having read the book cover to cover I can say that it is quite a well made, relatable list of challenges and how they are being resolved in the sector. Foreseeing these types of issues is hard especially if you never went through the process, and quite hairy to resolve as such I believe it is a very good resource to have.On another note each section comes with quite a lengthy follow up material, which I found absolutely amazing to use as a starting point as well.Absolutely love it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everything Gergely writes (and he writes a lot! Books, blogs, tweets; and also YT channel) is gold, especially if you&#39;re into mobile dev, interested in growing as a senior developer, or if you live in Europe and are interested by big tech. He&#39;s really filling a huge gap.Re:book, I&#39;ve been an Android dev for 3 years (hybrid &amp; native) and the book really covers the whole spectrum of things (as you can see in the table of contents) that need to be done to have a good app, some of them hard to know in advance. At the same time, it can (and should) be read and understood by non-devs (project managers, directors etc.). Congrats on the launch!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A particularly bad instance of link tracking I&#39;ve found is in TikTok&#39;s link sharing feature.If you share a link from the TikTok app, it gives you a vm.tiktok.com/[xyz] link to send/post elsewhere. It gives you no indication that this isn&#39;t a generic link to the post, nor does it give you an option to expose the generic link to the post.Instead, when you share that link and someone clicks on it and does not have the app, it opens with a header saying &#34;[First Last] is on TikTok.&#34; On the other hand, once you do click on that link (if and only if you don&#39;t have the app installed), you get redirected to the static link to the video and finally obtain it.This is an anti-pattern that enables further tracking and potentially unknowingly exposes user data when links are shared publicly. And there&#39;s no indication to the user that this is happening, since the link is structured as if it does not contain any tracking. Ie a tool like this wouldn&#39;t be able to &#34;strip out&#34; the tracking since it isn&#39;t tacked on in any way, but embedded as the generated link itself."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would love to see an &#39;educational&#39; mode on this - rather than just removing the tracking elements, put some info on-screen that shows what was removed and why, so people can use this as a tool to learn more about what types of tracking exist online and how common it is. Hopefully that would lead to a more knowledgeable end user community online and we can have more nuanced discussions in the future about where tracking is benign, and where it is not."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you want to treat climate change as an existential threat, then you do whatever it takes to keep all existing nuclear running until fossil fuel plants are gone from the entire continent. And you put a little money to subsidize/stimulate new nuclear on the off chance some of the advanced nuclear concepts work out (or as a backup in case renewables improve slower than we think).You don’t have to stop or even slow renewables deployment to do this. They are fairly different industries with different workforce’s, so there are resources to do both simultaneously without significant interference. And you’re not going to get “too much” electricity as cheap abundant electricity will help accelerate decarbonization of other things like building heat and transport and industrial processes.Existing nuclear ESPECIALLY must be protected. And existing hydro. Number 1 and number 2 (tied with wind) clean energy sources.Nuclear power produces as much energy in our country as coal. We can phase out coal twice as fast if we at very least keep nuclear around a few years longer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been noticing the impact of excessive multitasking on myself lately, and I am now actively trying to avoid it.
At first i thought that multitasking would increase my overall efficiency by filling in gaps of downtime in certain tasks, but it soon turned me into a person incapable of focusing on anything deeply.
One day, I noticed that I am unable to read a book the same way i did as a child (cover to cover in one sitting for example), and it kind of shocked me.
I now have a rule that i do one thing only, and start other tasks only when the previous task has been finished. This applies to both productive work (learning, programming etc.) and entertainment (YouTube, books etc.).
I think that it is starting to help, but I feel like it will take time to undo the damage of years of bad multitasking."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My primary school age son, and anecdotally, lots of other kids of similar age, relentlessly multitask in ways that hurts my brain just to think about.He literally is playing a game, watching a YouTube video in another screen, and talking to friends at the same time, and in the most extreme case, is even listening to an audiobook or podcast as well.Asking kids about it, they all say that&#39;s just what they do and look at us oldies like we are from the 20th century or something."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yet multitasking is still being branded as something of a higher cognitive functioning. Byung-Chul Han in The Burnout Society claims that it is the opposite:&gt; “The attitude toward time and environment known as “multitasking’ does not represent civilisational progress. Human beings in the late-modern society of work and information are not the only ones capable of multitasking. Rather, such an aptitude amounts to regression. Multitasking is commonplace among wild animals. It is an attentive technique indispensable for survival in the wilderness.&gt; An animal busy with eating must also attend to other tasks. For example, it must hold rivals away from its prey. It must constantly be on the lookout, lest it be eaten while eating. At the same time, it must guard its young and keep an eye on its sexual partner. In the wild, the animal is forced to divide its attention between various activities. That is why animals are incapable of contemplative immersion—either they are eating or they are copulating.”&gt; ...&gt; We owe the cultural achievements of humanity—which include philosophy—to deep, contemplative attention.”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is common in the Enterprise and makes me wonder how many companies are undermined by their own accounting/billing departments. Typical problems include:1) Vendor agrees to to NET 60, but begins to display warnings to end users on day 30.2) We want to purchase 100 licenses in bulk, but vendor will only sell individual licenses directly to each user, who must pay using the vendor&#39;s payment system, with no exceptions or alternatives.3) Vendor does not have a method to process payment for multiple invoices combined in one check.4) Vendor sends invoice to wrong account at the same enterprise (way too common).What&#39;s frustrating about these examples is that there is no sales pitch needed; we&#39;ve already decided to purchase the product. Taking our money shouldn&#39;t be the hardest part."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The world is a scary and violent place. Without Liveleak, you might never feel it. Until you see the actual violence and gore, it doesn&#39;t mean anything, it&#39;s just empty words. I didn&#39;t care at all about wars in the middle east until I saw the reality on Liveleak. Seeing dead children and people with their legs blown off made all the commentary on CNN and Fox seem so understated.A lot is said about desensitization as a result of seeing horrible things on the internet, but in my experience, only the opposite was true. Seeing violence online when I was in my late teens sensitized me and made the stories on the TV real. Frankly, I owe a lot of my political beliefs (especially on foreign policy) to horrible realities I saw on Liveleak."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I do hope you also understand our reasonsI mean, I&#39;d like to try, except he didn&#39;t actually give us any of those reasons.Rest in peace, LiveLeak.  You were a beacon of reality that shone through the propaganda, the bullshit, and the sugar-coating. Your demise means that people who want to see something like a shooting that&#39;s been removed from mainstream platforms will be forced to visit darker corners of the internet.  Now if someone asks me &#34;Hey where can I go see that thing that was taken off of Youtube&#34; I don&#39;t have a ready answer that isn&#39;t an alt-right cesspool."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"LiveLeak was the only video site that still felt like the wild west. If I was ever linked to a LiveLink url I knew something crazy was about to happen.I&#39;m sure serving this kind of content had its hurdles legally. And running a video site cannot be cheap in the first place. LiveLeak will be missed."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Honestly, in this story everyone looks like a big child.I would maybe be more sympathetic to DHH if it wasn&#39;t the guy who was so opinionated he pushed through Rails features that everyone else disliked or co-wrote several books on company culture that are glorified ads for basecamp (although &#34;it doesn&#39;t have to be crazy at work&#34; is still a thought-provoking read, at least in part). I can only imagine that he might be similarly self-righteous in workplace situations.I think that, no matter your political views, if a situation gets out of hand that bad over matters that aren&#39;t even really directly related to workplace concerns, something must have gone fundamentally wrong much earlier. These levels of tension and distrust don&#39;t just arise out of nowhere."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m among those with mixed feelings.- list of funny names that is kept in some persistent form and circulates the company with full acknowledgment of the head people: Childish and extremely unprofessional, but still a typical mistake rather than a colossal disaster;- politics and racism issue: looks like typical misunderstanding but on a very fragile subjects. Very easy to get into drama scenarios with this mix. Very easy to mishandle it. But it still seems that this topic is not normal workplace topic. If there is a serious issue in that matter, you go to some authorities. If you did not address it officially and decided to attack the head people - sorry, it&#39;s not the way. That might suggest that there was no real issue as there were no serious actions;- policy change public announcement first then to your team: Yeah that&#39;s a big mistake, something that probably their books wouldn&#39;t even advise. Head people did not recognise  that this is not the way to manage fragile topics.Is DHH and Jason all evil?- These are the same guys that give equal pay regardless of remote worker location.- They were always believing in remote work, which is bigger problem for company and it&#39;s more of a benefit for the 
employees- Many times were vocal about issues with big companies, where many others did not have enough courage to do the same- Creators of a breakthrough tech stack and tremendous contributions to open-source- Always happily sharing their knowledgeThey made a mistake. But they don&#39;t seem to be bad guys here overall.In this context, the article seems to be written by someone who had some personal issues with the guys and he found a way to &#34;show&#39;em all&#34;. Even if it tells his version of the story, to me it&#39;s at least unfair and biased."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the April discussion about the list of customer names, Singer posted to say that attempting to link the list to genocide was “absurd.” On the Friday call, he went further.“I strongly disagree we live in a white supremacist culture,” Singer said. “I don&#39;t believe in a lot of the framing around implicit bias. I think a lot of this is actually racist.”He continued: “Very often, if you express a dissenting view, you get called a Nazi. … I have not felt this is open territory for discussion. If we were to try to get into it as a group discussion it would be very painful and divisive.”Singer concluded his remarks. Fried responded, “Thank you, Ryan.”A handful of other speakers followed. Then a Black employee asked if the company could revisit Singer’s remarks. (I’m withholding the employee’s name and other identifying details out of colleagues’ fears that they could be targeted for harassment for speaking out.)--Interesting that comments objecting to political hyperbole gets the commenter suspended (leading to resignation) with his name all over the place, while those who called for his censure are deemed as needing to be protected from naming due to &#34;harrassment for speaking out&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, all. Author of the project here. Sorry to have caused some confusion: this is part of a research project, and it&#39;s not yet meant to be terribly legible to a public audience.In the near-term, this project is about augmenting written texts so that readers can easily remember the key details. See https://quantum.country for an example or https://numinous.productions/ttft for detailed background and discussion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some context: The author created https://quantum.country which is a text book augmented with spaced-repetition. It seems that Orbit is a toolkit for creating these types of flashcard/spaced-repetition learning webpages for anyone (with the user data being stored at Orbit&#39;s server).I&#39;ll have to say that I&#39;m still not 100% sure how useful this approach is. Most of the times when you&#39;re learning something you&#39;re not merely reading, but you&#39;re also actively using the knowledge in some way. If I&#39;m learning about B-trees then the major part of that learning process is implementing them. If I&#39;m learning some complicated math I will solve a bunch of exercises. Where does flashcards in a text book fit into this?It was also my impression (from the Anki community) that spaced-repetition is far more effective when you create the cards yourself. A common &#34;beginner mistake&#34; is to download a pre-made deck and start memorizing from scratch."</p>
