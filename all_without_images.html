								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have any questions directly, just wanna say that I love VLC, it&#39;s one of the first programs I install on any computer, and I will continue to use it as my primary media-viewer for the foreseeable future.The number of features that the devs have packed into VLC is staggering; I&#39;ve been using VLC for almost 15 years now, and I still find new things about it occasionally. Fun fact (though probably not as surprising to an HN crowd as it is to most people I tell this to), VLC can also be used to convert media to different formats, AND works as a quick ad-hoc media server if you want to display something on a TV.  This can be really handy if you have a video file in a weird format and want a way to quickly watch it on a device that doesn&#39;t support weird formats.I think I&#39;m going to donate.  Keep up the good work folks!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"You guys rock and the entire Linux community owes you big time.
Once you installed videolan you were ready for all media formats.
It was so tiresome to tell the people you convinced to try Linux that no, by default they couldn&#39;t play their media, that they needed gstreamer this and that.
You made the transition to Linux so much easier to lots of people by offering a simple to use very feature rich application everyone needs and uses.Thank you!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh my god, they don&#39;t even bother implementing the app any more...It reminds me of my first App Store experience. I made an app that was somewhat successful (about 2000€ a month, enough to pay for a students living expenses).Within short time, a chinese speaking developer cloned it. They copied the icon (slighlty different color), they copied the UI, they even copied all the text in the dialog boxes. They released the app with a slightly different name.I contacted Apple to complain about the obvious copyright infringement, but they only forwarded my complaint to the developer. Interestingly enough, the developer actually replied to me. They sent an email threating legal action. I asked them to at least change the icon, and they did. But until today, the rest of the cloned app is still on the app store and competes with my app.It&#39;s not comparable to your case, since in my case the competitor wasn&#39;t a scammer, just someone with a very lose interpretation of intellectual property.But it makes me feel that Apple really doesn&#39;t give a shit what goes on in their store, as long as they make their 30%. (or 15% from small fish like me now)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FYI, in situations like this the best way is to:1. Register your videos and images with the USCO. It&#39;ll cost &lt;$100.2. You can now file DMCA takedowns. Send one to Apple with the USCO registration ID and a copy of the image and a link to the app in question.3. Apple will either immediately remove that fake app, or be liable for up to $350k in punitive damages for wilful infringement and lose all DMCA protection.4. If Apple didn&#39;t react a week later, approach a lawyer. They&#39;ll likely be willing to work purely for 50% commission, because it&#39;ll be a slam dunk in court.5. Repeat the same with Facebook / Youtube if they advertise there with your images or videos. Take Screenshots and write down the url and date and time.Of course, one would hope that Apple will do the right thing, but it&#39;s also reasonably easy to force their hand.That said, I don&#39;t know anyone for whom app development worked out financially if you fairly price your own labor. So maybe just stay away from cheap apps in general."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m dumbfounded at Google&#39;s lack of planning on this. I tried Stadia, and they had (have?) so few games that they seem to have neither search nor pagination on the list that you can play. None of the games are ones that I care about.It feels like they could have—at the cost of short-term profit and pride—partnered with Valve and shipped something mind-blowing. But instead we&#39;re left with a bunch of AAA games that feel half-baked (Hitman crashes on first boot and complains about a lack of a controller) and a bunch of indie games that feel like a sad attempt to squeeze a few extra bucks out of a middling title (the Hello Neighbor hide and seek game) and titles released half a decade ago (superhot).Minecraft is on every console imaginable—except Stadia. What about Roblox? Fortnite? Factorio? Among Us? Any Sid Meier&#39;s game? Any Paradox game? Every genre of game that I actually put time into is completely absent on their platform. Every game from the top 10 (perhaps 20 or more?) on Twitch right now is absent on Stadia. I don&#39;t know what they&#39;re doing, but whatever it is, it&#39;s wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know Google/Stadia recently partnered with LG to bundle the Stadia app with LG TVs, but I wonder why Google doesn&#39;t do this with every TV manufacturers (save Sony.)If I were Stadia&#39;s marketing chief, I&#39;d1. Bribe the TV manufacturers to include the Stadia app2. Advertise that the TV includes _a game console_ during TV commercials.3. Allow the TV users to pay a bit extra ($20?) to buy a basic game controller.4. Have all the store demo units to auto stream Stadia playing video games and explicitly explain you don&#39;t need a xbox/playstation to play these games.5. Buy out Witcher 3/Call of Duty 4/Project Cars 2/other older games and make them free for TVs with Stadia bundles.Most smart TVs these days are more than fast enough to stream HD broadcast. I don&#39;t understand why Google doesn&#39;t push this.Fiddling with my phone to play Stadia on my TV is pretty crumple some. It&#39;s just too much work for normal folks. People just want to turn on the TV and start playing.Edit: I guess monopolistic abuse is a concern. However Sony and MS have their own streaming services. Google can just advertise &#39;play games with Stadia and Playstation Now and Xbox Cloud on your TV!&#39; I am 100% if players switch to playing games on TV without game consoles, it hurts MS/Sony a lot more than to Google."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is totally the right move.  I am a (very happy) user of Stadia. If you haven&#39;t tried it, you really should...it&#39;s an amazing piece of tech. I can find myself with 20-30 minutes worth of downtime during the day, fire up Cyberpunk 2077 or Hitman or Assassin&#39;s Creed in moments from my browser *on a macbook* and play at high settings with no noticeable lag.Obviously you need a strong, steady internet connection for Stadia to shine, but I&#39;d guess that the HN crowd skews towards that.If you&#39;re an old gamer who wants to play newer games but doesn&#39;t have a ton of time and don&#39;t want to drop $1k+ on a gaming rig, check out Stadia.The game library does leave a lot to be desired, no question about that. But this decision seems to be the right move to mitigate that by giving developers better access to getting their games on Stadia rather than Google trying to be both the platform and the content."</p>

Would it still be interesting for me?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey! FastAPI creator hereNice surprise to find this shared on HN!It&#39;s also great to see so many products/projects and companies using it successfuly in production!I see a bunch of questions related to &#34;how FastAPI compares to X&#34;, FastAPI was built from the learnings from other awesome tools, and is built on top of great packages.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Huge FastAPI fan here.I use it for my projects (and one project even makes enough revenue that I sponsor Sebastián’s work through GitHub sponsors at $250/mo) and it for sure has increased my development velocity.It’s an absolute joy to work with. The automated interactive docs are great for iteration. Type hints as first class citizens is an awesome developer experience that I didn’t think I wanted.Using the auto generated OpenAPI you can even generate client side code and typings to interact with your API.It feels like flask but with lots of quality of life improvements.[1] https://www.vim.so"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently used Starlette, which FastAPI also uses, for a project and absolutely loved it. I went with Starlette over FastAPI because I didn&#39;t need a lot of what FastAPI provided for that particular project.I want to start nudging my coworkers into using FastAPI over Flask because some of the async APIs they&#39;ve started using.  FastAPI seems to come with all the things they want out of the box instead of adding a bunch of individual Flask packages.Just for my own understanding, where would FastAPI be appropriate vs. Starlette and vice versa.Thanks!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Wow, how has nobody noticed this before? This looks seriously rotten:&gt; Michigan-based entrepreneur Robert Simpson decided to see what would happen if he bought the entire stock of one company. Using a single broker, within a couple of days Simpson had paid a little over $5,000 for 1,285,050 shares in OTC bulletin board property-development company Global Links. According to Simpson, these shares were delivered into his account shortly afterwards. Yet the following day 37,044,500 Global Links shares were traded on the bulletin board. The next day, 22,471,000 shares were traded. On neither day had Simpson traded a single Global Link share, he insists. And events surrounding Simpson&#39;s investments became yet more confusing. Global Links had only ever issued 1,158,064 shares. Simpson had managed to acquire 126,986 shares that did not exist. How he had managed to be sold more shares than were in issuance is exactly the question Simpson hoped his foray would raise."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Recent events have a lot of people confusing high short interest with naked shorting.A stock can have short interest greater than 100% without any naked shorting.How is this possible? The textbook definition of a &#34;short sale&#34; is that someone borrows stock and then, literally, sells it short. The buyer of the stock is free and clear to do whatever they want with the stock, including re-lend it for another short sale. Wikipedia has a good primer on how this works: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)This has created a lot of confusion on WallstreetBets, where many participants have come to believe that Gamestop&#39;s short interest of 113% means that there are 13% more shares shorted than long positions to cover. It&#39;s not true, though, because the long interest is always greater than the short interest."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Summary:Every so often, someone gets very steamed about short selling, often with no real reason. Back in 2005, someone got very steamed about short selling, and then got a journalist to write a somewhat confused article about it. It&#39;s not clear anything was actually wrong then, but in any case, the rules have been changed a few times since then, so there doesn&#39;t seem to be any obvious relevance to current times.It&#39;s also worth noting that there&#39;s no real theoretical basis for why naked short selling would be harmful, no real empirical evidence showing it is harmful, no general laws against it, and the structure of the market allows and expects it to take place in some specific cases. If your mental model is that the stock market is a tool to allow people to trade a fixed number of concrete objects back and forth, this probably seems odd, but since that&#39;s not really a good model of how the stock market works or is intended to work, it&#39;s not clear that means much."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Summary: if you have an index on a column which is mostly NULL, consider using a partial index covering only the records where it&#39;s non-NULL."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Partial indexes are amazing but you have to keep in mind some pecularities.If your query doesn&#39;t contain a proper match with the WHERE clause of the index - the index will not be used. It is easy to forget about it or to get it wrong in subtle ways. Here is an example from work.There was an event tracing structure which contained the event severity_id. Id values 0-6 inclusive are user facing events. Severity 7 and up is debug events. In practice all debug events were 7 and there were no other values above 7. This table had a partial index with WHERE severity_id &lt; 7.
I tracked down a performance regression, when an ORM (due to programmer error) generated WHERE severity_id != 7. The database is obviously not able to tell that there will never be any values above 7 so the index was not used slowing down event handling. Turning the query to match &lt; 7 fixes the problem. The database might also not be able to infer that the index can be indeed used, for example when prepared statements are involved WHERE severity_id &lt; ?. The database will not be able to tell that all bindings of ? will satisfy &lt; 7 so will not use the index (unless you are running PG 12, then that might depend on the setting of plan_cache_mode[1] but I have not tested that yet).Another thing is that HOT updates in PostgreSQL can&#39;t be performed if the updated field is indexed but that also includes being part of a WHERE clause in a partial index. So you could have a site like HN and think that it would be nice to index stories WHERE vote &gt; 100 to quickly find more popular stories. That index however would nullify the possiblity of a hot update when the vote tally would be updated. Again, not a problem but you need to know the possible drawbacks.That said, they are great when used for the right purpose. Kudos to the author for a nice article![1] - https://postgresqlco.nf/doc/en/param/plan_cache_mode/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Coming from Oracle, I was always taught that NULLs are not indexedThat left me wondering how, if all indexes are by default partial in Oracle… how does one make an unpartial? nonpartial? index.https://use-the-index-luke.com/sql/where-clause/null/indexApparently, you add a computed column to the index that just computes a constant value. And single non-null column then causes the nulls in other columns to get indexed, it&#39;s only if the whole tuple is composed of nulls that it gets left out.That also seems like a bug waiting to happen; someone inverts a query to find unset (NULL) entries, and now you&#39;re doing a table scan.…but it seems also like a form of brain rot, induced by a particular implementation, e.g., similar to how I&#39;ve had MySQL users ask how to make a key on a table. Where a &#34;key&#34; is an index, it&#39;s just that MySQL by default uses the word &#34;key&#34; to mean index, instead of … key¹. (The query language even supports &#34;INDEX&#34; in place of &#34;KEY&#34;, but things like &#34;SHOW TABLE&#34; default to the &#34;wrong&#34; (linguistically, not programmatically) word.) And then you might have to de-tangle why these two are different concepts, how they&#39;re different. It&#39;s very Arrival, in the sense of language (mis-)shaping perception.¹a key is a set of columns that are sufficient to identify a row. The primary such set of columns is … the primary key. An index can index a key (if more than one exists within a table), but it doesn&#39;t have to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; They already host source code of millions of apps. Release integration should be trivial to implement.Release integration is trivial for anyone. It&#39;s the easiest and most irrelevant part of the app stores.&gt; Unlike Google they actually listen to their users. They were awesome during youtube-dl debacle.And controversial on others, like shutting down Popcorn Time&#39;s repository. As any other, they&#39;ll listen if there&#39;s enough outcry.&gt; Backed by Microsoft. Microsoft has been playing good by the developers for years now. I trust them more than Apple and Google.This is situational and opportunistic. It can change any day. In fact, managing an important app store is exactly one way to re-(un)-balance this relationship.&gt; They could finally give the desktop the app store it deservesMicrosoft won&#39;t have GitHub compete with the Microsoft Store and its newer efforts like winget. It would unermine their unifying vision that has been in the works for years for no benefit.&gt; This is a minor but users will be able to raise issues with developers directly instead writing comments over app pages which I think you would agree completely suck.Sure, lets pipe user feedback directly into GitHub issues. Good luck with that if you have a hundred issues a day.I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a single angle that would paint this as a good idea. Phone manufacturers like Samsung are in a much much better position to try. And indeed they have been trying an failing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like a great way to create incentives that undermine githubs mission while simultaneously taking a huge amount of developer resources for a product that will have niche interest at best.Building app stores is hard. Moderating app stores is hard. Both are significantly different from running GitHub.While I appreciate the author&#39;s intent here, this just doesn&#39;t feel like it was deeply thought out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Or we could just stop using app stores.Honestly, I&#39;ve yet to find an argument for the existence of an app store that holds water. Let people install what they want. Provide reasonable paths to update and upgrade and cut out the middle layer.The layer of control that Google and Apple exert over people is anti-competitive. But the answer isn&#39;t competing app stores. I don&#39;t need someone to tell me what I can or can&#39;t install on the operating system on my device."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everyone assuming a conspiracy theory needs to read this.Keep in mind that Robinhood also gives everyone a margin account by default. They also let people invest on margin before their inbound bank transfers arrive (Robinhood Instant). The influx of new traders sending money to Robinhood or selling other stocks to buy GME quickly drained their credit lines, reducing the capital they had available for collateral.Keep in mind that when someone sells a different stock to buy GME in the same day, they&#39;re buying GME on margin. Stock trades don&#39;t settle until T+2, so any new purchases using those proceeds are done on margin.This was a capital crunch at Robinhood due to an unexpected herd of new traders all looking to do the same thing in unison. It violated the assumptions of their business model, and the only way to keep the platform from grinding to insolvency (or violating regulations) was to slow down the unexpected event by slowing meme stock purchases.Is it really so hard to believe that such an unprecedented mass movement would break the underlying business assumptions of a pre-IPO startup that was heavily dependent on their credit lines?The biggest problem is Robinhood&#39;s poor messaging. It&#39;s clear their highest priority was to avoid admission that they were running out of money. They didn&#39;t want to trigger a bank run or shake the confidence of their newly acquired users, so they tried to obscure the message as much as possible. As a result, the popular narrative assumed some sort of evil conspiracy theory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">",,Robinhood legally could not submit trades on $GME until they could muster the deposits for GME that they needed. &#39;&#39;This sounds like a liquidity issue, but Robinhood&#39;s CEO said in the interview that there was no liquidity issue.The why doesn&#39;t matter at this point because Robinhood CEO was caught lying by contradicting himself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Similar explanation was posted Jan 28 on twitter by Silent Cal[1]. This article and the twitter thread do paint a very plausible explanation. And is easy to accept.OTOH, a potentially far more nefarious, yet plausible, underlying motive was posted on /r/wsb today [2] that links GME to counterfeiting shorts.Given Steve Cohen&#39;s numerous scandals through the years as detailed on wikipedia [3], needing to cover up for counterfeiting shorts also seems like a plausible explanation.I hope the finance committee investigations AOC called for take place and consider both points.* - Not invested in GME, and prohibited from doing so by my employer.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I realize this is a site about the past, but I really hope this is the future. I want an internet of specialty sites, browsable curations, diversity of offering, freedom of choice, and full of the quirky/unusual. It might have to do with growing up in the 90s and experiencing that kind of world wide web, w/o walled gardens.Several years back, perhaps even via an HN post or comment, I came across a blog, hosted on a university network (IIRC, perhaps related to media studies). The page consisted of a group of possibly graduate students contributing some of the weirdest and most obscure media I&#39;ve ever seen online. Nothing obscene and nothing seemingly new/current, so it was rather hipster in that sense, but I kick myself for not having saved the URL.Nothing says I need to use walled gardens or get my news from the big networks, but I often feel I&#39;m being pointed that way. In the end, I just want something different than what&#39;s usually being served up.(It doesn&#39;t escape me that this 90&#39;s TV site is full of walled garden/big network type content of the time)"</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25963589">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s interesting to me that this delineates between facts and personal experience as if personal experience doesn&#39;t occupy the same space as facts. Perhaps a more useful way to think about people&#39;s relation to truth is one of proximity. For a given individual, their personal experience is entirely factual, and because it is also most proximate to them, it is weighted the most highly. Intuitively, I think we understand this, so we tend to weight other people&#39;s experiences similarly, knowing that those are as proximate to them as our experiences are to us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key point:&#34;The problem is that facts—at least today—are themselves subject to doubt, especially when they conflict with our political beliefs (21). In the past decades, America has seen a decentralization of news and information (22) that has allowed people to gather their “own facts” (i.e., alternative facts; ref. 23). Most recently, claims of “fake news” allow people to distrust any information that fails to align with their political beliefs (24, 25) and to trust fake news that aligns with their beliefs (26).&#34;This is the epistemic crisis we&#39;re currently facing. Up until about the late 70s we had 3 news networks that were all pretty much middle of the road politically. Newspapers could have more of a discernible political leaning, but even there most of the mainstream ones we&#39;re pretty centrist. People who hewed to an extreme political position in either direction were ostracized and thus had a very small audience. We had more of a common narrative which is now gone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A personal experience is a fact. It is a fact we can be pretty sure of, and we know the context of that fact. Obviously, once we extrapolate from that experienced fact, it becomes bias.A fact that is not a personal experience is difficult to trust. Even if I trust the source of that fact, I am often not sure if I understand the fact properly. Anyone who has ever tried to understand a math theorem might relate.It is entirely rational to trust more in your personal bias. In fact, I would argue that the only way to trust a fact is to make it somehow into something that you can personally experience. For example, to understand a math theorem, it helps to look at lots of different kinds of examples where it holds (and where it doesn&#39;t)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe this kind of thing is a big contributor to Amazon&#39;s hegemony in online shopping. I&#39;m reluctant to order from other sites because there&#39;s a whole new set of dark patterns I may fall victim to. At least I&#39;m familiar enough with Amazon to know I&#39;m not getting charged for things I didn&#39;t intend to order, the low stock warnings are somewhat legitimate, etc. I&#39;m not saying Amazon doesn&#39;t have its own issues, but at least it&#39;s a known quantity.If it weren&#39;t for Amazon&#39;s dominance, other sites would be able to compete without resorting to these dark patterns, so this is a self-perpetuating cycle: people only shop on Amazon -&gt; the only other sites that can survive are the ones that engage in deception -&gt; trust in non-Amazon shopping sites decreases -&gt; people only shop on Amazon -&gt; ...I don&#39;t mean to cast these scammy shopping websites as victims. My concern is more about how the legitimate sites that could exist don&#39;t because they&#39;re crowded out by Amazon (and other big players like Walmart) and the scammy shopping sites this article discusses."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is interesting - I feel like the site should separate dark patterns that add information from ones that lie or obfuscate. In my experience, consumers feel differently about these categories.I&#39;ve sat in on a few dozen user research sessions for ecommerce. This was qualitative research that included their general shopping habits, and additionally testing new features. The most interesting thing that I learned is that consumers (a) are generally pretty aware of when they&#39;re being pressured, and (b) are fine if it&#39;s transparent and accurate.A classic example of this were low-stock notifications. The shoppers were generally okay with being told that something was low stock if that was really true. Many people could name specific items they lost because they were sold out. Some could also name instances of when they had bought something &#34;1 item remaining&#34; and seen it on sale the next day. They preferred having the information because it helped them make an informed decision. It turns out that lots of people browse the same items for a while, and use sales or almost-out-of-stock as a &#34;now or never&#34; moment.The most interesting user session I ever sat in on was for a countdown timer for a sale ending. The designer refused to design it at first, and then was like, &#34;fine, I&#39;m going to design the hell out of this and then show you in user research that nobody wants this.&#34; And then she showed it to 5 people in user research, who were generally okay with it on the condition that it counted down to the actual sale ending. Some said they actually liked knowing, because when they&#39;re just looking on their phones they might not be in a good position to buy it, and want to know how much time they have later to get it. They said that they&#39;ll often refresh the page to see if the timer resets, because if it starts ticking from the same time, they feel like the site is just scammy and they&#39;ll leave.Anyways, I&#39;m not trying to defend lots of these patterns. Most of them are clearly wrong, and the ones that I mentioned above can also be used to lie and deceive. But I wouldn&#39;t put them all together - in my experience, consumers generally want accurate information even if they&#39;re aware that the company is doing it to pressure them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So we got notified by the developer console at 21:45 UTC that the app had been suspended, but still haven’t had an email to explain why - it’s 02:24 now.Our assumption that this is due to someone reporting abusive content in Matrix to Google, and Element catching the blame — although this is currently speculation.To be clear: Element is a Matrix client just as Chrome is a Web browser, and just as it’s possible to view abusive material via Chrome, the same is true of Element.However, we abhor abuse, and on the default matrix.org server (and other Matrix servers the core team maintains) we have a fairly strict terms of use at https://matrix.org/legal/terms-and-conditions#6-play-nice-cl... which we proactively enforce. Meanwhile we have a comprehensive toolset at https://matrix.org/docs/guides/moderation to help folks moderate, and are making good process with decentralised reputation to empower users and admins to filter out stuff they don’t want to see, as per https://matrix.org/blog/2020/10/19/combating-abuse-in-matrix....So, it’s very unfortunate and frustrating that we’re in this position - hopefully Google will explain what’s going on shortly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is this google starting to test the waters when it comes to arbitrarily kicking out software they personally don&#39;t like? (open source, decentralized, privacy oriented etc.) I might of course be exaggerating a bit here, keep that in mind.- Element and Matrix are growing but still not equipped to fight back at large against this, so it is unlikely to create too much negative press- If Google starts to catch too much critique for this decision they can put it back and always blame $errorI believe Element will be back soon, the problem I see here is that it will be framed as an &#34;honest mistake&#34; and then become forgotten until they pull another stunt like this.Even if these removals are temporary, they can still hurt growth. Let&#39;s assume a bit more malice: Couldn&#39;t Google just monitor and analyze metrics of an undesirable app (downloads, usage, hype), pick a critical point in its growth then &#34;accidentaly&#34; remove it for a few days, causing damage that isn&#39;t immediately apparent, but nonetheless long lasting?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe that removal of Element from Google Play Store is a violation of EU regulation 2019/1150.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you read the other threads it&#39;s clear what&#39;s happening is that robinhood&#39;s product isn&#39;t designed to cope with high volatility[1]. Is this a flaw in their product? Yes. But then again, they are a discount brokerage for a reason. It&#39;s not any different than any other consumer product that shits the bed during 99.9 percentile events.[1] Specifically, they&#39;re required by the DTCC to put up a deposit on every trade their users make. During periods of low volatility this is fine because they can come up with the money, but when volatility goes up so do the deposit requirements, which can cause them to become insolvent. This is further compounded by the fact that their product invisibly hands out margin, eg. &#34;instant&#34; deposits of $1000, or giving you the money before it settles (2 days later)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;And though traders may be outraged by the surprise, Robinhood’s terms of service grant it permission to close a trader’s position under a number of circumstances.&#34;The terms of service for EVERY service we use are entirely legal jargon for &#34;we can do whatever the f*k we want to do with any data on our service, and you have no legal recourse.&#34; No matter what the company says about &#34;privacy&#34; or any other rights you think you have, buried in there somewhere is a clause that says that no matter what happens, you can&#39;t sue. What do you expect when you&#39;ve abdicated the right to sue the company for something you think is illegal or injurious? It&#39;s supposed to be the bastion of last resort, to keep everyone honest. When the safety net of the legal system is gone (e.g., forced arbitration) -- or only used for one side, there&#39;s nothing to restrain these humungous companies which are running the world now. We&#39;re a long way past needing a legal reset on &#34;terms of service.&#34;"</p>

Our development goal was &#34;fast and opportunistic&#34;. As you can expect, the product was full of bugs, and customer support had their hands full. It was a shitty product with a lot of customers.I didn&#39;t see how this would ever turn into a success story. We were digging a grave. But I didn&#39;t realize 1 thing: we were not selling a product, we were selling the company.In the end, a huge Canadian competitor wanted a foothold in the European market, and so they bought us (and our customers). They were going to introduce their own product to the customers, and so our product was thrown in the wastebasket.In the end, it all ended as planned, and the founders walked away with a lot of money. Basically they built a customer base in EU, and sold that one to another company.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Go big or go home&#34;.  This seems to be a uniquely north-American attitude.  Germany, or maybe Europe, is full of so-called &#34;Mittelstand&#34; companies that are good in what they do, have 500-ish employees, have been in the same family ownership for generations and provide a good solid living for everyone involved.  What is wrong with that?  It goes without saying that staying mid-sized doesn&#39;t mean staying complacent, but you can innovate without growing huge.Here in Ottawa, there was a debacle a few years ago.  A typical such company, Swiss Pastries, changed ownership or at least management.  The new attitude was &#34;grow at all costs&#34;, they overextended themselves, went bankrupt, and Swiss Pastries is no more.  Ottawa now has no local source of soft pretzels along with other delicacies that they made.  It&#39;s almost a scorched earth approach.  If you can&#39;t make the company huge, you might as well destroy it, because not being huge means you&#39;ve failed.The previous paragraph is based on reading a few news articles at the time.  If I&#39;m wrong, I&#39;m guessing it still makes a textbook example of &#34;go big or go home&#34; going wrong and I&#39;d love to see more details."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Fair warning. Buying stocks with high short interest is, over the long run, a terrible investment strategy. Mountains of academic research has consistently found the most heavily shorted stocks to significantly underperform the market[1] (to the order of 10% per year).Heavily shorted stocks tend to be the companies with the most negative cash flow shocks[2], low quality earnings statements[3], negative earnings revisions, and future bad news[4]. In other words, when a company is heavily shorted it&#39;s almost always for a good reason. (Like being a brick and mortar video game retailer, that&#39;s losing mountains of cash with no turnaround plan.) High short interest is a tell-tale warning of a bad investment.This shouldn&#39;t be surprising. Research has consistently found that short-sellers are the most sophisticated and well-informed investors in the market[5]. There activity strongly predicts soon-to-be released negative public announcements[6].

If you admit on TV that your company is experiencing liquidity issues -- even if temporary in nature such as with clearing custodianship requirements -- you run the risk of triggering a greater panic through customer withdrawals/redemptions.This could turn into a run on the brokerage pretty quickly, and probably already has in some measure, especially after a day of massively lost customer trust.

In his video, Rossmann covers the technicalities and systems behind actually __making__ a trade with an app like RH. The videos were very informative and I learned quite a lot.With the exception of his recent interviews, it isn’t exactly clear what Robinhood was supposed to do differently. If my understanding is correct, clearing houses required more money up front to perform trades - RH didn’t have it so they stopped the trades unidirectionally. People got upset that they couldn’t buy but could sell which made it seem like RH wanted to manipulate the price - but isn’t it better than the alternative, the inability to both sell and buy would seem to me worse than what was done. Imagine them closing both and preventing people from selling if a crash occurs. The discussion would simply be « Robinhood stole our gains and wouldn’t let us move our funds ».Now, should it be the case that more money is required up front, intuitively it makes sense, I mean, who is supposed to front the bill on those 5000% returns? The hedge fund that just went bankrupt? Where exactly does this money come from?Isn’t RH just trying to play within the realities of the current system?Genuinely curious.[1]: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MAqxQe0l4g0&amp;feature=youtu.be[2]: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=RQTC5f_VR9I&amp;feature=youtu.be"</p>

Unlike so many virtue-signaling Silicon Valley darlings, the guy behind the curtain was an honorable dude. And again, that’s a direct account from someone who has no vested interest or a book to sell or anything of that sort.Dick and I worked closely together, one on one. After enough time, after he trusted me, I finally got to ask him about what the hell actually happened. The man had a ton of PTSD — and probably still does — but eventually it became clear that the real story was completely, utterly, unbelievably stupid.Yes, Lehman was doing a bunch of stupid stuff, and the management under Dick were behaving like cowboys. But at the end of the day, that was the entire market at that time. What sunk Lehman was, in the end, a decision by all of the other big banks and the regulators that they’d let Lehman die because of something that might be best summarized as “lol idk sorry Dick but we’re just gonna let you go and let the Fed bail the rest of us out sorry bro lol.” Like really. That’s how it went behind those closed doors in the lairs of the lizards that control the universe. Lehman had already  suffered near-death in 1994 — the world has now forgotten that Dick was the hero that saved the firm back then — and now it was to be made a sacrificial lamb for everyone else’s benefit.Why am I telling you this story? What is the point? Well, what I am trying to say is that these supposed “adults in the room” who are so much smarter and better than the the “retail investors” are pretty much the same sort of immature, self-centered children as the other side. The difference is, they’ve got the regulators  and the politicians in their pockets. So when they say “lol oops” and literally blow up the global economy to save face, nothing happens to them. But for some reason when it’s the retail guys, a moral panic ensues.In my eyes, the Internet-connected retail investor is learning the power of what I call “massively multiplayer liquidity.” Yes, there’s some growing pains, but let’s not kill this wild new phenomenon before we learn what it can do. Because, from what I’ve seen from the other side of things, I doubt these self-styled “retards” will ever end up as depraved and corrupt as the people they’re disrupting.Play ball, kids. And as Dick always used to say, “don’t get left with nothing other than a ham sandwich.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There’s a long history of similar occurrences that follow along a common line: whatever appears to support individual investors will be the path taken by politicians and regulatory bodies.Right now it appears that the public wants to be able to trade on their terms because there is this narrative that the little guy is finally sticking it to the big bad hedge funds. In reality there is probably very little truth to this. However, support for the individual investor plays extremely well which is why you see politicians from both sides joining forces on this issue. A rumor makes it halfway around the world while the truth is still putting its pants on. Nobody is interested in the subtleties around these issues where there almost certainly should be regulations in place or at least warnings from those who do actually know better. But late in bull markets when speculation is running wild those who try to be the voice of reason are run over by the masses until they shut up and go away.Galbraith wrote about this in the 1950’s and if you read his account of the 1929 crash the parallels are eerily similar. Nobody wants to be told they aren’t making money due to skill but because they’re caught up in a dangerous bubble. In the aftermath of a crash when tremendous sums are lost, nobody blames the speculators, they always find another scapegoat- the regulators, the brokerages, the hedge funds- whomever. It doesn’t matter so long as the speculator is held up as a victim. I expect this to end no differently."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Dark patterns are everywhere and I&#39;m afraid not enough people are raising a ruckus about them. For example, the &#34;Google Pay&#34; app in India, which works via the UPI system, shows its own &#34;scanner code&#34; in the app as opposed to the standard UPI QR code. Furthermore, you can&#39;t discover where the UPI QR code is, if you want to pay using BHIM - an app that works directly with UPI payments. If you&#39;re using GPay too, then you can access the scanner code. If not, you used to be able to select the UPI QR code from a menu and scan that. However, later updates have hidden that - not eliminated it, mind you, deliberately hidden that. You have to &#34;swipe left&#34; when you see the GPay scanner code to get to the QR code - not at all a discoverble act. My wife discovered it by accident after we were puzzled a few times about where the QR code that used to be accessible went (both of us use BHIM). As a consequence, folks who use GPay do not know about UPI. This is, in my books, malicious design. Hanlon&#39;s razor would ask me to try &#34;stupidity&#34; first. But no. This isn&#39;t stupidity. It is downright malicious (the benign term being &#34;dark pattern&#34;) to do this .. at least at Google&#39;s level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s also worth mentioning that the misconception of thinking UX as being solely related to aesthetics is getting dangerously more and more common, even among professionals referring to themselves as UX designers.Aesthetics is important, but, in some sorts of systems, it has much lower priority than other non-functional requirements, like overall speed, maintainability, testability and so on.I don&#39;t know if my experience is the same of most of you, but I&#39;ve seen more and more systems getting aesthetic pleasant but painfully slow and/or buggy these days. It&#39;s easy when you can simply quit using the software, but when your bank, your broker, your airline, your accountant, the company that operates the subway ticket machines, when those sorts of businesses start to embrace such vision, things start to get complicated.And, unfortunately, all those examples I mention here are real and this is not an exhaustive list.Besides, I&#39;m not sure those companies (at least the ones in my examples) do that as an attempt to exploit users. I believe they do that due to plain lack of competence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d actually argue otherwise - UX has gotten tremendously better in the last decade. Online products have been moulded perfectly towards improving the use case for their customers.The main issue though is that you aren&#39;t the customer anymore.Look at Facebook - they&#39;ve done an absolutely incredible job becoming a dream experience for advertisers. Youtube has catered to these advertisers as well and blocked controversial content that wouldn&#39;t look good next to their brand. It&#39;s a golden age to be at the head of a marketing team with a large ad budget. These companies have made golden escalators for getting sponsored content in front of the productized consumers.If you want UX to succeed and become something that benefits you as a user, then you should focus on platforms where you truly are the customer. Look at Square or Patreon - in both platforms you are truly the customer, and their UX is incredible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This has always been my pet peeve with jobs that won&#39;t hire people without &#39;5-7 years experience with X&#39; - the vast majority of these jobs do not need an EXPERT on language x, or framework y. If they do, the rest of this post does not apply.You can learn enough of a language to be dangerous in just a couple weeks. Enough to be productive in 2-3 months. However, there are 3 other things you have to learn:1. How the code for the project you are hired for works. How it&#39;s laid out. All the weird shit about it.2. How the framework/libraries used by the project works. Nothing to do with the project, but maybe you haven&#39;t used Angular, Swing, or Boost before.3. How the data is laid out, and how it gets in/out of your system. What database tables are there, what&#39;s the workflow.Those 3 things are the hard part and what take 6-12 months. Learning Javascript, Ruby, or whatever language is the least of your worries."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Glamorous Toolkit (https://gtoolkit.com) by feenk, which embodies the thesis of this blog post, is in my opinion the most exciting working development environment in decades.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some of us (me, for example :) have to spend multiple weeks a year to draw the design architecture of certain parts of the product. During engineering meetings everybody raised the same question: i commit to new area in product, how can I understand what are the components and how to do certain things? You can ask your colleagues but they might know it as well.So I decided to document main flows and designs in PlantUML diagrams. having these diagrams greatly improved onboarding process, cause you can quickly glance what component does what and what are the dependencies (the code base was in JS, so it is usually quite limited on refactoring/figuring out wtf is going on).But the problem with such approach is: diagram quickly gets out of date. Someone makes the change and the diagram makes no sense at all now. With what I saw in Gtoolkit, you can always query the real source code and build custom dev tools that always produce current and real overview of the system. I would love to have a starter kit for JS projects that you can drag and drop and start building your own tooling for your product."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"FWIW I ran a startup that provided you with a program (single binary) that allowed you to run natural language queries on your database across most schemas. It had a full semantics layers which translated your query into a mixed-lambda calculus-prolog query, which is then translated into SQL as needed - you can see a sample of the semantics layer here: https://youtu.be/fd4EPh2tYrk?t=92.It&#39;s deep learning based with a lot of augmentation. Going from the OP&#39;s article to actually being able to run queries on any schema is quite a bit more work. I&#39;d love to see GPT3 handle arbitrary schemas.p/s: the startup failed. deep research based startups need a lot of funds."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Woah. I never gave it my database schema but it assumes I have a table called &#34;users&#34; (which is accurate) and that there&#39;s a timestamp field called &#34;signup_time&#34; for when a user signed up.I am definitely impressed by the fact that it could get this close without knowledge of the schema, and that you can provide additional context about the schema.  Seems like there is a lot of potential for building a natural language query engine that is hooked up to a database.  I suppose there is always a risk that a user could generate a dangerous query but that could be mitigated.Not related to the article but what exactly is &#34;open&#34; about OpenAI?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a use case where AI-powered SQL is a solution in search of a problem, and introduces more issues than just doing boring SQL. For data analysis, it&#39;s much more important to be accurate than fast, and this article is unclear how many attempts each example query took. GPT-3 does not always output coherent output (even with good prompts), and since not 100% of the output is valid SQL the QA and risk tolerance of bad output affects the economics.OpenAI&#39;s GPT-3 API is expensive enough (especially with heavy prompt engineering) that the time saved may not outweigh the cost, particularly if the output is not 100% accurate."</p>

When &#34;something must be done&#34; about this or that... because digital culture progresses to some point, the deep well of ideas that dominated web culture have zero impact.Ultimately, the encryption argument is being had between spooks and tech monopolies. Politicians are bystanders. There is no &#34;freedom of speech&#34; equivalent, no idea of the current technological age to guide them. No flag for the public to rally to.The right to privacy is great, but we can&#39;t just keep arguing by analogy. We need modern age thinking to define this for modern circumstances."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I always say if politicians want to ban encryption being absolute (by making it insecure): you first. Lets see how well it works by implementing encraption in your systems and email and seeing if your backdoor deals and illegal activity winds up in the public eye for all to see."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Put simply, the resolution is no different from the previous proposals which generated a wide backlash from privacy-conscious companies, civil society members, experts, and MEPs. The difference this time is that the Council has taken a more subtle approach and avoided explicitly using words like ‘ban’ or ‘backdoor.’ But make no mistake, this is the intention. It’s important that steps are taken now to prevent these proposals going too far and keep European’s rights to privacy intact.”"</p>

I was apprehensive about adding the closed-contribution policy but I&#39;ve seen overwhelmingly positive support for it since I released.Some commenters have noted that I could use another free code hosting platform. That&#39;s a valid criticism. However, I like the tools and workflow that GitHub offers personally. The GitHub Discussions feature in particular has been a nice step toward improving communication. GitHub Actions have been really nice for a CI workflow too."</p>

Is sourceforge still around?"</p>

We ended up saying it&#39;s a legal problem [1], which it partly is. But throw away not only because of quality issues, always because of project scope issues.Yes, you feel the project is completely useless unless emoji icons animate in diagrams. That&#39;s great, fork the project and kill ours off by adding the feature (which they won&#39;t and it won&#39;t).When you know what the project scope is, tight enforcement of that scope is critical to prevent the complexity of the project from running away and ultimately killing the project entirely.https://github.com/jgraph/drawio"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;a workable plan that enables more free speech, [...] That approach: build protocols, not platforms.  To be clear, this is an approach that would bring us back to the way the internet used to be. The early internet involved many different protocols—instructions and standards that anyone could then use to build a compatible interface. As I&#39;ve commented before[1][2], discussing protocols and advocating for them is a popular topic but it does not make progress.The real issue is funding and trying to make humans do what they don&#39;t want to do.If HN is overrepresented by vanguards of decentralization and free speech, why are a lot of us here on HN instead of running USENET nodes and posting to a newsgroup such as &#34;comp.programming.hackernews&#34; to avoid being moderated by dang?If most of HN knows how to set up git and stand up a web server, why do most of use Github instead of running Gitlab on a home pc/laptop/RaspberryPi or rent a Digital Ocean vps?It&#39;s because &#34;free &amp; open protocols&#34; weren&#39;t really the issue!A lot of us don&#39;t want to run a USENET node or manage our own git server to share code.[1] the so-called &#34;open&#34; internet of free protocols: 
https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20231960[2] free &amp; royalty free protocol like Signal still doesn&#39;t solve the &#34;who pays for running the server&#34; problem:  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=20232499"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;After a decade or so of the general sentiment being in favor of the internet and social media as a way to enable more speech and improve the marketplace of ideas, in the last few years the view has shifted dramatically—now it seems that almost no one is happy.&#34;10 or 15 years ago people looked at web 1.0, saw many good communities and valuable conversations and said &#34;we need to protect free speech&#34;.Today people looks at Twitter/Facebook/YouTube/Reddit, see mismanaged cesspools and declare that we need centralized speech control.This is understandable, but highly reactionary and irrational. Speech control is facilitated by big tech at their own discretion. Advocating for more of it means you&#39;re advocating for giving more power to the companies who fucked up the system in the first place."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read, and re-read the article and I am yet to understand how a protocol will help what the author describes in the first few paragraphs. (BTW very nicely walked around that hot bowl of mess!)First, Usenet was just as much of a dumpster fire as Reddit et al. in some branches (alt. I am looking at you).  The rest (comp. soc. sci. etc) were heavily self moderated.Second, I am not sure the author is clear on what is the primary product of social media, as I see it. We, the users are the product.  By moving to a protocol, there is little to no opportunity to capture private information about the product. (Not complexity, too big, or filter bubble.)Why would a platform give up such income stream?Am I misunderstanding what the author means by protocol here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Depository Trust &amp; Clearing Corporation settles most listed securities transactions in America; in 2011, it did $1.7 quadrillion [1]. You&#39;ve never heard of it unless you&#39;re a professional trader, but it&#39;s actually quite fascinating to read up on.Trading looks instantaneous. But settlement takes a few days. In between are a series of credit agreements. From your broker to you. From the clearinghouse to the brokers. DTCC is the clearinghouse. Robinhood is the broker.There are rules and contracts between DTCC and its members, including Robinhood [2]. Those contracts ensure that when you buy shares through your broker from a Robinhood customer, if Robinhood falls down two days later, there is collateral sufficient to make you whole. Those collateral requirements change in reference to, amongst other things, the volatility of the security. (If a broker falls down, the clearinghouse liquidates their collateral and makes their counterparty whole. More volatility means more chance the collateral will be insufficient.)In this case, collateral requirements on GME went up. Because of its volatility. So while before Robinhood had to pony up collateral for a few shares of GME for every hundred it traded, it now had to, at close of business, pony up one hundred shares&#39; worth of collateral for every hundred it traded. That creates a cash crunch. One that exacerbates itself with every additional trade in the security. If Robinhood fails to satisfy those collateral calls, they go out of business overnight. Into receivership. Done.Most brokers have policies for these situations. Higher brokerage fees for securities on a schedule. Not making shares and cash from trades available until the trade settles, sort of like what banks do for large cheques. But I don&#39;t know if Robinhood is able to do that quickly. So instead they pulled the plug.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Depository_Trust_%26_Clearing_...[2] https://www.dtcclearning.com/products-and-services/settlemen..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I suspect this will be lost in the hysterical clamour, but yes, it is in fact true that trading platforms have to worry about systemic risk and their ability to work with certain capital obligations. The idea that this just boils down to some good old boy phoning up RH and asking them to pump GME doesn&#39;t stand up to very much scrunity at all. But such is life- the baseless conspiracy is easier to believe if you don&#39;t spend time understanding how these companies work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The RH apologists are going on long winded explanations about clearing houses (and to some extent there’s elements of “it’s too complex for your little brain”). But even to the extent it’s true, if I put in 5k from my checkings into RH and buy stock, why does Rh need all this liquidity to get orders filled? I understand turning margin accounts off, but that’s it . Past that, at best robinhoods business model is highly flawed , at worst it’s fraudulent. Because ultimately, all the finance whiz bang talk doesn’t change common sense that only allowing trades in one direction is unfair, and is incredibly bad optics when that direct benefits a huge player filled with conflicts of interest. But honestly I think the “robinhood is committing fraud” is being underweighted amongst “serious “ discussion."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s been a while since I did this, but last time I transferred shares from one brokerage to another, it took several days.It seems to me that if you are holding GME, the last possible thing you want is being stuck in a position for a while.For this particular case, it might be a better choice is to liquidate your position, cash out and just open another brokerage account. I know this is the total opposite of what the WSBs are looking for but the alternative is transferring a position with $50k and when you can trade again its only worth $500."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi guys, Alex Oshmyansky here, CEO of the Mark Cuban Cost Plus Drug Company. Crazy to see our little project at the top of Hacker News!We&#39;re planning to introduce a lot more drugs with transparent prices later this year, cutting out monopolistic middlemen in the supply chain and alleviating pharma drug shortages, particularly for rare and orphan disease conditions.We are looking for a few devs (fullstack, frontend, and backend). If anybody is interested, drop me a line at alex@costplusdrugs.comIn the meantime, happy to answer questions if anyone is interested!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve wondered for a long time how much money could be saved if the non-trivial administrative overhead of insurance companies were removed from all but truly catastrophic cases (where claims start at $10k or more) and medical, dental, and drug costs were paid out of pocket (including via an HSA account).  There are numerous cases where cash-only medical clinics are able to offer up-front pricing for a fraction of what is billed to medical insurance companies.  If Cuban&#39;s idea is &#34;we don&#39;t do insurance but you&#39;re free to pay with an HSA card or seek reimbursement from your insurance company&#34; then this could be a huge winner."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with drug prices isn&#39;t because of the drug manufacturers, it&#39;s with the middle-men and private insurance companies. At least, that&#39;s what the manufacturers are sayingFor instance, with the manufacturers of insulin, none of them are American and they offer to sell the insulin to everyone at the same price.The problem is that the large insurance companies use just three middle-men drug buyers called Pharmacy Benefits Managers (PBM) who DEMAND growing discounts every year from drug manufacturers, so the drug manufactures have to raise the prices to the US market every year to keep making a profit.Novo Nordisk is willing to sell insulin much cheaper, but the drug buyers demand about a 75% discount off of the wholesale cost or they&#39;ll make the product not covered by the insurance companies they represent. To compensate, they raise the wholesale price in the US so after the forced discounts, they still make the same amount of money.The people who suffer are the ones who don&#39;t have insurance.The solution, at least in the case of insulin, isn&#39;t cheaper prices from the manufacturer, it&#39;s for the US to pass a law that prevents insurance companies from dropping a product based on the refusal to discount the product if it&#39;s under a certain price-per-month.This article seems to cover the finger-pointing between the manufacturers and PBM&#39;s and insurane companies very well: https://www.healthline.com/diabetesmine/pharmacy-benefit-man...?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; These points doubtless make me appear to be a complacent shill for the financial industry, talking down to the rubes. For the record, I’m still angry about the way workers were ripped off in Britain more than three decades ago, and about the way the little guy ended up bearing the brunt for the financial implosions of 2000 and 2008. But it looks horribly to me as though the same thing is going to happen again — and I don’t think the answer to today’s many ills is to empower poor people to bankrupt themselves with margin accounts and derivatives.Who is this hurting, exactly? The author is making it sound like messing up the short stock is somehow hurting &#34;the little guy&#34; in the long run, and I wouldn&#39;t see that happening unless:a) Gamestop is somehow in a bunch of mutual funds tied to employee pensions/401k&#39;sb) The &#34;little guy&#34; refers to the Reddit traders that are making a killing right now, with the expectation that eventually the stock price will crash again.As best I can figure, most of the /r/ guys are doing this as a form of trolling and aren&#39;t expecting to get rich off it or pour their live-savings into it. And again, as best I can figure, the only people this &#34;hurts&#34; are the ones who were originally shorting the stock. So if this comes down to guys on Reddit pissing in Wall Street&#39;s cornflakes, it&#39;s hard for me to feel sympathetic for Wall Street."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Somewhat related. IKEA is the largest owner of forests in Lithuania (around 33% of the total land area is forest):https://www.lrt.lt/en/news-in-english/19/1104260/ikea-the-bi...At the time of this article (2019), they owned 66,000 acres of forest in the country."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s none of my business if Ikea wants to buy productive forest land and take it out of production.However, I don&#39;t understand how it is any kind of signal of virtue.Would it be virtuous to buy productive farm land and take it out of circulation?How is forest land any different?In a previous life, it would be broadly correct to say that I worked in the forest industry.  My body still hurts when I think about it.I worked for wood lot owners, felling trees, trimming off the branches, sectioning the logs, splitting the wood and then stacking it to be sold by the cord.  These woodlots had been in operation for over 150 years.  Same land, different trees.  They still operate now.I also worked as a tree planter, hired by small contractors working for &#39;big forest&#39;.  Us tree planters went in after the heavy equipment had ripped out the trees, tearing the land to shreds in the process.  It felt like what ground would have been like after a B-52 strike, an eerie hell scape, but with an explosion of small plants and flowers with new access to the sun, deer and other wildlife roaming free, wondering at the strange human interloper.  Sometimes wolves and bears, at which point it felt rather lonely, me with a Swiss Army knife (mostly for the fork) and my nearest crew mate being well outside shouting distance.The churned up land we were planting had been pulp forest itself for over a hundred years.  As I planted, others were taking soil and water samples.  To the forest company, the forest was a long term asset and that it thrived was in their interest.I didn&#39;t think about it much then, but others long dead had planted that ground before me.  Those foot long trees I planted have long been harvested and new trees planted in their place.Trees are like wheat, or corn, or quinoa.  Except instead of being a once a year crop, trees are once every twenty five years or so.Otherwise, what&#39;s the difference?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not implying that this is corporate propaganda to cater to the US public, but something similar happened to my country where saving the planet is not on the agenda of its citizens since there are other problems that need to be solved first. [1]&#34;IKEA’s goal is to purchase wood which is 100 per cent FSC-certified from these countries. At the same time there are many indications that forests with high conservation values are being logged by FSC-certified companies. FSC-certification is far from a guarantee for socially- and environmentally friendly forestry and FSC has received serious criticism from many environmental organizations, both in Sweden and internationally.  Several environmental organizations have left FSC in protest. &#34; [2]So practically, you have a situation where IKEA acts on some shady rules established by this FCS that are unreliable. Moreover, countries with corrupt officials will eventually end up in prison but too late, before the harm is done. Generally, if as a Romanian I go outside to protest against IKEA and corrupt politicians exploiting the Carpathians, I&#39;m told that I don&#39;t respect private property and that IKEA acts according to the laws of that country (created by corrupt policians with shady lobbies), in the end IKEA becomes the victim.[1] https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/ikea-buys-83000-acre-fore...

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a fantastic article, it does miss one very key point about bog-standard HTML which is worth mentioning though.The standard widgets are all accessible, people with screen readers, limited mobility, poor vision, etc, all rely on pages being written so the devices they use to read the web can function properly. People who choose to eschew these standard components very frequently end up with a site which is unusable for disabled people.Very few people have the skill to turn a div into an effective button, yet over and over I see web sites with rows of buttons which are in fact just divs with javascript behind them.Making your site accessible isn&#39;t just a good practice, in the US, it is the law. Courts have ruled that the ADA applies to web sites along with any other type of business. A small sample of sites where people thought they could smash together super-fancy sites without concern for basic needs of users: https://www.atilus.com/top-10-ada-lawsuits/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am not a front-end developer but looking at it from a distance I really don&#39;t get modern web design. Sure some sites might need fancy javascript single page features, like if your webpage is an interactive map or realtime game, but most sites are just text and some pictures. Whats with all the javascript? Your site looks just like the next one anyway! It feels like an &#34;Emperor&#39;s New Clothes&#34; situation or maybe more likely I just don&#39;t understand the allure as an clueless user.. I am almost tempted to make a webpage to see what the big fuss is about!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Made me think of a time I didnt do adequate research before buying an expensive flight ticket: I was in Changi Airport and had a cheap return ticket to Malaysia, when I got back I was going to travel in the east coast of Australia for a few weeks as the end of my study abroad in Asia.
It dawned to me that I never actually checked the Visa rules for Australia, but just pressumed that they would be like any othet commonweath country I had previously visited. Turned out I was lucky and didnt need a paper visa, but could do with an e-visa. 
As my HTC Desire Android phone had died in the humiddity, I only had the cheapest nokia I could find, X-1 ... Armed with a 2011 public internet kiosk of internet explorer, I tabulated through the australian immigration forms and found the correct form, filled it out while my browsing session of the kiosk expired, after a few tries, I knew exactly the way around the static site, and was what some would call &#34;speedrunning&#34; through their website. After sumbitting I just had to hope for the best. If that site had been required any more than it did, I am not sure I would have been able to submit my application through that public internet browser."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In graduate school, in my lab there was a grad student who was kind of an unlikely &#34;professor&#39;s pet&#34;.  He was tall and had surfer&#39;s long hair with a bit of a hippie aesthetic.  Anyways, he was also really completely clueless about how to do science correctly, but also, I guess, really good about playing politics (there was a time when he asked me to put some bacterial plasmid DNA on my mammalian cells.  I told him &#34;it doesn&#39;t work that way&#34;, but I did it anyways and handed over the cells, and he got the observation he was expecting).  On his main project he was teamed up with a super sketchy foreign postdoc that I was convinced would say anything to get high profile papers out.So they did a series of experiments and reported results that screamed &#34;artefact&#34;.  On one of them, for example, the postdoc got trained to use the electron microscope and they went through thousands and thousands of images to pick out the one that had &#34;just the right morphology&#34; (I am pretty sure they were snapping photos of salt crystals).  On another, they reported that their research subject protein was so fast at the process we were studying that everything occurred IN MIXING TIME.  That to me, screams &#34;you are not doing your experiments carefully&#34;.Meanwhile I was sweating balls working on a very careful preparation of similarly finicky proteins (you agitate them and they do bad things since they&#39;re metastable) and finally got it to produce reproducible results.  I suggested they adapt my preparation to their protein but they couldn&#39;t give a damn, they had already published their paper and had moved on to sexier proteins.But then an intern was put on the project, and she could not reproduce their results, after working on it for six months (she is careful and honest).  At the end, I felt so bad for her, I offered to train her on my technique, but she passed.  I think she was burned out on the project.  I asked if I could get a sample of the protein that she had prepped, and she agreed.I ran the protein through my preparatory technique and observed that there was a contamination that could have seeded the kinetics of their process.  Upon isolating an uncontaminated sample, I carefully but briskly rushed the sample over to the machine.  Nothing.  Curious, I jacked the temperature up to get it going faster.  Nothing.  I left it in the machine overnight.  Nothing.  Finally, convinced that I had likely done something wrong, I dropped the sample in a shaker at temperature, came back the next day and recorded amazingly high signal.  In short, the observation that it was &#34;super fast&#34; was entirely an artefact.As I, too, was trained on the Electron Microscope, I quickly spotted my sample onto an EM disc, reserved some time and hopped on the &#39;scope.  The first grid sector I looked at, there was literally TEXTBOOK morphology in front of my eyes.I stapled together my results, gave it to the grad student, and told him that the general gist of his paper was probably still correct, but that he should be careful about characterizing his protein as exceptional.  I then said it was in his hands to do the right thing.What do you think he did?  Nothing, of course.  He kept on the talks circuit, still talking about how exceptional his discovery was, and to date there have been no retractions.  He even won the NIH grad student of the year award.The epilog is that after a decade of floundering I realized that even though I am pretty good at science, I was no good at playing academic politics and quit the pursuit; I drove for lyft/uber for a bit, and now I&#39;m a backend dev.  I am certain that my experiences are not unique.  Amazingly the intern returned to our lab, and had her own three-year stint chasing ghosts that turned out to be overoptimistic interpretation of results reported by a postdoc.Oh.  What happened to the grad student?  He&#39;s a professor in the genomics department at UW."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It does feel like a watershed moment regarding hedge funds. This is the first time netizens capitalize on hedge fund short favorites and it has been surprisingly easy to cause an absolute catastrophy in the order of billion losses for them. I heard Melvin Capital may even have gone bankrupt?And how to do it? You get people to invest in a stock that is expected by the industry to go belly up. Seriously. It&#39;s that easy. It&#39;s not illegal. It&#39;s so easy that even semiprofessionals can understand exactly which stock are hedge fund favorites. It&#39;s not hard information to come by. And, here&#39;s the kicker: There is a potential monetary reward if you enter and exit a stock at the right moment.So it&#39;s simple to discover and execute, and there is a financial incentive, and it&#39;s not against the law. This is a trifecta of properties that makes this very interesting to follow indeed.I just saw this article too: As hedge funds try to cover losses, the rings are now spreading over the market: https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-01-26/hedge-fun...The author speculates that this might even ultimately trigger a market correction."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was addicted to Twitter in high school. I spent hours on it at night, getting no sleep. I spent so much time and mental bandwidth thinking of funny things to say or memes to make to get more likes. I was addicted to the likes and keeping up with everyone I knew.First semester of college, I stopped using Twitter. My sleep got better, I had more free time, and I was noticeably happier and freer. I no longer spent time in that dopamine cycle.I&#39;ve been weening off of Reddit and HN the past few months as well. YouTube is my next beast to conquer, and that might be the biggest one for me right now. I&#39;m trying to adapt to longer form content again, instead of only watching videos under a minute or reading 280 character tweets. I want to have an attention span again, I really do.Is social media an inherently evil thing? I don&#39;t think so, but I don&#39;t think I should use it. I also think that it can be toxic for teenagers in general. There are a variety of reasons, but the one that applied to me was the dopamine cycle caused by &#34;likes&#34;."</p>

I suppose the problem is, most communities are completely addicted to this stuff, so we&#39;re left in a situation where it&#39;s hard for most people to unplug for any long period of time without isolating themselves."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Aside: I&#39;ve heard about web platform tests, but I never realized that it could be a viable alternative to MDN for representing browser compatibility information. In this case they have a pretty good collection of tests [1] that give you a picture of overall WebRTC compatibility. Of course MDN is still the gold standard and we on web.dev will always link there as our default choice when they do a good job representing browser compatibility data, but in this case they don&#39;t seem to have a good table representing the state of WebRTC at large [2] (happy to update the article if it&#39;s just an oversight on my part and they do have a good browser compat table somewhere that I missed). Specifically, it seems like the WebRTC API page [3] should have a list of the browser compatibility of each of the interfaces that are mentioned on the page.[1] https://wpt.fyi/results/webrtc?label=experimental&amp;label=mast...[2] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API[3] https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_APIDisclosure: I edited the web.dev announcement"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if you don’t find the tool useful, the implementation under the hood is very clever. The dependency graph between the jobs is stored as a bunch of live processes flock()ing on each other’s log files. Once the files are unlocked, the process execs the requested job. This makes the scheduling and error handling code much simpler. Also, right now the dependency graph is dense (a job depends on all previous jobs) but it would be straightforward to thin it out to allow parallel jobs.Overall, a clever trick I intend to steal."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the opinion of a last semester CS student who has never written an application from scratch that needed more than a SQLite DB (so take me with a half grain of salt), it seems like premature optimization, while always talked about, is very common. I see people talking about using Kubernetes for internal applications and I just can&#39;t figure out why. If it&#39;s a hobby project and you want to learn Kubernetes, that&#39;s a different situation, but in the case of making a real application that people will use, it seems like a lot of us can get away with a single DB, a few workers of our app, and maybe a cache.I&#39;m speaking out of little experience though. I just think that a lot of us can get away with traditional vertical scaling and not think too much about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The assertion that PostgreSQL can handle dozens of TB of data needs to be qualified, as this is definitely not the case in some surprising and unexpected cases that are rarely talked about.PostgreSQL&#39;s statistics collection, which is used by the query planner, doesn&#39;t scale with storage size. For some ordinary data distributions at scale, the statistical model won&#39;t reflect any kind of reality and therefore can produce pathological query plans. It is quite difficult to get around this scaling behavior. Consequently, I&#39;ve moved away from using PostgreSQL for data models with distributions such that these query planner limitations will occur. These pathologies occur well before the &#34;dozens of TB&#34; range.The statistics collector is not a scalable design generally, but that is another matter. In its current state it does not degrade gracefully with scale."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The difficulty with this advice is that it assumes that you have many small transactions.Yes, of course, you should try to build your application so queries and transactions are very short. That solves a great many problems.But sometimes you can&#39;t. Sometimes you just have to do joins across large tables. There just isn&#39;t any other way. Your query is going to run for 5, 10, maybe 30 seconds. That&#39;s a huge burden on your server, and it will slow down the other tenants. In that case, the only answer is to distribute the queries across other boxes.I agree with the advice in general -- delay moving to a distributed system as long as possible -- but sometimes you just can&#39;t."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I appreciate the author&#39;s framing of &#34;transaction costs.&#34;  These costs are often hidden.It seems that as systems scale (in size) they tend to become inherently lower-trust. Consider a physician who makes house calls (not uncommon as recently as a few generations ago, and certainly not incompatible with modern medicine) and a large medical system such as Kaiser Permanente or NHS.The economic benefits of the larger-scale system are obvious, and are directly measured, but the economic detriment due to increased transaction costs (derived from decreased trust) are neither obvious nor readily measurable.Upsides of systems at scale can still outweigh downsides, and often do, but I suspect many industrial systems have a maximum scale above which efficiency gains lose out to, in this author&#39;s framing, transaction costs.This abuts certain natural &#34;borders&#34; for system growth, such as national (or in the case of EU, common market) boundaries."</p>

Not only is it an unpleasant environment to work in, but it feels predictive of failure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve spent a lot of years overseas, in third-world or developing countries, often torn by tribal or civil war, or other natural and man-made disasters. I have come to realize how foundational trust is in a functioning economy and self-governing society.  We in G8 nations often don&#39;t see it, like fish not thinking about water.  I&#39;ve been extremely concerned with the efforts of sub-groups in our societies  attacking the foundations of trust.  It&#39;s like watching people, on a boat at sea, tear up the hull for firewood...  The irony is that the basic nature of people (the world over) really hasn&#39;t changed: people are msotly good and want to live in a healthy community.  But culture, context, and experience can overrule those tendencies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; The cost, however, is steep — the list, or wholesale, price is $3,960 a month, or more than $47,500 a year. The list price for the one-time initiation dose is $5,490.Median income in the US is ~$31K apparently. So even in a rich country, this is like 50% more than the income of a typical person.My understanding is the funding for the trials was partly from NIAID. This seems like yet another case where public funds are used for research, but a company ends up with the ability to dictate pricing.I&#39;m glad that this works and that there is another, more convenient and effective treatment option. But shouldn&#39;t we have some setup where if tax dollars pay for the research, the government should own a share of the IP commensurate with their funding level, and should then be able to have some say in pricing?Or, if you think that the government itself shouldn&#39;t own IP for a product on the market, can we create an independent non-profit which receives ownership, and whose charter aligns with actually treating as many people as possible?I&#39;m not saying that when real, innovative work happens, pharmaceutical companies shouldn&#39;t get some meaningful return on the money they put in. But when the public supports the work, we shouldn&#39;t get nothing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have always heard that Truvada (prep) was extremely effective at preventing HIV infection. These new injectables are reported by the article to be 89% and 66% more effective at preventing transmission.What is this based on? Was I misinformed about Truvada&#39;s effectiveness? Is this a decrease in an already very low chance of transmission? Or is this in comparison to people forgetting to take their daily pills vs a shot that a health care provider had record of administering?It&#39;s currently common in the gay community for sexually active, healthy people to take Truvada proactively to protect against HIV because it&#39;s understood to be even more effective than condoms. If there is a better option or if the current option is not as effective as widely believed then standard of care should change."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who is in this high-risk community: good news.(Well, except for that price tag.)People, to a first approximation, are just terrible at pill compliance. Doesn’t matter the demographics, people just aren’t perfect at taking a pill, every day, at the same time, forever and ever. Having that injection where you can set it and forget it? Nice advance. Not game-changing, but still a nice move forward.And I think it’ll be a bigger move forward for people who are at high risk of HIV, but also have not great access to medical care where they live. If you…oh boy, here I go, potentially getting into trouble. Non-white and/or non-affluent communities tend to come down much harder on homosexuality. It is much more discreet to get a periodic shot than heading to Walgreen’s and bringing home a bottle full of blue pills. It’s safer. It’s a bit more private."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This brings back the memories. Another true story to add to this one. I (like many Sun cohorts) loved the burritos at La Costeña market, and we had adopted the FAX trick from Adobe.Then along came the &#34;Distributed Objects Everywhere&#34; project (which invented CORBA) and they wanted an example application so they created &#34;BurritoTool&#34; which used CORBA to find the server that was connected to the fax line, and a nice WYSIWYG window to select your burrito condiments. Everyone loved it, it was a great tool and we all used it.Then one day we show up and they tell us they have turned off their fax machine. We asked why, and they show us faxes for burrito orders that started coming in at 6AM and went non-stop until they turned it off. Some seemed legit but many were clearly not from someone who knew the place.We go back to the office and do some snooping and see a bunch of requests to the burrito server in the wee hours before anyone is at work. We trace the IP address to a hotel in New York city. We call the Hotel and as it turns out Sun Sales is hosting an event and one of the things they are showing off at the &#34;pavilion&#34; is our cool distributed object technology. And using Burritotool! But CORBA has done its job and when it hadn&#39;t been told there was a local burrito server it sent packets back to HQ and found the one in the systems group lab. Starting at 9AM eastern and going all morning long, people had been making random burrito orders as part of the demo code!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related: Sun had a demo for NeWS (fancy desktop display system) called PizzaTool.  Don Hopkins did a writeup: https://medium.com/@donhopkins/the-story-of-sun-microsystems...(One question: that writeup says Solaris 2, but I think I might&#39;ve used PizzaTool under OpenWindows 2.0 on SunOS 4.1.1 on sun4c.)Inspired by PizzaTool at the time, but my employer having a gazillion dollars of workstations and servers, yet none with a fax card (and my group having daily ad hoc lunch outings), I wrote LunchTool for the Suns.  It was a GUI with a database of local lunch places, which someone could choose to decide on a lunch location and time and such, then print a fancy announcement sign to hang where everyone would see it.  (Not everyone checked email, and I liked typesetting and programming PostScript anyway.)  I was most proud of the bitmap burger icon.When Google first solicited third-party apps for Android (it might&#39;ve been a contest?), I almost stole the idea of PizzaTool, since it still seemed like a fun idea, as a gimmick or experience.  Not that one really needed to see composited pineapple bits, to know whether they wanted it on their real-world pizza, but I thought the visual made adding toppings fun, and not a bad early demo for Android."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"compare this nearly 30 year old script with the absolute red hot hell of trying to order anything at all through toast,caviar,grub hub,uber eats or postmates and you&#39;ll want to check out the latest RCS and build it on X86 before the end of the day.im serious.  compared to the relatively clean, coherent and transparent burrito script, the dumpster fire that constitutes modern online ordering is an unforgiveable travesty.again this is not delivery...no gig shit this is just simple pickup n go we&#39;re trying to do here but at the end of the byzantine transaction you make on a vendors website you&#39;ve opted into a dozen mailing lists and you&#39;re getting menus and direct mailers from any and every local and non-local restaurant and bar...complete with mailers from the goddamn platform itself shilling you to either get in your car and play delivery drone or sign up for endless datamining.and hell, you might not even be ordering from the restaurant itself.  most of these platforms set up the virtual equivalent of a pop up tent in front of the business.  If nothing else, this script has pushed me to reconsider email-to-fax orders to the handful of small local restaurants in the neighborhood."</p>

So I had to educate my customer employees how to log in to Play Store and install my app. The additional benefit was that people had security updates of Chrome and other apps.Two months ago my app was suspended after I made all necessary changes to support Android 10. The Gbot claims that background location updates aren&#39;t essential for my app. As you may guess I wrote appeal without success.

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25899286">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some context: A few years ago, there was a paper from Google (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3183713.3196909) that made learned data structures popular for a while. They started from the idea that indexes such as B-trees approximate an increasing function with one-sided error. By using that perspective and allowing two-sided error, they were able to make the index very small (and consequently quite fast).Many data structure researchers got interested in the idea and developed a number of improvements. The PGM-index is one of those. Its main idea is to use piecewise linear approximations (that can be built in a single quick pass over the data) instead of the machine learning black box the Google paper was using."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a major practical advance from the succinct data structure community.This community has produced so many brilliant results in the past years. But, they work in the shadows. Since the rise of interest in neural network methods, I&#39;ve often described their work as &#34;machine learning where epsilon goes to 0.&#34; It&#39;s not sexy, but it is extremely useful.For instance, Ferragina previously helped to develop the FM-index that enabled the sequence alignment algorithms used for the primary analysis of short genomic reads (100-250bp). These tools were simply transformative, because they reduced the amount of memory required to write genome mappers by orders of magnitude, allowing the construction of full-text indexes of the genome on what was then (~2009) commodity hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get it. I&#39;ve implemented B-trees. The majority of space the used by a B-tree is the data itself. Each N-ary leaf of the tree is a basically a vector of data with maybe some bookkeeping at the ends. The leaves are more than half of the tree.Sure, you can compress the data. But that depends on the data, completely random data can&#39;t be compress. Other data can be. But a point blank 83x space claim seems bizarre - or it&#39;s comparing to a very inefficient implementation of a B-tree.Edit: It seems the 83x claim is a product of the HN submission. I could not find it on the page. But even the page should say something like &#34;a compressed index that allows full speed look-up&#34; (akin to succinct data structures) and then it would make sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ask yourself, how much brighter is it outside than inside (assuming a sunny day vs a brightly lit office)?Before looking into this, I would have guessed 2X or 3X, but would you believe it&#39;s actually over 100X!I bet most people&#39;s guess would also be off by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.Even outdoors in the shade, it is over 50X brighter than indoors.(For specific numbers and comparisons, see: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6656201/ )Apparently, our eyes adjust so quickly to the difference that we have a very poor sense of the magnitude of light change between indoors and outdoors.I bring this up because one of the largest factors in myopia development appears to be outdoor light exposure in childhood.Genetics are likely a factor too, but light exposure seems to have a huge effect: 
&#34;The prevalence of myopia in 6- and 7-year-old children of Chinese ethnicity was significantly lower in Sydney (3.3%) than in Singapore (29.1%), while patterns of daily outdoor light exposure showed that children living in Singapore were exposed to significantly less daily outdoor light than Australian children.&#34; (from the same study linked above)The obvious takeaway for parents, schools, and governments: ensure your children have plenty of outdoor playtime. It will greatly reduce instances of myopia (not to mention the benefits from higher Vitamin D levels, exercise, etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Off on a complete tangent here, only remotely related.Yo, fellow four-eyed geeks.I noticed that when lying down and looking up in a room with a light source, with my glasses on, if there is a small droplet of water on the lens (say, due to having just cleaned the glasses and not wicked up every last drop), this droplet can bend the light in such a way that when it subsequently hits the cornea and pupa, a perfectly straight, parallel beam of light passes through the vitreous humor right to the retina.The consequence of this is that all the junk floating in your eye is rendered in &#34;4K clarity&#34; in a circle of light, regardless of whether it is next to the retina, or floating somewhere in the middle.Imperfections in your cornea or elsewhere are also rendered, making themselves evident."</p>

If this works, it&#39;s fascinating!One thing I have been wondering for a while, and I thought this what it was when I read the title, is, why can&#39;t we have zoom lenses with a camera turned inword to the retina applying autofocus algorithms? As I age, I need a different prescription for every 20 cm I push my laptop back, something like this would be very useful.Anybody knows what happened to this project https://www.core77.com/posts/12220/brilliant-water-based-eye... ?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ken White has been talking about the potential for this suit for a couple weeks now. He spends a lot of time talking about what isn&#39;t defamation --- people use defamation suits and threats thereof to chill free speech, and he&#39;s a 1st Amendment guy --- but the Dominion cases are apparently examples of very serious defamation cases.The core of defamation is (1) a false statement of purported fact that (2) causes damage (there are some exceptions to (2) that aren&#39;t relevant here). Most defamation cases you hear about fall apart on (1) - they target non-falsifiable statements of opinion, which can&#39;t be defamation because they don&#39;t purport to relate an objective fact. What makes Dominion&#39;s cases terrifying is that they are chock full of purported facts, all of which are batshit, and have so devastated Dominion&#39;s reputation, in a reputation-intensive business, that it had to hire private security to protect its employees from death threats.What makes the case challenging for Dominion is that they will almost certainly be treated as a public figure for the purposes of the case. The standard for defamation of a public figure is higher than that of a normal person; we add a condition (3): actual malice or negligence, meaning Dominion must show that Giuliani either intended to destroy Dominion&#39;s reputation by spreading facts he knew to be false, or that he was at least negligent, acting with reckless disregard for the truth.The problem is that it&#39;s not totally clear whether Giuliani believed any of his crazy-talk. It may actually be the case that Giuliani is just off his rocker. If he himself was sold by the (false) facts he received from others, he is a more difficult defamation target.Here&#39;s attorney Akiva Cohen analyzing the case a bit:https://twitter.com/AkivaMCohen/status/1353700596407283721"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a superb set of resources for anyone interested in the history of computing in the 80s and 90s. I&#39;d go so far as to say it&#39;s great even if you don&#39;t intend to watch the show (although you should!). I wish this had existed back when I was teaching history of technology.One of the best decisions the show made was to set the series at a series of fictitious minor companies and startups struggling down there in the trenches of the computer revolution without ever quite making it big. This avoids the trap of teleology and gives you a sense of how things could easily have turned out differently. It is why the show is so much better as both computing history and drama than all those films about Apple or Steve Jobs and the rest that tediously rehash the same stories of the winners. (Although one of the main characters, Joe Macmillan, has some Jobs-like character features. I do not mean this as a compliment.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve probably said this before, but I was a computer engineer in Texas in the 80s and this show captures that culture perfectly.* I first learned &#34;Halt and Catch Fire&#34; as an obscure illegal instruction on the 6800 processor that would lock it up. When I heard about this show my first reaction was &#34;How dare they title a show with a meme from an obscure part of my hindbrain! Guess I can&#39;t use that for a password any more.&#34;*Well almost perfectly. I don&#39;t remember many engineers or coders being as attractive as the actors on this show."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The strange thing is that the “instruction” Halt and Catch Fire originated in a joke System/360 “green card” (reference summary) from the 1960s, along with Rewind and Break Tape, Execute (or Punch) Operator, and many others I&#39;ve long since forgotten. Reference is sometimes made to an undocumented Motorola 6800 instruction, but the term is from the Big Iron era, and has nothing to do with personal computing. It&#39;s really from the &#34;Blinkenlichts&#34; era, when people commonly put up cartoons in the machine room showing a floating-point adder as a snake in a birdbath.By the way, Big Iron&#39;s abilities in the physical world were real. I occasionally operated a System/360 with 4 2311 disk drives, 7.5MB monsters with the form factor of washing machines. When running the IBM sort program, these clunkers were apt to move around the machine room."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#39;Global sales&#39; I hope everyone understands in China it is very hard to get a licence plate, the government allows you to get a licence plate if you buy a heavily subsidised electric car. The aim is to stimulate demand to develop an industry. Large cities also banned motorbikes and scooters, with the same aim.This is no way market driven demand, BYD is a very interesting company to look into. It is my understanding that Warren buffet has a large share in this company.My believe is China sees oil dependence as a long term strategic weakness. In the event of a navel blockade it will be much harder for them to get the oil they need to run the economy. If a large part of the consumer sector is driven by electric powered by local sources (coal, hydro, nuclear) they can keep the logistic channels open. As a side benefit they get to fund a sector hoping to have the same success as they did with solar panels.The article might have pointed this out but it was paid past a certain point on my device."</p>

Not 10.2.  Not 10.2.2.This is a very conservative hunk of software because this is not a &#34;move fast and break things&#34; industry.  This is a &#34;people die when we screw up&#34; industry.  So they haven&#39;t moved from ArcGIS 10.2.1 for our version.  Change is coming but they have to be careful.So ArcGIS 10.2.1 comes with a python install of 2.7.2 (I am pretty sure it is .2).  And you are very strongly advised NOT TO UPGRADE THAT in big bold letters on the relevant help pages.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been 100% remote and run remote teams since 2014 and I promise that it won&#39;t stick for the broader society. Here&#39;s why:1. Socializing is the primary activity that happens at work for the vast majority of workers. The gal or guy coming by your desk to &#34;check in&#34; or &#34;see how your weekend was&#34; etc... is literally where they find their social outlets and personal connections.2. Managers like to be able to watch their direct reports because it makes them feel more in control than they are3. The commuting routine, even if it&#39;s a nightmare, offers a sense of normalcy that most people have gotten used to and in a weird way rely on for grounding.4. For a huge swath of Americans at least, work is an escape from the drudgery of the home.To truly work from home 100% of the time you have to be a master at controlling yourself and your ability to be distracted. Most people don&#39;t have this control and need a framework to insert themselves into. Add to that the contextual dimension of an &#34;other&#34; place that is a world apart from your home life and you have something that allows for a depressurization for most people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a little disappointed at the percentage of comments which extrapolate personal anecdotes into societal behavior, and without addressing the data in this study - even to poke holes in the methodology, which is totally fair game (though IMO quite good, especially for what they had to work with).The whole point of a 15,000-person survey like this is so that we&#39;re not all stuck guessing based on our own experiences. Obviously one can argue that what employers were telling employees they would do post-COVID as of October 2020 is not what employers will actually do (and give reasons why!), but it&#39;s still likely to be more accurate than any individual&#39;s speculation (including mine!).In particular, the survey addressed 2 topics that a lot of comments seem to not incorporate:1. At population, employer, and individual level, it&#39;s not either/or. The paper title doesn&#39;t do a good job of conveying this. All 3 entities seem open to everything on the continuum, based on their employees, work type, and so on.Statements like &#34;I promise that it won&#39;t stick for the broader society&#34; imply a more binary outcome than the survey results predict (and maybe than anything predicts). The survey concludes that, of the roughly 50% of employees who can work from home, they&#39;ll average 2 days per week (or 23% of total hours worked). IOW, WFH doesn&#39;t need to move everyone all the time in order to have massive effects. Some people changing some of the time is enough.2. Employer plans vs. employee desires. Lots of commenters state their preferences and then try to generalize from that, but.. the survey captured that too. To just skim those results, scroll to page 60 for employee-desired vs. employer-planned % of working days. Gist: if WFH is roughly the same productivity, employers plan ~22% of days and employees desire ~45% of days to be WFH. In all productivity cases, employees preferred a higher % of days to be WFH than employers.Page 43 shows answers to the pay raise or cut employees would take in order to work from home 2-3 days per week.It also breaks down the change in perception about WFH by demographic cohort on page 55. For example, those with no children and those with children at home both had significant improvements in their perception of WFH. Those with children had more improvement in perception than those without children. As the study wrote: &#34;This 23 percent figure [post-COVID WFH as a % of full time days] is almost five times larger than in the pre-pandemic time use data, but still half as large as what workers want in a post-pandemic world.&#34;Of course, there&#39;s a place for speculation and anecdotes. This paper - and hopefully soon, more studies like it - should let us evolve from speculating based on only our personal experience to thinking about its methodology and results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is ironic coming from Stanford, who is currently fucking up every single aspect of their handling of covid, as many Stanford students will attest to. Colleges are basically scammers at this point. The whole benefit of going to college is being able to meet like-minded smart, young people like yourself. Remote college isn&#39;t a thing and never will be. College is about people, as much as it is about learning. The unfortunate K-12 and college students are learning this the hard way.Personally, I don&#39;t think that remote is here to stay. I think working will be augmented by remote tools, but it cannot be replaced by remote. Humans just aren&#39;t robots and they need community, and work is the biggest source of community after college. To me, online college is a complete joke and is not what students after high school need. It&#39;s just not healthy.  Humans need interaction in person, and they do their best work when they are working with people who they see on a weekly basis, especially young 20-somethings.This whole thing is becoming evident as people are starting to really just not care for the lockdowns at this point. Parks in SF are a complete shitshow because people want to be out and about. You will never be able to force them to be purely remote, and after covid, if your company is purely remote, you will not attract the best young talent, period. You might attract older folks, but you know you want young talent.This whole thing makes no sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something particularly concerning about this incident is buried further down in the article.Under the heading &#34;Why Facebook Doesn&#39;t Ban Everyone&#34;, Lincoln explains how social network theory can identify individuals in networks that are influential. This isn&#39;t an exaggeration - basic graph heuristics (such as comparing in/out degree of an individual relative to other parts of the social graph) can easily identify such individuals. Censoring those individuals can have an amplified effect on the graph structure as a whole.For an example of how just a few individuals can make a big difference on graph structure, check out Watts &amp; Strogatz&#39;s 1998 paper, Collective dynamics of &#39;small-world&#39; networks [0][1]. I&#39;d highly recommend reading it - it&#39;s very short and easy to understand.Essentially, a small number of connectors connecting with random individuals can seriously reduce the average number of steps to connect any two individuals. If Facebook wanted to stop the spread of a narrative that they didn&#39;t like, censoring just these few individuals would make it much harder for information to flow through the graph as a whole, and hardly anyone would notice (since Facebook&#39;s only censoring a few people.)Scary.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts–Strogatz_model[1]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9623998/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think FB has a fundamental issue here, which is that:1) they don&#39;t feel they can NOT police content2) they are wayyyyy too big to police content manually3) any AI they train to police content, is not going to be able to state clearly why a given post/account was banned, and anyway...4) if you state objective, clear rules that are automated, it will be pretty easy to game them (e.g. using euphemisms or code words for objectionable content)I don&#39;t see how FB can get out of this situation.  Any social network that is as large as it is, which relies on advertising (and thus cannot be as content-neutral as e.g. phone companies are regarding what you talk about on the phone), is going to face the same situation.Of course, if FB ends up getting way smaller as a result, that would be fine by me.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Stress resilience is one of the most important things when it comes to knowledge work, also one of the most neglected aspect. Mindfulness, stoicism, exercise help, but nothing helps as much as a good night sleep. Also the other thing people usually fail to note is the vicious stress-sleep cycle (lack of sleep induced stress &lt;-&gt; stress induced lack of sleep). It took me years to realize that so much of my problems with bedtime revenge, burnout, non-clinical depression, permastress was basically just lack of quality sleep. FWIW, it helps to think of productivity in terms of sleep and stress when you are working in the knowledge economy. Just like sleep debt, you can also accumulate productivity debt due to lack of stress resilience, lack of sleep, which can eventually lead to things like burnout."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had great success picking up a consistent meditation habit with the greasing the groove-approach[1].. in essence, every time I would feel a bit foggy in the head, I would take a 3-15 minute meditation session. It usually results to 3-5 sessions per day. It&#39;s such a great mental reset, and I haven&#39;t since experienced the kind of complete depletion that you get from pushing yourself hard through the day.I bet some Zen master would reprimand me for this being the wrong approach, but I found it quite difficult to get into the habit of doing, say, a single 30-60 minute session per day. Now I can consistently drop into the meditation session with no urge for procrastination and have also successfully experimented with longer ones.[1] refers to the method of increasing your pull-up capability by installing a pull-up bar in your office / bedroom doorway and doing a set every time you pass through the doorway"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many of us are wearing devices with continuous optical heart rate monitors. Heart rate variability at rest is one of the best indicators of stress and these devices are pretty good at estimating sleep duration and sleep cycles.Regulators need to recognize that continuous tracking devices are a new tool for establishing a health baseline and they should not be expected to match the performance of single-test medical devices. Apple, Garmin, and Fitbit need to build standards to share this baseline data with medical professionals and offer analytics to determine when changes occur.Questionnaire based medicine seems backwards given the digital tools available."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"WhatsApp worldwide usage is estimated to be more than 2B+ users. Even if this article is accurate, it doesn’t really mean much. In the HN bubble lots of people have migrated to Signal with all of their contacts but outside of that bubble nothing much seems to be happening. Note that I’m not agreeing with these changes, I’m just observing reality.To put things into perspective, let’s assume that 25M users (as stated in the article) actually moved to Telegram - which I use and like by the way. Let’s assume they fully moved and stopped using WhatsApp (very unlikely). That means less than 1.25% users moved to another platform - and this means assuming many things that aren’t probably real.It reminds me a bit of the articles about DuckDuckGo vs Google where many people think big changes in usage are happening while ignoring that the average Joe will keep using whatever it’s using unless there’s way too much trouble to continue using it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand why FB needs to do this, but the execution was so out of touch it&#39;s bizarre. My elderly parents called me and were alarmed that WhatsApp is threatening with removing their account unless they agree to share their data. They wondered if FB will be able to track their transactions or perhaps even get into their bank accounts. After years in the tech industry, I&#39;ve learned that my parents&#39; feedback is a good predictor for how well my messaging will be perceived by the wider world. I would have assumed that at FB they would do something similar (or rather, that their testing is 100x more sophisticated), so it&#39;s bizarre that they would miss the mark with messaging and with their prediction of overall success when it came to something so strategically important and sensitive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not even a visible dent.Here, in India if you mention SMS you get weird looks even from people who crossed their youth using SMS. Communication is WhatsApp here.My physiotherapist, my doctor&#39;s nurse (who handles my appointment) they all function on WhatsApp, and no, they are even going to try Signal. Grocers, delivery people — it goes on. My bank and credit card relationship managers communicate with me on WhatsApp. They are never &#34;migrating to&#34; Signal.I am the only one among my contacts who will be moving away from WhatsApp — everyone else (among my people who are using Signal sparsely or actively as of now) have WhatsApp installed and will keep it.Most of my recent Signal convert contacts have already started replying on Signal after hours or days, some have uninstalled. Most of those people will soon uninstall it is what I expect. Unless Signal brings social features that makes these people experience FOMO of broadcasting their lives on one more network :)Penetration of Signal in real world is way too different from what it &#34;feels&#34; here on HN."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For any non-Brits, the SWP is the main left of Labour party in Britain. As a student in the 80s I remember them as an earnest, way too serious bunch of ideological zombies ranting into microphones at the Student&#39;s Union about the latest crimes against humanity perpetrated by &#39;Thatcher&#39;. They&#39;re the kind of people that come up to you in the street with leaflets about some atrocity in Africa and shout &#34;Would you murder children&#34; at you. I&#39;m not entirely sure they&#39;d recognise what an actual &#39;Worker&#39; was if they met one. I always found them quite comical.However they are a serious party, they&#39;re a highly motivated  and active movement with significant influence in the Labour Party grass roots. They&#39;re sort of our equivalent of Antifa in that they are a significant organising presence in lefty street protests, but much more politically active and spend a lot of time in conferences and action committees wondering what Capitalism ever did for us.Importantly, they are in no way shape or form a terrorist or criminal organisation. I would not be at all surprised if some ultra-violent or would-be Red Army Faction types joined or associated with them, but that&#39;s not at all who the SWP are as an organisation. They&#39;re the well meaning, impressionable white middle class girl next door with a class guilt complex and a side shave that&#39;s been going to BLM protests.If they are getting banned by Facebook something has gone horribly wrong. Quite possibly some of them got a bit excited and posted things they shouldn&#39;t, so I&#39;m not saying this is for sure Facebook&#39;s fault, but they&#39;re not about to murder any bobbies in Parliament Square."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How is this not foreign political interference?The UK media has been preaching to us about dangers of Russian election interference for years at this point, but simultaneously they seem completely unconcerned that a handful of wealthy Americans how the power to censor popular media outlets, entire political movements and political activists at a whim.The SWP is massive. I don&#39;t know for sure, but I suspect they had millions of followers on Facebook. This isn&#39;t some fringe, extremist group by any sane interpretation of those terms.It seems we&#39;re now quickly moving on from just censoring those with extremist political views to simply censoring anyone who who dares express a non-establishment political view online."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a positive thing for these ejections to be across the political spectrum, because it makes the demand for distributed moderation come from across the political spectrum.I hope that demand congeals on support for an open blogging protocol, such that people can very easily post once and direct it to multiple platforms or any listener. If this becomes popular enough, and posts aren&#39;t owned by a particular platform, the big platforms lose their power to control the conversation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will forever associate Larry King with the movie “Spin”. [1] It’s a rather brilliant indie documentary about the 1992 (Bill Clinton / HW Bush) election based on a fascinating technological element: back then, Satellite TV feeds would often just keep running during commercial breaks, or warmups.So the director recorded a TON of footage from these moments where the politicians and news anchors acted themselves, seemingly unaware that anyone was watching.The segments with Larry King are, um, memorable. Very candid moments.1: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(1995_film)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned English watching Larry King Live, because that was my father&#39;s favourite talkshow during the 90s.I didn&#39;t understand half of what was going on in those conversations, but what stuck with me was the broad spectrum of people he interviewed and how consistently respectful he was towards his interviewees."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always enjoyed his interviews and his style.  I happened to just watched a very short clip of him talking about his fear of death with Norm Macdonald last night.

My fantasy would be to have SpaceX move it into the Lunar L1 Lagrange point which would keep it in use but it would have to deal with more cosmic rays, also station keeping would be an issue unless we could really get energized tether station keeping to work (lots of solar energy to provide power, but not a lot of mass to provide thrust, so tethers are energized conductors that push against the Earth&#39;s magnetic field)Parking it in L4 or L5 could keep it for future generations but it would be even more of a challenge to go visit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think this guy would enjoy seeing some of the very low end of the used computer market in places like Pakistan - where they receive 20&#39; container loads full of 5 year old Dell, HP office PCs and mix/match pieces into fully working systems that people can enjoy for more years to come. There&#39;s a whole street with at least ten different retail vendors/repair shops in Rawalpindi."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty neat. Definitely recycles a lot of electronics in a good way. On the GPIO pins I would definitely replace the connector! I can tell you from experience that even if the pins straighten out, some random plugging/unplugging later and the pin will break off and the next person will end up replacing the connector. This is much easier if you have a setup already for doing the work.This is also a really great way to &#34;pay yourself&#34; to learn to do rework. Buying 200 at £61 and selling the fully restored ones (which appears to &gt; 100) at £9 is at least £900 revenue from the experience. Granted, since you are &#34;learning&#34; that would be slow work at first, but later it would become fairly routine. So something someone in high school could easily do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I’m doing it for the blog content and the experience and to hopefully provide you guys with some very cheap Raspberry Pi’s for your projects!One other thing here that makes me happy is that these repaired Pis will not end up in a landfill, which I bet would have otherwise been the end result.  Yes, there are electronics recycling services, but who knows if the original owner would have gone that route, and I imagine there still ends up being quite a bit of unrecycleable waste, not to mention the energy required to do the recycling itself.Meanwhile, I have a thermoelectric wine fridge that died recently.  Looks like it&#39;s the logic board, but the manufacturer doesn&#39;t make them anymore (couldn&#39;t find anything on ebay etc. either).  I feel really awful that I&#39;ll likely have to have to toss the thing due to what is probably a really cheap and easy-to-replace dead part.  (I need to take another look at it to see if there&#39;s something obvious like a blown capacitor that I can replace.)&gt; Instead I will be donating the proceeds of the sales to the Raspberry Pi Foundation and they can decide what to do with the Money!This is just really awesome.  Kudos to the author."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regarding performance, I wrote a bit about this a few months ago in a post comparing different workload isolation techniques:https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/Two useful links from my Pinboard research for that post:A person at Red Hat optimizing QEMU boot time:http://oirase.annexia.org/tmp/paper.pdfAn Intel deck talking about qemu-lite:http://events17.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slide...(The other thing to follow up on if you&#39;re interested in the background on this stuff is kvmtool).In both cases, a big part of the answer seems to be eliminating BIOS overhead; getting rid of oproms appears to have been the single biggest win for Intel. But the Red Hat article also finds lots of overhead in QEMU itself, and both pieces talk about kernel config issues (for instance, scrubbing the kernel you boot of subsystems that have expensive initcalls).By comparison: Firecracker is purpose-built in Rust for this one task, provides no BIOS, and offers only network, block, keyboard, and serial device support --- with tiny drivers (the serial support is less than 300 lines of code)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another incredible blog post from Julia Evans.Julia if you&#39;re reading, I&#39;m a big fan.  One request:  could you add the date/time to the post, preferably near the title?I do see a `&lt;time&gt;` tag in the HTML, but it doesn&#39;t render any human readable text.  The datetime is also part of the URL which is &#34;good enough,&#34; but it always takes me a minute to remember that and Ctrl+F won&#39;t find it.I&#39;m a little ADD about knowing when things were published, so far from an average person.  If you like it the way it is, then don&#39;t worry about me.  I just wanted to throw it out there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The blog post doesn&#39;t mention it but Firecracker was originally based on crosvm [0] built at Google by the ChromeOS team for a WSL-like Linux sandbox on top of ChromeOS running debian-buster containers viz. penguin (afaik) in a gentoo-based VM viz. termina [1]. crosvm inturn is part of a much bigger crostini project [2], which I find to be super fascinating, as it supports UI workloads (over Wayland and X).If you&#39;re using ChromeOS to run any Linux app, you&#39;re using crostini which launches those apps in crosvm managed sandboxes (Container inside a VM) in seconds. In not so distant future, it looks like Android will sandbox platform workloads (running outside the Android framework?) managed by crosvm, to considerably improve security [3].I looked for but couldn&#39;t find ChromeOS GCP instances. I mean, ChromeOS might be a great platform to run multi-tenant server workloads at this point.[0] https://archive.is/T1ZNJ[1] One can run custom Linux containers (other than the debian-based penguin) but not VMs (other than termina) at this point: https://chromeos.dev/en/linux/linux-on-chromeos-faq[2] https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/c...[3] https://lwn.net/Articles/836693/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Here&#39;s the denial of the TRO:https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qhXD-4Kaw5dCEBv0dUM8buygEKg...Parler hasn&#39;t lost the case, just a TRO that demands reinstatement on AWS, but the ruling on the TRO requires the judge to tip their hand about the case, and Parler is going to lose.I don&#39;t think you even need to read the AWS AUP to know that Parler has no real case here. To buy Parler&#39;s contract claim, you&#39;d have to believe that Amazon&#39;s lawyers are so stupid that they set out a TOS for the world&#39;s largest hosting provider that didn&#39;t give AWS the right to boot customers, which is something AWS --- really, every hosting provider --- has to do all the time. You almost have to not know anything about the hosting business to think there could be a case here.But if you need to read a judge laughing Parler&#39;s claims off, well, now you can. Real &#34;based&#34; energy in excerpting the AWS AUP in their complaint and clipping it right before the clause that gives AWS the right to terminate service without notice to customers who violate their AUP. The judge, uh, noticed.(As the judge points out, among the many problems with Parler&#39;s restraint of trade argument, there&#39;s the fact that AWS doesn&#39;t host Twitter&#39;s feed.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As much as I don&#39;t like Parler&#39;s digital death sentence from Silicon Valley, they should&#39;ve known this was coming and prepared. It doesn&#39;t take a genius to know that such a controversial website is going to get dropped, even if it&#39;s just because it makes the webhost look bad.Yes it&#39;s unfair that Twitter gets away with hosting way worse content, but life is unfair, that doesn&#39;t mean you stick your head in the sand and pretend the risk of de-platforming never existed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been trying to come to grips with the societal impact of echo chambers, &#34;hate&#34; speech, and the obligations vs. rights of sites and hosting providers.So far, my take is that websites have less obligation than hosting. It concerns me that AWS booted a site off their platform for speech issues - I am leaning more and more to the idea that colos, IaaS and ISPs should be considered common carriers, and that only a court order should get a site booted off the web entirely."</p>
