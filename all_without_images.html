								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is a massive YouTube and Instagram industry of outright faking craft and cooking tips. They&#39;re not just bad or a stretch, they&#39;re intentionally fabricated, made at scale by TheSoul Publishing with 550 employees. That&#39;s because making cool things looking surprisingly easy goes viral way better than actual reality-grounded instructions, and for the adtech giants nothing matters except the number of clicks.Before people realize that they can&#39;t really make a 3-layer cake in a toaster, the fakers already cash in on the views. Usually the risk of these faked craft hacks is just cut fingers and kitchen fires, but the &#34;just grab 2000V, it&#39;s so easy!&#34; videos take it to another level of lethality."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"YouTube&#39;s moderation is ridiculous, and it demonstrates the problem Google has in general. They don&#39;t like paying actual people to moderate their sites, and rely on automated systems and bots to do everything for them. So, if there&#39;s ever an issue (or you have a bunch of scammers mass reporting you because you debunk their &#39;work&#39;), then YouTube/Google seems to think you&#39;re the problem instead of the scumbags.We need things to change here. We need Google to moderate their services properly, and we need these scammers to get arrested/sued/whatever for misleading info, and putting people&#39;s lives at risk."</p>

It&#39;s a really big deal in the industry that the prices that insurance companies pay doctors are now being shared publicly. It will have all sorts of positive impacts over time, hopefully making rate negotiations more consistent and fair between different insurance plans. Right now, 10x differences in prices paid for the same healthcare service from the same doctor between insurance plans is not uncommon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work in healthcare.Here is an exchange I had with a major hospital about standard surgery (one of those deemed &#34;Shoppable services&#34;) earlier this year. This exchange was possible after I was able to get an email recipient, following a 30min conversation.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
Hello!I was told by the very helpful Ms. XXX, that you would be able to provide patient responsibility amount , related to CPT codes for XXX procedure.
I am attaching front and back of my insurance card (Payor). The member DOB is MM/DD/YYThe specific 2 codes in question are :
CPT 12345
CPT 01234Can you please provide the total cost and patient resp. for the CPTs above?___________________________________________________________Response:Good morning,&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The hospital does not process estimates for patients with insurance coverage. However, our web portal contains charges under the Hospital Price Transparency link. I have included the link in the subject line for easy access. [comment: This link was broken. After much browsing.. I was able to find an alternate route. The linked file turned out to be a JSON. I couldn&#39;t figure that one out] As far as out-pocket responsibility, your insurance company is the best source for that information; they will advise if you have any copay for the encounter._______Read the 1st sentence of the reply again.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My teenage son knocked on our bedroom door last night after we&#39;d all gone to bed. He was crying and told us his cousin had just texted him the news, and then he watched the video. We watched it again together. I cried and hugged him and we talked about it a little bit.My kids were so isolated during covid lockdown, we were getting really worried for their mental state. They weren&#39;t seeing other kids their age, they felt like they had no friends, and there was one point when it seemed like they even stopped missing other people altogether.But my son, especially, was deep into Minecraft Youtube at the time, and I could tell that this cast of creators was really important to him. It often felt like he was on a call with his fun and hilarious buddies, just on mute.I think Technoblade, and other creators like him, helped get my son through the past couple years. I&#39;m so grateful to him for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In his message, Techno, who reveals his name is actually Alex, talks about how the money from merch and other “sell-out” pushes over the last year is being used to send his siblings to college, if they want to go, along with thanking his viewers for giving him such happy moments—all while a slideshow of images showing him throughout various points of his treatment are shown on screen.&#34;What a beautiful legacy. Fuck cancer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My teenage daughter made an irregular visit to my study about an hour ago to let me know of this news.  I let her know that I didn&#39;t know this Technoblade, but this news seemed to hit my usually tough exterior daughter pretty hard, so he had some type of positive impact to my family.  It is a touching tribute video they released."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am just wondering how many people have to die before it finally dawns on on us that the current approach is idiotic.The supposed smart cars can&#39;t even talk to each-other directly &#39;without internet&#39; to warn of a car pileup! They can&#39;t report to city traffic control about their condition.We should be innovating in infrastructure instead - create standardised computer readable infrared road markings, equip each traffic light and each lamp post with a radio beacon, each crash barrier could have a radio marker, create PUBLIC maps of each city, have a central traffic control sypercomputer in each city provide directions to cars. Have each car painted with infrared markers so they recognise each-other. Provide cyclists with something these cars can recognise.We could even make radar-reflective pants so that autonomous cars see them better.the whoe traffic system needs to be looked at and brought to a new set of standards, whatever they may be. I am not sure what they are, but it should be clear to anyome with half a brain thay having a car use a camera to tell if the traffic light is red or green is idiotic.untill a new system is ready, no car without AGI level ai will ever be safeThe only problem is that such collective approach conflicts with the way VCs work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related. I listed something for sale on Craigslist recently and got a bunch of messages right away that asked obvious questions that were in the listing. One suggested that his wife pick it up, and can I take Zelle? Went silent when I said cash only.But the most interesting scammer said: &#34;for my safety, can I send you a 6-digit number, and you confirm it, so I know the listing is not fake?&#34; I say yes, unsure what the scam was going to be, but sure it was a scam. Moments later I got an SMS from Google Voice asking me to verify my phone number. Mofo tried to steal my number, presumably to use it to scam other people. I was pissed and impressed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For a while I grew quite fond of wasting phone scammers time. I’d pick up, talk suuuuuuper slowly— like Emo Phillips speed at one syllable every one or two seconds— interrupt with irrelevant questions or anecdotes, and overall just see how long I could keep them on the phone without giving them any information. The best strategy I found was telling them that, yes indeed I did remember owing the IRS or whoever money and I could pay them however and insisting that first they needed to take down my new email address… I’d just start spelling random words incredibly slowly, say I messed up and start over, ask if they needed my checking account number to keep them engaged and then start spelling my email address again. They prey on intellectually disabled folks so pantomiming a stereotypical version of that wastes a ton of time while keeping their interest. Got boring after a while but I got pretty good at it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, how interesting. I started getting these a few months ago, right after starting a new job in a somewhat high-profile area. I have been getting 1-2 per month but found them quite unusual because none of them ever progressed to an actual scam - just a few messages back and forth about the fabricated &#34;wrong number&#34; situation and then each thread would stop, seemingly earnestly.Since there was no obvious scam, I&#39;ve been wondering what the motivation for these was, and actually started worrying about whether someone might be trying to compromise my phone via some yet-undisclosed SMS exploit - why else would there be a systematic effort to get me to spend time exchanging a few pointless messages around the &#34;wrong number&#34; pretext that otherwise went nowhere?I tried calling the senders by phone and found they were all Google Voice numbers, which eliminated the possibility that some actual rich guy had innocuously ended up with a number similar to mine.I asked a few friends and no one else was experiencing the same thing. Glad to hear it&#39;s not just me."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As Vim9 comes alive, and Neovim community focuses on Lua plugins instead, it seems this release is finally the update that will put a hard branch on the two communities. Up until now, most plugins (except Lua-only ones of course) have worked in both editors, but it doesn&#39;t seem like Vim9 will be supported in Neovim, so I guess what people go with now, will decide what you might stick with in the future (unless you&#39;re eager to switch development environments)."</p>

This will give vimscript a Python 3 moment, splitting an already small community into even smaller pieces.I wish he’d have embraced Lua like Neovim.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is mostly cliche popsci trash that isn’t worth reading.  Good for a game of logical fallacy bingo.The only interesting development seems to be the methodology but that only gets a passing mention.The rest is basically fearmongering.&gt; In humans, for example, gut bacteria influence how the immune system responds to pathogens and allergens, or interact with the brain, affecting mood.Ok.  But what does that have to do with diversity?  Humans have not been an emotionally rational species at any point in the past.  Arguably the relationship between gut biome diversity and civilization is inverse.  Maybe we want fewer microbes.Lifespan has also increased with decreased gut biome diversity.This is why correlation alone is uninteresting.  You can find it anywhere.&gt; Splitting the difference, people in less developed parts of the world have between 60 and 65 of those bacterial groups, an observation that ties the decrease in microbial diversity to urbanization.Oh come on.  How does a line like this get published?  This is fine if you define “ties” as “moves with” but not “is connected to”.  IOW correlation doesn’t imply causation.&gt; Kyle Meyer, a microbiologist at UC Berkeley, argues such losses are not necessarily a problem. “Maybe we don’t need them,” he points out. But Moeller is worried. “We are really doing some scary stuff to our microbiomes,” he warns.Why is it “scary”?  Nothing in this article established any cause for concern.The guy that developed the methodology is now in search of a problem his solution fits."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About ten years ago my former PI (second author in the below paper) did quite a job on this in Burkina Faso, analyzing the composition of the gut in children living outside cities, in cities, and a comparison with European children.Obligatory disclaimer: I was working in his laboratory at the time, but I wasn&#39;t involved in that research.https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1005963107"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty much every culture around the world 100 years ago had some staple fermented food. Nowadays, a lot of people in western culture at least outright refuse yogurt or other fermented foods like saurkraut or pickled cabbage that used to be staples in these people&#39;s ancestor&#39;s diets a few generations ago. People are becoming even lactose intolerant. You have to fertilize your microbes so to speak and eat these sorts of foods. Plus once you are doing stuff like making your own yogurt, a jug of whole milk works out a lot cheaper than the chobani stuff."</p>

Despite years of warnings, examples and analysis of where this can lead, the only thing that matters in the end is some emotional trigger word that makes the public think they are dealing with an &#34;outgroup&#34;.The cherry on top of it all is that ProPublica uses Google Search for their website. I am moderately sure that after I post this someone will jump in to comment and defend this practice, showing nothing has been learned.Privacy is important precisely because after your data has been collected and stored, there is no telling where it will end up and what it will be used for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This means Google may have turned over such critical information as unique mobile phone IDs, IP addresses, location information and details about users’ interests and online activityCan someone help me to understand this?I thought Google kept this kind of user-preference (interests/activity) data to itself, and used that as the sauce powering its ad auctions. If you run a site, GA will give you IP, location, etc. for inbound traffic, but I didn&#39;t think they would give you data on other users.Does Google actually sell user preference data and IPs in bulk? What product are they referring to here?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the US at least, any refrigeration technician should already have passed his EPA 608 or 609 and be fully aware that venting a unit can cost him his card rendering him unable to buy refrigerants. Before working on all but small self contained units he must have access to a refrigerant recovery unit. This a compressor sort of thing that can move the gas from the installed unit into a tank for either reuse on site or taking to a reclamation center, where allegedly they can be paid for it.(Yes, my AC units broke and the time to even get a technician to look at them, was so long I researched how to diagnose them and do the easy fixes, ran into the EPA requirement, studied the material and got my EPA certification, bought a bunch of gear off Amazon and refrigerant from a “good old boy” at an exorbitant price (global shortage, plus most is sold in palette quantities), and fixed my own unit in half the time it would have taken to get an appointment with a professional company. The first unit is working. If I succeed at the second unit I’ll even be money ahead. Of course if my yak had already been shaved maybe it could have tolerated the heat.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problematic refrigerants are pretty diverse, being made up of short carbon chains (1-4 atoms typically) decorated mainly with chlorine or flourine atoms. For example:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,3,3,3-TetrafluoropropeneInterestingly the best option for a refrigerant may be CO2 itself, which if collected from the atmosphere has no global warming or ozone depletion issues.  The only drawback is CO2 refrigeration equipment has to operate at relatively high pressure, but this isn&#39;t a major problem:https://www.rsi.edu/blog/hvacr/carbon-dioxide-refrigerant/Getting rid of the chloro-flouro stuff makes lots of sense, but not producing any of it in the first place would be even better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Planet Money did a story [1] in 2020 about a US team running a very similar scheme with the same business model to get rid of R12 refrigerant in the Midwest.It turns out running a business where you give people money in exchange for their junk is suprisingly harder than you would think.[1] https://www.npr.org/transcripts/917060248"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the problem with &#34;no politics at work&#34;: work has political salience. Politics concerns regulation of the world and work happens in the world.Whenever an executive starts complaining[1] about how politics is impacting their workplace I see management incompetence. Politics exists. It exists for everyone. If your company is having an unusually difficult time getting work done in a given political environment, the conditions that are causing that probably have more to do with the company environment than politics writ large.Prohibition is always a largely ineffective policy. People have feelings about the world. If you can&#39;t find a way to make space for those feelings somehow they will make their own space, often at the least convenient moment.[1] Most recently this was Kraken CEO Jesse Powell"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Crypto&#39;s biggest friction point imo has been that people are used to interacting [primarily with centralized services. Average people don&#39;t want to manage their own crypto wallet because they aren&#39;t used to being the sole person responsible for managing things like that. They don&#39;t want all their money to be tied to a single computer, or QR code, or device, they want it tied to an account held by a big company, where all they have to do is prove who they are to access their stuff. 
Because of this habit it feels like decentralized services will always end up as a collection of siloed centralized services. And with centralized services you get things like this data selling. Unless there&#39;s a paradigm shift in how non-technical people interact with decentralized services things like this are going to keep happening. That said, they&#39;re saying they&#39;re only providing publicly available data to ICE, but if it&#39;s publicly available and non-identifiable, why does ICE even need it, and why wouldn&#39;t they be able to get it themselves?

Saying that for full disclosure because I&#39;m biased and this feels like a hit piece to me.When I worked there, they disclosed all financials in our internal Confluence site. There was a policy of full transparency with the employees. The owners (Mike and Scott) had impressive business discipline. They were profitable every quarter. They had many many opportunities to get vc money and go wild. When they finally took VC money, It was a modest amount ($60M I think) and the purpose was explained to us as setting up an ESOP program and putting Atlassian on the path to go public.A year or two later, Doug Berman, the founder of Great Plains software became chairman of the Atlassian board. He gave a presentation to all of the employees at the Sydney office. One thing that stood out was that he said, it&#39;s actually bad to be profitable when you&#39;re growing. I&#39;m paraphrasing here but he essentially said, you&#39;re leaving growth on the table. His thesis was growth is more important than profits.So whether you agree with that or not, that is obviously the idea they are operating on rather than uncontrolled spending and helicopter dropping stock on employees heads out of desperation."</p>

I switched the ticket type from A to B (no epics involved) and it wiped out the entire description. All I did was select a different item in a select drop down box provided by the form&#39;s UI.There was no warning it would clear the description and no draft saved. I lost 30 minutes of work.I normally manually copy textareas every few minutes on any Atlassian page because I don&#39;t trust their site (to be fair I do this for most sites too) but in the above case I had just copied a link reference which overwrote my clipboard.

For example, why are your Microsoft Windows and Office codebases not in your training set?This is my favorite question about Copilot ever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a leader of a FOSS project that is on github, and migrated off of sourceforge because SVN and email patches were not scaling - I&#39;m a bit confused by this article.Co-pilot has issues, ergo github is going the way of sourceforge, and so now we must abandon github? Do I have that reasoning correct?We need to:- migrate the bug queue- have all links in commit history break- application integration with githib for bug reporting be removed- update documentation- find a new website host (and no longer github.io)- find a new CI/CD (we were already burned by travis, github workflows are nice)- teach our user contributors to actually use git! There has been a lot of heartache from them that they have to use the pencil icon on a web ui to edit config files, now we have to take them back to using a git GUI client! We were on github before that blessed pencil icon feature came out, there was no end to the wailing about how unapproachable the process was (super frustrating when users see they have to do something.. frustrating for us because our users wanted to just email is stuff so we could then do the uploading to git work)- lose all PR history- migrate project tracking- find a new place to host release artifacts- update our website to use a new distribution URL (the website scrapes github api to get latest version for download link; it&#39;s nice never updating website as we do releases on every merge)- figure out and migrate repository permissions. (We have a hundred repositories of user generated plugin content, everything about migrating that would be a lot of work and missing important features)- lose our search ranking and rebuild our SEOWhat else to add to this pile.. and all because co-pilot smells?? Meanwhile all of that work is busy work, and not at all feature-pare. That kind of migration would take a long time, seems like that pivot without good reason is the worst kind of churn.  Convince me this article is not a temper tantrum about copilot..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This isn&#39;t very compelling to me.SourceForge went bad ... and everyone left.  That doesn&#39;t seem like a bad thing and there&#39;s no reason for me to think any given site / service will or won&#39;t go bad too.  I expect that for any number of reasons I might need to move from one site to the next.The rest too is kinda hollow to me.  The fact that they&#39;re for profit doesn&#39;t upset me.  I figured they wanted to make a profit when I signed up even ... not sure how that would surprise anyone now.Co-pilot, I personally don&#39;t feel there is a compelling reason to leave github due to that either.Maybe I&#39;m not versed enough in some of this but as a rando dev I&#39;m just not having any problems on github these days ...I&#39;m not saying the author is wrong or right or that I&#39;m right or wrong, just that I&#39;m not finding that article very convincing."</p>

				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31932808">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Headlines about Supreme Court cases are almost uniformly misleading, because they suggest the Court is making decisions on policy issues rather than legal issues.The very first words of the opinion, on p. 2, make clear that the legal issue before the Court is very different: https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1530_n758.pdfThe Clean Air Act does not purport to give the EPA blanket regulatory authority over anything involving emissions into the air. It has detailed provisions focused on reducing the amount of toxic pollutants, in particular through the use of control (scrubbing) technologies. This case concerns whether the EPA can use its power to impose control technologies on power plants, to force the industry to use a particular mix of power generation sources (solar, gas, etc.). The Court decided that the statute did not confer on the EPA the power to do that.  The relevant discussion begins on page 16.This decision gives legs to something that has been called the &#34;major questions doctrine.&#34; The gist of that doctrine is that an agency can&#39;t stretch some pre-existing grant of Congressional authority to create sweeping regulations addressing a major new problem. As applied here, that means that the EPA can&#39;t rely on authority delegated by Congress to, for example, tell coal plants what kind of scrubbers they have to use, to tackle climate change. pp. 17-19."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What’s interesting about this ruling (if you listened to the oral arguments and read the ruling) is that it appears to undercut the ability for any executive agency to make a rule, under them claim that congress cannot delegate its powers.So the FAA can’t determine and then require that aircraft have transponders.  Congress has to do this.If they continue down this path it will be chaos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with &#34;congress cannot delegate it&#39;s powers&#34; to a certain extent.Negative example: The BATF has a splendid history of literally doing nothing except putting it&#39;s critics behind bars, while solving 0 actual crime and preventing any sort of mass tradgedies.Positive example: The FAA has done an incredible job making air-travel safer than car travel. I have a feeling that a lot of the higher-ups are former engineers and have been able to put politics and red/blue crap aside for a common mission.Mixed example: The FCC has done a great job on spectrum allocation. They&#39;ve done a shitty job when on broadband and content regulation, with it quickly becoming politicalized and more concern about red/blue.Good example: The FDA has done a great job in regulating the industry for their namesake: food and drugs. We have unprecedented levels of safety in both despite not having a complete knowledge of how all drugs work (biology is just complex with a lot of hidden downstream after-effects).Poor example: The NRC has pretty much just said &#34;No&#34; to fucking everything in nuclear. No progress has been made. We should have 3-5 reactors (on average) in every state. Instead we&#39;re still running 50 year old designs (not _necessarily bad_ but not great either) when we could have Generation III+ with passive failure modes.That brings me to the EPA. I think they&#39;ve done a lot of good: energy efficiency ultimately benefits the consumer in nearly every case. I have an air conditioner that kicks out a splendid 58degree air stream in the summer heat and extraordinarily low energy consumption levels. The EPA has successfully sued countless corporations and created superfund sights when they just dump industrial waste without a plan to handle it.Unfortunately, as red/blue politics get involved in an agency, everyone loses. And the finger pointing begins. As such, the only &#34;way out&#34; may be to say delegate it to Congress. I&#39;m not sure where we go from here."</p>

Also in rainstorms where they are constantly getting pelted with their bodyweight in wet missiles every few seconds.They can also fly 30mph in level flight, which in body lengths / second is ~4x times faster than an SR-71.[0] US nickels weigh 5 grams, for comparison.[1] https://www.kqed.org/science/28759/what-happens-when-you-put..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Throwaway account for reasons that will become obvious.I know someone who was able to work with JR at EA at a very high level, and who was familiar with internal goings-on at Unity a few years ago. His assessment of JR&#39;s leadership style was that he thought competition between executives was a good thing, and the result was a lot of mistrust and chaos.I&#39;m not sure the specifics of how this played out at EA, but what I do know is that during his tenure, there were a number of poorly-executed moves towards expanding franchises (Dead Space 3, Medal of Honor: Warfighter, Army of Two: The Devil&#39;s Cartel), adding live service components to games that didn&#39;t benefit (SimCity), pivots to free-to-play that failed (Plants Vs Zombies 2, Bejeweled Skies, Dungeon Keeper), rushed releases meant to fill schedules (Dragon Age 2), and several massive acquisitions at hugely inflated prices that were almost total wastes of money (Playfish, PopCap).There were many internal groups battling for control: Multiple product management teams who wanted to influence monetization strategy across mobile games, several small studios who were able to release games with little to no oversight (an HTML5/JS web game team that made a Command and Conquer game, and another team that made several Dragon Age Flash games), and the ill-fated initiative to turn BioWare into a huge umbrella label that lasted about a year before SWTOR came out and then Ray and Greg were basically forced into retirement.Lots of really messy stuff.From the folks I&#39;ve talked to who work at Unity, it&#39;s pretty chaotic there too. And why wouldn&#39;t it be? They doubled headcount in a short period of time, are tackling a ton of different markets, they&#39;ve pushed and then deprecated or removed support for a multiplayer solution, analytics service, a UI rewrite, and probably more I&#39;m forgetting. Then there are the &#34;this is the new hotness&#34; features that STILL AREN&#39;T FINISHED even two, three, four, or more years after they were announced, like the two competing and incompatible rendering pipelines, ECS, and more. And I&#39;ve been told that the reason that longstanding bugs in major features like 2D sprites and physics take so long to be fixed is that each of those major features only has one, maybe two people working on it.No wonder things are rocky at Unity."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s incredible that the US allowed TikTok (which is by all measures a chinese spy tool) to become such a dominant social network.India got it right from the beggining by banning TikTok. They saw the immense threat and didn’t hesitate.China, by principle, has always banned all foreign information technology companies. What seemed hostile for us, it’s a reasonable play if you understand the unmeasurable power of massive information products such as Google or Facebook.Meanwhile the US is just focused on attacking its own homegrown tech companies and diminishing their ability to compete in global contexts.We are on a declining trajectory and we willingly paved that road. It’s sad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I will repeat my comment:Stop generalizing the &#34;country of origin&#34; as if it does not matter like the Chinese Comunist Party isn&#39;t a threat to the world.
- There will always be a ruler, and which ruler is killing, slaving, censoring and selling it&#39;s own people as meat tools for foreign companies?- China will kill, torture it&#39;s own people and their families if they think they are a thread (even if remote) to their government party (CCP).- China put on a HEAVY surveilance tool and actually forced people to behave like they want using social credit- China is actively removing ANY historical filosophies, tales, traditions, religions that could be a thread to the CCP&#39;s beliefs.- Have you ever seen a CCP convention? Their plan is to remove the worlds countries boundaries in order to rule over everything from culture to politics and economics. Australia is suffering a lot on their hands, they even sent spies to patronize elections."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a stellar example of a quite rare class of magic trick where the method is actually more amazing than the effect. The vast majority of magic tricks are the opposite. The effect is amazing but the method is actually quite mundane. This is one reason magicians don&#39;t reveal &#34;secrets&#34;. The reality is most magical methods are rather disappointing compared to the astonishing impact of the effect created.For any magical effect there are almost always many possible methods and, conversely, for each method there are multiple possible effects. This method provides a way to know the location (or absence) of each card in a shuffled deck without the performer handling the deck. For most of the effects which could be accomplished with this method there exist a wide variety of alternate, much simpler, methods. Using any of those easier and cheaper methods would likely appear identically amazing to audiences. And that&#39;s why I love this method. As a technologist and magician, I&#39;ve always had a special fondness for wildly complex methods - that rare kind of magic where the method actually IS as amazing as the effect."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This tech could be a game changer for accessibility. Many card games are not or cannot be adapted to braille, so I haven&#39;t been able to play them with friends. If cards can be sold with invisible ink in an open format, then I would need only a scanner and a earphone to be able to check my cards without other help.I&#39;ve thought of doing with with QR codes, but I&#39;m not sure if it will look okay for the other players and if the qr codes won&#39;t be recognizable enough by a human to give someone unfair advantage in some situations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The intro speaks truth and brings back a lot of frustrating experiences:&gt;We may have all heard the saying “use it or lose it”. We experience it when we feel rusty in a foreign language or sports that we have not practised in a while. Practice is important to maintain skills but it is also key when learning new ones. This is a reason why many textbooks and courses feature exercises. However, the solutions to the exercises feel often overly brief, or are sometimes not available at all. Rather than an opportunity to practice the new skills, the exercises then become a source of frustration and are ignored.Typical exercise soltion: How to draw an owl. 1. Draw some circles. 2. Draw the rest of the $@#% owl."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Side-note on digital calendars: What I&#39;d really like is a continuously scrolling calendar to help with long-ish term planning (3-4 months). Most apps are stuck in the single-month page view analogy to physical calendars, which for me keeps breaking my mental flow of stringing activities across the boundary/long distances. And I get why (standard behavior/components and user expectations) but it just seems like a missed opportunity. Not sure how many want this but I suspect more would do if they were exposed to it.A few calendar apps allow a stretch of &gt;4 weeks and there&#39;s this POC web version: https://madebyevan.com/calendar/app/ but all I can do for now is constantly switch from a Gantt app to my calendar app (Thunderbird or Google Calendar)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, this is where design really falls flat.It looks nice, the idea is appealing, but the result is awful. This thing is totally unusable. You need to remember to slide the frame every month. It doesn&#39;t even tell you that you did or not. Sliding the frame requires checking the number of days there are in the month. When you&#39;re in the last week, having the 31 always there is a pain in the ass. Knowing the next month is kind of useful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat. Some limitations:- It doesn&#39;t tell you how many days there are in the month (31/30/28/29).- Working out how to move the frame at the end of the month isn&#39;t very difficult, but it&#39;s not trivial either (especially given the previous point)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something not mentioned in the article: Middle Earth is depopulated. Without large market, it does not make sense to produce at scale, nor you will have the capital to do it.The main characters travel hundreds of kilometers down the biggest river around and they don&#39;t encounter other vessels or a populated settlement until they reach Minas Tirith. And I&#39;m not even mentioning the missing cities and villages in the inland part of the travel. We can say that this is due to lower birth rate in the numenorians who obviously have reproductive issues as mentioned in the books. Another reason is the brain, knowledge and capital drain caused by the large elvian immigration going for centuries. Dwarfs have the excuse of a long generation length to explain why they are not multiplying like rabbits for the thousands of years since the last world war, however, Tolkien does not provide a good reason for the other human nations, the orcs or even the hobbits.Possible explanation might be the unstable security situation on the continent, however, most of the societies are not described as being constantly under the risk of a raid from nearby orc. Aragorn is able to defend most of the north with a few hundred irregulars, while the east participated in only one war 60 years ago that was done in a few weeks time. The south is not described, but nothing unusual there as well as far as the books go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I highly recommend &#34;The Last Ring Bearer&#34; for people who like to have a bit of fun with Tokien.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_RingbearerEskov&#39;s version of the story describes Mordor as a peaceful constitutional monarchy on the verge of an industrial revolution, that poses a threat to the war-mongering and imperialistic faction represented by Gandalf (whose attitude has been described by Saruman as &#34;crafting the Final Solution to the Mordorian problem&#34;) and the racist elves.[2] For example, Barad-dûr, Sauron&#39;s citadel, appears in chapter 2 as...that amazing city of alchemists and poets, mechanics and astronomers, philosophers and physicians, the heart of the only civilization in Middle-earth to bet on rational knowledge and bravely pitch its barely adolescent technology against ancient magic. The shining tower of the Barad-dûr citadel rose over the plains of Mordor almost as high as Orodruin like a monument to Man – free Man who had politely but firmly declined the guardianship of the Dwellers on High and started living by his own reason. It was a challenge to the bone-headed aggressive West, which was still picking lice in its log ‘castles’ to the monotonous chanting of scalds extolling the wonders of never-existing Númenor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article presents an engineering answer to s sociological question.The reason technology did not advance in Middle Earth is because innovation was not rewarded. Innovation and experimentation were punished.Mine a little too deeply? You awaken a balrog that kills you an everyone you have ever known.Want to expand into that verdant area across the river? You didn&#39;t expect giant spiders, did you?Build a disruptive startup and bank $50B? You&#39;ll hear dragon wings a-flappen.Middle Earth was not filled with innovative disrupters because the risk and reward equation strongly discouraged innovation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally I think they should not be able to decide such things. A payment provider should be forced to accept all legitimate customers. It is absolutely unwanted for a private business (in an unrelated category no less) to be playing the role of legislator.The problem is once a majority of payment providers (especially in this category where there&#39;s only really 2 major ones) starts blocking things, it becomes really difficult for fringe groups that are in fact perfectly legal. I understand that porn payments are a bit more risky but the providers can simply have a policy to deny chargebacks for this category and shift the risk to the customer. Similar to the way returns of sex toys are not accepted for hygiene reasons.Recently there was a lot of news in the Netherlands about prostitutes not being able to open bank account because all banks refused them. Think of prostitution what you will but over there it&#39;s legal work and they pay their taxes. But not being able to get a bank account gets them into very difficult situations and pushes them to shady people (which was exactly what the legalisation was avoiding).Also other platforms like fetlife have recently been forced to validate their users, leading to potentially serious consequences if this data ever becomes compromised. Many people there don&#39;t even show their face so the result is that they have to give a lot more personal info now than they would have wanted to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an author of pinephone keyboard firmware, I spent a bit of time thinking and trying to use keyboard like this. I can say that what hinders portability/serious use of all of these layout designs that try to emulate regular big keyboard is that they try to emulate big keyboard layout. That layout is made with an asumption that you have many fingers available, and that they can easily reach anywhere if you like.If you have only two thumbs available for typing, that can only reach about half the keyboard each (quite a hard limit!), you realize how asumptions this layout makes suddenly don&#39;t hold, and normal things like ctrl+a or alt+shift+1, or alt+shift+any arrow are almost impossible.Yes, you can modify the shortcuts in i3wm,screen,... (not Firefox, which is quite resistant to modifying keyboard shortcuts by design) specially for your &#34;PDA&#34;. But  if you just want a portable device you can painlessly migrate your tasks to for a few days a year, spending a lot of time designing shortcuts for your DE, or terminal multiplexer, is not that appealing.It would be probably more useful if key layout was designed from the start to allow various modifier combos to be invoked by dedicated keys, or layout designed so that more modifiers were symetricaly placed (or something even less traditional, and have all letter/number keys on the right and all modifier/modifier combos/special keys on the left), instead of wasting space on big enter key, or big spacebar (for which you may spend several HW iterations just to make those right and reactive on their whole surface), etc. Due to size, it&#39;s usually uncomfortable to press 3 key combos even with the keyboard laying on the table.Also comfortable position for the most comonly used keys (usually modifiers) is not on the edge of the keyboard. That&#39;s really pretty bad for your thumbs.The layout of these things just needs a lot more thought.Sad thing is, that if someone would spend a ton of research and thinking on making something usable and comfortable, most people would completely poopoo it as a freaky unusable layout, just because it would look unfamiliar, lol."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ugh, every time I see a device like this (and even the larger Reform) I&#39;m so tempted. But I learned my lesson form-factor wise with the GPD Win Max: even as a travel laptop it&#39;s painfully small after about a day or two of use. And the sad reality is that the performance-freedom tradeoff is still immense. If we assume the best system module is faster than say a Raspberry Pi 4 (which seems optimistic), it&#39;d still get absolutely walked by an 11-year old i5 (e.g., Tx20 generation Thinkpad which are coreboot-able these days).Any kind of performance-critical stuff is clearly not the point, but it&#39;s hard to not think that smartphones have killed off this form-factor/performance tier for good reason. Makes a lot of sense as a Raspberry Pi with a screen and keyboard, but not really as a &#34;laptop.&#34;"</p>

My needs are very simple, and I&#39;d love to know the state of anything that can (and with stability).1. Be a decent phone (voice, sms)
2. Contacts/Mail/Calendar sync
3. Run android apps that require voice (Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, etc)?

I use it as my daily driver in work and for personal use.It has so many features that puts me, the user, in control that I totally take them for granted until I have to use outlook for something.I use it in a multinational, I used it with exchange and now with office 365. People can complain away but there are many like me who rely on it every single day and it has a real, positive impact on our work lives every single day.Some days are just email client and Web browser, and without thunderbird and Firefox working for me as the user...... I dunno, work would be a lot more frustrating I guess. MASSIVE thanks to all the contributors to thunderbird!"</p>

I&#39;m glad to see Thunderbird&#39;s maintenance continuing well, but I want it to be a focused app. On the other hand, I have been glad to have out of the box Lightning integration, so perhaps I will come to enjoy the Matrix addition as well."</p>

I&#39;m not sure if it will be useful in the office, which is small enough for people to just talk to one another, but it could come in handy in some circumstances where we&#39;d normally use an email chain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is informative.  I have found that databases in general tend to be less sexy than the front-end apps...especially with the recent cohort of devs. As an old bastard,  I would pass on one thing:  Realize that any reasonably used database will likely outlast the applications leveraging it. This is especially true the bigger it gets, and the longer it stays in production.  That said, if you are influencing the design of a database, imagine years later what someone looking at it might want to know if having to rip all the data out into some other store.  Having migrated many legacy systems, I tend to sleep better when I know the data is well-structured and easy to normalize.  In those cases, I really don&#39;t care so much about the apps.  If I can sort out (haha) the data, I worry less about the new apps I need to design.  I have been known to bury documentation into for-purpose tables...that way I know that info won&#39;t be lost.  Export the schema regularly, version it, check it in somewhere.  And, if you can, please, limit the use of anything that can hold a NULL. Not every RDBMS handles NULL the same way.   Big old databases live a looooong time."</p>

The user clicked the link after getting it in their mailbox but then Auth0 throws up an error page because the e-mail address has already been verified (by Outlook scanning). 
The problem becomes worse if for some reason the mail ends up in the junk mail folder so the user thinks they&#39;ve never received the mail but when you check it looks like the e-mail address was verified successfully.
That has caused a lot of annoying back and forth trying to figure out what the hell is going on.

Super annoying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not just in megaprojects either. In my large, fairly dense US city, basic, easy-to-build, local infrastructure like adding a 1-mile bike lane to a straight street is impossible because a handful of NIMBYs are constantly taken seriously by local politicians.My city has many bike lanes that are popular and well-used, as well as a bike-share program that is extremely popular. It also has a large number of cyclist deaths - including children! - due to the spottiness of existing bike infrastructure and overall lack of protected bike lanes. It seems like improving that infrastructure would be both easy, cheap, and popular, given the popularity of cycling and its existing infra, and the cheapness of plopping a concrete barrier onto a street. But no - the second anyone mentions protected bike lanes, a handful of NIMBYs write in with &#34;but muh cars&#34; and the politicians throw up their hands and surrender.I don&#39;t understand why NIMBYs have been taken so seriously in the US in the past 50 years. It seems like at any point in history, any local project will be opposed by somebody, no matter who they are or what the project is. But previous generations seemed to be able to get over that in favor of building. For today&#39;s generation it seems like doing nothing has become better than doing something. If this were the 1900s, government would have told the NIMBYs to get bent, we&#39;re building Thing X because it&#39;s good for society and if you don&#39;t like it, tough. That&#39;s what living in city means sometimes!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the things I love about Palladium (and closely related, Samo Burja&#39;s newsletter) is the depth of research.Like the detail that one of the most egregious episodes from California HSR involved a Spanish company that performed excellently on rail projects in Spain. Overall, this piece makes a strong case that the problem is specifically NIMBYism and loss of government institutional capacity.I think the million dollar question is how government organizations can hire and retain better. The current situation looks dire. Obviously a charismatic leader with a broad anti-NIMBY mandate would go a ways at getting competent people to want to work in government. You saw that succeed on a small scale with orgs like US Digital Service.The elephant, after that, is merit-based pay and promotion. Someone needs to sell this to the public. RN literally random cops and plumbers make mid six figures thru overtime while the directors of $100b mega-project are low-energy lifers making less than that. That&#39;s not gonna work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People generally call out NIMBY-ism as though it&#39;s just some sort of irrational bias that people have, but I don&#39;t think that always explains it.  Sure, in a lot of cases, people are overprotective of their neighborhoods or communities.  But where did that attitude come from?  I&#39;d argue it came from decades of corporate greed and government dysfunction that bred a general distrust of large institutions.  It&#39;s not like people have no reason to feel like big business doesn&#39;t have their best interests in mind.Another commenter gave the construction of highways as an example, saying that people used to look at large infrastructure projects like that with a positive attitude.  Well, I&#39;d say look where that got them.  The way highways were built in this country completely wrecked communities (especially poor ones located in less desirable parts of town) and eventually led to the uniquely American aesthetic of the urban and suburban wasteland.If large organizations in this country want to undertake large projects, they have to first work to regain the trust of the average person by acting like they actually give a damn and really want to the world to be a better place for their efforts."</p>

So it seems hypocritical to mock someone who trips, knowing that I&#39;m just lucky to sometimes avoid the hazards that would trip me up.In the end, about the only conclusions I&#39;m really confident in is that trouble besets us all, and usually it&#39;s good to default to kindness and sympathy.EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION: I&#39;m not saying that I want swindlers to succeed.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Prominent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has defaulted on a loan worth more than $670 million. Digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital issued a notice on Monday morning, stating that the fund failed to repay a loan of $350 million in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDC, and 15,250 bitcoin, worth about $323 million at today’s prices.In other words, the $670 million that 3AC defaulted on was ~50:50 USDC and bitcoin.Then later:&gt; Zhu [3AC founder] is known for his incredibly bullish view of bitcoin. He said last year the world’s largest cryptocurrency could be worth $2.5 million per coin. But in May this year, as the crypto market began its meltdown, Zhu said on Twitter that his “supercycle price thesis was regrettably wrong.”This seems odd. How does a person convinced that bitcoin exchange is headed to $2.5 million take out a loan of 15K bitcoin if he actually thinks he&#39;ll be paying back it back at a higher exchange rate? Either the founder was bullish in principle but bearish in practice, or didn&#39;t have the first clue about what he was doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really don’t understand the business model of making massive fiat loans to “firms” to buy bitcoin. If crypto goes up, you get a small amount of interest. If crypto goes down, you lose everything. What? Lol. Just spend a fraction of the sum on bitcoin and do something safe with the rest. What was the plan?Edit: I guess when someone has “20 billion dollars” a 700mm loan doesn’t seem like a big risk."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good overview, but even by 2014 we weren&#39;t calling hlt - there&#39;s a few problems there. Imagine the situation where you fork() a process on one CPU, and you have another CPU that recently called hlt. Ideally you&#39;d schedule it immediately instead of waiting for the next scheduler interrupt, but sending interrupts from one CPU to another (to break it out of hlt) is kind of expensive. The replacement is an instruction called mwait, which will (like hlt) wake the CPU up on interrupts, but will also wake up the CPU on a write to a specific memory address. If you want to wake up an idle CPU, the working CPU can just do that memory write and then the idle CPU will wake up back into the scheduler and figure out it has work to do.(Edit: there are still actually some circumstances in which hlt is called rather than mwait, but this is very CPU dependent and is based on vendor recommendations. Also, before mwait showed up, switching to deep CPU power saving states tended to involve performing magic IO port accesses rather than calling hlt, and yes the world was worse back then)"</p>

Asyncio has its place but is waaay overused. Typing was a cool idea, but so awkward in practice.All of it has really turned me off, personally. It’s getting to where reading libraries is just painful.  The simplicity of the language was really beautiful and when I wanted type safety, etc. I’d use something else.  I can still write simple Python, but it’s more all the other code I need to grok.I find myself going to Go more and more for stuff I used to use Python for. It’s easier to set up a dev environment for other people, easier to distribute code, and gives me type safety and concurrency as first class citizens while being a very small language.I miss dictionary comprehensions and other shortcuts from time to time. But it actually feels more ergonomic now.All personal opinion. I’m fine shifting languages.  I still write C from time to time to bang bits.  I play with various LISPs to exercise my brain.  I never used Python for performance critical code.

  &gt; of soft pseudonymity as my digital personal space, and expect
  &gt; to have it respected.

Without judging whether the goal is good or not, I will gently point out that your current approach doesn&#39;t seem to be effective. A Google search for &#34;BoppreH&#34; turned up several results on the first page with what appears to be your full name, along with other results linking to various emails that have been associated with that name. Results include Github commits, mailing list archives, and third-party code that cited your Github account as &#34;work by $NAME&#34;.As a purely practical matter -- again, not going into whether this is how things should be, merely how they do be -- it is futile to want the internet as a whole to have a concept of privacy, or to respect the concept of a &#34;digital personal space&#34;. If your phone number or other PII has ever been associated with your identity, that association will be in place indefinitely and is probably available on multiple data broker sites.The best way to be anonymous on the internet is to be anonymous, which means posting without any name or identifier at all. If that isn&#39;t practical, then using a non-meaningful pseudonym and not posting anything personally identifiable is recommended."</p>

I know there are people on here that have much, much more and could afford to buy an already existing house.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You should organize each day as if it were your last, so that you neither need to long for nor fear the next day.I&#39;ve come to find this &#34;live each day like it&#39;s your last&#34; advice to be pretty unhelpful. My favorite quote about it is, &#34;all that goes to show you is some people would spend their last day giving you stupid advice&#34;.The problem is that if it actually was your last day, most people would give the finger to all of their responsibilities and go party, eat cake, see friends, familiy, lovers, etc. Which is simply not an actual way to live your life. It&#39;s a way to exit your life.An alternative framing that I&#39;ve come to find more helpful is to take your life expectancy, and cut it by 2/3. Now what do you do? For example, if you&#39;re 20 years old and your life expectancy is 80 (ie. 60 more years), pretend that you only have 20 more, so you&#39;ll only live until you&#39;re 40. It&#39;s nice cause it naturally adjusts as you get older. You&#39;ll have smaller windows to work with.This approach strikes a nice balance. It gives you enough time to be able to really do something and change directions if you want. But not so much time that you can really waste any. It forces you to ask the hard questions about whether your day to day is truly connecting with your dreams, and whether you&#39;re on a path to get there.Of course, Seneca didn&#39;t have life expectancy tables to work with. But I think he would have approved. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article buries its lede, which is about how honey bees get all the attention but are at less risk than wild bees:&gt; And that brings us to the actual problem. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is only one of about 20 thousand different bee species. The non-honey bees are usually referred to as wild bees, and each location has its native species. According to an estimate from researchers at Cornell University in 2006, wild bees contribute to the pollination of 85 percent of crops in agriculture.&#34;&gt; [...]&gt; But last year the magazine Cell published the results of a study with a global estimate for the situation of wild bees. The authors looked at the numbers of bee species that were collected or observed over time using data publicly available at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. They found that even though the number of records has been increasing, the number of different species in the records has been sharply decreasing in the past decades.&gt; The decline rates differ between the continents, but the species numbers are dropping steeply everywhere except for Oceania. The researchers say there’s a number of factors in play here, such as the expansion of monocultures, loss of native habitat, pesticides, climate change, and bee trade that also trades around pathogens.&gt; So the problems that wild bees face are similar to those of honey bees, but they have an additional problem which is… honeybees. Honey bees compete with wild bees for food and habitat and they also pass on viruses. Now, a big honey bee colony can deal with viruses by throwing out the infected bees. But this doesn’t work for wild bees because they don’t live in large colonies. And worse, when honey bees and wild bees fight for food they seem to both lose out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(1) Stop using neonicotinoid pesticides. There are plenty of alternatives for protecting food crops from insect infestations, such as neem oil applied as a foliar spray or a soil soak in response to infestations.  Neonictoninoides are based on the tobacco nicotine molecule structure, but are typically chlorinated and modified to make them more persistent and toxic to insects relative to animals.  There&#39;s a good argument for banning the entire class due to their persistent ecological effects on beneficial native insect populations.https://organic-center.org/research/neonicotinoid-pesticides...(2) Have undisturbed habitat set aside for wild bee populations.  This can be something as simple as maintaining undisturbed hedgerows on the sides of agricultural fields, but in general means maintaining a fair amount of undisturbed native habitat.https://www.planetbee.org/planet-bee-blog//native-bee-series..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I appreciate that she draws the link between monoculture crops, land use, and the health of ecosystems upon which agriculture depends.Organics are important not because GMOs are the enemy but rather because the land use change is inherently bad for all life in that area. GMOs don&#39;t have to lead to monoculture crops that span acres or rampant neonicotinoid insecticides, but they often do, and it&#39;s precisely at that point we can see drastic changes in a biome&#39;s stability and therefore the health of bees among many other pollinators. That&#39;s why we need to be talking about insect numbers at large and not only bees.The study of biodiversity has an extremely difficult time modeling these kinds of changes, and that&#39;s probably why many scientists won&#39;t go to bat against this kind of land use change. A self-respecting scientist won&#39;t say that converting croplands to monocultures ready for insecticide use lead to biodiversity die-off because it&#39;s hard to actually track the fluctuations between species. It takes so much time to collect data to analyze before we even get an inkling of the interplay. We understand so little about the microscale interactions and how it fits into our larger understanding of agriculture and land development.For those who think this is all overblown and alarmist, go sit on the grass -- if you can find a patch -- and stare at a spot until it comes alive. Things are moving around and teeming with a multitude of species of plants and insects. The reality you see escapes unnoticed until you stop to think about the ecological systems that underpin our fragile existence. Our health depends on a functional biosphere. If we cannot figure out how to share the earth with its other inhabitants, what the fuck are we doing going to Mars?"</p>

To me, the replicants (or androids, if you will) are deplorable because [inaudible] they are cold, they are selfish, they are heartless, they are completely self-centered, they have no empathy, they don&#39;t care about what happens to other creatures, and to me this is essentially a less-than-human entity for that reason. Now, Ridley said that he regarded them as supermen who couldn&#39;t fly. He said they are smarter than humans, they are stronger than humans, and they have faster reflexes than humans. Well, then I said &#39;well, gee Ridley, I mean, holy smokes, uh, golly,&#39; and that was about all I could think of to say, you know. That&#39;s rather a great divergence, you see: we&#39;ve gone from somebody who is a simulation of the authentic human to somebody who is literally superior to the authentic human. So we&#39;ve now flipped all the cards on the table, you see, when we do that: in other words, all the cards that were up are now down and all the ones that were down are now up. And I was at a loss at that point, you know, to respond, I mean. I said, &#39;okay, now the theme of the book is that Rick Deckard is dehumanized in his job of tracking down the replicants and killing them, that in other words he winds up essentially like they are.&#39; And Ridley said that he regarded that as an intellectual idea and he was not interested in making an esoteric film.&#34;-- Philip K.

So much sci fi I encounter now feels little more than a long trailer with no idea how to end."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Tech writer here.The absolute, invariable first rule in tech writing is to know your audience.Understand not just their technical problems but take the time to empathize with why they have these problems in the first place.Tech writing isn&#39;t about documenting, it&#39;s about finding the best way to explain something to people so they can solve their problems.Oh, and use an editor (the human kind, not the digital kind.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Lots of great advice here. One piece of advice I got from my publisher when authoring a technical book was to first break down what I was going write into headings and subheadings, and if possible, into sub-subheadings. Then review that to see if your flow is coherent and whether there are sections that are missing, or could be extracted into another text.Personally, my process after this is to express my thoughts in bullet points, followed by inserting any placeholders and captions for any graphics (e.g. charts or diagrams), and then finally I start rewriting my bullet points into proper sentences, expanding my examples, and adding any interstitial text necessary to make things flow.Also, I see some comments on keeping things short and to the point. In general, I agree with this, but depending on the medium, sometimes it doesn’t hurt to inject a bit of personality into your writing. Technical writing can be dry at times, and this can deter engagement. Try to use concrete examples whenever possible or refer to other supporting texts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If anyone is interested, after firefox send shutdown, i wrote https://www.relaysecret.com, its footprint is extremely small (1 lambda function that does all signing for s3 upload/download, simple frontend code that does encryption in browser using web crypto api with no 3rd party Js, no 3rd party css, no tracking. Anchor tag is used for additional random key material (so it wont leave ya browser and files will always be encrypted regardless).You can roll your own too with the terraform code in it. It costs me barely anything (never go over free tier limit) to run it because files never live more than 10 days (there is a catchall lifecycle rule on the bucket) and when users select durations, i also put them in bucket prefix that has lifecycle rule place on objects under them for that duration. Note that we can&#39;t rely on lifecycle rule all the time so i also make sure when lambda is called to access the object, it checks the time-stamp, the duration and if it is meant to expire and not yet cleaned up by s3 - lambda function deletes it.I learnt a ton of cool things about s3 after this neat little project and really dig the API, the lifecycle rule, signing url etc...Ps: for these type of tool, you should definitely mitm it to see if plaintext file or password ever leave the browser... Relaysecret does leave one item unencrypted and that is the file name. You can change it upon upload but i like to leave it there so people know what they are downloading. I have simple idea of encrypting that with just the anchor key but haven&#39;t gotten around to put that in yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if Google was an absolute saint without a trillion-dollar ad business, there&#39;s still a problem of &#34;bug-compatibility&#34;.Without a second browser engine to test pages in, it&#39;s really hard to know what is a bug and what is intentional. Devs don&#39;t know all the specs by heart. They write whatever happens to work for them, but sometimes they accidentally depend on obscure edge cases in the implementation that were never meant to exist.In the long term it&#39;s paralysing for the engine maintainers, because any change in implementation could be changing some subtle behavior that breaks some pages. W3C requires two independent implementations, so that they&#39;ll share intentional behaviors, but hopefully their bugs will differ.The single-engine Web will be as fun to maintain as Windows: Windows 11 Explorer has a shiny new context menu with an option to reopen it as an older, uglier context menu, because Microsoft couldn&#39;t touch a line of code of the old context menu without breaking apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The chromium-only web is not google’s fault. It is a symptom of a body of web standards that has grown wild to the point of being all but unimplementable.Building a browser for the modern standards-based web is effectively impossible, because it costs too much, takes too long, and requires a standing army to keep up with.We are at an impasse. The standards cannot be deprecated because they are used all over the web, and because they are used all over the web a new browser maker has little choice except forking chromium or firefox. Even microsoft couldn’t afford to keep adding all the standards to their browser engine. Normally the solution for a messy overgrown implementation is a grand reboot. But we can’t do a grand reboot of the web because we cannot get rid of the legacy. The only viable strategy I see to have real browser engine diversity without giving up on compatibility is moving as much of the standards implementation as possible into JS modules, so new browser makers can start with a small engine that loads the publicly hosted  standards modules."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article does an incredible job as painting Apple as a dystopian corporation that is strangling the web with forced WebKit, but spends so little time actually refuting the statement &#34;if WebKit weren&#39;t mandated, Chromium would take over&#34;. It pretty much comes down to &#34;if Apple were forced to open their platform, they would spend money improving Safari, and user&#39;s wouldn&#39;t switch because Apple has a gorillian dollars&#34;. The author seems to ignore that Google also has a gorillian dollars, plus the added inertia of Chromium itself, plus the pervasive network of Search and YouTube that would shove ads for Chrome down the throats of users. Money alone, even billions, cannot create a competitive browser engine. Microsoft tried. I&#39;m not sure that, if you actually cared about browser diversity, that forcing Apple to open up iOS and then hoping they don&#39;t mismanage Safari trying to compete with Chrome is a losing bet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, I felt this take was so disconnected from my reality as a user that I didn&#39;t even know where to start.Looking at the author bio, I can see he&#39;s very invested in the Blink project so it&#39;s difficult to shake the feeling that by arguing for &#34;browser diversity&#34;, he&#39;s simply pushing for increased Blink dominance.If one truly wanted to get more diversity in the Browser space, the number one objective should be getting Google to divest from the Chrome project. This would finally create space for other players to come in and have real influence over the future of the web.As it is today, everything Web-related gravitates around what Google wants. Apple is not playing ball, and so Google is getting the community to push regulators to intervene and make them kneel.Well, that&#39;s my view at least, maybe I&#39;m too cynical."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s not just WebKit. Devs can’t extent WebKit very much. Orion is trying but they’ve barely gotten anything done on the iOS extension side. There are limitations on what you can do by linking into the iOS web browser API, it seems.I recently switched to Mac with  great success. So I decided to try out the iPhone. I hadn’t used one for years and I was sick of Android.I’m still no great fan of Android. And so many little things are better on iOS.However, the SINGLE BIGGEST THING is absolutely broken. Browsing on iOS is unusable if you’re used to uBlock Origin. I can run that on Fennec/Firefox. I cannot do so on iOS. I was hoping the content blockers and extensions might come close. They do not in any way.I don’t even REALLY like FF and I don’t like Android but those are the options if I want browsing that doesn’t suck.Or maybe I’m missing something and someone can enlighten me before I return the iPhone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article buried the lede, which I think is this-- Google as email provider had information all along that DMCA notices it was sending to its YouTube property were not legitimate.  Google even went so far as to flag and reject some of those notices because of false personalities, but instead of going to the root cause to stop abuse of its systems it allowed the same user to plug along long enough to manipulate YouTube in a way that caused Bungie an alleged $7.6m in damages.  Then the icing is that when Bungie came knocking Google initially resisted a court-related request to allow Bungie to identify the user and stop the abuse.  Wow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A side note that I found particularly interesting&gt; On March 22, the Reynolds account logged out of Google and less than a second later, the Wiland account logged in, suggesting the same person was behind both accounts.I&#39;ve always wondered how often timing analysis is used in practice by surveillence big tech. I suspect that as people become more privacy aware, and start using VPNs, pseudonames, multiple accounts, etc, that big tech will start using timing analysis more and more to correlate traffic and identify users. Like if your friend sends you a Reddit link on WhatsApp, and you immediately open it in your browser, that Reddit session is now linked to you.Another more complex example: let&#39;s say Google has already identified your Reddit account. You open a Reddit discussion, and deep in the discussion it links to a Youtube video, and you open it in your browser. Now even if you weren&#39;t logged into Youtube, Google could guess that it&#39;s you based on the timing of when your Reddit account opened the discussion, and when the linked Youtube video was accessed. And not just that video, but now every Youtube video watched in the same browsing session, is now linked back to you (assuming you have first-party cookies enabled, which is basically required if you ever want to log into anything).Seems a bit paranoid, but I actually suspect this happened to me a few months ago. I was using a FOSS reddit client and clicked a youtube link buried deep in a reddit thread, and opened it in Newpipe (a FOSS youtube client). I wasn&#39;t logged in, and was using a VPN, and yet the next day on my Youtube feed I started getting recommendations based on that video (and those recommendations were very different from my usual ones). Scary stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My understanding is that if you wanted to hurt a YouTube channel, you could do so like this   1. Use a VPN create a gmail address.
   2. Use that address to file a DMCA notice on each channel video.
   3. Google auto-accepts; the channel challenges each notice.
   4. You deny all challenges.

And just like that, you can destroy any YouTube channel, without any accountability. Is this correct?"</p>

I turned off all electronics for a month and uninstalled the apps and restricted my phone use to calls and responding to 3 close friend&#39;s texts at a set time each day--I didn&#39;t keep it on me at all. No video games, no TV, no watch or music streaming. I had my library of local music loaded to my trusty Zune and used that exclusively for music as the only device I carried with me.I read through the entirety of the Percy Jackson books and the Heroes sequels, the Mortal Instruments, the Seven Realms Novels, and the complete unabridged HHGTG. All it took to get my book-a-day self back was bringing myself back to my teen years when I wasn&#39;t allowed on the computer with access to the internet and my texts cost .3 minutes to read or send and I only got 100/mo. I was averaging roughly 350 pages per day.When I wasn&#39;t reading I was drawing or writing or outside being active when it was cool enough which improved my mental health even in spite of my heat based SAD.At the end of the month I had the attention span when I got back online to attend to a cross country move and secure a job and an apartment by the end of August. I had been intending to move for the 3 years prior.I wonder how I could go about taking advantage of the burst of creativity and focus while still being online enough to develop some of the software ideas I have that I never follow through on without getting overstimulated and distracted."</p>

Stuck in line somewhere? Time for my phone. Waiting in an elevator? The phone. Riding the train? The phone. Going to the bathroom? Make sure to bring the phone! Eating breakfast? The phone.

Anti-societal violence in video games were under constant protest (like the original Grand Theft Auto, or Mortal Kombat), and don&#39;t even think about trying to start a business like Uber or Spotify.New file formats could be immediately crushed by IP concerns. Even web pages posting content about circumventing current systems or linking to sites like that were targeted. If you weren&#39;t a big player, you didn&#39;t have any way to accept money (besides asking people to mail you checks).While tech is seen as too powerful now, I think it&#39;s at least nice that we no longer have the anxiety that plagued any idea or project in the past.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find people are religious about being git cli purists and only interacting with it in this black box (the terminal). On top of that a lot of people stop learning git after add commit push pull branch and merge so concepts like rebasing and cherry picking are scary.
In this day and age we have state of the art GUI tools that change the game and allow git users to see and interact with the state of a git repository in real time. It&#39;s a great way to demystify things like rebasing and interactive rebasing because they show you what&#39;s happening in a modern UI designed specifically for git.
I often suggest git CLI purists to get something like git kraken and just use it as a visual dashboard. Watch what happens when you run git commands. You can see everyone else&#39;s remote branches and have a much better idea of what&#39;s going on than you can without it.  
I&#39;ve worked on teams that just didn&#39;t rebase at all and I think people are oblivious to the mess they make on branches with their chaotic merge strategies.  
These days, I tend to envision the state of the branch that I want and make that happen. It&#39;s so easy to create a new branch before I do anything that if I think something might go south, I just hard reset to my previous state (a branch I created right before the operation)  
Gitkraken also has an undo button that handles all sorts of scenarios and I rarely click it without getting exactly what I expected."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My mental model of a git repo is basically a bramble bush with labels on it.The bramble stems and branches are the commit history (which may join and well as split, unlike a bramble). The labels are stuck to particular bits of the bramble. Some labels are even stuck to other labels!You can move the labels around, and you can glue extra bits of bramble to the tips of what you have. You can even hack about with the bramble, but this is not recommended. Label moving often happens automatically, e.g. when &#39;growing&#39; a bramble tip.It gets interesting when you compare two brambles (e.g. remote and local repos). You might determine that one bramble is identical to another, just with the labels moved. Or one bramble is the same as the other but with extra stems added. Or both brambles had a common ancestor bramble, but now they both have extra stems. Or perhaps they are completely irreconcilable.Better visualisation tooling would help."</p>

So my father decided to set me homework of his own devising, which on one occasion was reading Flowers for Algernon.I was moved by the story of a man who had little natural ability, straining to make the best of what he had. Then becoming smarter than everyone around him, and then what follows.There&#39;s many things to take from this story. I took away that we should make the best of what we have.

With old age, we, too, will lose our intelligence.  If we value intelligence, in and of itself, we’ll eventually face a crisis of sorts.  But, if we value making the most of our intelligence, we are resilient.Applying this framework to Charlie, there’s much less to be sad about.

I&#39;m interested in corporate governance and learning Roberts Rules of Order definitely helps.I&#39;m also a certified farmer (yeah its a thing), I have 5 sailing certs, 3 scuba certs, Wilderness Emergency Medical Responder cert, working on my pilots license, getting my real estate sales license, ham radio operator general class, almost done with my CDL, there&#39;s lots more I&#39;d have to check my notes on.I do want to get a Kubernetes cert done this year. Long term I want to knock out my CPA/CFA exams, but those are a huge commitment so we will see if it pans out.Most of this response hasn&#39;t answered your question at all, because certs really are mostly useless. Still fun to collect.I&#39;d imagine financial certs would be the most useful (CFA in particular).If anyone knows any other fun certs let me know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This will not apply to all companies, but for our hiring decisions certs have an adverse effect. If someone puts many certifications on their resume my expectations are lower and I likely won&#39;t consider them for interviews. It&#39;s a negative signal in my experience. Your time is better spent working on side projects, contributing to open source, writing a blog, etc. I.e. do real-world stuff instead of wasting time on artificial tests that require memorization and exist largely as a revenue stream for certification providers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"MCSE really helped me.In the late 90s, 98 I think, I worked for an internet startup that didn’t end up being huge. We were on Novell and a bit if solaris and had just launched a product that used windows nt and server side activex.I was a college dropout web dev/web master making $50k. They had a hard time hiring devs who knew nt and could design and automate server farms. I learned on the job and did an ok job running it. But they wouldn’t promote me because I was really young and didn’t have a degree.I went to a Microsoft conference and would buy a study book each day and take the test there. I did 3 exams during the conference and took the other three when I got home and with all 6 certs got my Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (with a stamp of bill gates’ signature).They gave me a raise to $60k (and the college grads went from 50-55). I then got $70k six months later and $80k six months after that as I was the “certified person.”I always thought it was funny that I did the same job before and after the certs. The Networking cert was really useful and I still remember how to do subnets and dns and dhcp and stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anecdata: exercise massively reduces my otherwise constant craving for processed sugars, deep fried and smoked or cured things, alcohol and smokes.I&#39;m not less hungry, but I&#39;m less hungry for nasty stuff, so from my perspective there seems to be a lot of truth in this!Context: I&#39;m natively extremely lazy (phisically, not intellectually), I find any phisical activity a pain an a nuisance, I derive zero pleasure from any kind of sport and phyisical exercise (except hiking and skidiving, but not the phisical effort aspects of them), the release-endorphines-on-effort circuit is 100% broken for me or I just lack the receptors for those endophins... eg. 100%-lazy-cat except not fat because genetically I come from a line of people slim-no-matter-what-we-eat. (Probably more average or atletic people&#39;s bodies just don&#39;t work like mine...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Although this is my guess based on experience, I think said anti-hunger effect can be had without intense exercise.  I&#39;ve noticed consistently that walking has an anti-hunger effect.  Walking does take more time than running, but it doesn&#39;t really register as stress to the body in the same way that running and other forms of cardio do, meaning a lower cortisol response.  Maybe it&#39;s not as strong an effect as with something like running, but I think it&#39;s worth observing and considering.  In weighing the pros and cons, I think that walking is better in terms of longevity.  Cortisol and stress on joints are things you don&#39;t really want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article mentions that a substance (lactose-phenylalanine) appears
after exercise in several animal studies. There&#39;s a suggestion of a
strong connection of this to reduced appetite. But this isn&#39;t
explained and more importantly there&#39;s no hypothesised mechanism. Why
would it be a metabolic advantage to reduce hunger after exertion?
Maybe it creates a buffer-period. Otherwise, common sense/intuition
would say we feel hungrier after exercise. What gives?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll be the begrudging devils advocate for a decision that is sure to have devastating consequences for poor women in red states.It is good for unelected bodies like the Supreme Court to allow such dividing issues be figured out democratically. The US house has bled power to the other 3 institutions and of them, the judiciary is the least democratic. Ofc, my support for this change assumes that this Supreme Court will show restraint towards political activism (in either direction) in general. Call it naive, but I&#39;ll wait and see.States rights has always been a double edged sword. You can&#39;t have your cake and eat it too. The same state rights that allow gun control and homosexuality to be locally legalized before national concensus; also now lead to abortion legislation being a state issue.The sad part of democracy is that it aims to represent the views of the voting majority. If the voting majority truly cares about access to abortion then we will hopefully see enough democratic traction to give them the mandate needed. Now, the rural republican votes counting for more in the senate is a huge issue and threat to democracy that the US needs to figure out if it ever wants to represent the views of the people. But, the Supreme Court should not be responsible for managing dysfunction in other branches of govt.My personal opinion is that polarization has pushed both sides to be completely antagonistic towards each other. &#39;Own the libs, fuck the deplorables&#39;, no compromise. The jaded side of me says: vote in more moderates that are willing to strike compromises. Crazed jesus Republicans and hyperprogressive activists are terrible people to put into national office. They gain power by antagonizing and being unhelpful roadblocks for change, all while asking for the most stubbornly impossible outcomes.In the long run, history will have a dim view of this era of global polarization with all political sides to blame."</p>

Now that same hurdle can become risking prison.A few years later, we were blessed with a child who is doing well. I would have neither if not for Roe v. Wade.This isn&#39;t about abortion, it&#39;s about denying healthcare!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Before anyone writes a eulogy based on the headline, note the following:So it’s sad, but also awesome in its own way, that 2022 will see the end of Zachtronics. Not because their publisher shuttered them, or because their venture capital funding ran out, or because Activision made them work on Call of Duty, or any other number of reasons (bankruptcy! scandal!) game developers usually close their doors.No, Zachtronics is closing because...they want to.“We’re wrapping things up!” Barth tells me, way more enthusiastically than you would normally expect under these circumstances. “Zachtronics will release Last Call BBS next month. We’re also working on a long-awaited solitaire collection that we’re hoping to have out by the end of the year. After that, the team will disband. We all have different ideas, interests, tolerances for risk, and so on, so we’re still figuring out what we want to do next.”I play games too infrequently to invest the necessary bandwidth into a Zachtronic game, but I read some of ZACH-LIKE and always respected the philosophy. As long as no one is getting the rug pulled, this sounds like an awesome way to go and an awesome thing for the gaming industry. Hopefully this means more smart indie gems in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve found it difficult after starting to work full-time to fully enjoy Zachtronics games, since they use much of the same parts of my brain as my day job, but the sheer joy I got out of Zach&#39;s earlier games (SpaceChem, KOHCTPYKTOP, Codex of Alchemical Engineering) contributed a lot to my decision to work in software. I&#39;ve experienced little else that scratches the &#34;design itch&#34; in such a pure and thoughtful way, whether games from other developers or actual software development."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Zachtronics leaving game development is such a blow to the industry. Zach is directly and indirectly responsible for a lot of games we see today. His game Infiniminer was a major inspiration for Minecraft, he published a game that was also a book explaining his philosophy on puzzle design, and his games were genuinely fun with no BS."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is Alina Chan, one of the co-authors of Viral: The Search for the Origin of Covid-19.I’m going to answer some of the questions that have come up in the comments.1. Are Chan and Ridley selling a book?Yes, the updated paperback comes out in the US next week: https://www.harpercollins.com/products/viral-matt-ridleyalin...The updated epilogue now discusses three significant new developments since the publication of the hardback that are being hotly debated in the comments here. The first was the discovery of a virus in a bat in Laos that is slightly more similar to SARS-CoV-2 than the virus studied at the Wuhan Institute of Virology; but both are still not the progenitor of the pandemic. The second is detailed information about how prominent western virologists, who had privately thought the virus was likely manipulated in a laboratory, began to instead tell the public that no lab-based scenario was plausible. The third is a trio of conflicting studies about whether the Huanan seafood market was the site of a natural spillover of the virus from animals to people or just the site of a human superspreader event in December 2019.As with the hardcover, half of our earnings from the book have gone/will go to charity.2. Does the available evidence lean towards a market origin?Some experts have asserted that there is dispositive evidence that the virus jumped from animals to people at the Wuhan Huanan market. However, their analysis failed to take into account the realities in the early days of the pandemic. Without access to the methodology and actual data collected by investigators in Wuhan, their interpretation unfortunately falls prey to ascertainment bias. Please see this thread for details: https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/1499794942012579843At the moment, US intelligence, the WHO SAGO advisory group, and many top virologists and experts find both natural and lab origin hypotheses plausible and deserving of investigation. The evidence does not lean so strongly towards one hypothesis or the other that we can assume one as the default truth.I personally think the available evidence points towards a lab origin but would not go as far as to say that there is dispositive evidence of it. 
Please see these 2 threads:
https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/1524394197738049537
https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/15397457368076165133. Can scientists manipulate and genetically engineer naturally found viruses without leaving a trace? In other words, can the genome of the virus tell us its recent history?We describe the seamless genetic engineering capabilities developed in the years leading up to the pandemic in VIRAL. Due to advanced technologies, it is no longer always possible to use the genome of a virus to distinguish between a natural pathogen vs one that has spent time in a laboratory. Even top coronavirologists, including Ralph Baric who collaborated with the Wuhan scientists, have said that the only way to know is to look at the Wuhan lab records. You can also read my twitter thread: https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/1493733086089121794Even the presence of the furin cleavage site insertion that is unique to the pandemic virus and is indeed what makes it a highly infectious pandemic virus is not “dispositive evidence” of either a natural or lab origin. Please see our peer-reviewed analysis here: https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/39/1/msab327/64260854. Why does the lab leak hypothesis encompass so many different scenarios by which research activities could lead to the emergence of the pandemic virus?A natural spillover hypothesis also encompasses several different scenarios, e.g., bat direct transmission to people in natural habitats, bat to people in markets, bat to farmed animals or wildlife to people in nature, at farms or market, etc.This doesn’t mean that a natural or lab origin are insinuations. It just means we are lacking so much key evidence that it’s not possible to pin down an exact mechanism by which the virus emerged in the Wuhan human population.5. Does finding close relatives of the pandemic virus in bats, e.g., in Laos, mean that its origin is natural?No, because viruses that escape from labs were also ultimately derived from nature and we know that scientists in Wuhan had been collecting viruses from across 8 countries (China and SE Asia) where the closest relatives to the pandemic virus have been found. Please see the graphic in this tweet: https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/15221172706124513356. Is there anything to do about finding the origin of Covid-19 now? Isn’t it a dead end? And is that why interest is waning?There is plenty to do to investigate the origin of Covid-19 using sources and data that exist outside of China. Please see a recent peer-reviewed letter in PNAS: https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2202769119And my thread on it: https://twitter.com/Ayjchan/status/1527381169729425410It is very surprising to me that these feasible routes of inquiry have not been explored more than 2 years into the pandemic.7. Have infected animals on sale at the Huanan market been found? Was there any evidence that SARS-like viruses were circulating in the Wuhan animal trading community before the emergence of Covid-19?No. I recommend reading my medium post for more details: https://ayjchan.medium.com/a-response-to-the-origins-of-sars...8. Regardless of the origin of Covid-19, shouldn’t the focus be on making sure there is more oversight and regulation of current and future pathogen research?I agree and wish that we didn’t need to prove the origin of this pandemic to motivate scientific leaders to better regulate risky pathogen work. I have been dedicating efforts to this cause since last year and hope to be able to share some exciting news later this year."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For those with a bit more background in the sciences, there&#39;s an increasingly massive amount of evidence to support Zoonotic origin.  Philipp Markolin has a good rundown:https://protagonistfuture.substack.com/p/natures-neglected-g...Most of the &#34;evidence&#34; for lab leak is just weird insinuation -- it&#39;s increasingly hard to pin down what the advocates for that position are even arguing (e.g. whether it&#39;s a natural virus that escaped or an engineered one, how different lineages showed up at the market, which lab it allegedly escaped from since the WIV campus is much further from the market compared to the CCDC, etc etc).China is a bad actor and definitely contributed to the conspiracy madness around the virus by being so shut-down and performing such a half-assed investigation but unfortunately they would have done the same whether the virus came to be via the same animal trade that caused the last SARS outbreak or if there was some secret Wuhan project."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think understanding the origin is important, but I also understand why it wasn&#39;t a media fixation during the pandemic itself.1) Understanding the origin doesn&#39;t change the consequences or response to the pandemic2) Unlike the nuclear analogy in the article, pandemic virus outbreaks happen naturally, and fairly frequently. Combined with the huge increase in global travel, when one does happen it can be around the world in every airport before anyone has even identified it.So in the big picture this type of outbreak seems inevitable, not anomalous or inherently preventable.Understanding the origin, either by cross-species origination or a laboratory containment breach, is indeed important and significant and should be pursued, but I also understand why the search for that answer isn&#39;t at the top of the 24-hour news cycle."</p>

Otherwise account takeovers become trivial.The article&#39;s attack is relatively benign - the user simply goes to a website. Sure they may end up putting info in that website, but probably not. Plus existing systems for malicious website filtering can kick in to prevent this.The more concerning attack is the social engineering one where a third party says something like &#34;let me &#39;verify&#39; your identity, I&#39;ll send you a number tell me what it is&#34; then triggers an identity verification request on the domain (this can be done either manually or part of a sign up flow for some honeypot service).

This is how the idea for Plausible was born.Surely they must have looked around and seen that there were already quite a few products doing privacy-first analytics? But yet they started anyway? And had success even though their marketing doesn&#39;t really state any reasons why the user should use them not the many other privacy-first analytics offerings out there?I mean I&#39;m happy for them that they&#39;re successful, but I think there must be more to it than alluded to in this blog post, both in (a) the decision to start in the face of lots of competition and (b) success despite not trying to differentiate themselves from the competition."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I might be abusing the term here, but Plausible seems like the best example of a mittelstand[1] that sells SaaS.They are not beholden to VC investors and can grow slowly, organically. According to this article, they were able to cover their costs by January 2021. By keeping their team small, they can remain sustainable for a long time and refine their product.The biggest challenge for growth right now seems to be that customer support costs will scale linearly with growth.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31327219"</p>

Crypto providers operating in or from the Netherlands also needed to apply for registration with the Dutch Central Bank (DNB). Besides the AMLD5 implementation DNB required from crypto providers to implement additional measures, which is the same wallet verification that Coinbase now requires.Bitonic (a dutch crypto broker/provider) filed a lawsuit against DNB regarding the additional wallet verification requirement, which was not part of AMLD5. DNB formally acknowledged the complaints from Bitonic and revoked the wallet verification.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is the future of databases, but nobody seems to realize it yet.One of the biggest problems with databases (particularly SQL ones) is they&#39;re a giant pile of mutable state. The whole idea of &#34;migrations&#34; exists because it is impossible to &#34;just&#34; revert any arbitrary change to a database, diff changes automatically, merge changes automatically. You need some kind of intelligent tool or framework to generate DDL, DML, DCL, they have to be applied in turn, something has to check if they&#39;ve already been applied, etc. And of course you can&#39;t roll back a change once it&#39;s been applied, unless you create even more program logic to figure out how to do that. It&#39;s all a big hack.By treating a database as version-controlled, you can treat any operation as immutable. Make any change you want and don&#39;t worry about conflicts. You can always just go back to the last working version, revert a specific change, merge in one or more changes from different working databases. Make a thousand changes a day, and when one breaks, revert it. No snapshotting and slowly restoring the whole database due to a non-reversible change. Somebody dropped the main table in prod? Just revert the drop. Need to make a change to the prod database but the staging database is different? Branch the prod database, make a change, test it, merge back into prod.The effect is going to be as radical as the popularization of containers. Whether you like them or not, they are revolutionizing an industry and are a productivity force multiplier."</p>

I came across it at a really good time in my computer science self education. It helped me learn about some essential data structures and algorithmic analysis. The video lectures interspersed in the text augment the text and vice versa. The sections without videos were tougher for me to digest, but are written clearly and bear revisiting and study. If you, like me, are looking for a good next step after Grossman’s PL MOOC, I recommend spending some time with this incredible free resource."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I found my experience trying to work with a large OCaml base a nightmare — when signatures changed in an unstable dependency (e.g. function argument removed and nested inside another), the errors spat out by the typechecker were utterly incomphrehensible.This was largely due to automatic currying in OCaml — if I have a function call &#34;some_function arg1 arg2&#34; and &#34;some_function&#34; adds a third argument, that call becomes a function that requires a single argument, arg3, but the typechecker message that tells you all of this is well-nigh unintelligible.Switching to Rust was a blessed relief, not least because Rust has much better developer tooling and documentation (but also no automatic currying).It made me think that OCaml is efficient and beautiful if you&#39;re the only person touching your specific codebase (which I think is true in the vast majority of cases) or if many of your colleagues are deep OCaml officionados with PhDs, but it&#39;s not a good collaborative language for the rest of us."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"All these things are related.  Back in the 1990s I worked with others to develop DSL technologies (ADSL, HDSL, VDSL) for telcos.  Why not fiber, some ask?  oh, fiber materials may be sand, but installed fiber is sand, energy, and labor.  Installation costs trump everything - use what you have for the physical medium.While we (PairGain) also made point-to-point private links, it was clear then, and even moreso now that most DSL involves a service provider managing the network - with specialized skills, practices and setup.In the 2010&#39;s I was spending time with the Ethernet folks, and in particular industrial folks with large plants.  I ended up chairing IEEE Std 802.3cg which developed the 10 Mb/s 1km technology.  Not really a speed increase - more an application refocus.  As the networking world developed, many realized that converging networks above the physical layer added network complexity and therefore setup and ongoing operating costs...  So we now also have SPE - pure Ethernet at DSL-like distances...Similar tech with different use models, enabling connectivity for whatever...I&#39;m not Al Gore - I won&#39;t claim to have invented the internet.  I just an engineer who happened to have a hand in both of these technologies, and am still pleased to see that people use them."</p>

In fact they end up selling your code back to yourself if you plan to use the service.If the answer is no, that moves the needle pretty far in the direction where I&#39;d at least consider the idea of moving all of my repos to Gitlab. I don&#39;t care much about stars or popularity. I open source things that are interesting and useful to me and if other folks want to use it they can but I don&#39;t gain motivation from others using the projects I release. I like Github and its UI and it&#39;s no doubt &#34;the spot&#34; for open source but selling code written by others rubs me the wrong way a lot. It stinks because it also means no longer contributing to other code bases too. It&#39;s moving us in the opposite direction of what open source is about."</p>

Stop getting into a frenzy of arousal about the police kicking down doors to drag Billy Gates to jail because 80 characters of fast square root is theft but 79 isn&#39;t.Where on earth is the ambition and vision!? Knowledge is public domain. A commons of knowledge is a public good. The cost of code copying is zero.Sure in our day job we have to pretend to care about this stuff. But when did the ideological scope of what can be achieved become rules lawyering over license text.Copy my MIT licensed code without attribution? I don&#39;t give a shit, go ahead, I hope it helps, in fact I want a truly public domain license but copyright law is so hostage to corporate interests no such thing exists in many countries.Free the code."</p>

        pass

In Python, this will be compiled into: a call to range(), heap allocation of an Iterable, calling getIterator() on an Iterable (which might also do allocation), calling next() on an Iterator while catching for StopIteration exception (and calls are often slow in interpreted languages). While in C we could just have a loop without any calls.I remember how I had to use a Dart-based web application (compiled to JS) in one of Google&#39;s advertising products. The script weighed around several megabytes and everything was so slow. Furthermore, there also was a small and useless &#34;what&#39;s new&#34; applet, and it probably was shipped with a separate copy of Dart runtime because it weighed several megabytes too. Obviously this was a product intended to be used only on latest MacBooks, not on a Windows XP laptop.It is totally fine to write such application for youself, or maybe for internal use, but if you are a corporation with millions of users, I think you should pay a little attention to performance and choose a better technology. Or, if you are of a Google scale, find a way to optimize the code."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  &gt; But there is another aspect of the language that makes it so desirable from his standpoint: it can be extended with binary extensions that use an API that is written in C, but can be accessed from other languages. He likens Python to &#34;a Honda Civic with mounting bolts for a warp drive&#34;. So the language can be picked up by kids who can then pop open the trunk &#34;and bolt on warp nacelles&#34; that allows the code to run faster than C or C++ in some cases, Wang said.
  &gt; 
  &gt; That aspect is sometimes overlooked, but it means that Python can be used in ways that other, similar languages cannot. &#34;It&#39;s not just like Node, it&#39;s not just an alternative to Ruby&#34;.

Both node and Ruby have a comprehensive C API, this is a very common language feature since binding to native libraries is unavoidable. Is there actually anything different about python here?https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I like Rust and I&#39;d love to see it in the Linux kernel, but not before the GCC+Rust issues are all fixed. You shouldn&#39;t need non-GCC compilers to compile Linux and from what I can tell there isn&#39;t any GCC Rust compiler that&#39;s fully equivalent to the standard Rust compiler just yet.They say that Rust support is optional, but when the first big driver gets written in Rust it&#39;ll become mandatory. So either the Rust integration will fail and nothing important will get written in it, or it won&#39;t be optional. I&#39;m not sure what comfort that&#39;s supposed to bring."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"EDIT: It is very bit unfortunate that my general/off-topic comment is currently the most upvoted. I was not commenting on the Linux integration specifically. I&#39;m a _novice and hobbyist_ when it comes to Rust.For example this comment https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31849071 is much more interesting and on topic.---I want to provoke a little bit, but I&#39;m genuinely curious about the following:I feel like the Rust ecosystem is still quite immature in a lot of areas. Just a few indicators to illustrate what I mean:- Both async/await and the question mark operator feel like rushed implementations, neither seem like the best long term solutions for Rust and are not in line with the otherwise solid foundation of the language.- Open source code examples sometimes use an array of external dependencies that are unrelated to a given project and feel arbitrary. This reminds me of the JS ecosystem.- Some projects pride themselves to not use &#34;unsafe&#34; code, including linking with battle tested C code, which seems like an arbitrary restriction that sounds better than it actually is. There is even an open source maintainer that got mobbed out from his own project because he used &#34;unsafe&#34; in places that others didn&#39;t agree with.- Rust is fashionable. Putting &#34;Rust&#34; next to a HN title immediately gets clicks and upvotes. SO surveys and similar report high interest in the language. This is not an inherently bad thing, quite the opposite. But as a secondary effect it might detract from objective, technical decision making.I really like the language, I have _way_ more good things to say about it than bad things. But am I alone in feeling like this? Other modern language communities come with a philosophy that promotes stability and simplicity. Is the Rust community riding on the merits of Rust&#39;s unique value proposition, while forgetting some important fundamentals?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is my humble opinion, but kernel shouldn&#39;t be a place for language diversity. Even code comments should be standardized for such critical and complex project with so many participants."</p>

I set up yacy[1] on a personal, internal server at my home, which I can access from all my devices, since they are always on my wireguard vpn.Yacy is actually a distributed search engine, but I run in &#39;Robinson mode&#39; as a private peer, to keep it isolated, as I just want a personal search of only sites I have indexed.Anytime I come across something of interest, I index it with yacy, using a a depth of 0 (since I only want to index that one page, not the whole site). This way, I can just go to my search site, and search for something, and anything related that I&#39;ve indexed before pops up. I found this works way better than trying to manage bookmarks with descriptions and tags.Also, yacy will keep a cache of the content which is great if the site ever goes offline or changes.If I need to browse, I can go use yacy&#39;s admin tools to see all the urls I have indexed.I have been using this for several months and I am using this way more than I ever used my bookmarks.[1] https://yacy.net/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have tried many different solutions the last two decades, but none of of them really stuck or became useful over time. I kinda gave up and as a last ditch effort started to do the simplest thing I could think of: ctrl+D to add bookmarks in Firefox, jotting down a few keywords on each entry. No folders, no structure, just a flat list and some keywords.A few months in I noticed how powerful this simple system was. When talking with someone else about a tool, github-repo or article I had seen but did no remember the name or title of, finding it back was suddenly a breeze. Since I keep my desktop and mobile bookmarks in sync, it it just a matter of typing in a keword in the address bar in firefox and it shows up instantly!On desktop, you can limit the search to bookmarks only by starting with a *, which is helpful to avoid browser history etc.I have really low bar for adding a bookmark now as the mental overhead is so low and it is done notime.

And he’s being proven right at an alarming pace this year.So far this year we’ve had:- A land war in Europe- Food insecurity in the developing world- Breakdown of supply chains and shipping routes- Nation states resorting to seizing each other’s ships (see Greece-Iran issue recently).Everything that he had talked about in the past and in his latest book.The thing about Zeihan’s arguments is that you can’t really argue against demographics. You can procure any resource from any part of the world, but if you want an 18 year old to consume or work or fight, you HAVE to wait 18 years. Or import them from elsewhere - which causes all sorts of cultural and societal conflicts."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting to combine this line of thinking with the transition from nation-states to market-states:https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1744057060106386...The power vacuum that&#39;s arisen from populism &amp; isolationism is about to create a gigantic untapped market for firms that provide the services of a state - defense, dispute resolution, and currency - for a fee, to gigantic multinational corporations.  At the same time, there are nascent technologies (drones and robotics for defense, blockchain and the Internet for dispute resolution &amp; currency) that dramatically lower the cost of many of these services, to the point where we may see private companies that are more effective than nation-states at it.  Might we see the nation-state get replaced by a web of competing mercenaries, each of which effectively serves as a protection racket for their customers?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Haven&#39;t read the book, but for those who don&#39;t know who Zeihan is, his work follows two threads of post-WWII history:1. Deglobalization; and2. DepopulationThe article focuses mostly on deglobalization, but depopulation is in the horse pulling the cart.Many are familiar with the deglobalization idea from the last US presidential administration. The current administration kept those tariffs, and abided by the previous commitment to exit Afghanistan. Zeihan argues that this trend toward increasing isolationism goes back decades.What may seem less familiar is the demographic implosion the entire world is undergoing - a baby bust. The vast majority of major countries with the exception of the US and Mexico have passed a point of no return demographically. Their populations will shrink with mathematical certainty. As their populations ebb, so will their economic growth prospects and place on the world stage. The problem is especially pronounced in Asia and Europe, but can be found everywhere.The reason for the bust: people moved to cities. On a farm, kids are free labor. In a city, kids are expensive conversational pieces."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was half my age, OBS was unfathomable. I was shooting video on digital 8, editing in Final Cut Pro 4 which was the new hotness, and trying but failing to use DSS on my college network. Actual streaming at scale required a massive server and a massive license from RealNetworks. If I wanted to do anything with animation, it was all $$$$$ software. This all took place in a shared lab at my college with stuff I could never afford on my own.Today, people at that age are making lucrative careers out of streaming then doing the things they love out of their bedrooms using OBS. Blender has enabled all kinds of amazing creators, from animation to video editing to 3D printing and even (basic) architecture. Kicad makes EDA! approachable.  My teen son has been able to dabble in all of the above in his spare time without spending a dime.I’m in awe of the power of free software and the amazing engineering work that has enabled these projects to be good enough for real professionals to choose first. I hope we see Godot achieve world domination in gaming,  GIMP in graphics, and Libra Office + Collabra in productivity. The people who have given us these tools deserve the highest accolades."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m one of the authors of this. Happy to answer any questions.One of the fun technical details is that, when enabled on a machine (tailscale up --ssh), the userspace tailscaled process takes over all TCP port 22 packets after the WireGuard decryption and doesn&#39;t even feed them into the kernel over TUN. We use gVisor&#39;s netstack to handle the TCP connections in-process.So it doesn&#39;t matter whether you have other processes (or iptables rules, etc) that would prevent the Tailscale SSH server from binding to port 22. This lets people gradually use Tailscale SSH over time without messing with their system one.The Tailscale SSH server currently only runs on Linux but there&#39;s support in git main for macOS too but it&#39;s not super well tested yet and not included in the sandboxed GUI builds currently."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been having trouble adopting Tailscale. As so many others say, relying on another identity provider is unfortunate - I, too, worry what happens when Google decides to lock me out because some algorithm decided my account is fishy.The biggest blocker has been the issues with the Android client. I&#39;m either hitting https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/915 or https://github.com/tailscale/tailscale/issues/4611, but neither issue appears to have a fix coming soon. Whenever I am on my carrier&#39;s network, my phone&#39;s internet stops until I disable Tailscale - that&#39;s just a show stopper from using TailScale.So instead of developing this SSH feature, I would have preferred to seen them work on their bug backlog.In the meantime, I&#39;m experimenting with ZeroTier. While it doesn&#39;t have the ease and cool magicDNS+LetsEncrypt feature, I think I&#39;ll survive with something more reliable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very interested in Tailscale for both personal and business use-cases, but I&#39;m rather put off by the stark centralization of offered identity providers: Microsoft, Github (Microsoft), Google, okta (?).

Had already read many glowing reviews then, but was not sure if the choice of language (Java) for the first half of the book would be a hindrance (it&#39;s not the stack I am most familiar with).Decided to buy it anyway, primarily because the two implementations of the toy language piqued my interest (most other books only go through one implementation).Boy was I glad I did.Writing is superb, end-of-chapter challenges are instructive, code samples are meticulously and beautifully done. Here and there I also encountered references to other languages (e.g. had a brief detour to Lua internals [1], thanks to a side note), which I have enjoyed too.Went through the first half twice: first using Java as it is written and then secondly implemented the interpreter in Rust (my initial fear turned out to be unfounded).

We need more hands on, code first books that take you through 1-2 extended projects where you can type along and get working code at the end. These books should have CS theory, but still be fundamentally focused on implementation. It&#39;d be really fun to have one of these for a more functional compiler (type checking, code generation, optimization), for a language service (query based compilation, concrete syntax trees, language server protocol), for databases, operating systems, and so on. Ideally they&#39;d be a cross between an O&#39;Reilly book and a SerenityOS stream"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My reaction to this is that it&#39;s an effort to keep users within the &#34;walled garden&#34; of Twitter, which is not the best thing for those that write.Recall the story with Medium - yes, you get broader reach with less effort, but at the cost of giving up control of your content.I know that I am talking with an overly developer-focused lens (a-la &#34;you can reimplement Dropbox in a weekend&#34;), but self-hosting blogs outside the &#34;walled gardens&#34; is not super complicated even for non-power users. Ghost has existed for years and is a very user-friendly experience. Want to be a bit more technical - go the static site route.It might be a lost battle to convince the majority of the social media audience of this (after all, can&#39;t beat the convenience and the cost of $0), but I really do not see this as beneficial to those that deeply care about their long-form writing accessibility and sustainability.Twitter already has login walls to just read tweets, so I&#39;d imagine the same is likely to apply to long-form content as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it&#39;s all well and good to launch new features, I think Twitter should improve their existing service and I&#39;m referring to low hanging fruits.I don&#39;t understand the rationale behind cutting me off while I&#39;m scrolling through Twitter simply because I&#39;m not logged in. Twitter can still display Ads to me irrespective of whether I&#39;m logged in or not. In fact cutting me off means I leave Twitter which means I don&#39;t see the Ads they&#39;re selling which in turn means less Ad money for them.Even when logged in, Twitter will display the new message/note icon. When I click on it to read the notification, it turns out to be Twitter telling me to turn on notifications. Now normally, once you have read the message, the &#39;new&#39; message/note icon is cleared. Instead Twitter displays it again almost immediately and this then goes on for the next few hours before they stop.If they can&#39;t fix these simple things, why would someone want to read longer content on Twitter. They would still get cut off again as Twitter is doing for existing tweets"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I welcome this. I always hated the long multi-tweet essays and have often just given up on reading them, especially when I&#39;m not logged in I can&#39;t even make it to the end before twitter blocks me from scrolling further.As of now it doesn&#39;t look like you can reply to a note with another note?

People spend a lot of time discussing the chronic youth issues but the reality is that Juul never wanted to sell to youths or anything of the sort — they were just _so_ incompetent at operations that they couldn&#39;t do anything.They set fire to hundreds of millions of dollars on totally ridiculous projects plainly stupid ideas:* A modular supply chain project with the idea that they could use manufacturing as a carrot for regulatory laws — this team was 50-100 people and had tens of millions of dollars in budget. Never did anything.* All manner of vanity innovation projects: new battery technology, next and next and next generation projects, dozens of flavours, absurd marketing campaigns, rebrands, a $250k custom typeface, the list goes on.* Hired McKinsey and Bain because the executive team (who were all ex-management consultants) wanted the company to move fast ....* My personal favourite Juul story (ok I have a bunch) was that the company was so incompetent they didn&#39;t do headcount planning — You could just hire as many people as you wanted if your random (often incompetent) VP was okay with it. Juul had 50-100 VPs so it was sheer chaos.It got so bad that Altria had to step in and install their own CEO and axe all of the existing executive team (and lay off thousands of random employees) to try and right the ship. Altria are a very legit operational business — you may not like them but they know how to work with the FDA within strict regulation guidelines. If Juul is removed from the market despite Altria taking over they&#39;re truly fucked.In my time at Juul I have never worked with so many incompetent people. 
It was quite impressive but also incredibly depressing as someone that joined because the idea of creating a connected device vaping product to help switch Americans off combustible cigarettes was very compelling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I managed to give up fags over four years ago after 30 odd years of smoking around 20+ a day.  I&#39;m still quite surprised that I managed it but in retrospect I did a mental job on myself - you have to be hard but in the end it wasn&#39;t quite as bad as I thought it would be.  If I can, you can but you need to find your strategy.Initially I thought that I&#39;d transition to e-fags and climb down from there.  Nope.  You are trading one habit with another - it doesn&#39;t matter if a e-fag cloud is better for you it is still not good and keeps you tethered to smoking.  I think it would be quite easy to go back to tobacco if you &#34;allow&#34; yourself to vape as a transition.I rapidly realised that once I started down the abstinence route I had to be very hard with myself.  It wasn&#39;t actually that bad in the end.  I came up with two mantras that I repeated to myself in my head whenever I really wanted to smoke:  they were - &#34;I don&#39;t want to smell&#34; and &#34;I don&#39;t want to die&#34;.  They are pretty self explanatory.I did and sometimes still have dreams about smoking.  It is a very insidious habit.  I was a smoker for 30 years so it is obviously still a part of my life at age 52 but it is fading and I rarely have to say my mantras these days.I had another strategy too, which helped in the short term:  I started my give up, in the early afternoon of day one (Easter 2018 as it turns out) and had a very long lie in on day two.  That got me to over 24 hours with minimal stress.  I then progressed to a series of time based targets:A day (tick), two days ... a week ... two weeks ... (tried a drag on daughter in law&#39;s fag - no thanks) ... a month ... two months (weird dreams) ... six months ... etc ... four years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The worst thing about this was that openoffice was starting to get some name recognition before oracle killed it, and this whole debacle intentionally or unintentionally turned that name recognition into a weapon against LibreOffice.Ideally they should have given LibreOffice the OpenOffice name, but even if they had just said &#34;openoffice is dead&#34; then it would have been easy for people to find libreoffice.Unfortunately, by taking over the OpenOffice name and absolutely refusing to admit that development has ceased, Apache has caused tons of confusion that has massively harmed libreoffice, because for years people who had heard about &#34;openoffice&#34; would see the terrible, out of date, insecure pile of junk being distributed by the Apache Foundation and not realize that the actively developed LibreOffice was available.In the case of linux distributions it was less of an issue since they just switched to LibreOffice, but I wouldn&#39;t be suprised if there are windows users who are still downloading OpenOffice (and possibly taking one look at it and giving up and switching to Office 365).Apache should have killed OpenOffice years ago but at the very least they should take it down and honestly apologize for fucking this up so badly.Even ignoring the harm to LibreOffice it&#39;s just irresponsible for Apache to keep distributing OpenOffice when they can&#39;t even make new releases to simply apply security patches for years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The mark of a good open source maintainer is the ability to, when your personal interest wanes, find a new maintainer and hand over.I&#39;ve done this several times, and certainly development went on much slower than before, but them&#39;s the breaks. At least I did the right thing.For such a big organization, with so many open source projects under its big wing, Apache has failed on this mark of maintainership completely. It failed so badly that at this stage, deploying Apache-maintained software for a customer or employer is downright irresponsible.Would you organize all your company&#39;s internal communications around Google&#39;s latest messaging thing? That&#39;s insane, you know it&#39;ll bite you in the ass in a few years time when it gets cancelled. Apache is no better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be honest I never understood why Apache even started in the first place. By that time the LibreOffice fork was well underway."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This stifling of competing ideas, say a growing number of scholars, is a big reason why there is no treatment for Alzheimer’s. (The four approved drugs have no effect on the disease, providing only a temporary memory boost.)Those who championed the amyloid hypothesis truly believed it, and thought that focusing money and attention on it rather than competing ideas was the surest way to an effective drug.Or maybe the real problem is the excess emphasis on finding a drug in specific that can be commercially monetized. A single drug for a single cause of what is likely a complex process.Amyloid and another protein (tau) accumulate in the brain due to sleep deprivation.  Helping people get a good night&#39;s sleep -- without drugs -- would likely help, if only to stave it off in those at risk.The problem is it won&#39;t create any razzle dazzle &#34;unicorn&#34; companies and newly-minted zillionaires.One of the researchers in the article found that herpes simplex infection promotes the accumulation of amyloid. Her research was not irrelevant to the amyloid hypothesis.  It was only irrelevant to an agenda to find a drug to treat amyloid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"FTA, contradicting the headline (emphasis mine):&gt; Despite being described as a “cabal,” the amyloid camp was neither organized nor nefarious. Those who championed the amyloid hypothesis truly believed it, and thought that focusing money and attention on it rather than competing ideas was the surest way to an effective drug.This discrepancy indicates part of the problem: the investigators narrowing the search for causes honestly believe in what they&#39;re doing.The NIH review panelists really believe they&#39;re safeguarding the NIH budget, and the Pharma execs really believe they&#39;re wisely allocating their R&amp;D budget."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is no better way to get shut out as a scientist than to disprove the career-making findings of the important people in your field. One of the side effects of this is the “discussion does not match the results” paper. It’s routine to read papers where the discussion blatantly contradicts the papers own results. What is happening is the authors are disclaiming their own findings in order to get past hostile reviewers, betting that astute readers will notice the contradiction, ignore the discussion and draw their own conclusions from the results."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Docker going strong :-)Unsurprising, really. The usefulness of it cannot be overstated.Doesn&#39;t even matter if its used anywhere in the deployment chain; simply having the ability to pull up a replica of almost any *nix environment on my laptop in mere seconds, using it for tests, and then throwing it away resetting it again in mere seconds is beyond awesome, no matter if what I&#39;m working on then goes into a huge complicated deployment chain, or is shoved onto some on-premises, zero-abstractions, baremetal server.And how is it all configured? Plain text files. How is it controlled? Command Line. Meaning I can script it every way I want, using the tools I already have and use. Doesn&#39;t get in the way, doesn&#39;t demand that I work around it...it works with me and my tools in the same way they already work together.Oh, and of course, good bye and good riddance to the days when I had to install and configure local RDMS for tests. Everything I use has an official image, so I just write some small setup script, a Dockerfile, knit everything together in a docker-compose.yml and presto, done: Application stack is up and running.To me, Docker is as essential as my text editor these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It blows my mind that 72% of developers love Slack.  I absolutely hate it with a passion.  It&#39;s like someone walking up to your desk, except we made it way easier because they don&#39;t have to get up and feel the social pressure of waiting for you to stop what you&#39;re doing and take off your headphones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ruby is missing entirely in the [1] Salary and experience by language.156 People responded were programming with Crystal professionally. A language that is still very very young.Even ignoring Node.Js, there are 3x [2] more Django developers than Rails.If people thinks Phoenix is young or niche, it has half of Rails professional usage in this survey.Django&#39;s current position should be what Rails tries to achieve. 15% usage is enough for a market sustainable position.Some Google developer told me Fresh Grad or Junior Software Engineers gets $200K Total Comp per year. That is equal to the median salary of Senior Executive (C-Suite, VP, etc.) in the US. When developers with 5 - 10 years of experience are calling for a &#34;fair&#34; $400K Total Compensation on Twitter. Someone on HN once said Google Senior SWE make up to $700K. The salary gap within the industry is huge.[1] https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-salary-salary-...[2] https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#section-most-popular-t..."</p>
