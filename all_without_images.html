There are plenty of other choices out there when it comes to infrastructure services so this isn&#39;t &#34;deplatforming&#34;. I sympathize with people that are not pro regime but ultimately even those tax dollars they may generate go to the regime. We have people on the ground in Ukraine being bombarded now non stop. I cannot with good conscience continue to support the Russian regime in any way, shape or form. People that are getting angry need to point that at the cause, their own government. If more grace time is necessary for some to move, we will provide it. Free speech is one thing but this decision is more about a government that is committing war crimes against innocent people that we want nothing to do with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a non-russia customer, I am inmediatly  moving all of my domains I host at namecheap to another provider.this kind of stuff from private companies are useless, and downvote me all you want, they do not work, and dont come to lecture me from your SF desk while im living in a sanctioned country, how did the 2017-2019 sactions for Venezuela worked? Everyone in the world moved on and even forgot about our country, and the comunist regime is more alive than ever, all the sactions just fucked the regular people like me, for example my gf is still explaining after 2 years to those idiots at transferwise support that her money sitting on their super awesome &#34;no borders account&#34; has nothing to do with the venezuelan govt and that it&#39;s from her US based remote job but they just decided to steal over 22k USD from her solely based on her citizenship. Or should I tell you how stripe completely killed my friend&#39;s startup by suspending their accout because they had venezuelans IPs and venezuelan citizenship and aparently they aren&#39;t able to check that they (normal citizens) arent the people on the OFAC list, (like 5 names LOL)So yeah, dont mind me, get your likes, get all the nice advertisiment you want while prettending you are helping and is nothing more than a PR move while messing with normal people with normal lives, struggling everyday but you won&#39;t get me as a customer anymore, we are all suppose to be professionals at our tech jobs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was surprised by this, until I realized that one of Namecheap&#39;s offices is in downtown Kharkiv. Today, the Russian military bombed Kharkiv with cluster munitions [1]. Civilians were killed, possibly including children [2].Given the severity of the situation, I&#39;m surprised that Namecheap has not opted for more drastic measures- for example, redirecting Russian web traffic. Simply transferring Russian businesses to other providers might be among the less-drastic options they considered.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e42F1V3AOq4&amp;t=150s[2] https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2022/02/28/kharkiv-rock..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Why are all of the API clients so intent on storing all your requests and environment config in the cloud?We would keep a directory of relevant collections and environments inside all our application repos, so they would simply be committed along with the code, be versioned, included in PR reviews, etc. But it looks like all of the popular REST client tools use some hidden cloud services.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My entire team of software engineers are Ukranian, residing in Ukraine (I&#39;m not in Ukraine, nor am I Ukrainian).For the past few weeks our &#34;water cooler talk&#34; has been almost exclusively about the rising threat of invasion, if not directly about the ongoing conflict in the SE of Ukraine. A number of the team signed up for the volunteer defence force and have spent countless weekends training with the army.The morning of the invasion I received early morning messages from a few of the members to the effect of &#34;Russia has invaded. We are going to fight.&#34;I have never sent such an emotional and heart felt &#34;Good luck, stay safe&#34; in what is such a vacuous and empty medium (i.e., a messenger client) before. I haven&#39;t been able to produce anything since the invasion began because I am constantly watching the news and various social media feeds for updates on the invasion, and it&#39;s really hard to pick up a full (now absent, mostly) team&#39;s efforts without metaphorically dropping bits all over the place.My work, and that of my team, it just.. doesn&#39;t matter in comparison. My boss is asking for progress updates and I&#39;m just responding &#34;Nothing. The guys are focussing on staying safe, warm, and well stocked right now.&#34; (with a small side of incredulity.)I&#39;ve brought it up with leadership and they are going to parachute in some agencies from other places and I can&#39;t help but feel we are just abandoning my team members. The people I have, on average, spent 5x8hr days working with for the past few years. My comrades. My friends. Just so expendable in the eyes of my employer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am American, moved to Kyiv almost four years ago.  My startup engineering team is 100% in Ukraine. As the warning signs mounted I urged my people to consider leaving but no one, myself included, thought it would come to this.  Of course no one left.I finally agreed to take a couple of weeks out of Kyiv to calm my cofounder’s nerves, sure that I’d be back and we’d have a laugh at how it all came to nothing. So I am in Tbilisi and my team are all stuck in Ukraine.We’re doing all we can to help   We can’t get the men out because the Ukrainian borders guards won’t let any men leave, and most of the women won’t leave their husbands behind. A few have joined the territorial defense forces and are defending Kyiv now. Many others are taking shelter in basements while the Russians shell their cities.Today, 66% of my 45 person team were online and working. It’s astonishing the grit and commitment the Ukrainians are showing. We’re resolved not to abandon them and to do all we can for them but the shitty reality is that’s just not a whole lot right now.If anyone can fight their way to victory in this war it’s them. I wish the west had done more when there was still time to make a difference, but now it’s up to Ukrainians to save themselves and make the Russian invaders pay for every meter they take."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As if the pointless prodding of “any updates? :)” is ever called for. If there were any updates, there would be fucking updates posted. I frequently get comments like this in projects they I maintain, sometimes less than a day after the issue was opened, and it does nothing but annoy me and make me not want to resolve their issue. Why is there an expectation that maintainers have infinite amounts of time to fix whatever problem you’re having? Extremely frustrating and makes me hate working in open source."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"DIY Perks [1] has a good tutorial on how to make a super bright LED panel from LED strips. Quite easily, actually.Been using one of those in my office for the last eight years or so. I use a server PSU for power.I was surprised to see how bright it is when I once went outside while it was on. Not only was my window the brightest in the entire street by far. But it actually illuminated the trees around my window.If I was to build it again - and especially for a place like living room - , I would build it so as to also simulate sunset. That is to say, that it will automatically lower the brightness and shift to a warmer spectrum in the evening. Otherwise, this thing messes with your biorhythm and gets you out of sync with normal daylight hours very quickly.[1] https://youtu.be/jLia59KfkSw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I lived in Seattle, my solution was a 2’ square fluorescent panel I got from a gardening supply place called “The Indoor Sun Shop”. I grew up in the South and got real bad seasonal depression up there; it probably saved my life. I paid all of $300 for it. Plus like twenty bucks for a mechanical timer, because I discovered that there were a lot of mornings where I was too depressed and mopey to turn it on myself. I kept it in the home office I worked in and it did a lot to shut up that little voice that suggested killing myself as the solution to every problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m from India. Lighting in my middle class house, since forever, has been poor. I never consciously felt it when I was still studying. Just that the rooms were dark and I would prefer to play/study outside, or in the front room, where the door was always open, allowing a lot of sunlight.I realized the lighting factor a few years back. Now, My own home has two lights in every room and whenever I am studying/reading/cooking, I always have them both on.The difference is stark. Perhaps I am clutching my pearls when I say this, but I feel my quality of life has improved with better lighting.I also got my walls painted with very light colors, and the ambient light is just amazing.Good lighting is a blessing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is cool! As someone who&#39;s into fine dining, a few thoughts/tips for people starting out:1. Don&#39;t go into a michelin level restaurant expecting &#34;well it&#39;s expensive so it should be what I normally eat but better&#34;, think of it as its own category of food, that happens to have a really high buy-in price. Lots more crazy flavors, presentation, exotic ingredients, etc. It&#39;s not that it has to be &#39;better&#39; than the best $12 bbq joint you&#39;ve ever been to, just different.2. Many very high end restaurants have great lunch deals, which can really cut the price to try them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so glad this was a positive story, and I&#39;m so happy for the author! I went into it expecting this restaurant to be mocked, since articles like this are usually played as a joke.No, not everyone can afford to try a Michelin Star restaurant. A lot of Michelin restaurants suck. And you don&#39;t have to pay a ton for a good meal; some of the best food I&#39;ve ever had has cost $10.However, food is right up there with music as something that connects people. A taste or smell can unlock a memory you thought you lost forever, or create new ones you&#39;ll never forget. There&#39;s a reason meals are so prominent in movies and literature. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a good relationship with food (in fact, for many, the connotations can be quite negative), and I&#39;m so happy for this person that she loved it.When done right, nice restaurants are an experience. From start to finish, from the food to the drink to the decor to the people, it&#39;s closer to going to a Broadway play or art museum than it is a normal meal.For people who can afford it readily, the experience is almost lost. It can become a status symbol, where the Instagram story is more important than enjoying it. It was so charming to see this through the eyes of someone who had no pretentious goals going into it, and had a wonderful time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was in Italy with my brother back in 2019, we mostly ate at cheap local spots to keep costs down. But towards the end of the trip, I said lets go get some amazing food, regardless of cost.We walked into this little Italian restaurant, ordered an expensive Merlot and a tomahawk steak to share. First the wine, &#34;holy shit&#34; was the exact words I used when I first tasted it, super smooth, to the point where you couldn&#39;t feel even the smallest bit of sting from the alcohol.Then the steak, the tenderest steak I&#39;ve ever had. You cut of pieces of fat and as soon as you put it in your mouth the thing just melts away.In the end dinner set us back 250 euros, and much like this lady, I walked away going &#34;that was worth every penny&#34;. Food like that isn&#39;t just about the experience, it&#39;s also the memory. That dinner I had is now almost 4 years ago but I still remember the wine and the slightly salted steak kisses fingers like an italian"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I do see a point in it working like it does, though. I&#39;m one of the lead developers on a free software project with over 20 years of history. Even though the project has used multiple version control systems (and hosting providers) over time, we have imported our entire project&#39;s history going back to the very  first commit into git and GitHub.Not every contributor has kept their email address for over 20 years. Some don&#39;t have access to the old addresses they once used for commits. Still they want the commits to be associated with their current GitHub account; even if it&#39;s just for statistics and &#34;bragging rights&#34;.If GitHub required email address verification, how would this be done?EDIT: To be clear: With &#34;working like it does&#34; I&#39;m referring to the possibility to add unverified email addresses to your account and have commits attributed to you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In spite of GitHub&#39;s claims that nothing wrong, something is wrong and fixable.GitHub should be showing the identity pulled from the e-mail address, and not replacing it with the name of an associated GitHub account. Just like it does when there is no associated GH account.A reasonable compromise would be to show that name, but turn it into a link to the account if there is one. Then only someone curious clicking on &#34;Linus Torvalds&#34; would see: hey, how come this leads to some VanTudor account?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GitHub’s response is pretty surprising. How can anyone think this is expected? Having to follow Git’s commit message emails makes sense and indeed anybody can use any email they want to make a commit. But then for GitHub to make the connection between (unverified) commit emails and (unverified) GitHub.com accounts is the issue for me. Since they can’t verify the commit email belongs to a GitHub account, why show that as though it were true?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is an interesting fork of LFS that uses Musl instead of glibc.https://github.com/dslm4515/Musl-LFSI played with it for a while as the base OS for my KVM hypervisor servers.A couple of years ago, I tried to find all the source archives for the old LFS releases. I ended up using the Debian and kernel.org archives to find most of the old package versions. Packages from before 2004 started disappearing like as86 and the PowerPC patches. I was never able to find the PowerPC patches because they were never mirrored on anything but FTP sites. The Internet Archive did not pick up any of those mirrors.
https://archive.org/details/linuxfromscratch-releasesI eventually replaced the Musl-LFS build and replaced it with a buildroot set of configs and scripts when I had issues replicating my work with later package versions. Buildroot allowed me to more rapidly test and deploy my hypervisor config.  I wanted a simple /etc/rc init like what was in SunOS 4, no GRUB, and QEMU with VDE networking.I ended up with SYSLINUX for BIOS MBR and gummiboot(before it was converted into systemd-boot) for EFI because my EFI machine (Dell R810) did not allow for direct booting of EFI binaries."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"LFS is great to learn how a Linux based system works without all the sweet, sweet magic modern distributions give us.On a personal, nostalgic, note: running LFS on your laptop in my university was the ultimate Linux nerd cred. A step below, immediately following, there was Slackware.The reason I feel confident enough working with Linux today is because I started back in the early &#39;00 using Slackware, which recently had a new release[1].Don&#39;t get me wrong, compiling your own kernel, solving shared libraries compilation hell, messing up your init.d and starting over, leaving your Pentium 4 compile for several hours was a massive waste of my 20s.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Appreciate the effort the article author put in, but I&#39;ll be contrarian here (in the hopes of saving people time) and say that I think this is the wrong approach to take to getting hired (the effort:hire ratio is terrible).I don&#39;t know why, whether it&#39;s to be fair or avoid litigation, but in most companies I&#39;ve worked for or interviewed with, the senior engineers, hiring managers, HR, etc. don&#39;t have as much influence over the hiring process as you think. You&#39;ll probably still need to go through 5 stages of interviews, including a white-boarding or a take home test. Otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have all these &#34;rockstar&#34; programmers on Twitter complaining about the interview process. The best that these &#34;influencers&#34; can do for you, is to tip you off to an opening and maybe help towards the end of the interview process.The other issue is, how do you know you&#39;re betting on the right horse? e.g. is the person that you&#39;re getting cozy with really going to help you career? You only have so much time and &#34;connections&#34; to invest.My advice: instead of going to meet ups, take more interviews and improve your interviewing skills. Instead of spending 2-5 hours/week going to meet ups, take 1 interview instead. Even with no preperation, you&#39;ll start to see the pattern in the types of questions people ask. Improve on your answers. Interview again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is probably good general advice for getting comfortable in a crowd and starting conversations, but I doubt such &#34;networking&#34; has as much to do with getting a tech job as people like to think.In my 2+ decades of experience on both sides of tech recruiting, getting your foot in the door is always the easiest part of the process. Apply online at the company&#39;s careers site. Get an existing employee to refer you (literally anyone will be more than happy to do so for the bonus). Message a recruiter on LinkedIn. All of these will get you at least a screening call. From then on 100% of your hiring chances are dependent on your resume and interview performance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s clear to me that the author is introverted as in shy, not introverted as in neurodivergent; there are so many “why don’t you just ____?” and maybe there’s an audience who hasn’t tried that and would adjust well to the advice, but I’m definitely not in that audience.My advice to anyone who feels the same way: let yourself shine, make the social connections that feel comfortable for you, and… hopefully you’ll have the same privilege I have in being able to stand out just by being your awesome self. The job market is competing for you, not the other way around."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once was part of a now-defunct reading forum in my teens.On the forum, people would package three related books into quests. A boring example would be a dystopian quest pack with three books about three very different dystopian scenarios.But the quests people put together were usually more interesting. I remember a &#34;Weird Magic&#34; quest had books with really unconventional magic systems. I found Motherless Brooklyn (detective with Tourette&#39;s) in a quest pack of &#34;heroes with issues&#34;. Other quest ideas would be evil protagonists, alien first-contact with the wrong guy, and stuff like that. You can often find three books for even the goofiest of quests.It was a cool way to find new books. And whenever you didn&#39;t know what to read next, you&#39;d look at what quests you were still working on and choose among them. Once finished, your completed quest count would increase.Long append-only lists of genre-related books were never as interesting to me. Quests only having three books made them a fun thing to collect. Maybe there&#39;s something fun there that new goodreads competitors can experiment with."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very interesting... some feedback.So I search for &#34;Proust&#34;, and the top 8 results are not Proust. Since Proust has one extremely famous book, I thought it would show up, rather than a bunch of different commentary on Proust.So I finally find the page for In Search Of Lost Time. However, it says none of my friends have read it. Well, of course not - I don&#39;t have any Booqsi friends yet. So, there&#39;s just nothing I can do on this page.Next I looked for The Power And The Glory. At least this page has a summary of the book. But, also none of my friends read it, and there&#39;s nothing I can do here.Next, Consilience. Same thing. Basically I search for a book, I get maybe nothing, maybe a summary, and then there&#39;s nothing else I can do on that page.So, I want to like this site, but I&#39;m just finding nothing I can do here.Personally, I love books but I hate Goodreads. I just don&#39;t care that a hundred thousand random people prefer The Twilight Saga Complete Collection to The Death of Ivan Ilych.I would be really interested to read a well-written paragraph that said, hey, if you like Nabokov and Borges, then you might like this other author. That sort of recommendation is what I occasionally get from reading blogs or tweets from people with a similar literary taste to mine, and it&#39;s very useful, I find most books through some sort of recommendation.Goodreads has this mistaken idea that I care about the average person&#39;s opinion of a book. A book is not a can opener. Everyone wants to open a can, everyone opens cans in the same way, everyone appreciates a can opener that successfully opens cans.Anyway, I hope you do succeed in building a Goodreads alternative, because I would love to spend more time reading about books, reading good books, discussing books, and Goodreads is just not providing that experience."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Why not just set $TERM to dumb or xterm without color support? Or change all color definitions in the terminal to print the same color?&gt; The terminal is capable of color and should be able to print color when instructed. NO_COLOR is a hint to the software running in the terminal to suppress addition of color, not to the terminal to prevent any color from being shown.I have to admit I don&#39;t really get this. I personally like colorized output, and I can&#39;t even think of situations where the colors chosen by a developer were so bad I wanted to disable them completely.I respect others like no color (and there&#39;s already a solution per that, above), but I don&#39;t quite get the desire to have just some color (prompts but not applications). Can someone with this opinion explain their rationale?Normally I wouldn&#39;t care,
 -- individual preferences are like opinions and everyone is entitled to their own -- but this imposes work on every developer/application.  There&#39;s certainly ways to implement this that minimize impact, but it&#39;s still a non-zero up-front and ongoing maintenance/testing cost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m starting to be of the mind that environment variables in general are an anti-pattern.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is a fine idea but I wonder about this part:&#34;... should check for the presence of a NO_COLOR environment variable that, when present (regardless of its value), prevents the addition of ANSI color ...&#34;How common is this behavior ?That is, the presence of the env var regardless of its value trips the conditional ?That seems like asking for trouble / confusion ... especially since there is a very well understood practice of setting 0/1 false/true for settings like this.Is this commonly done and I have just never noticed it ?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieceshttps://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/I failed the interview for an internship I really wanted in my 2nd year of engineering; I did get a shit internship that summer, but being really shaken at my incompetence, I took up this book, and quite honestly, it changed everything!It truly sparked an interest in systems for me. The book helped me build a strong foundation in systems; Processes, memory, filesystems, networks, concurrency, synchronization and more. After reading OSTEP, it felt like an epiphany, and I charted a path for the rest of 2 years of college around distributed systems, systems research, and virtualization.And the best part is that all this knowledge is free! Kudos to Professor Remzi and his work!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SICP for CS and programming. That book (and its exercises) really instilled in me the thought patterns that drastically improved my programming skills and made me realize how important fundamental CS knowledge is to being a good programmer. What I learned from that book was: becoming comfortable with recursion, realizing the importance of abstractions, functional programming concepts and it gave me insights into how interpreters and the machine work.I studied math in university and the book that really improved me mathematically was baby rudin. I really struggled with this the first time I worked through it and had to also fall back on Abott&#39;s analysis book, but after my first analysis course I worked through Rudin again and it just clicked. The exercises are really well chosen and the text is just so on point. Every sentence in the book is extremely carefully chosen and of fundamental importance to what Rudin wants to teach you.It&#39;s really rare that you find textbooks that almost kind of have a certain magic to them, like you are directly taught by one of the greatest minds in that field. These two books definitely meet that criteria."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Code, by Charles Petzold. It came to me at exactly the right time, and broke through the biggest conceptual barrier I’d had until that point; how do you actually go from logic gates to general purpose computing? Having Petzold walk you up the ladder of abstraction, never missing a link, really got me over the hump of treating all that complexity as a black box. On a meta level it gave me confidence to go approach apparently impossible things with an open mind and dig deep enough that you see how the “magic” works."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Project Oberon is awesome!I found the Project Oberon book in SFSU library and read it cover to cover.  Such a tight, elegant system.  Pretty much complete: Oberon OS includes compiler for Oberon language!Language was self-hosted (compiler written in itself) and Prof. Wirth had a heuristic: no feature could be added to the lang/compiler if it made compiling the compiler slower.There are several emulators, in C, JS, Java, and Python, and there&#39;s Verilog so you can burn to FPGA and make a real workstation.  People have.The system has two kinds of OOP.  There is the C++/Java/Python/etc. kind where you basically add methods to a record type, and there is the old school Smalltalk message-passing kind, where elements of the OS communicate through an extendable message bus.The GUI system, especially with the &#34;Gadgets&#34; subsystem, is mind-blowing.  It would take too long to go over it at the moment, but there are features there that still haven&#39;t made it into mainstream GUI systems.  If I get a minute later today I&#39;ll come back and add a note detailing some of the awesome if someone else hasn&#39;t already filled in the picture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project is still a great example of a complete computer design, starting from Niklaus Wirth&#39;s own RISC5 CPU (not a RISC-V) and very simple peripherals over the OS, runtime/garbage collector, compiler, GUI and simple example applications.One problem of the original implementation is that it was based on an old Xilinx Spartan 3 development board. This is not only no longer available, but it is one of the few FPGA boards that used 32 bit wide fast (12 ns IIRC) asynchronous SRAM chips. Wirth&#39;s hardware design relies heavily on this.Some years ago, there was a compatible board, the OberonStation. However, it seems this is no longer manufactured: https://pcper.com/2015/12/meet-the-oberonstation-kid-friendl...However, some modified designs exist that implement a cache in FPGA block RAM and an SDRAM controller. These can be used with more recent FPGA boards:- FleaFPGA &#34;Ohm&#34; board with a Lattice ECP5  FPGA and 32 MB RAM (https://fleasystems.com/fleaFPGA_Ohm.html) - https://github.com/Basman74/Oberon_SDRAM- Radiona ulx3s, another ECP5 in an open source design  (https://github.com/emard/oberon) - https://github.com/emard/oberon- PapilioPro using a Xilinx Spartan 6 LX, another open source PCB design (https://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.PapilioPro) - https://opencores.org/projects/oberon_sdramShameless plug: my student Rikke&#39;s port of Project Oberon to RV32I (this is a real RISC-V), however, we still need to find some time to build an FPGA-based SoC. Currently, it runs in emulation: https://github.com/solbjorg/oberon-riscv"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Oberon channel has several videos of Oberon in action,https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Oberon+Chan...While Oberon was quite cool, people should also learn about its Xerox influence,&#34;Eric Bier Demonstrates Cedar&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_dt7NG38V4Also dive into what happened afterwards, Oberon-2, Active Oberon, Zonnon,...Active Oberon could be considered quite modern, also makes the distinction between safe and unsafe pointers, which improves the experience for low level coding.https://github.com/metacore/A2OSOne of the best things about these systems is proving what systems programming with automatic memory management were capable of.Given Oberon-2&#39;s influence on Go, maybe improving Fyne (https://fyne.io/fynedesk/) with something like gRPC for the dynamic experience, could be a possible sucessor."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context on what I believe they mean by &#34;fraudulent&#34;.Steam back in the day used to accept 0 confirmation bitcoin spends. This means that the transaction has been gossiped on the bitcoin p2p network but had not yet been mined into a block and thus had minimal finality guarantees. Steam could see that they were going to receive a bitcoin payment (when the transaction was mined into a block) and would credit the users account instantly for a better purchase UX.Turns out anyone with some deeper understanding of bitcoin could construct another transaction spending the same bitcoin back to themselves before their original transaction was ever put in a block. The bitcoin community moved away from accepting &#39;0 conf&#39; transactions pretty much everywhere because of this reason.In fact the high fee era (2016-2018) saw many wallets incorporating this &#34;double spend&#34; feature into their wallets. This is known as RBF, &#34;replace by fee&#34; and is really useful when you need to bump your transaction up the queue. You replace your old transaction, that is waiting to be mined, with a new one that offers a higher fee to incentivize miners to add it to a new block.I think its rather unfortunate that 0 conf transactions were written off so quickly. There are many context where a 0conf tx makes sense, mostly IRL. But, if you are running a business online and you don&#39;t trust you customers you should wait 3-6 blocks after the transaction has been mined before delivering your goods."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately no details were given about what makes 50% of all bitcoin transactions “fraudulent” ?What does that even mean?* did someone try to send something other then bitcoin to a ₿ address?* did a client claim he payed and did the payment seem to fail on his end?* did a client not realise that you as payee also pay for the network fee?Nowadays these kind of problems would be easily prevented by using bitcoin lightning payments, because they work in a fraction of a second and specify the exact amount that has to be payed.
Also they are almost free of transaction costs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be a basic misunderstanding on the part of the pro-btc ppl here all saying &#34;how is that fraud?&#34; or &#34;how is that steams problem?&#34;If you run a business that can be used in a money laundering scheme, even if you are not a victim, you have a legal responsibility to try to limit/prevent that actually.The crypto crowd may not like that, but it&#39;s not up to them."</p>

So why isn&#39;t this an industrial machining process already, like plasma cutting?GA Drilling was pushing plasma drilling back in 2018.[2] They&#39;re still pushing it, but not making holes.The University of Minnesota was pushing electro-pulse boring in 2015.[3] Again, no deep holes.There&#39;s something called ThermoDrilling, which, despite the name, is more like a water jet cutter.[4]Successful projects are still using mechanical drilling.[5]So there are a lot of deep hole drilling approaches being studied. Anything that works would be used by the oil and gas industry, and if they&#39;re not trying it, one suspects it might not be working.[1] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270653673_Microwave...[2] https://www.gadrilling.com/[3] https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/electro-pulse-boring...[4] https://www.geodrillinginternational.com/deep-geothermal/new...[5] https://geothermalengineering.co.uk/united-downs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I&#39;ve always wondered.Wouldn&#39;t massive scale geothermal end up pumping more heat into the atmosphere that otherwise wouldn&#39;t be there?In contrast, the energy collected by solar and wind generators is from the energy added to Earth by the sun and would be energy in our atmosphere regardless of whether  or not we collect it.But it seems like the heat inside the Earth&#39;s core should be fairly well insulated by the lithosphere, and it only slowly leaks out over time. If we start pulling that energy out at a faster rate to generate electricity, could that have a noticeable net increase on total energy under the atmosphere, or is it such an insignificant amount of energy relative to the sun&#39;s to not even bother worrying about?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah right. They drilled in Strasbourg, France, to get this &#34;free&#34; energy. When they entered production, the city was experiencing an earthquake every month, waking the city at night.
After a magnitude 4 earthquake, they finally shut down the plant.A town in Germany is  devastated also due to geothermal power: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Staufen_im_Breisgau"</p>

My FB wall is full of people providing their apartments for free, giving jobs etc. There is over 100 cars long queue at a border willing to transport Ukrainians escaping war where they want. They can travel by train for free in Poland.Now not so good tidbit. Just few months ago we had a lot of people lured into Belarus by Lukashenko trying to come to Europe. Poland treated them really really poorly. Catching them after crossing border and pushing them back. The society was split among pro-refugees and anti. The political parties almost all focused on &#34;protecting our border&#34;.I was afraid that this natalist sentiment might repeat, even though Ukrainians are one of the closest people to Poland. I am very happy to note I haven&#39;t heard anyone speaking against refugees from Ukraine, not on twitter not on facebook not by far-right parties, altough I am sure some people are silent about their opinions."</p>

I love going there and wouldn&#39;t mind staying there a bit longer at some point.More countries should do this; Germany and my home country the Netherlands in particular. I live in Berlin currently as a foreigner (perfect place for that). Lots of people from all over eastern Europe live here, lots of companies here outsource all over eastern Europe, lots of people that I know either come from or have friends/family from the Ukraine. Also, about 200k people of Russian origin live here that chose to move here after the wall fell. And I assume quite a few Ukranians.I remember meeting refugees from the former Yugoslavia in the nineties. I think 25 years later, a lot of those people did pretty well. I actually visited Bosnia for work last summer and met a guy that went to school in Munich. Likewise a lot of Syrian refugees that ended up in Germany seem to be doing OK. Quite a few ended up here in Berlin. In times of war, people are generally grateful if you accommodate them; even if it isn&#39;t always with open arms.It&#39;s usually the smart, free thinkers that need to flee. Incidentally those are also people likely to find a way to make it in life; start businesses; or otherwise be generally successful.The US is full of such people that emigrated there after various wars in the last century. Now is not a time to be xenophobic about this sort of thing."</p>

America holds sway over international finance thanks to the dollar’s dominance and its pre-eminent role in global settlement systems. Further politicising swift would give China an incentive to bolster cips, its rival to swift for cross-border payments in yuan. It would also help China court any country with uneasy relations with America looking for alternatives.I would imagine there are additional politics in play with disabling SWIFT. I dont how many countries will need to agree before shutting down SWIFT access, if it is at the will of US it would be more like a semi-nuclear option.Although I am already surprised by CIPS, one eighth of transaction volume of SWIFT is not &#34;well behind&#34;.

That&#39;s what happened in East Aleppo (with the help of the Russian airforce), that&#39;s what happened in Jobar, too. Not sure if the flattening of Kyiv would be the best thing for the Ukranian people going forward.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9ZXPhmR7lQ"</p>

I guess it&#39;s self-evident, but not having thought about the topic, the utility of rubble and repurposing semi-destroyed structures, as well as how important snipers are, were new to me. Maybe the importance of snipers makes civilians being handed out guns in Kyiv now seem less futile.Would be interested to read a basic explainer along these lines on &#34;How to Rebuild a City&#34; -- I guess one divergence from urban planning/development literature would be on how to reuse rubble? Given the many destroyed cities through history including this century which have been at least partially reubilt (perhaps Grozny was first of this century?) I guess there must be plenty written on this topic."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Author here, didn’t expect to see this here again after two years!I guess I’ll give a quick update on how things have been since this article was written. I haven’t used or studied French much since then, and have gotten quite rusty, though I’ve had a few conversations fully in French in the last few months and can still maintain a conversation. I have been thinking of picking up French again soon, as traveling to a French speaking country becomes more of an option.I also did roughly the same thing with my Spanish in the following year, with similar results, though I’d say I probably reached a solid B1.5 or weak B2 after a year (due to COVID I was unable to take the proficiency test and lost some motivation to continue studying to a high level as a result.)My recommendations are still largely the same, though I haven’t used these resources (e.g. Duolingo) since I stopped studying a while back. And as others have noted, for other languages, particularly those that are less closely related to English (e.g. Japanese), you’ll have to follow a different path to achieve the same proficiency. However, language learning resources are getting better constantly, so you can certainly still learn quite a lot without total, in-person immersion, as I did!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned Spanish, too, in about 12 months to dogfood my new app for learning vocabulary (which I just recently launched) [0]Even though I made an app that helped me along the way to learn words, I don&#39;t believe in a single app/book/approach for learning a language. You need to expose yourself to A LOT of different language materials.I was learning for about 2h a day, 6 times a week. I would read articles, books, websites in Spanish. I would watch YouTube videos [1]. I would read news, initially for beginners [2] and later regular [3]. And most importantly, I would have 4-5h a week itakly conversations.After 6 months I understood quite a lot, but couldn&#39;t speak almost at all. Then magic happens and 6 months later, I was having a normal conversation (though still with some errors) about any range of topics: politics, global warming, travel, engineering etc.I believe the key for me was to read a lot of books which were interesting to me. For example I read Bill Gate&#39;s book &#34;How To Avoid A Climate Disaster&#34; in Spanish, as well as about ~8 others in the first 12 months.[0] https://www.obstino.com[1] https://www.youtube.com/c/DreamingSpanish[2] www.newsinslowspanish.com[3] https://elpais.com"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with the author that custom components don’t capture all the interaction details. Many times they are not accessible or cannot implement cross-platform input well.However, I disagree with:&gt; The browser’s built-in controls are quite sufficient.The problem is that browser components are good for simple forms but insufficient for other types of interaction.A good example is select. Using the select tag is the best way to have a dropdown list that’s accessible and supports mobile. But, select doesn’t cover most of the cases that you need for a complex app.Many of the WAI ARIA authoring examples  (including the combobox patterns) are not covered by built in components. Interaction patterns like pop ups, dialogs, or lookup lists are quite common for an app… but hard to do in an accessible/cross-platform way.Web browsers need to do something different to support accessible/usable apps. The idea of leaving all those things to WebComponents makes sense, but the result is reinventing the broken wheel on each app."</p>

One of the top devs took a look at it, and saw that the text was sent to Grammarly&#39;s server unencrypted and warned everyone not to use it. Some still did.At my previous engagement, a large number of staff spoke English as a second or third language, and Grammarly was prevalent. Even as a native English speaker, they wanted me to use it as a sort of proof reader. I&#39;ll admit that it caught some of my dumber mistakes, but I never felt comfortable using it. I could have proof-read my work better is all. Perhaps if I wasn&#39;t given mind-numbing work, the quality would have been better."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a huge AMD fan but this is bonkers.Yes, Intel has floundered for a number of years, but at the same time they are a foundry themselves, second only to TSMC (for now), have incredible manufacturing capacity, and seem poised to start pushing interesting CPU designs as well as having their foundry half finally start executing correctly. Also their growth potential for their GPU business is huuuuuuge.As someone who enjoys AMD for the competition they bring, I am worried what the next few years might look like for them for the following reasons:1. AMD GPUs were actually very competitive with their RDNA2 architecture, but at the same time AMD enjoyed a huge silicon advantage as they were on TSMC while NVIDIA was on Samsung (for consumer). The next generation of NVIDIA consumer GPUs will be made by TSMC and if their professional GPUs (see A100 which are made by TSMC) are any indication we can see potentially up to 1.5x to 2x efficiency bump for NVIDIA.2. Intel seems to be cleaning up shop and their latest generation of CPUs feel like a 1st Gen Ryzen moment. Also, Intel does not have to clearly surpass AMD, they just need to be competitive as they can simply out produce AMD given AMDs relatively small allocation at TSMC.3. Intel GPUs pose a moderate threat on the horizon for AMD for both low end and portables and at the same time they are eating up available capacity at TSMC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just want to clear things up.The reason why AMD is suddenly catching up to Intel in valuation is because of the confirmation / success acquisition of Xilinx. Which triggered the conversion of 250M Xilinx shares to new AMD shares. Adding roughly $40B to its market cap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something that has gone unmentioned in these comments: Intel has a lot more debt than AMD (38B vs 661M on 12/31). That does affect their comparative market cap by, you know, roughly 37 billion dollars. (give or take some amount related to their credit rating and the very low cost of money right now, I would think, and if you want something to argue about there&#39;s always the fact that Intel has an even better credit rating than AMD...)Intel has much, much more income than AMD and they&#39;re valued similarly by the market and... that is not a mystery.https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC/financials?p=INTChttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD/financials?p=AMD"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If I understand this correctly, the FCC has allocated the 4.2GHz-4.4GHz band for radar altimeters. The FCC has also allocated the 3.7GHz-3.98GHz band to 5G. It turns out that the radar altimeters, as manufactured, use spectrum outside their allocated band, down to and including part of the 3.7GHz-3.98GHz 5G band.Am I missing something?If a rancher buys a plot of land from 34.42°N to 34.44°N to graze his cattle on, but in actual fact grazes his cattle all the way from 34.37°N to 34.47°N. Then a farmer buys a plot of land from 34.37°N to 34.398°N to grow wheat on. Does the rancher still get to herd his cattle down to 34.39°N to feed his cattle? The cattle have to eat, after all, and cutting down the grazing land by 30% could cause some cattle to starve to death. And the rancher has a vested financial interest in ensuring his cattle are well fed, and that wheat is good eating. And the rancher has always been grazing his cattle there, what right does the farmer have to till the soil on the racher&#39;s grazing land? And we, the American public, have the right to buy beef. Why should the farmer purchasing 34.37°N to 34.398°N interfere with my ability to buy a steak?Does any of this make any sense to anyone?Unless there&#39;s additional information I&#39;m unaware of, it seems as if the design and/or manufacture of the radar altimeter is not fit for purpose. Using 3.7GHz to 3.98GHz for 5G doesn&#39;t break the radar altimeters; the radar altimeters are already broken and must be fixed or grounded, because the equipment is broken and unsafe.If 5G equipment is emitting outside of its allocated 3.7-3.98GHz spectrum then the FCC needs to drop a brick on that of course."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t know much about aviation or electrical engineering, and I’m wondering if anyone could help me understand something.It seems like the telecom and aviation industries (along with the FCC and FAA) disagree on a question of fact: does 5G equipment interfere with radio altimeters?There’s a way that the FAA could convince me, and probably all the politicians. Shoot a video with a radio altimeter and some 5G equipment where the radio altimeter malfunctions. Put it on YouTube. Do a press release.This seems like an obvious step if the underlying issue exists. Any reason they haven’t done this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this along with potential interference problems in weather radar [0], it&#39;s obvious the FCC bungled allocating the 5G spectrum. What a shame that they gave into industry pressure over other practical considerations.However, it doesn&#39;t surprise me that the FAA, which allowed the Boeing 737Max fiasco, is back here coming to Boeing&#39;s defense.

					<h3><a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ukraine-war-flashes-neon-warning-lights-chips-2022-02-24/">Ukraine is a major producer of neon gas, critical for lasers used in chipmaking</a></h3>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve found the reason (I think) 90% of the world&#39;s semiconductor-grade neon production is concentrated in one country. Per this German government whitepaper about the noble gas industry: the USSR massively overinvested in neon capacity in the 1980&#39;s, in order to build space-based excimer laser weapons. Ukraine&#39;s extant plants date (probably) to the 1980&#39;s; they&#39;re responsible for a global oversupply that&#39;s persisted since the Cold War.- &#34;Neon was regarded as a strategic resource in the former Soviet Union, because it was believed to be required for the intended production of laser weapons for missile and satellite defence purposes in the 1980s. Accordingly, all major air separation units in the Soviet Union were equipped with neon, but also krypton and xenon, enrichment facilities or, in some cases, purification plants (cf. Sections  5.4 and 5.5). The domestic Soviet supply of neon was extremely large but demand low.&#34;- &#34;Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, global crude neon production was approximately 500–600  million  l/a  (=  500,000–600,000 m3/a).  It  was dominated by far by large-scale air separation units associated with metallurgical combines in Russia and Ukraine. Simultaneously, demand was estimated at around 300 million l/a (cf. Section 4.2). In the years between 1990 and 2012, therefore,  most crude  neon was not  purified, but  released into the atmosphere, because there was no customer base.&#34;https://www.deutsche-rohstoffagentur.de/DE/Gemeinsames/Produ... (chapter 5.2)For context, this would have overlapped with Energia/Buran&#39;s launch of the Polyus weapon (which was a megawatt CO2 laser).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How is neon extracted and why does one country have a 90% monopoly (in this specific grade)?edit: Found this C&amp;EN story from 2016 that adds context:- &#34;Chip makers, which account for more than 90% of global neon consumption, are already experiencing high prices and some shortages stemming from the Russian conflict with Ukraine, Shon-Roy says. The war, which started in 2014, interrupted global supplies of the gas, about 70% of which comes from Iceblick, a firm based in the Ukrainian city of Odessa.&#34;- &#34;Iceblick gathers and purifies neon from large cryogenic air separation units that supply oxygen and nitrogen to steelmakers. Most of the air separation units equipped to capture neon, which makes up only 18.2 ppm of the atmosphere by volume, are in Eastern Europe.&#34;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cen-09410-notw7This is puzzling to me, because I don&#39;t get why air separation should naturally concentrate in exactly one place. It&#39;s not tied to a rare and localized geologic formation, like helium sort-of is.Also there&#39;s cryogenic air separation plants all over the planet, why don&#39;t they do neon too? (Asking in the spirit of curiosity)edit #2: I&#39;ve just found something that offers a possible explanation and it&#39;s far more interesting than I expected:- &#34;Neon was regarded as a strategic resource in the former Soviet Union, because it was believed to be required for the intended production of laser weapons for missile and satellite defence purposes in the 1980s. Accordingly, all major air separation units in the Soviet Union were equipped with neon, but also krypton and xenon, enrichment facilities or, in some cases, purification plants (cf.

Ukraine accounts for 7% of the world&#39;s wheat.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/17/infographic-russia-...This conflict will affect 1/4 of the world&#39;s wheat which will affect food prices.In 2010 Russia stopped exporting wheat due to wildfires burning their fields (most likely caused by climate change). This caused a hike in food prices which helped trigger the Arab revolutions in 2011.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Russian_wildfires"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From a philosophical stance, this is history repeating for the same basic reason. 2022 AD and risk of war is still the same as it was in 1022 AD, or 22 AD. That reason is the accumulation of power (or by proxy, wealth) in a small set of individuals, or in this case one person. No realtime access to information changes this; it just makes the story of the horror unfold faster.Persisting with the concentration of power in individuals has shown throughout history to have dire consequence. We continue risking civilization on the mental health of those who already show significant issues with their obsessive clammer for power. The cult of the leader is toxic and, as far as I can see, illogical and lacking evidence for benefit.Where are the voices that seek a structured shift away from personality cult politics?

At least until we further increase energy independence. Only bureaucracy and politics are in the way. Get them out of the way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was during an online rapid tournament. So still very impressive, but Magnus loses games online all the time and I&#39;m not _quite_ sure why this is news.It is interesting which junior players Magnus invited to the tournament, though - besides Praggnanandhaa, there&#39;s also Andrey Esipenko, who _did_ beat Magnus in a classical game once at the prestigious Tata Steel Masters 2021, and also Nodirbek Abdusattorov, who beat Magnus late last year en route to becoming the World Rapid Champion at 17 years old. A fun group! With Vincent Keymer in the mix too, you&#39;re only really missing Nihal Sarin and (of course) Firouzja for many of the future faces of chess.[Edit: the article says that Praggnanandhaa is the youngest player ever to beat Magnus since 2013, which would definitely be newsworthy. I think the article must be leaving out important context, since this tournament is (1) online, (2) speed chess and (3) not FIDE rated, so it typically wouldn&#39;t be included in records, and Magnus has almost certainly lost random online games to younger players before. I&#39;m guessing the article is referencing some other source without providing the relevant criteria, which is why it looked a little weird to me.]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is noted in another comment, but it should be a top level comment... Magnus actively has COVID and has said that it was affecting his energy levels and ability to calculate during the early rounds of the tournament (during which this game happened).And Pragg wasn&#39;t even the lowest rated player to beat Magnus this tournament! Eric Hansen, aka popular chess streamer &#34;chessbrah&#34;, is even lower rated and also beat Magnus, which again you would not expect if Magnus were playing his usual level.So still a great win and great accomplishment for Pragg, but a little context would have been nice in the article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Even Prags coach pointed out [1], let&#39;s not get carried away. This was a great achievement but the pressure this creates can be very bad for him in the longer run.[1]: https://mobile.twitter.com/Rameshchess/status/14964993222462..."</p>

Mean, system is so much disbalanced, that any government got totalitarian power and does not account on people. And laws are created, to make all people offenders, and with very wide possibilities of interpretation, so state officials and their friends become above law.If you really want to help Ukraine, better to contact volunteers-entrepreneurs, who where on Maidan, and who struggle for economic freedoms, and support Ukrainian army as private persons, without government/state.You could just donate, or you could create some business opportunity, so Ukrainians will make business, export working hours, or export some products to world.Business opportunities much better, because Ukraine now have critically huge dependence on Russian market, close to 50% of all trade, need much-much more export to world.Thank You!"</p>

Our apps are gleaned by blogs looking for scoops on upcoming features.I once interviewed at a major airline (not United) and at the time they had outsourced their entire app and web to some foreign companies, including any and all oversight. Their app was a POS and they had hired someone to write a new one -- the same company. Now they had no idea why it was so delayed so they wanted to hire someone to embed in the other company to spy on what was going on. Of course I wanted nothing to do with this travesty. This was years ago, no idea what happened.You&#39;d be amazed at how pathetic mobile development can be even at big companies.

Without Ukraine, Russia ceases to be a Eurasian empire.”“However, if Moscow regains control over Ukraine, with its 52 million people and major resources as well as access to the Black Sea, Russia automatically again regains the wherewithal to become a powerful imperial state, spanning Europe and Asia.”"</p>

Russia understood this before invading, right? So it seems Russia is accepting a high risk of loss.But it doesn&#39;t make sense that a nation as sophisticated as Russia would accept such a high risk of loss. Which means that they might actually believe the risk of NATO intervention is low.How could the risk be low without some kind of collusion or hidden knowledge (hidden from us common folk)?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This looks like a decent deal looking deeper into it.Things that weren&#39;t obvious on first pass:(1) The VR specs are much higher than consumer level.  I suspect this is what makes it reasonable to read text on it.  The comparison headset is this: https://varjo.com/products/aero/  (They named it, but didn&#39;t google it)(2) They said &#34;VR Computer&#34; but don&#39;t define the term.  They mean that it&#39;s a full PC with a headset instead of a regular display.  Oddly they don&#39;t include a mouse or keyboard.My feedback for Simula one:(0) The value proposition here is (a) the included equipment and (b) the software.  They together have to justify the price at some level.(1) You have to really push the point that this is a full computer, not another headset.  I suggest you include a keyboard/mouse, and include it in the pictures with the headset (the pictures with just the headset, not the ones with the people).  Perhaps a keyboard with a trackpad.(2) Show that the headset is substantially higher-spec than the consumer ones.  Show a comparison chart.(3) Dump the AR coffee shop video.  Show AR in a home office.  Don&#39;t assume/require that your customers are that VR gun-ho.(4) Show more than a bunch of shells in the VR screenshots.  I can alt-tab as fast as I can move my head, with less work.  If this is your underlying value proposition, it sucks.  I&#39;m sorry.  If you have something more interesting, like a combined VR/app environment, then it can work.(4.1) Is there some useful interactions between 3D visualization and high-quality small-text rendering?  If you have good VR/3D developer stories, then this can work.(5) Simula One - is it Ubuntu with a 3d window manager and custom rendering stack?  Does it do anything else?  Does it just make a (claustrophobic) shell of windows around the user in VR?(5.1) Are there any integrations with anything?  Like https://blog.jupyter.org/ipygany-jupyter-into-the-third-dime... ipygany?(5.2) What do you expect people to do with it?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The code design is also very elegant in its simplicity.You have two static lists of words in the JS code - known words, and a smaller, random pre-shuffled list of words the game will select from.The selection is done on the client, by date, from the second list - every day at midnight (your local time!) the next word in the pre-shuffled list is selected - no hashing or randomizing or anything. No cookies are involved in making you play one game per day, no server side calls are involved in gameplay at all. And yes, this means that changing your time zone will let you play tomorrow&#39;s game, and that you can just view source to know tomorrow&#39;s word - it appears right after today&#39;s word in the code.This is so counter to how we usually design software in so many ways, it&#39;s just delightful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually think the OP and the comments are too focused on the programmer-related aspects of this. I&#39;ll add a few things.1. It&#39;s not trivial but it&#39;s not that hard if you have a decent vocabulary and some intuitive sense for word frequencies (and word pair frequencies) for different locations in a word. The answer list does not seem to include really hard words as naively picking all the words in the MW dictionary would be. It&#39;s a fun 10-15 minute puzzle.2. Five letter seems like something of a sweet spot.3. The answer word list does not appear to have a lot of plurals or common vowel endings for past tense, etc. Or obscure words.4. It lends itself to what I&#39;ll casual cheating, i.e. there are easy ways to get some hints without giving the answers away while focusing on a strategy.5. Basically, it&#39;s got good gameplay for a casual game. It would be easy to build something along similar lines that didn&#39;t have as fun gameplay for a casual gamer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One more factor in Wordle&#39;s popularity that I haven&#39;t yet seen commentators identify much. The game&#39;s word roster tilts heavily toward words with neutral or cheerful connotations.So your brain conjures up something happy at the end. You don&#39;t slog through the puzzle solving to end up with VIRUS, ENNUI, GRIEF, SLAVE, INANE or other such morose words.Instead, we get the likes of AWAKE, BLUSH, FOCAL, etc. That helps make the game a mood-stabilizer or even brightener. We&#39;re usually clever enough to find a solution most days. When we&#39;re slow and need all six turns, we get a cheery &#34;Whew!&#34; to console us. It&#39;s a simple, barely noticeable bit of gamification at its nicest."</p>

I ran into an issue with proxy_buffering being off yet I was still getting 502 errors because the upstream was passing too large headers for the default 4k buffers. I naively assumed that with proxy buffering off that it would send data to the client immediately and, y&#39;know, not buffer it, as [0] suggests. Turns out that turning proxy_buffering off doesn&#39;t turn proxy buffering completely off.While working on that issue, I also needed to set the proxy buffer size. Quick, what&#39;s the difference between proxy_buffer_size [1] and the size argument of proxy_buffers [2]? I still don&#39;t know, because the docs for each directive sound to me like they&#39;re restating the same exact thing.[0] https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_proxy_module.html#pr...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised the &#34;set a resolver with a dns ttl&#34; isn&#39;t on here; it&#39;s probably my only headache with nginx. If you have an upstream that you specify with a hostname, nginx will lookup the host, cache it, and never refresh it by default.I don&#39;t know why it happens to me so often, but I will set up nginx containers that proxy to some load balanced service (via DNS), and then one day the IPs will change and that service would break because I forgot to set resolver."</p>

In the first week, he had battery drain issues. Even when he put it to sleep, it would drain the battery. He had to keep it plugged in at all times. He tried few distros (including the older version of Ubuntu they recommend) and the problems persisted. His screen also had issues and colors would slightly shift. I lent him my colorimeter and he said the monitor would lose calibration after several days. He also complained about trackpad not tracking his finger properly. In the end, he returned it. I think he said you have 30 days to return it.Hope they fix these issues."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I kinda feel bad for Docker. The prevailing wisdom seems to be that you shouldn&#39;t be using Docker anymore, use Podman. Often the reasons for this is that Podman is daemonless, supports rootless containers, etc. But I feel this is misplaced:- The Docker daemon is actually really useful. It can run containers as other users, perform a bunch of mounting and networking stuff you can&#39;t do as rootless (or at least requires some hacky workarounds), and can monitor/maintain your containers. Podman can do lots of this as well, but requires the use of systemd. So in those cases you&#39;ve just swapped one daemon for another.- For most of my use cases, I don&#39;t really care about rootless. On servers I run all my docker containers as non-root anyway, and if I&#39;m on a workstation I have privileges and don&#39;t need rootless.- Although Podman claims compatibility with Docker, I&#39;ve always found issues with trying to use it even up to a few months ago, prior to this release. Mostly when trying to use compose, although it does improve every release.I basically just view the Docker daemon as an init system like systemd. It&#39;s a privileged daemon that runs other processes. But for some reason it seems to have been made into a bogeyman."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like Podman, and I&#39;m happy to see this new release. This little nugget about non-released features makes me most excited though:&gt; More features, including support for volume mounts from the host, are planned for Podman v4.1, so stay tuned for more updates.IIUC host volume mounts for podman-machine are the last major missing feature in Podman that would allow something like Podman Desktop Companion [1] to replace Docker Desktop on Windows/Mac for most use cases - if it works well. It&#39;d be great to replace that nagging-for-updates and nagging-for-subscriptions with a completely open source replacement tool. (I&#39;m sympathetic to the Docker team in need of a revenue source, but I&#39;m really happy OCI containers on Mac and Windows can be made accessible without vendor lock-in).[1]: https://iongion.github.io/podman-desktop-companion/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there an eli5 or similar on the differences between podman / docker / rancher / others?Feels unexplained (at least for me), how do I know which to choose when and what are the trade offs?I recently went deeper on Rancher Desktop and it’s use of containerd vs dockerd backends and it is totally not obvious what you lose if not using dockerd and how you might fill the gaps. Feels like because docker established the space and put a bunch of related components together (cli, image building, image storing and container running) and other projects make difference choices it can be quite confusing to compare them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From the article:&#34;I often encountered videos that were uploaded again and again, no matter how many times I removed them. One day, a woman emailed me, calmly explained that her ex-boyfriend had uploaded a video of them having sex, and asked me to remove it. I deleted the clip. Later that week, it was re-uploaded. The woman wrote again, I removed it, and this continued for months; I must have pulled the same video down a dozen times. This was before I had ever heard the term “revenge porn.”Requests like this were not uncommon. Once, a woman wrote to say there was a video of her on Tube8 that showed her being sexually assaulted after someone spiked her drink at a party. The video had tens of thousands of views, so I had to review it before making the call to remove it. In the clip, the woman is clearly high, laughing and head lolling, having sex on a bed surrounded by fully dressed people holding drinks and watching as colored lights flashed and music blared in the background. I took it down, but it was uploaded again repeatedly in the following months. Each time, the mortified woman flagged it, and each time, I removed it; both of us were aware that there was nothing we could do to stop the clip from resurfacing.&#34;I have read the same thing from Facebook content moderators.  They got so frustrated at having to watch and take down the same videos over and over.This seems to be such a simple problem to solve:  record a hash of the video file, don&#39;t allow uploading it again.  That would probably get rid of most re-posting.It could be bypassed by modifying the file slightly, but the hashing could also get more sophisticated.  At some point, an ex-boyfriend is not likely to want to keep modifying a video to piss off his ex."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Be careful working in this field (pornography). In 2017 I wrote a mildly pornographic app (http://driftwheeler.com) and it appears on my resume. When hiring managers or recruiters take a look, some of them get upset.For example, a scheduled interview was abruptly cancelled the night before. I pursued the matter through a friend who had a senior role at the hiring company and it was determined that the (middle-aged female) in-house recruiter had been deeply offended when she followed the link on my resume and had cancelled everything. Eventually, I received a sincere apology from the CEO.There is a real stigma, and it will affect you. Beware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; One day, I received inquiries from journalists looking to find out more about Manwin. Believing it was a major threat, I sent off a panicked email to the owner of the company and some vice presidents. My bosses were stunned, and not in a good way. Corey, the guy who had originally hired me, marched me into an office, and I nearly got canned. They had mercy on me. I think they could tell that I was trying to protect the company in my own overzealous, entirely inappropriate way. It was true — I felt like part of a team and wanted to do my best for them. But I had blown it.&gt; After that, with my reputation tarnished, my fortunes at the company started to dwindle.That seems wrong to me, but I&#39;m interested in other people&#39;s responses. It doesn&#39;t seem like &#39;blowing it&#39; at all. How many companies have problems with employees that are too motivated?First, afaik, CEOs generally work to have open lines of communication with their lower level employees - the problem is people not paying attention, not communicating important information, or it getting filtered by the interests of layers in between. Second, Manwin can&#39;t be that big a company. It&#39;s not like emailing the CEO of Microsoft, who has &gt;100,000 people working for them (and again, wouldn&#39;t Satya Nadella just say - &#39;hey, thanks for keeping a sharp eye out and for the heads up. It may look bad, but we&#39;ve seen it many times before. I&#39;m going to forward this to corporate communications, who can handle these things astutely.&#39;)Maybe other companies are just different than the ones I&#39;ve seen."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I fully agree with this. Scanning Google News or a couple of the more professional international news services like BBC / Al Jazeera / Reuters I still feel pretty well informed (and confident that there&#39;s usually nothing of immediate consequence to me) but it doesn&#39;t grow into &#34;expert analysis&#34; or impact my feelings much. Here&#39;s another thing I noticed: how manipulated / manipulative it is. And not just news and I don&#39;t just mean politically - I know everyone thinks that news that doesn&#39;t align with their politics is just brainwashing. Broadcast TV is just generally awful now IMO.We went quite a few years without ever seeing cable. My kids would stream shows and consume other media on-demand, but any advertising was minimal and fairly non-intrusive. And then they were watching a kids show at a hotel once and the ads came on and the effect it had on them was crazy. They suddenly desperately needed all the toys in the commercials and were repeating catch phrases from ads after only seeing them a couple of times. The contrast in their behavior was insane. And they HAD to keep watching it like I hadn&#39;t seen before. I spent a week off-grid with my parents a while back and it was great. We came home and my Mom put on the news suddenly everything was terrible and she was angry, but she had to keep watching.Just awful for mental health if you can&#39;t separate yourself from it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As someone who just stepped back into pop culture after being in prison for years (so might as well been on the moon) my first shock was just how horrible it all is now. There is no news worth watching. Cable news is just a pile of filth excremented by a Labrador Retriever that solely eats baby diapers. I thought I will watch Bloomberg since if real money is involved it can&#39;t be too manipulative. Nope, wrong. The internet is just a fireheap. Let&#39;s check Reddit. Oh god close the browser window immediately. WTF? Slashdot? Um, what is this, someone wearing a Slashdot skin suit? How about the sites by supposedly rational academics on each side of the political persuasion to get some balance. WTF? Just hate and anger and toxicity on a crazy level otherizing any opinion not their own. People are once thought great intellectual insides making incredibly uncharitable frankly hate filled comments and self isolating in echo chambers. Google Discovery app... &#34;here&#39;s some blog posts summarizing relationship posts made on Reddit&#34;. Huh? Why would anyone want to read this let alone have it further aggregated for them? Seriously, modern American discourse has less humanity, compassion, depth, and recognition of nuance THAN PRISON. Or maybe prison just made me less patient of bull crap and able to immediate horrible people by their mannerisms. Seriously this site is the only place I have found still sane and enlightening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I strongly agree with this. I would, however, like to call out one TV program here in the U.S. that I think comes much closer to approximating the experience of “reading a 5,000-word article”: PBS NewsHour. It’s great, completely free and available to watch online, and you can even get most of what you need from their podcast alone (https://www.pbs.org/newshour/feeds/rss/podcasts/segments).It consists of fairly in-depth, thoughtful coverage of both domestic and worldwide news topics, as well as a tiny bit of political analysis on Mondays and Fridays. It almost never devolves into the breathless, “the world is about to end”-type coverage found on basically all cable news programs. Judy Woodruff and her team are really great. I dearly miss Gwen Ifill and Jim Lehrer.The Economist is also a great resource, as has been pointed out by other commenters here. They publish an audio edition of each week’s newspaper, too."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I avoid all things Samsung for a much more important reason: They spy on you mercilessly, up to about the same level as Facebook.For example, they take screenshots of what you watch on your Samsung Televisions!Don&#39;t believe me? Take it from them: https://www.samsung.com/us/business/samsungads/resources/tv-... and https://www.samsung.com/us/business/samsungads/insights/You&#39;re not their customer, you&#39;re the product.Additionally, Samsung have a habit of releasing forced updates that almost-but-not-entirely brick their TVs, slowing them down to molasses. They do this right before the next model becomes available for purchase.Last but not least, a colleague worked there as a consultant, and his stories of their lax IT security were nearly unbelievable. Even though they spy on you like Google or Facebook, they are not like a FAANG when it comes to protecting your private info! They&#39;ve been hacked for sure, probably by multiple nation state actors. Whatever you watch or do with their TVs is being relayed to the US, Russians, Chinese, or whomever. Assume that nothing you do with a Samsung device or Samsung software is remotely secure or safe.They&#39;re a slimy company made up of unscrupulous people trying to squeeze every last drop out of every rock.Don&#39;t give them your money. There are many other companies with much better track records."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am truly, deeply, unsurprised that foldable phones fail along the seam.I know that&#39;s not the point of the post, and I&#39;m not blaming the author. It just seems like such a ridiculous concept in the first place. My old flip phone had its own problems, and there wasn&#39;t even a display along the seam."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So the author had a folding phone that failed and couldn&#39;t get it repaired/replaced. The narrow take is that you&#39;re kinda crazy to buy a folding phone but Samsung was selling them so is really on the hook for the inevitable issues.The story of getting it fixed is really why people love Apple and even Amazon.I&#39;ve had the Wifi go unreliable on an iPad. I got a Genius appointment for later that day. They confirmed the Wifi module was shot and just gave me a new device on the spot. They even offered to do the transfer for me. This sort of convenience is what gives people confidence in buying Apple products.Even something as simple as accessory access matters. If my Macbook charger dies, I can walk into any number of stores and buy another. Dell charger? Not so much.Amazon has pretty accurate shipping estimates. This matters. So does Apple for the record. Just last week I got sent the wrong product. I didn&#39;t have to talk to anyone on the phone. I simply went to my order on my phone and clicked &#34;return item&#34; -&gt; &#34;wrong product&#34; and the entire matter was dealt with.I don&#39;t want to deal with support that is deliberately hard to contact that is monetarily motivated to not do anything for you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I changed careers at 40+ years old.  I&#39;m very happy that I did it.People have all sorts of constructs / ideas about how careers work (based on experience) or how they think it works, or how they want it to work.   I talk to some college graduates who tell me what they&#39;re planning for and have ZERO clue what industry they&#39;re talking about, their description is unrecognizable to me ... even tho I know it is the one I work in.I find your experience and paths can vary greatly company to company, even job to job.We all find truths we want to hold on to about work.   I recall trips to the valley where my coworkers where astonished to hear tales of people doing the same work they did, but doing it slightly differently elsewhere in the country.  Their view of how that job was done was entirely shaped by the couple places they worked (and everyone seemed to cycle through those couple companies).   You&#39;d think these folks though that if you didn&#39;t fill out the TPS report right to left that the world would end... I&#39;m pretty sure the vast majority of people fill them out left to right but I didn&#39;t feel like telling them that, it might have been too much for them to handle.&#34;
I think there are three main kinds of career destination, at least in the tech industry:    Independent
    Senior individual contributor (IC)
    Management
&#34;I have no idea why those are the only destinations ... for an article worried about being happy that seems kind of limited.The whole article feels very pie in the sky to me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;It&#39;s not surprising, then, that many of us find ourselves in less than fully satisfying jobs, with doubtful or non-existent prospects for advancement.&#34;Very true.

I&#39;m not sure why it needs to be made over and over again, but it seems that&#39;s the only way it doesn&#39;t get buried.Let&#39;s play a game. I will be the institution, you will be the person. You will get ability to record me with your cellphone and post stuff online to complain about various issues. I will get the ability to see all your financial transactions, listen to all your communications, track your location, arrest you when I don&#39;t like you recording me, smear you online and pressure companies to ban you from literally any service imaginable, including banking.Both of us will be bound by the legal framework, but when I don&#39;t like it, I will have the ability declare the state of emergency and scrap all the rules. Also, I will have sovereign immunity when I break the rules. Also, many of my actions will be secret because of national security.Oh, and I will be doing all the things described above using your money.Sounds fair?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Exactly correct.Anyone who is applauding this, just imagine the opposite political party in power using this against you or organizations you support.  This is why no one should have been happy when executive orders became the norm in the US and congress did nothing.  This is how you lose a senate and gain a Caesar, and look what happen to Rome eventually…Debanking someone who can now no longer pay for thier own defense is crazy overreach.  Absolute power corrupts absolutely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The simple answer is to reject the cashless society.In the medium to long term it&#39;s simply incompatible with any reasonable definition of freedom. Surveillance is bad enough, but a system that allows governments to arbitrarily &#34;turn off&#34; thousands or millions of people at the push of a button is too powerful to not be abused.Even the mere existence of such a system has a chilling effect. Which I suspect is precisely what these people want and is exactly why we can&#39;t give it to them.I&#39;ll take inconvenience over slavery any day of the week.This isn&#39;t some sort of anarcho-libertarian paradise opinion, I have no issue with there being a well functioning justice system.But yeah, if you want to seize assets, get a court order and go and lock someone in a box and take their things, don&#39;t take the cowardly way out and pretend that you&#39;ve just flipped a database key and it&#39;s not really a big deal.By the same token, if you tell me there&#39;s been a murder on my street I&#39;ll give you the CCTV footage of my door cam. If you ask me for a backdoor, I&#39;ll tell you where to shove it. That&#39;s what being a member of a free society is, that seemingly minor distinction is one of the most important things we have and better minds than mine have sought to elaborate on why.Even a child is able to understand that force is still force regardless of whether it involves the direct visible physical kind."</p>

While I&#39;m pretty smart myself, they all have something I don&#39;t always have:  The ability to be happy in any situation and interested in everything.For example, we were walking trough a hallway. On a wall is an old, damaged, ugly map of my country, half covered with graffiti.  I&#39;d walked past it almost every day for half a year.He checks it out, and starts noticing a lot of semi-interesting factoids about names, merged cities, obscure places, old mapping conventions, etc...  All of this with an absolute positive energy of pure interest.  We spent a fun hour just looking at it.  I should have known all this, and yet an hour with him makes me look at it with new eyes.Wherever he was, he instantly attracted a group of friends and wannabe girlfriends, and never really seemed to notice.  Same in this case:  There was a group of beautiful partygirls we&#39;d never met before, no nerdy interests at all, which accreted around the map in less than 5 minutes. They loved the situation just as much as us nerds did.I learned a lot from him, and try to follow this example, but I still can&#39;t do this today and am humiliated (in a positive way) by this way of living."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; we suggest that leaders follow the science and take a structured approach to hiring for, promoting, and developing employee happiness&gt; Measure happiness in both employees and job candidates.&gt; we conservatively advocate using measures of happiness and optimism as discriminators, or tiebreakers, because the risks are low and the benefits could be important.Good luck getting a job, unhappy people…I don’t think they have the evidence to make this recommendation, since they surveyed people already employed (by the US army), who may have been unhappier pre employment.&gt; might dismiss these results if you believe that military data somehow doesn’t apply to the business world, but you would be wrong to do so. After all, the U.S. Department of Defense is the single largest employer in the worldTheir entire argument for this also applying outside the military domain seems to be that the military is a very large employer… However, is not the military a vastly different environment from normal civilian workplaces?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Reading these comments is forehead slap inducing. People think that just because something is mental that it has to do with your mindset, your parents, your this your that.When a dude can run faster than other people, it’s written off as genetics. When someone is resilient to depression, it’s anything other than genetics. Both cases are the same: it’s just biological.I’ve been suffering super hard with depression recently and it’s made something clear to me: your mindset is bullshit. It might tip things one way or another but the actual mechanisms of depression will change your life. Everyone will be super humbled when we figure out how to turn off depression, and everyone gets it and everyone experienced on average a 50% boost to their intelligence and productivity. They will be humbled because they will realize that all of that relative suffering was totally pointless and for no other reason than a quirk of evolution. And that some people had it good for absolutely no reason. But it’s exciting to know that this day will come and it can’t come fast enough for me!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Cool demonstration of regular expression power!
Note that as implemented, this is a space bounded Turing Machine with a hardcoded tape length limit:&gt; With the current implementation, the read/write head looks at the 22nd element of the tape whenever we want to read the current position. With complicated machines that utilize long lengths of the tape, you would need to increase this number so that you never delete a necessary tape element as you scroll along it. This can be done by increasing the {20} that appears at the beginning of the expression.Embedding the tape head pointer ^ within the tape, just to the left of the scanned bit, should remove this restriction."</p>

   execution parameters for both inputs.
   W the output to be written to the tape at the current position. Either 0 or 1.

   left. A 1 moves it to the right.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve seen a lot of commentary about the fact that the Emergencies Act provisions &#34;expire&#34; automatically after 30 days, and include &#34;safeguards&#34;, ergo there&#39;s nothing worry about. People getting hung up on the text of the bill forget that it&#39;s merely an Act of Parliament, and thus can easily be amended or replaced via a simple majority vote.What played out last night indicates that none of these checks and balances really matter in a parliamentary system where the nuclear option of a non-confidence vote (and subsequent election) can be invoked to force any MPs with qualms to vote along party lines.It&#39;s easy to see what will happen next, based on this government&#39;s track record: they will introduce amendments to the Act, or new legislation containing only the provisions they would like to make permanent, and once again proclaim that voting against the amendment will result in a new election.They will probably also use it as an excuse to ram through their &#34;Online Harms Bill&#34;, i.e. internet censorship, targeted at &#34;misinformation&#34; (disagreeable speech) and, many suspect, independent media outlets that the PM despises.Internet censorship + government-directed financial de-platforming = Canada&#39;s near-term future if the situation doesn&#39;t change somehow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Occupy Wall Street was started by a group of organized Canadians and they blocked access to NYSE facilities. OWS was obviously an occupation (it’s right there in the name), but the better question is: was OWS a protest, too? If so, why can’t this be called one as well?There are generally more parallels between OWS and the truckers than people are willing to recognize, because there’s been a hell of an inversion: if you supported OWS 10 years ago you probably don’t like the truckers today and if you like the truckers you probably weren’t for OWS 10 years ago. There are a handful of Tim Pools that like both, and there are elites that disliked both, but the average person has to do some gymnastics.All that I ask is that everyone is consistent: if OWS is a protest, then this is too. If you don’t like that Americans funded the truckers, you have to be willing to call out that OWS took place in NYC but formed from a Canadian nonprofit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A related report from the BBC (published a few days ago):Europe gas prices: How far is Russia responsible? https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/58888451Some key points in the BBC article:- Russia supplies about 40% of the EU’s natural gas imports. Most of the rest comes from Norway and Algeria.- Russia sends gas to Europe through several main pipelines - such as the Nord Stream, the Yamal-Europe and the Brotherhood (see the map in the article).- Overall, Russian gas exports to Europe have been decreasing over the last couple of years - down 32% in February this year compared to February 2020. One factor - during the pandemic - has been falling demand as economic activity shrank. Stocks of gas across Europe have been depleted, which in turn is driving up prices.- Gazprom, Russia&#39;s majority state-owned energy company, supplies gas to Europe under two different arrangements: 1. Long-term contracts often lasting from 10 to 25 years. 2. &#34;Spot&#34; deals or one-off purchases for a fixed amount of gas.- It is understood that Gazprom met its obligations to European buyers last year under these contracts.- &#34;Spot&#34; sales don&#39;t appear to be happening in any significant quantity, going by data from Gazprom&#39;s own electronic sales platform.- The International Energy Agency&#39;s executive director, Fatih Birol, has accused Russia of reducing gas supplies to Europe for political purposes.- Gas storage across Europe is well below the 10-year average, with levels currently at about 75% of storage capacity, according to Gas Infrastructure Europe data."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That is not remotely pulling the plug. This is &#34;thinking about it&#34; again. They already stopped accreditation a few weeks ago, otherwise it would already transport gas as the pipeline is already filled. They just say that they have officially stopped the process which they more or less already did. I think in a year it might come online again if the news cycle is on another topic.Overall it will be much more expensive for Europe than for Russia. Who do you think will profit the most if gas prices hike?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here&#39;s some quick numbers I just googled to understand the big picture.This pipeline has an annual capacity of 55 billion cubic meters. It&#39;s the same capacity as the Nord Stream 1, which is already in operation. If Germany was truly meaning business, they&#39;d stop Nord Stream 1 the moment Russian boots enter Ukrainian territory. But let&#39;s leave that aside.55 billion cubic meters translate to about 0.6 billion MWh. The price today for natural gas Dutch TTF futures is EUR 78/MWh [1] , so that translates in about 40 billion EUR per year.  It has been as low as EUR 13 and as high as EUR 165 over the last 2 years. It&#39;s quite likely that Russia would make a profit even at the lower range, so the 40 billion EUR/year is pretty much pure profit for them.[1] https://www.theice.com/products/27996665/Dutch-TTF-Gas-Futur..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank goodness. Bethesda&#39;s launcher was uniquely awful in a number of unpleasant ways. Slow, prone to crashes, bad user communication, not suitable for use on small monitors. The worst of the launcher apps I have used - and there are so many!I remember when it was in vogue for every game maker to build their own launcher or even full Steam clone - when EA pulled all its new games from Steam to get people to use Origin, when Ubisoft forced uPlay on you no matter how you bought the game, and so on. Now, it seems like we&#39;re pulling back from that situation somewhat - a lot of EA games are back on Steam, for example.I wonder whether the experiment didn&#39;t work, or if it worked, but now the goals have changed again?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there a technical reason why Steam is a such a force in the space? People, myself certainly included, often criticize Apple for taking 30% of developer revenue for merely existing in it&#39;s walled garden. Right or wrong, they control the ecosystem, so their ability to monopolize and heavily tax the App Store is unsurprising, they&#39;re exercising their pricing power as much as they possibly can.But how is it that on PC, where we have a mostly open field on which anyone can participate freely without a gatekeeper&#39;s blessing, Steam managed to consolidate so much of the gaming marketplace that even a titan like Microsoft is throwing the towel and bowing to Steam&#39;s cartelish 30%? I get that being the dominant two-sided marketplace of a given space is a strong network effect and moat, and consolidation is certainly convenient for users (I like having all my purchased games on a single account), but intuition tells me Bethesda doesn&#39;t need Steam&#39;s exposure to sell games or make new arrivals known (their announcement will go viral regardless), similarly to Riot, Mojang, Epic and co not listing on Steam. So I&#39;ve always found it surprising they were dual listing their games in the first place, but the fact they&#39;re now entirely giving up on direct selling is a testament to Steam&#39;s might in the gaming industry.Is Steam&#39;s product particularly good and hard to reproduce from the publisher&#39;s PoV, even one backed by Microsoft, to the extent it is hard to compete against with something like Microsoft Store? Or is this just another case of being early enough to establish the initial brand and let the self-fulfilling network effect kick in - with the userbase acting like gravity to bring in more users and developers - until it&#39;s large enough that sheer force of habit/inertia makes it quasi-&#34;indisruptible&#34;?Either way, I found it fascinating how Valve turned into Steam, whether it was accidental or not, what a homerun pivot. Seems that is the way of the Internet, being first matters more than just about anything, having the superior product (not claiming there is one for game stores) is irrelevant if you&#39;re remotely late, it just won&#39;t matter how much cash you pour into a Microsoft Store or a Google+. My gut tells me Microsoft is salivating at the idea of buying out Steam, seems like a perfect fit for the conglomerate if it wasn&#39;t for the scrutiny it would bring their way while they are positioning themselves as the good FAAMG."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a matter of principle, I think digital delivery platforms benefit from competition, and we should not be locked down into a single monopolistic, stagnating platform.As a selfish consumer though, I hugely wish we just had Steam and Netflix:The Origins and Uplays and Battle.nets of the world exist solely to make my life difficult, refusing to play my game when I want it due to obscure update required or forgotten password or old email account (especially when they are an overlay on top of Steam), and have zero repeat zero positively zero benefit to myself as a consumer. It is blatantly anti-consumer, and not made with customer view in mind.(Gog.com gets a pass because it allows me to JUST download the game, with no launcher and crap, so essentially going into opposite direction from all publisher-owned platforms and provides a unique value proposition)Same for Netflix.  It&#39;s fine. It&#39;s good. It&#39;s great! Over the last 5 years, proliferation of Disneys, Amazons, HBOs, Hulus, CBS All Access, Paramount Ultra Plus Exclusive Diamond Platinum... the whatEVERs, all they do is make me have to guess which  service is content I want to play on. All they are, at any level, is &#34;we want more money for less consumer convenience, and we think we can get away with it due to exclusive content lock-in we refuse to license to the convenient platform&#34;.I understand I&#39;m supposed to vote with my money, but with exclusive lock-in that&#39;s difficult.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I always liked the embedded system model where you get flash hardware that has two operations -- erase block and write block.  GC, RAID, error correction, etc. are then handled at the application level.  It was never clear to me that the current tradeoff with consumer-grade SSDs was right.  On the one hand, things like the error correction, redundancy, and garbage collection don&#39;t require the attention from CPU (and more importantly, doesn&#39;t tie up any bus).  On the other hand, the user has no control over what the software on the SSD&#39;s chip does.  Clearly vendors and users are at odds with each other here; vendors want the best benchmarks (so you can sort by speed descending and pick the first one), but users want their files to exist after their power goes out.It would be nice if we could just buy dumb flash and let the application do whatever it wants (I guess that application would be your filesystem; but it could also be direct access for specialized use cases like databases).   If you want maximum speed, adjust your settings for that.  If you want maximum write durability, adjust your settings for that.  People are always looking for that one size fits all use case, but it&#39;s hard here.  Some people may be running cloud providers and already have software to store that block on 3 different continents.  Some people may be an embedded system with a fixed disk image that changes once a year, with some temporary storage for logs.  There probably isn&#39;t a single setting that gets optimal use out of the flash memory for both use cases.  The cloud provider doesn&#39;t care if a block, flash chip, drive, server rack, availability zone, or continent goes away.  The embedded system may be happy to lose logs in exchange for having enough writes left to install the next security update.It&#39;s all a mess, but the constraints have changed since we made the mess.  You used to be happy to get 1/6th of a PCI Express lane for all your storage.  Now processors directly expose 128 PCIe lanes and have a multitude of underused efficiency cores waiting to be used.  Maybe we could do all the &#34;smart&#34; stuff in the OS and application code, and just attach commodity dumb flash chips to our computer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; It is obvious that Swift has outgrown my influence, and some of the design premises I care about (e.g. &#34;simple things that compose&#34;)As someone who was heavily invested in Swift, and an active member of the community from around 2015-2019, I&#39;m a bit sad to see the direction the language is taking.From the time I started experimenting with Swift, I absolutely loved the philosophy of the language.  It seemed to really prioritize having a set of well-factored systems, each with their own very rationally designed interfaces, which could be composed to do really powerful things.  It was an incredibly expressive language which allowed for writing code with an incredible level of clarity - when writing Swift code I always felt I was writing at the level of the problem domain, not writing syntax.  At the same time it offered really nice features for ensuring safety and correctness, like ADT&#39;s and best-in-class nullability syntax.It was a language which sometimes seemed to move at a glacial pace, but the implicit tradeoff was that when a feature landed, it was for the most part very well thought out, and would add to the language with minimal negative impact.A few years ago that seemed to start to change.  From my perspective, some of the features added to the language to support SwiftUI - specifically property wrappers and function builders - very much felt rushed and forced into the language based on external deadlines.  And imo they have a largely negative impact on the language: it used to be the case that you could look at a piece of Swift code and roughly understand how it would compile to assembly pretty easily, but with these new features there&#39;s a ton of compiler magic going on behind the scenes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I clicked on this thread because I knew exactly what I wanted to comment about, and was surprised to see that Chris mentioned exactly it in his message:&gt;After several discussions generating more heat than light, when my formal proposal review comments and concerns were ignored by the unilateral accepts, and the general challenges with transparency working with core team, I decided that my effort was triggering the same friction with the same people, and thus I was just wasting my time.I stopped paying attention to Swift for this exact reason. I have actually submitted and implemented a feature in Swift and I think it was one of my most frustrating experiences with open-source projects. It seems that almost every thread in this forum devolves into people fighting over the most irrelevant details, and my proposal specifically took months to be submitted into review because a couple of users simply refused to back down from how they personally wanted it to work, ignoring the actual problem the feature aimed to solve. After a long time deflecting the comments, the feature was accepted the way I originally intended and I never entered the forum again.Example aside, it doesn&#39;t take a proposal to see that almost every thread in the forum looks like this. Open sourcing Swift has benefits, but I think when it comes to the actual progress of the project, this particular democratic process was a mistake."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Key takeaway for me was the note that it “definitely isn’t a community designed language”. This is telling, I’ve watched a lot of neat languages over the years and absolutely none of the ones without community involvement have grown beyond the sphere of influence of their primary companies.I like swift enough I’m learning it to build my own personal tech nerd ideal podcast client because I own apple devices and want an app that works between macOS, iOS, iPadOS, tvOS,and watchOS. but I doubt I’ll ever use it for anything beyond this one personally motivated project. Even if i release it as an app on the store for download or purchase I don’t know if I will ever be motivated enough to build anything else using it. Because the scope is too narrow. Business work is converging on open stacks like react, and angular, and the dark horse of C# with its latest release supporting WASM web components backed by GRPC-web and a C# function driven stack from front to back, even without SQL Server costs this is a compelling ecosystem backed by PostgreSQL and other completely open source tools.But Swift remains Apple’s language for apple stuff and… while a profitable niche, it’s still a niche.Edit: typo fix."</p>

Then ask me to make a video of myself.I didn&#39;t create the account and booked an hotel.Now they are less aggressive with their new procedures, but still, you can see that the people behind it see technical solutions way before they perceive the human impact.My grand-father was like that. A brilliant engineer from the most elite school of his generation in France. He once told me very seriously a solution for making more accommodations for the poorest people would be to remove individual bathrooms, and create common ones for the whole building instead.Airbnb tech teams remind me of him."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Validation on holdout sets.When I was a student in the 1990s, I was taught about hypothesis testing (and all the hassle of p-fishing etc.), and about Bayesian inference (which is lovely, until you have to invent priors over the model space -- e.g. a prior over neural network architectures). These are both systems that tie themselves in epistemological knots when trying to answer the simple question &#34;What model shall I use?&#34;Holdout set validation is such a clean simple idea, and so easy to use (as long as you have big data), and it does away with all the frequentist and Bayesian tangle, which is why it&#39;s so widespread in ML nowadays.It also aligns statistical inference with Popper&#39;s idea of scientific falsifiability -- scientists test their models against a new experimental data, data scientists can test their model against qualitatively different holdout sets. (Just make sure you don&#39;t get your holdout set by shuffling, since that&#39;s not what Popper would call a &#34;genuine risky validation&#34;.)The article mentions Breiman&#39;s &#34;alternative view of the foundations of statistics based on prediction rather than modeling&#34;. Breiman does make a big deal of evaluation on holdout sets; but his &#34;prediction&#34; idea isn&#39;t general enough, since it doesn&#39;t accommodate generative modelling (e.g. GPT, GANs). I think it&#39;s better to frame ML in terms of &#34;evaluating model fit on a holdout set&#34;, since that accommodates both predictive and generative modelling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Off-the-cuff, i.e. without digging deeply into a set of history of statistics books:Tied 1st place:• Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm• Hidden Markov Models and the Viterbi algorithm for most probable sequence in linear time• Vapnik–Chervonenkis theory of statistical learning (Vladimir Naumovich Vapnik &amp; Alexey Chervonenkis) and SVMs4th place:• Edwin Jaynes: maximum entropy for constructing priors (borderline: 1957)Honorable mentions:• Breiman et al.&#39;s CART (Classification and Regression Trees) algorithm (and Quinlan&#39;s C5.0 extension)• Box–Jenkins method (autoregressive moving average (ARMA) / autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) to find the best fit of a time-series model to past values of a time series)(The beginning of the 20th century was much more fertile in comparison - Kolmogorov, Fisher, Gosset, Aitken, Cox, de Finetti, Kullback, the Pearsons, Spearman etc.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a side issue, but I wonder what changes could be made to the teaching of statistics, most importantly &#34;stats for scientists&#34; taught in college and even high school. What occurs to me right off the bat is that I learned stats by the use of formulas to boil data sets down to answers. For example, null hypothesis significance testing and the dreaded p-value. We had to do it this way, as widespread availability of computers was still on the horizon.Today, computation is easy and cheap. I wonder if we could learn stats in a different way, perhaps starting by just playing with data, and simulated random numbers, graphing, and so forth. Can something like null hypothesis testing be taught primarily through bootstrapping, with the formulas introduced as an aside?Yes I know that statistics is a formal branch of math, with theorems and proofs. I took that class. But the students who take &#34;stats for scientists&#34; don&#39;t ever see that side of it. Understanding the formulas without seeing the proofs is like trying to learn freshman physics without calculus."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love the idea of nix but the inconsistency and developer experience is terrible.   I want to suggest people use it but there is too many rough edges currently.For example, if you want to install a package the old way, you&#39;ll install it including the channel:    nix-env -iA nixpkgs.ripgrep


but then if you want to remove one, you don&#39;t reference the channel:    nix-env -e ripgrep

You have a similar issue if you want to use the new `nix` command.  To install a package you&#39;ll do:    nix profile install nixpkgs#ripgrep


but running:    nix profile remove nixpkgs#ripgrep


will do nothing.  It won&#39;t say &#34;I didn&#39;t remove the package&#34; or &#34;package not found&#34;.  It just returns silently.    The only way to remove it is to point to the number from `nix profile history` or the actual path.It is unbearably slow:    &gt; time nix-env -qaP ripgrep
    nixpkgs.ripgrep  ripgrep-13.0.0

    11.17s user 2.70s system 73% cpu 18.970 total


Overall I love the idea but it has a long way to go in developer experience and quality before it is ready for any mainstream adoption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"  &gt; Nix often scares newcomers and experienced devs alike, because it proposes a fairly radical overhaul to how we think about package management and how we run software in general.

I am not sure this is the main put-off of nix.Ideologically, I love nix. The syntax/language itself is a massive barrier IMO.I use Nix for personal projects, but I prefer the experience of Devcontainers. They&#39;re easier to understand and debug (for me).I&#39;m watching eagerly the work being done by the ostree/rpm-ostree folks who are also trying to solve for a similar problem. Hoping to see something like &#34;Nix but with YAML/JSON&#34; come out of that.https://ostree.readthedocs.io/en/stable/manual/related-proje..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been running NixOS and uxing Nix for almost everything since I switched to it, and my experience has been great so far. It is one versatile solution to a lot of applications:1. I run NixOs on on laptop and workstation, for work and for personal use. Any change to the configuration can be immediately transfered to other machines. And give me a new machine, I can quickly bring it up with the configuration that I am always using.
2. I run NixOS on my home server and machine learning cluster. Deploy experiment and service on them is as simple as updating the git-managed configurations. Meanwhile, if I want to use more power to run an experiment, NixOps can quickly bring up a set of machines on AWS with the configuration identical to my local experiment. You do not need to worry about setting up CUDA/pytorch and other dependencies every.
3. In my start-up, it definitely took more time to train the developers to learn Nix, but once they get familiar, everyone becomes a good DevOps engineer, which solves development environemnt (that invloves C++/Python), CI/CD and release really well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Great if it works for you, but for those who are dealing with babies, I wouldn&#39;t beat myself up if this advice doesn&#39;t apply. The parenting advice world is chock full of people who found something that worked for them and who then made the unwarranted conclusion that it is universal truth. For example, their techniques that &#34;always work&#34; definitely do not always work. Maybe they always worked for their particular babies, but I have been in situations with my kids where neither shushing and patting nor holding and walking worked to stop crying.My general feeling is that you can drive yourself nuts trying to figure out why your baby is crying, and, as the blog author mentioned in his conclusion, you may still be unable to figure it out. IMO this is a great time of one&#39;s life to discard the illusion of control."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Newly minted dad of twins and uncle for 5 others.Infant phaseThe work is intense when they are young since they can’t do much on their own and need help very often. But this doesn’t last for too long. Most parents exaggerate this phase since it is very intense from their otherwise happy days without kids. I had enough nephews and nieces around that I helped with so my kids are not the first time I am doing something this intense.Toddler phaseThey are very manageable because of their size. Not those helpless poor little things any more. But they need to be entertained. Having others kids help a lot here. One more reason to have more than one kids. Only kids can match kids energy level.Beyond infantsThis is when things get interesting they start engaging with you a lot with words and actions.Most of the problems with millennials for fear of having kids got to do with not having much experience before having their own. So they get overwhelmed, this is very specific to societies with lack of communities (western urban societies).Once your friends have kids they are out of your circle since they cannot come out and do as much as they used to do.With medical advancements and tools available to raise a child it is lot easier to raise kids than before. Over focusing on parenthood is also another issue. This is product of abundance of time and money. My mom of 3 children didn’t have tools and time to engage with us like our generation do. She did exceptionally well without over indulging in the name of parenthood.Note: I am leaning game development and reading books while having full time job and having twins as my first children on my own at 40.It’s totally doable. Try being around your friends with kids, that’s helpful for them as well as you.Most rewarding thing and easily attainable for most of us is to raise children never forget the entertainment and stress buster aspect of having kids as well.Once a wise women from the east said to us raised in the west: If you can have pets I don’t seem to understand your issues having kids.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like we have so much leverage and don&#39;t use it at all.We&#39;re still attending stand-ups every day with non programmers telling us when we can and cannot refactor. It&#39;s nuts to me that a skilled profession - that not many can do - lets themselves get micro-managed like this.If anyone has read Developer Hegemony, I&#39;m fully on board with that general premise - we start operating like lawyers with partnerships, and turn bosses into customers. Though that does require us to think of ourselves as professionals not nerds who are too smart for business."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it ends with everyone becoming a developer.Making machines do things will never end. However, the tools for making machines do things is evolving very quickly.The general art of being a developer will continue to get specialized and at some point specialists at any field would be expected to be able to program their machines.Very few people are learning how to run their servers and much more are moving into AWS type of infrastructure and “cloud literacy” has become a thing.I would expect layers of abstraction to continue to build up and programming to become something like using spreadsheets to do your actual task.Eventually, “true programming” will scale back to building these tools. It would be rather niche, very high skill serious engineering - an elite, hard to get in profession that continues to fetch high salaries. They probably will have some kind of association similar to the lawyers/doctors, the code they write will no longer tolerate bugs as a fact of life but they will be responsible as any other licensed professionals. Skipping unit test will land you in jail or very high fine due to malpractice if something goes wrong."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Programmers are increasingly needed for *everything*.I mean, we&#39;ve entered an age, where a farmer can&#39;t milk their cows, if the software of the milking robot has a hitch - can&#39;t plow their fields, when the gps-software that drives the tractor isn&#39;t working.Apart from that, programming is becoming every other job - as far as domain knowledge is concerned.I&#39;ve personally experienced (multiple times!) professional accounting companies complaining about not being able to just modify official invoices (totally illegal) but having to cancel and re-issue them with a new invoice number (how it MUST be done).
-&gt; It&#39;s now the responsibility of the programmers to understand how accounting works. Professional accountants just click a button and expect the software to &#34;do the right thing&#34;.
-&gt; As in this case, the professional accountant no longer adds much value, they&#39;ll probably be entirely replaced by software at some point.A more relatable example might be Taxis drivers. It might take years still, but at some point, all Taxis will be self-driving vehicles, created by robots in a fully automated factory. Programmers will be needed for the driving software and the factory software. You might still need some mechanics to repair the factory robots - until when that job is done by robots as well (that have to be programmed).It currently seems more likely to me, that we are headed towards a future, where programming is the *only* job - and everything else is done by software."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"An interesting quick dive into how some of the artifacts of historical implementations can carry forward decades later. I&#39;m saving this one. While everyone on HN is probably familiar with a pile of examples of this in our own work particularly if you do anything lower level, this is a nice example because it&#39;s really easy to grasp even for total non-programmers and gives a feel for the layers upon layers the digital world is built on. Details on the x86-64 bootstrap sequence are interesting to tech people but this is the sort of thing I might show in a school class.That said at first I thought the author was being a bit tongue in cheek on the suggestion to fix it with:&gt;A downside to making any changes is that the badly formatted GIFs won&#39;t render any more. I reckon just be bold, like the release of Netscape 2.0...If Netscape was fine with breaking poorly-made GIFs, we should be too!But we kind of have a bit more content now then when Netscape 2 was released, and it seems they&#39;re serious?  Support more than 256 colours in a single frame of GIF animation
  Support fast GIFs (10ms delay)
  No confusing behaviour with small delay = slow GIF
  Better compression for GIFs with multiple small areas updated per frame

But frankly at this point why? We&#39;ve got good universally adapted image formats that do more than 256 colors. We&#39;ve got webm and so on (even Apple caved on that one in the end) for baked animation which is much smaller and more powerful than gif, and plenty of CPU and libraries for generation on the fly. We&#39;ve got powerful ways to do animation purely with HTML/CSS/SVG/JS. GIF is a historical artifact with a lot of its value at this point purely about old things. This wouldn&#39;t even retroactively bring newer capabilities to older systems because it would require updated code which by definition means the ability to run new browsers and thus modern capabilities.I get they really enjoy hacking on gif but come on. Only way I can see it working is if all the players agreed on some metadata that could be added to gifs which wanted &#39;standards&#39; vs &#39;historical&#39; playback with the default remaining historical, and potentially also make it a browser setting. That&#39;d still leave the ad issue, but maybe at this point that&#39;s moot given the advancements in blockers (and it&#39;d be a very easy thing to look for as an indication of an ad, and thus be selected against)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I like the ”Internet Explorer 5 is closed source, but could hypothetically look something like this” bit.Is this source code available through MS partnership programs or an old leak?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rate limiting or clamping &#34;0&#34; delays upwards can also help for polling applications where you want to be as fast as possible, but you&#39;re never going to be actually zero. For example if you have a thread that&#39;s pulling images from a camera (publishing at 30 fps) in a loop, you can delay for 1ms between polls and nobody is going to know, but that can have an enormous impact on CPU usage; especially on embedded platforms. Instead of running at 100% thread usage (calling camera.read() and waiting for it to return true), the spin/loop cost is basically free and you only need to worry about the cost of acquiring/decoding the frame. In theory branch prediction should help because you&#39;ll take the &#34;no image yet&#34; branch 99% of the time, but in practice that just makes the loop iterate faster. I learned this the hard way writing a custom camera publisher in ROS, but I&#39;ve seen it a lot in tutorial code and I think a lot of beginners make that mistake."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Sometimes the initial rotation hides a part of the shape.Also, I have always wondered if there&#39;s a way to translate these shapes to strings for quick &#34;mental algorithm&#34; matching. Something like, &#34;5, left turn, 3, right turn...&#34;I guess you&#39;d need a normal form. The first turn can be defined as always &#34;right&#34; or &#34;left,&#34; and subsequent turns can be right, left, up or down. The first turn that&#39;s &#34;up&#34; or &#34;down,&#34; can be defined as &#34;up.&#34; That leaves two ways to read any shape, but that&#39;s an uhh constant-factor overhead. :)(I can&#39;t think of a way to define a normal form reading direction that wouldn&#39;t involve potentially reading an arbitrary distance in before having to re-start the other way.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"IMO this would be more enjoyable if the shapes were more different morphologically, and fewer (ideally no) close pairs which differ only in the length of a segment by a single block.After the first couple of wrong guesses (though I&#39;m pretty sure one guess was correct - could be the bug https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30408567) I started to count segment lengths rather than relying on mental shape rotation."</p>

Especially if you&#39;re running something with many transactions like AlphaBay. You would need to obfuscate quite a bit more:- if you&#39;re using VPN traffic but most people &#34;around&#34; you aren&#39;t, you&#39;re a suspicious node; your ISP could easily flag you to your government. If you use wifi at a common point you&#39;re likely to be flagged and there isn&#39;t an easy way other than keeping on the move. But moving often is another anomalous event, and it&#39;s very difficult to do even for Drug Lords ( El Chapo ) or Terrorists that it behooves to do. This puts you in a sort of Zugzwang, to borrow a chess term.- there&#39;s always leakage, for instance, in the way you talk with people in the real world. At some point you send enough communication for sophisticated frequency analysis.- and there are other patterns of usage that could be used to identify you, like searches or even keyboard frequency on anonymized accounts can be de-anonymized by very specific markers ( ML works! ).- off ramps for crypto aren&#39;t very good. If you&#39;re in e.g. Brazil, haha, yeah, good luck spending bitcoin or any other crypto and going unnoticed. Mixers and tumblers will eventually leak and you&#39;ll be caught.- you&#39;re very vulnerable to social engineering by people you do business with. one slip where you stop communicating in a transactional mode of communication and that&#39;s a weak link in your armor.In the end, the FBI only has to be right once, and you have to be right every time."</p>

The point of anonymity is achieving freedom, but staying anonymous expends energy and makes you a target, so you can&#39;t actually do any things that anonymity was supposed to get you.If what you really want is sovereignty, which is what most people confuse anonymity with,  the goal is to be like what Ernst Jünger called the anarch (in contrast to the anarchist), which is someone who complies and renders herself indifferent to authority, rather than standing out and drawing attention.A much better practice is to be as open as possible about the boring stuff, so you&#39;re not constrained and can do what everyone else does.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This kind of data collection abuse is why I think we need more addons like AdNauseam [1]. Unlike uBlock Origin, it&#39;s not available from the Chrome web store anymore, which is a good sign that Google hates these types of addons more than they hate simple blockers.Blocking A/AAAA domains with custom URLs to prevent tracking is almost impossible, so instead let&#39;s flood the trackers with useless, incorrect data that&#39;s not worth collecting.[1]: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/adnauseam/"</p>

There&#39;s no way to fight this unless you customize and maintain blocking scripts for each individual website.Yes, websites could always have done this, but the REST (CDN-bypassing) requests&#39; cost and the manual maintenance for the telemetry endpoints and storage was an impediment that Google just gives them a drop-in solution for :(I think Google is happy to eat some of the cost for the &#34;proxy&#34; server given the abundance of data they&#39;ll be gobbling up (not just each request&#39;s query string and users&#39; IP address but -being a subdomain- all the 1st party cookies as well). I don&#39;t have the time or energy to block JavaScript and/or manually inspect each domain&#39;s requests to figure out if they use server-side tracking or not.I honestly don&#39;t know if there&#39;s any solution to this at all. Maybe using an archive.is-like service that renders the static page (as an image at the extreme), or a Tor-like service and randomizes one&#39;s IP address and browser fingerprint."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That shouldn&#39;t be a surprise. At an old job with far smaller user base, we used to do something very similar and while the shadow profiles were not materialized in the form of actual profiles, the amount of data you can gather about someone just by having his/her number pop up in the contact list of several of your actual users is staggering: full name, workplace, city/neighborhood where they live, their partners, their hobbies and all sorts of things which you generally should not know. And we are not talking people who have their entire life published online, but people with little to no online visibility. Assuming that facebook is not doing something similar considering that their main business comes from profiling and modeling user behavior is just naive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Facebook also has shadow profiles for non-users that connect directly to name, email address, and/or phone number.  At the very least these seem to be populated when people share their contact list with Facebook.I have long wondered whether they can match these two kinds of shadow profiles together. One profile with personally identifiable information. The other profile with detailed browsing history. That would raise a huge privacy concern especially since these are non-Facebook users and therefore people who have not opted into this at any level."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A link that is shared on facebook gets an additional fbclid query parameter (interesting that google has it&#39;s equivalent glclid query parameter for links from google adds).I think that it is easy to get rid of this query parameter, when want to use such a link. (just adding, as I don&#39;t see that mentioned in the pdf)I think that the purpose of this query param is to act as a substitute for cross site cookies: when you click on some link then the original url is further transfered as the http referrer header of the http request, if they can get hold of the logs of some affiliated site, then they can possibly track the flow of these fbclid attributes.Interesting to observe, how every tiny detail is getting used for tracking purposes. I guess that browsers won&#39;t get rid of any specific query parameters when the url is passed as the referrer header, as that would be a violation of the protocol. However it may be possible to write a browser plug-in that does so."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love little compression hacks like the one given in the article.I created a word search game way back in late 1978/early 1979 4KB of RAM. I had about 2KB for storing the word database. And I recall I had about 2,500 words. Which I had to type in by hand.I used the 26 tables of words trick too, to drop the first letter. I also treated each word being made up of 32 symbols. I called them letters, but they didn&#39;t represent individual letters necessarily.Edit 36 minutes after writing my original comment: Having just checked my notes from December 24th 1978, I need to correct myself and say it was 38 symbols. Though I seem to recall I actually got it down to 32 symbols. I need to keep looking through my notes to refresh my brain on the solution.A word might end in &#34;ING&#34; so that was considered a single letter/symbol. Words were between four and seven letters long.Most words took up two bytes, some only took up a single byte, only a few took up three bytes, maybe a few dozen took up four bytes. And I judiciously pruned the database to minimize the words that took up three or four bytes so that I didn&#39;t have too many of them. I also packed the bits, so that there was no gaps between words.And it was all written in 6502 assembly, originally for the CBM PET, and later for the Acorn Atom.I was 11 years old and so proud of myself for such cleverness. I still have my notes and scribblings, including the digitised versions from all those years back.Later, when I wrote a much more complex Bookworm type of game I had to take a word list that was about 8MB long, uncompressed, which would just barely fit on the hard drive, and turned it into a trie, which brought it down to just a few dozen kilobytes, which handily fit on a SS/SD 100KB 5+1/4&#34; floppy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I got nerd sniped and compressed it to under 28K, which was good enough for the goal of fitting it in a 32K NROM cartridge for the NES. On the NES, you don’t need to do better than that, because you get a separate 8K for graphics, and 4K is plenty of space to fit the code for your Wordle clone.https://www.moria.us/blog/2022/01/dictionary-compressionThe annoying part is that the NES only gives you four background palettes, and you are constrained to use all four of those to color your words."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"And far better than gzip compression. Nice work. My takeaway is that context matters - this is not General Purpose Compression, but compression made specifically for this case. Good Stuff."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30396454">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes, I used to,but No, I fixed it :)Among other things, I am team lead for a private search engine whose partner-accessible API handles roughly 500 mio requests per month.I used to feel powerless and stressed out by the complexity and the scale, because whenever stuff broke (and it always does at this scale), I had to start playing politics, asking for favors, or threatening people on the phone to get it fixed. Higher management would hold me accountable for the downtime even when the whole S3 AZ was offline and there was clearly nothing I could do except for hoping that we&#39;ll somehow reach one of their support engineers.But over time, management&#39;s &#34;stand on the shoulders of giants&#34; brainwashing wore off so that they actually started to read all the &#34;AWS outage XY&#34; information that we forwarded to them. They started to actually believe us when we said &#34;Nothing we can do, call Amazon!&#34;. And then, I found a struggling hosting company with almost compatible tooling and we purchased them. And I moved all of our systems off the public cloud and onto our private cloud hosting service.Nowadays, people still hold me (at least emotionally) accountable for any issue or downtime, but I feel much better about it :) Because now it actually is withing my circle of power. I have root on all relevant servers, so if shit hits the fan, I can fix things or delegate to my team.Your situation sounds like you will constantly take the blame for other people&#39;s fault. I would imagine that to be disheartening and extremely exhausting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What do you find exhausting?One anti-pattern I&#39;ve found is that most orgs ask a single team to handle on-call around the clock for their service. This rarely scales well, from a human standpoint. If you&#39;re getting paged at 2:00 in the morning on a regular basis you will start to resent it. There&#39;s not much you can do about that so long as only one team is responsible for uptime 24/7.The solution is to hire operations teams globally, and then setup follow-the-sun operations whereby the people being paged are always naturally awake at that hour, and allows them to work normal eight hour shifts. But this requires companies to, gasp, have specialized developers and specialized operators collaborate before allowing new feature work into production, to ensure that the operations teams understand what the services are supposed to do and keep it all online. It requires (oh, the horror!) actually maintaining production standards, runbooks, and other documentation.So naturally, many orgs would prefer to burn out their engineers instead."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience is that the expectations on what your average engineer should be able to handle has grown enormously during the last 10 years or so.
Working both with large distributed systems and medium size monolithic systems I have seen the expectations become a lot higher in both.When I started my career the engineers at our company were assigned a very specific part of the product that they were experts on. Usually there were 1 or 2 engineers assigned to a specific area and they knew it really well.
Then we went Agile(tm) and the engineers were grouped into 6 to 9 person teams that were assigned features that spanned several areas of the product. The teams also got involved in customer interaction, planning, testing and documentation. The days when you could focus on a single part of the system and become really good at it were gone.Next big change came when the teams moved from being feature teams to devops teams. None of the previous responsibilities were removed but we now became responsible also for setting up and running the (cloud) infrastructure and deploying our own software.In some ways I agree that these changes have empowered us. But it is also, as you say, exhausting. Once I was simply a programmer; now I&#39;m a domain expert, project manager, programmer, tester, technical writer, database admin, operations engineer, and so on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of commentators are missing the point. Caselaw is what lawyers rely on to determine what the law is. For years, there was a monopoly, the privately-held West Corporation in Minnesota. In the 1970s, the field became a duopoly, with the advent of Lexis. West eventually sold out to Thompson, the company is now Thompson-West. Computer-assisted legal research was extremely expensive. The Air Force set up FLITE, but efforts to access their database of cases failed. Manual research is effective, but paper publication meant you ran the risk of not knowing yesterday&#39;s results. In the 90&#39;s with the advent of the Internet, a lot of new players moved into the scene; some more successful than the others.  Public-interest organizations sued for access to the cases, which, after all, were all in the public domain. There was a Washington-based group that called the caselaw the &#34;Crown Jewels&#34; of this effort--though EDGAR filings probably have more significance for the public. Time has provided a solution; access to anything older than the most recent 400 volumes of the Federal Reporter is really not needed, as any Thompson-West salesman will tell you. But these efforts to open caselaw to the public is not scammy and has nothing to do with shaming. In the United States, these cases state the law which governs our lives. I&#39;m glad they&#39;ve succeeded in the effort."</p>

Another example is that Windows still needs a local username and password, even if you&#39;ve logged in with a Microsoft account, and this can get out of sync if you change your Microsoft account password online, meaning you now have a different local password to your online account.It&#39;s a frustration that power users don&#39;t need and this is probably going to force me to relegate Windows to a VM."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Never again windows with Microsoft accounts. I have two windows 10 licenses, one home and one pro. I made the mistake of associating the licenses to my Microsoft account and now  there is no way to move the pro license from the old PC to the new one. The Microsoft support site is a complete joke of unpaid chatterers that send you on wild goose chase, the web is full of SEO bullshit site that keyword-dance around the issue... Windows 11 for me is Windows Never, and I am well under to way to ensure that the 100 odd laptops at $company run Ubuntu next thank you very much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Windows 7/8 are the last good versions of Windows IMHO. Yeah they have security issues, but I run them in a virtual machine not connected to the Internet where I need things like iTunes and MS Office. Some games don&#39;t run in a VM very well because of the overhead and abstraction (unless they&#39;re lightweight or not resource intensive). I have a separate Alienware laptop for gaming on Windows however.My hypervisor OS is a Linux Mint install, with Virtualbox. I use Mint as a daily driver. I also use Cloudready[0] for interacting with the Google ecosystem. I can&#39;t recommend Cloudready enough, although I think Google bought out[1] Cloudready and it&#39;s now called Flex[2][0] https://www.neverware.com/freedownload[1] https://cloudreadykb.neverware.com/s/article/Neverware-is-no...[2] https://edu.google.com/intl/ALL_us/products/chromebooks/chro..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Well I, and my family took several tests with this firm - and I am very upset about this.I will be speaking to a barrister today or on Monday to explore what, if any, remedies we can seek over this in court.Please if anyone could recommend a London-based barrister who specialises in this sort of matter by DM or in reply that would be much appreciated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem here is that it sold the DNA to third parties.  The government &#39;data watchdog&#39; appears to be stepping in to stop this overt failure.Of course, all the testing agencies are collecting DNA.  The records will be somewhere.Do we think that government agencies will be able to access these?  Will the NHS?  Will government access even be stated in the agreements that they signed to be &#39;government-approved&#39;?  Will the data be available to other companies down the line for research?  Or when they are bought up by a big corporation?The point is that this is another erosion of privacy, another cat is out of the bag.  It is all very foreseeable.Once we sanction the collection of private information, eg DNA for health! to prevent child abuse! to stop terrorism! the over-reach is never withdrawn.  Government access to your dna, online record, etc, etc - becomes the new normal.  All while the actions of the government are ever more hidden - eg secret courts, collection of data, etcIn every instance of privacy erosion, a plausibly valid excuse is supplied by the government.  But it is a one-way street.  Why we continuously accept government justifications of excessive over-reach amazes me.  But that we do in general (I don&#39;t!) destroys privacy for everyone."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"You can&#39;t ask for (nor give) a consent that broad: &#34;use my dna for whatever research you want by whoever&#34;. Having been involved a bit with asking for informed consent in a hospital, it&#39;s sooo difficult to design a specific- and useful-enough consent form for legitimate not-for-profit medical research. I hope these jokers go to prison for a long time."</p>

But had she had a device “probed” like this before?It’s such an important point of contact I wonder about the details of this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This isn&#39;t discussed much, but I think homes would become noticeably more affordable for families just by having the government stop subsidizing the mortgages of investment properties (e.g. only one mortgage subsidy is available for each family). This isn&#39;t even getting into tax write offs which are too complicated for me to understand the consequences of changing.As it stands, mortgage rates being below the rate of inflation make housing a very attractive investment.The sources of mortgage subsidy that I am aware of are secondary market purchases:  * Federal reserve mortgage purchases
  * Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac mortgage purchases

A big portion of quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve is buying billions of mortgages every month. The Fed is trying to start unwinding this now, but they have had trillions of mortgages on their books since the GFC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Housing will never be relatively cheap until it’s easier to build a house. It will never be easier to build a house until zoning is more lenient.No state is incentivized to make zoning more lenient. Therefore it falls on the federal government, who lack the authority.The only thing they can do is something similar to what they do with the highways and threaten to take away funds unless all plots of land can be zoned for up to 4-family houses (FHA limit).Potentially quadrupling the amount of housing will do it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We&#39;re in the housing hunt right now and we&#39;re losing to all-cash offers and ridiculous terms (like months of rent-free to the previous occupany: those sort of terms don&#39;t come from someone looking for a new place to live). We even lost on two offers where we were the high bid. We have pre-approval, solid financing and were willing to even waive the appraisal. It&#39;s not enough."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hmmm... I&#39;m skeptical.  Not necessarily because I don&#39;t think that pneumonia could be detected by testing VOCs in breath, but because I&#39;m currently working on a project that uses sensors to do breath analysis and my amateur research has informed me that it&#39;s fairly hard to get right (which is why my primary goal is to identify deltas rather than achieve numerical accuracy).For one, VOCs can be present in breath for other reasons besides some sort of infection in the lung, and VOCs are incredibly hard to differentiate with just a sensor.  The fact that they tend to be faint in human breath even at their highest (in contrast to O2 and CO2) doesn&#39;t help.  Even the most expensive PID sensors for VOCs (they get up into the several hundreds a pop) can&#39;t really tell you whether the predominant gas is acetone or alcohol or acetaldehyde or hydrogen sulfide.  So you&#39;ve got to figure out whether the presence of VOCs is truly an anomaly and not just a part of ketosis.  In which case you will also need to measure at least VeO2 to see whether the VOCs correspond with the Respiratory Quotient.The &#34;e-nose&#34; project, as described on the MakeZine article, doesn&#39;t appear to do that.  It does have an alcohol sensor.  But these sensors aren&#39;t particularly sophisticated.  They use semiconductors with heating elements to detect the presence of gases, and there is almost certainly some overlap between the alcohol and VOCs sensors.If VOCs are produced by pneumonia, then yes, it&#39;s conceivable that even just the VOCs sensor alone would detect this.  But can this group of sensors used in the e-nose differentiate pneumonia from catabolism?Maybe? ¯\_(ツ)_/¯After all, this thing uses AI.  And maybe AI can recognize something that a human can&#39;t by simply looking at a line graph.  I dunno...  Such things should be tested against known inputs before being suggested to diagnose anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is what happens when you give children the tools to succeed by teaching them math and science in ways that directly relate to their world view. Obviously, this kid is very bright, but giving kids the tools to understand how the ideas they&#39;re learning can be applied in the real world is so satisfying. They aren&#39;t blinded by previous failures, or the current market, or what can and can&#39;t be done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anybody have a link to what the kid actually did?  I skimmed the video, looked at the diagram, read the original MAKE article, and it seems like the kid did a science project and it doesn&#39;t actually diagnose pneumonia.  Am I missing something important?The reason I&#39;m asking is that I see a lot of these (used to judge science fairs, worked with smart undergraduates who build their own equipment) but most of it overstates the technical advances made by the kid."</p>
