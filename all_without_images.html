								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personally I&#39;ve used SVGs and linear gradients to achieve a smooth gradient. I made a CodePen about it several year ago: https://codepen.io/toastal/pen/NAVybq"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just before Christmas I got an urge to add a dither filter to my JS canvas library. The past few weeks have certainly been a very intense adventure through a very deep rabbit hole involving color spaces, color distances and discovering how to generate a best-fit reduced palette of colors and then dither it (hello, blue noise!)I finally managed to complete the work last week and I&#39;m quite happy with the results. Using the library people can set the colors of graphical objects or gradients using any CSS color space string (RGB, HSL, HWB, LAB, LCH) and the color should render as expected. The reduce-noise filter uses LAB internally to calculate color distances, but in the end I compromised and used euler distances for the algorithm rather than one of the more modern algorithms.Work is still on a branch in the library[1] but I&#39;m hoping to merge it into the main code in the next week or so (after testing across devices/screens/etc).Aside: Safari has gone ahead and introduced support for HWB, LAB and LCH color strings in CSS. Sadly, they&#39;re not recognised by Safari&#39;s canvas engine (yet). Also, their HSL and HWB gradients seem to be the same as the RGB gradients; their LAB/LCH gradients seem to dodge the dreaded Gray Zone.[1] - https://github.com/KaliedaRik/Scrawl-canvas/tree/dec-21-dith..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article seems to give RGB a bad rap but I think it makes the most sense for gradients. I wouldn&#39;t want a yellow to blue gradient to cycle through a (partial) rainbow of colors. But I also wouldn&#39;t really ever choose to make a pure yellow to pure blue gradient. Most pleasing gradients you see in the wild use colors that are more similar to begin with, so it&#39;s a bit of a strawman. It&#39;s really just about carefully choosing your start and end (and optionally intermediate) colors."</p>

They spent almost $5000 to buy and test every mask available on Amazon.If you click on a mask it will take you to a page with the test details.  More incredibly, most of the masks also have 5-7 minute video review!If you click on the &#34;Breathability&#34; column, then on &#34;Grade&#34; twice, you will end up with a list of masks that Pass with the most breathable masks first.Way to go, Lloyd.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I find annoying is that they still return results that are those sites that seem to register a load of terms that all point to the same page. You see this with telephone numbers, song lyrics etc. where the result looks like &#34;Lyrics for Stairway to Heaven&#34; but you click through and there is no content, just a page that says &#34;Upload some lyrics to this song&#34;.. etc.These sites should be heavily penalised for click-baiting and they have been doing it for years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ironically, my work on my own search engine has led me to be a bit more patient with Google&#39;s problems. At least I think I understand them better. Search engines fail in weird ways.I think in part that Google just has gotten a spectacularly confusing failure mode. If it can&#39;t find good matching contents, it starts second-guessing your query and producing other results, which makes you think it&#39;s not even considering what you entered. It may even be &#34;better&#34; in the sense that it&#39;s more likely to return at least something relevant, but in practice it&#39;s bad UX because it&#39;s so unintuitive what&#39;s happening. It&#39;s probably one of those unfortunate optimizations that are invisible when they work and frustrating when they don&#39;t.There is so much stuff on the Internet it&#39;s easy to start thinking there is guaranteed to be good results for any search, and that just doesn&#39;t seem to be the case. Especially with highly specified searches with 6-8 terms, you quickly enter the domain where you&#39;re reasonably unlikely to find an exact match."</p>

It returns a 403 error and might be a hacked site, since the home page is for a graphic design studio in Munich.Result #8 is something similar:&#34;Intellij flatten packages - Músicos de Viaje&#34;. This is definitely a hacked site (from Spain, apparently) that redirects me somewhere else.Result #10:&#34;How to calculate tax percentage in sql query&#34;. Another hacked site, this time for an evangelical church from Brazil.Now... how can Google think that any of these sites are relevant? Even if it doesn&#39;t realize the pages are hacked... even its crawler has been fed content that included the keywords... :A - The sites themselves don&#39;t match the query at all.B - No legit site about the subject would link to these sites.C - The results themselves (title, url, preview), as Google shows them, have nothing to do with the search!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author is fighting a strawman. Rather than engage with the specific problems these solutions were built to solve they dismissively regard them as just flavor of the week trends purely for the sake of chasing newness. This is true of the entire post, but I&#39;ll tackle just one since it&#39;s emblematic of my issues with all the rest:The argument for Electron and React Native isn&#39;t &#34;it&#39;s modern&#34;, it&#39;s &#34;it&#39;s much cheaper&#34;. Hiring experienced desktop application devs to build a quality native app for each platform is going to be expensive, hiring a few JS bootcampers to build one react UI that works on every platform is extremely cheap - shittier performance is the tradeoff to instantly have access to every platform. It&#39;s not a coincidence that Electron apps like e.g. Slack, Spotify, Discord are massively dominant players in their markets, I doubt you&#39;d look the engineering leads of these companies in the face and tell them that you believe they put no thought into the tradeoffs of Electron and that they&#39;re just following trends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel comfortable with asserting that the author has never worked on a complex web application. This web-dev hate borders on pathological: this is a guy that seems to specialize in Unix/Linux tooling, doesn&#39;t have a single tutorial on web app development [1], and yet has an intense hatred towards a space that he barely understands.These types of arguments are incredibly embarrassing to read, not only because they betray a stunning lack of familiarity with the topic, but it&#39;s basically a conspiracy theory: everybody is stupid except me, all these successful companies making billions of dollars and attracting top talent are just throwing money into a fire for fun.[1] https://unixsheikh.com/tutorials.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a greybeard. I&#39;ve been doing this since before HTML existed, and I&#39;ve kept up with the changes as they occurred along the way.I&#39;m not going to refute the author&#39;s points one by one. Everything being complained about exists for a reason. I agree that it&#39;s incredibly complex. It&#39;s overwhelming. That&#39;s why people specialize.An individual can still own an entire application and infrastructure, limit their technology choices to those from the 90s, and produce a perfectly functional, modern web application indistinguishable from anything using the latest tools and frameworks. It&#39;s a whole lot of work, though.If you take the time to learn some of the modern tools, they&#39;ll save you a lot of time. Why re-invent the wheel? But all these time-saving frameworks are complex, and learning all of them would take years, if you haven&#39;t been keeping up as they evolved. You can learn one or two of them quickly, though. You can specialize.That&#39;s why we have DevOps teams, UI teams, API teams, database teams. That&#39;s a lot of people. But that&#39;s what it takes if you want a high-performance web application that can scale to support hundreds of millions of users, is responsive around the world, supports a variety of languages, can handle disruptions, complies with regulations, and on and on. Don&#39;t need those things? Then stick with PHP and HTML on a server you run yourself. This isn&#39;t the 90s anymore. There are a lot of people out there, and if you&#39;re building something worth using, it&#39;s a different ballgame."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Meanwhile our idiot city (Oxford, UK) is spending £1.2m on &#34;Quickways&#34;, which are painted lines on existing roads... guaranteed to keep cyclists 0% safe. This in the face of national Government guidance in favour of physical segregation from cars. (Plans at https://letstalk.oxfordshire.gov.uk/quickway-cycle-route-oxf...: the promise of &#34;segregation where possible&#34; in reality means about 5% of the network.)It is really frustrating how highway engineers, as a profession, are unwilling to consistently learn lessons from the Netherlands in designing cycle infrastructure. Many cities seem to delight in half-assing their own solutions. So congratulations to Milan, who look like they may have got it right."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If you live in a region where bike infrastructure is underfunded, and car infrastructure is overfunded, it’s probable that’s because cycling is viewed as a recreational activity in your area and thus undeserving of tax dollars compared to ‘essential’ car travel.If you disagree with that, (and live in a democracy) let someone know! Find out who controls the infrastructure spending in your area and call/email them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If any of you have been to Milan, the inner circle of the image [1] is more or less the city boundary. That path could be anything between 70 to 100 km according to how they&#39;ll design it. I had no problems cycling 100+ km around the city during the second quasi-lockdown of one winter ago.The grey area is what&#39;s called &#34;città metropolitana&#34; now, basically the old province of Milan including more than 100 of other cities.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Turns out, you can’t. From what I could gather, the version of Chrome was tied to ChromeOS which couldn’t be updated because of the hardware. No new ChromeOS meant no new Chrome which meant stuck at version 76.This is the most surprising part of the article. If ChromeOS does not allow the browser to be updated after the hardware has reached end-of-support, I would recommend it to nobody, ever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A friend lent me a 2017 iPad that she&#39;s no longer using. I wanted to download Spotify, but couldn&#39;t, because I needed a newer version of iOS.The device does not get a new version of iOS, so I tried Safari to see if the web client works. Spotify&#39;s web client does not work on that version of Safari.So I tried downloading Firefox and Chrome, but I can&#39;t because they no longer support my version of iOS.So I looked for a way to download older versions of apps (Spotify, or an older version of Firefox or Chrome on which Spotify would still work). As it turns out, there&#39;s a way: you first need to &#34;purchase&#34; the app you&#39;re interested in on a newer device that supports the latest version. Then, you can log into your older device and download an older version of the same app.That means there&#39;s a way for me to run an older version of an app that works on my iPad, but nah, I need to first get a newer device and &#34;purchase&#34; it there.My conclusion: the onus is on the device manufacturers to not arbitrarily restrict their users. Jim Nielsen&#39;s mom&#39;s iPad is perfectly capable of opening that website, but its manufacturers are limiting it artificially."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The first line of the article is misleading. It&#39;s not just about a &#34;crappy laptop&#34;, it&#39;s about locked-down devices (ChromeOS, iPad) that have had their support terms expire. I suppose that is crappy, but it&#39;s not quite the image I&#39;d conjure myself.For various reasons but mainly because I so rarely use laptops, I have a crappy laptop from ca. 2010. It&#39;s slow, with a spinning-rust hard disk and an Intel Celeron from its day; it&#39;s a miracle it even allowed up to a 4GB RAM upgrade. With a GPU that can barely manage to process a 1366x768 framebuffer needed for the built-in screen, it&#39;s an unpleasant experience all around. By all means it&#39;s the definition of crappy laptop and that held even when the thing was new.All the same, it has no problem running Debian 11, and both the newest Chromium and Firefox can at least launch on it. It does take half a minute for the browser windows to actually appear, but it works, more or less. The per-site experience after this depends heavily on how much &#34;cool tech&#34; web site developers have opted to use. YouTube is practically unusable even in the tiny video window it displays and 360p videos. Hacker News is perfectly fine.Perhaps bias on my own part, but I would argue that this case is the crappy laptop that&#39;s reasonable to optimize for. It may not be pleasant, but for large classes of web sites, it should be bearable to some extent. I&#39;m pretty sure both the Chromebook and iPad mentioned in the article have better hardware specs than my thing, but they&#39;re both made by companies that are far too willing to drop support after a short period, leaving users in an insecure status and many of them just don&#39;t know why web sites stop working."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bet the Fukushima backup power system would have fit this explanation perfectly:&gt; in addition to the grid connection, there are four twelve megawatt diesel generator stations spaced around each corner of the plant -- each with two generators, any one of which is able to provide operating power to keep the reactor&#39;s safety systems working.Unfortunately for Fukushima, all generators were flooded by a single Tsunami. What are the odds of an unknown event that will affect all generators? Think of EMP, contaminated fuel, a large cloud of C)2 suffocating the engines... All seem highly unlikely, but how do you plan for the unknown unknowns?The most likely (and I think underestimated) risk for Nuclear plants is a systemic change due to a large (climate?) crisis and/or war. Think of the collapse of the Soviet Union, that definitely increased risk and reduced maintenance budget for a few Nuclear plants. Any significant sea level rise, drought or flood could very well trigger such events (even if the reactor is not affected directly, the society around it will be). That is why I think nuclear is a risky option to reach net-zero; every plant you build is a bet on the future stability of society for at least 75 years (time until the plant will be safely decommissioned by future generations). I would feel much safer in a world covered in solar panels, wind turbines and transmission lines (and highly variable spot pricing) than in one with nuclear plants that require constant care by experts and that even in the best case incur a huge cost on society to safely decommission.&gt; In 2016 the European Commission assessed that European Union&#39;s nuclear decommissioning liabilities were seriously underfunded by about 118 billion euros, with only 150 billion euros of earmarked assets to cover 268 billion euros of expected decommissioning costs covering both dismantling of nuclear plants and storage of radioactive parts and waste. France had the largest shortfall with only 23 billion euros of earmarked assets to cover 74 billion euros of expected costs  [1][1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_decommissioning"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">" Not very surprised.An Indian expat living in NL, with parents living back home in India. My (retired, old) parents are afraid to get tested for COVID because they hear way too many incidents from their neighbourhood about “hospitals faking COVID test results just so that they can admit them for 4 days, administer expensive drugs, charge them some hefty bill, and send home”. As stupid as it sounds, I could not force my parents to go and wait in the line to get COVID test, after he says “I believe I don’t have COVID now. But if I go to the testing center that is so badly managed and understaffed where only people with obvious high level of COVID are brought to get official result, I will get COVID there!”.Say what you will, but if the basic trust in doctors and healthcare is lost, how would people get tested, and how can you trust any statistics from there?!I’m ashamed, stupefied and angry at the same time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excess deaths will need to become the standard statistic used to compare nations.  Otherwise, we&#39;ll be debating &#34;deaths FROM vs. deaths WITH COVID&#34; and the differing statistical definitions from nation to nation.  Moreover, is a death from lack of access to medical care due to the collapse of a medical system a COVID death?  Is a death of despair from isolation and unemployment a COVID death?My sense is, when the pandemic is analyzed historically, &#34;excess deaths&#34; will be the only salient statistic in the literature."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"India desperately needs a public institution like the NHS of the UK!Few years ago my father died of ILD(Interstitial Lung Disease), as per the doctors. I had my doubts about the diagnosis, but I had no where to go to for second opinion. There is a private hospital syndicate in every city of India; no hospital goes against other hospitals in the same city; they will cover each others back because most of the hospitals have the same &#34;consulting doctors&#34;. They just loot the patient&#39;s relatives by prescribing same drug but from different manufacturer. And if they realise that the patient is going to die, then the family members are pressured to take the patient home or elsewhere, this is to avoid &#34;death count&#34; on their register. I was literally asked to take my father home the day he died suggesting that &#34;take him home, we will provide the ambulance and he will die on the way home so it won&#39;t be on anyone of us!&#34;The medicine profession in India is not just joke, it is inhumane and lacks any value for humanity.India should have looked at some of the European countries when setting up it&#39;s healthcare, education and news media policy.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This post, and how it explains that there&#39;s 30 people working there now, made me realize that if I care about signal continuing (and I do, since I really like it, especially that it has a dedicated desktop client), that I should see how it makes money and whether that&#39;s sustainable.  Turns out it&#39;s donations, and now I&#39;m a donor through monthly charges through the mobile app.  I actually opted for that specifically because their web site noted that they can&#39;t give you a badge in the app if you donate online, and I thought showing the badge would be a good way for other people to see and inquire about, and hopefully realize they can donate too if they care to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just hope that moxie&#39;s replacement is someone with as strong a reputation for fighting for the principles at stake and the ability to defend them. How many people could have written the Cellebrite blog post? Probably not many. The hidden pressures on Signal staff must be enormous, as likely the the world&#39;s single most valuable surveillance target."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been a user and evangelizer of Signal (aka TextSecure and even RedPhone when the audio piece was split off as a separate app) for a very long time now. I admire the work that Moxie and the entire team have put in over all these years. Thank you all so much for the great work, whether it be writing blog posts rebutting the &#34;I have nothing to hide&#34; people or implementing open and secure-by-default protocols and apps that put privacy within reach of even the least technically-savvy among us!I hope the next adventure is as fruitful as this one was Moxie.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m currently in the W22 batch. There&#39;s some heavy skepticism in this thread, so I want to add perspective from someone actually in the current batch (throwaway because we haven&#39;t announced our funding yet).The additional $375k (+$125k OG deal = $500k) that YC is offering is an optional and uncapped SAFE. I think of this as YC being an investor in our next round, except I can receive and deploy the cash now with no premium paid to YC. This is extremely founder friendly, and is in addition to what YC had already agreed to invest in us. The terms on this SAFE are much better than what I could have negotiated on my own, and it comes with zero fundraising effort.Because of this, I&#39;m able to go into pitch meetings with investors around demo day in March with more leverage – I no longer need capital from them to keep the company moving in the short term. I can also make capital intensive moves I otherwise would have waited to do.As to whether YC is a value add for us with the dilution it incurs: yes, absolutely. The valuation cap we&#39;re raising at has doubled, we have access to a great network of people and companies (this has a real and significant effect), and we were able to convince someone with the YC funding to leave their stable and well paying job to join us.This is all in the context of a US based developer tools startup that already has a top-tier university signal (Stanford), co-founders with FAANG offers on the table, and a co-founder with years of experience working (but not as a founder) at two startups that were acquired.I&#39;m sure some others have better fundraising opportunities, but there is a reason many founders like myself still choose to go through YC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This makes it much easier to get to profitability[0] and never raise again after YC (especially as a SaaS). I wonder how this will impact the decision to raise money after YC.0 - Including paying the founders a reasonable salary"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The entire reason I didn&#39;t apply last season was because despite being my startup looking for funding, and despite us having our best traction to date (functional MVP deployed in big retail partner, making sales) - the $125k (minus the cost of uprooting our team and product to CA) was just a bad deal. We&#39;ve been in talks with some angel groups with 500K being the ask for the pre-seed, and that has been well received. So I think 500K is right on the money for now. It&#39;s a good change to see!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would think Apple has some leverage to force it if they really wanted.If Apple really wanted to force the issue, they could tell T-Mobile no more iPhone contracts unless you do it. Apple can survive and thrive on fewer networks - the iPhone was AT&amp;T exclusive for a long time at the beginning.If that happened, there would be no way for T-Mobile to get a supply of iPhones. People would need to buy iPhones from Apple and then replace the SIM cards themselves. It would make T-Mobile bend pretty quickly unless they managed to get Verizon and AT&amp;T to join them on the issue.But then Apple has a second card to play, and that&#39;s the court of public opinion. If Apple wanted to make a public ad lambasting the carriers for undermining people&#39;s privacy, the damage would also force them to bend.Finally, of course, there&#39;s the fact that carriers need Apple just as much as Apple needs carriers. However, between the carriers and Apple, who has $200 billion in the bank to do things themselves if they wanted?Edit: Heck, T-Mobile has a market value of $130 billion. AT&amp;T has a market cap of $188B, and Verizon $223 billion. If Verizon and AT&amp;T joined T-Mobile in protest, Apple could theoretically attempt (or at least threaten) a hostile takeover of any of them. That would cause a lot of discussion among the carriers and send a strong message very quickly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think you should avoid T-Mobile if you can. Not just as a matter of principle, but also pragmatism. They have an extremely crude SMS censorship/anti-spam system [1] which even blocks links to lichess.org, the popular online chess website.They have poor security practices like storing passwords in plaintext [2], and they had a large data breach (probably about 100M customers affected) last year. [3]A̶n̶d̶ ̶n̶o̶w̶,̶ ̶i̶t̶ ̶s̶e̶e̶m̶s̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶y̶ ̶a̶r̶e̶ ̶t̶h̶r̶o̶w̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶i̶n̶ ̶s̶o̶m̶e̶ ̶p̶r̶o̶t̶o̶c̶o̶l̶ ̶b̶l̶o̶c̶k̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶t̶o̶o̶.̶PS: This isn&#39;t protocol blocking at the packet/port level, so I may have used &#34;protocol blocking&#34; a bit inappropriately. Apparently Apple allows the carriers to prevent people from enabling iCloud Private Relay, and T-Mobile is doing that. Apple is probably doing so due to the pressure by the carriers. In August, four carriers (Vodafone, Telefonica, Orange and T-Mobile ) signed a letter urging the European Commission to stop Apple from providing Private Relay. (According to a report by The Telegraph: https://archive.fo/BRUS4#selection-915.74-925.194) This, of course, still quite preposterous.[1]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29744347[2]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16776347[3]: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28192423 (The first comment by @jonathanmayer has a list of other recent T-Mobile security incidents)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Like I pointed out in the sister thread about EU telcos:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29875805Phone carriers do not want to be a dumb pipe - and having Private Relay go through their networks breaks:- HTTP header enrichment (which they use for self-care/customer sites/services),- zero rating (which they set up deals for with social networks, music streaming services, etc., often applying specific QoS tags) and- all sorts of value added services (many using deep packet inspection and DNS analytics) that they offer instead of raw, unfettered connectivity.I don&#39;t think many people are aware of exactly how much data telcos are sitting on, anonymized or not.And, of course, it also plays havoc with legal interception because there is no easy way to do MITM.(edit: readability)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been working as an ML Engineer for a few years now and I am baffled by the bar to entry for these positions in the industry.Not only I need to perform at the Software Engineer level expected for the position (with your standard leetcode style interviews), but I need to pass extra ML specific (theory and practice) rounds. Meanwhile the vast majority of my work consist of getting systems production ready and hunting bugs.If I have to jump through so many hoops when changing jobs I&#39;ll seriously consider a regular non-ML position."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The ML/DS positions highly competitive these days. I don&#39;t get why ML positions requires hard preparations for the interviews more than other CS positions while you do similar things. People expect you to know a lot of theory from statistics, probability, algorithms to linear algebra. I am ok with knowing basic of these topics which are the foundations of ML and DL. But I don&#39;t get to ask eigenvectors and challenging algorithm problems in an ML Engineering position at the same while you already proof yourself with a Masters Degree and enough professional experience. I am not defending my PhD there. We will just build some DL models, maybe we will read some DL papers and maybe try to implement some of those. The theory is the only 10% of the job, rest is engineering, data cleaning etc. Honestly I am looking for the soft way to get back to Software Engineering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This book has fun problems! Example:During the cold war, the U.S.A developed a speech to text (STT) algorithm that could theoretically detect the hidden dialects of Russian sleeper agents. These agents (Fig. 3.7), were trained to speak English in Russia and subsequently sent to the US to gather intelligence. The FBI was able to apprehend ten such hidden Russian spies and accused them of being &#34;sleeper&#34; agents.The Algorithm relied on the acoustic properties of Russian pronunciation of the word (v-o-k-s-a-l) which was borrowed from English V-a-u-x-h-a-l-l. It was alleged that it is impossible for Russians to completely hide their accent and hence when a Russian would say V-a-u-x-h-a-l-l, the algorithm would yield the text &#34;v-o-k-s-a-l&#34;. To test the algorithm at a diplomatic gathering where 20% of participants are Sleeper agents and the rest Americans, a data scientist randomly chooses a person and asks him to say V-a-u-x-h-a-l-l. A single letter is then chosen randomly from the word that was generated by the algorithm, which is observed to be an &#34;l&#34;. What is the probability that the person is indeed a Russian sleeper agent?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my first corporate job out of college (a NOC at an ISP) I was asked to update the documentation for troubleshooting quality of service issues. I checked our wiki for what was already there and it horrendous. I started to mentally thrash the person and was going to go confront them about it. When I checked the edit history I was greeted by a single edit and my username a week after I started the job.I learned a great deal of humility and compassion in that moment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the topic of &#34;who wrote this shit&#34;, I&#39;d really like to plug the idea that some of the most high-impact documentation you can write is a good commit message.Say you track down a bug, find a line of code that makes no sense, and `git blame` it, to discover that you wrote it yourself, 2 years ago. If the commit message is &#34;bugfix flaky builds&#34;, good luck figuring it out.If the commit subject rather, is &#34;bugfix flaky builds&#34;, followed by a message that explains what the flakiness was, why you think the change will fix it, what other bugs or limitations you were working around, and what upstream changes you might be waiting on that prevented further work, you&#39;re in a much better position. Suddenly you have a lot more context on what you were doing, why you were doing it, why you didn&#39;t do it better at the time, and in some cases it can even catch you from making an obvious but subtly-wrong mis-step.Similarly, if someone&#39;s confused by your code during code review, that&#39;s a great opportunity for either in-line comments, or commit messages, as appropriate.Unlike PR discussions, tickets, emails, slack threads, wiki pages, or photos of whiteboards, commit messages + git blame has an uncanny ability to be exactly the documentation you need exactly when you need it. Good git history practice can be one of the highest returning investments."</p>

Either you run servers or use a hosted service like the one that created this page. That&#39;s fine for some business, but putting a cost on dmarc reporting and then making dmarc a heavy signal in spam filters is a huge pain for some scenarios.It&#39;s not highly expensive, but  on non monetized side projects it can frustrating how how much the internet expects you to have dmarc on every domain now."</p>

But my children cannot be vaccinated.As a parent of a young kid it kind of feels like everyone has just moved on. I know folks in here will tell me that statistically speaking my children are unlikely to be hospitalized and so on, and I agree. But I know enough kids who got COVID and suffered the symptoms (e.g. a months-long scratchy cough) that I&#39;m not going to stop worrying about it. We&#39;re still very unclear on the long-term effects of COVID, after all.Couple that to daycare/preschool shutdowns: if there&#39;s a case in the class we&#39;ve got to keep our kids at home for a week. We both work. We can deal with it, lord knows we&#39;ve had to do it enough times already, but it&#39;s absolutely draining. And the stress of waiting/expecting the phone call from the school is always there, particularly in this Omicron phase where it feels like everyone and their dog is contracting it. And this comes from two parents that work from home. We&#39;re the luckiest of the lot!Pfizer has already announced their trial with under 5s was not successful and they&#39;ll have to restart. Moderna was supposed to close out a trial in late November but instead expanded it to hundreds of new participants. Why? Unclear. Last I saw no-one seems to be covering it in detail. Out of sight, out of mind."</p>

We’re stuck with it for a foreseeable future. Well, one can cry for the world that was, or one can get up and live in the world that is.We’re not going to be done with vaccines and mandates. And that does not have to be a big deal. I have had to prove vaccination status of my kid for schools and camps for years. It’s annoying but not any harder than keeping my car registration up to date or any other minor bureaucratic headache.I know someone who almost quit a great job because they were mad about a vaccine mandate from their employer.

Stopped wearing a mask for the most part, but with Omicron I started wearing a mask again because I just don&#39;t want this stupid virus. I&#39;m healthy and would probably not have a symptomatic infection. But I still don&#39;t want this stupid virus, and I don&#39;t want to spread it.I think for 2022 I am going to try to argue less, and focus more on my areas of personal expertise.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was very young I worked a tough job that had a mandatory union and it was quite terrible / weak.  Working conditions were pretty bad, physical labor, etc.  But it was not until I worked a job with no union that I realized every element of that job that didn&#39;t suck was due to the union.  For example we had supervisors but they didn&#39;t follow you around and micromanage you.  You were just expected to do your job.  If you didn&#39;t you would be reprimanded of course, but no one was on your case at all.  Supervisors had to show you a base level of respect: there were rules on that stuff.  There were a lot of rules, actually, and even though the union didn&#39;t have a lot of power I&#39;m pretty sure every single positive one, anything that gave employees even a sliver of autonomy and power, were things that the union fought for and got for us.I still was kind of anti-union after that.  &#34;Anti Union&#34; is the wrong phrasing, it was more... I was very suspicious of their structure, their own profit motive(s) etc.  People working for the union had it so much better than the people actually doing the work, and we were the ones paying for and funding it, right?  That aspect of it I never got over, but I now think that it may have been the wrong point of view.I have recently come around full swing and am 100% pro union.  And it is stories like this.  Starbucks, Google, Amazon, these companies will spend millions to fight unions.  This is prima facie evidence to me that unions benefit workers.  These companies all talk the same talk: &#34;we believe companies work best when team members can work directly with the company with no union in the way&#34;.  As though Amazon warehouse workers have some kind of communication path to improve their working conditions when they are being managed and fired by an AI.  What a buncha fkn BS.Things cost.  Good things cost money.  You are paying for someone to fight for your interests and not the company&#39;s interest.  Maybe that is worth paying for.  And if you don&#39;t pay money to a union to fight you pay with your physical health, your safety, your respect, your mental health.  If you work for Amazon you pay with your life when they threaten to fire you if you try to leave in order to hide from a hurricane.  We should all be in unions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people seem confused why a lot of tech people aren&#39;t pushing for unions.For me it&#39;s simple: Tech has brought me from near poverty to pretty darn wealthy. Why mess with that?Could a union help increase wages even more? Maybe. Are we being paid too little compared to our output? Maybe. But at the same time I&#39;m being paid more than I could have possibly imagined before I entered the field."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s a real shame that the middle and upper classes in the US have abandoned having their teens work in favor of various, expensive, college application boosting fluff.I went to work at McDonalds at age 15 and was part of a union. I have direct experience with what that is like. I don’t need to get my knowledge on the subject from flamewars between people pushing ideological agendas (most of whom themselves have apparently never had direct experience.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Remember, companies will always look after themselves before anyone else. If Upwork is the middleman here providing a payment platform, then I&#39;d expect them to swallow the cost of card fraud, not the freelancer. I suspect individual freelancers have a theoretical dollar value in their calculations and it&#39;s never going to be bigger than the company accepting a financial risk.I do wonder why the author is still on Upwork, their rating &amp; exposure on there must be worth more to them than working several weeks for free, but personally I&#39;d walk. I also don&#39;t understand why the pay back is not pro-rata instead of full time, allowing freelancers in this position to earn some money to pay the bills whilst paying back the chargeback (although they shouldn&#39;t be paying it at all). If the author is in the same country as the client then they should also be taking legal action to reclaim the money (which again, Upwork should be doing)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The freelancer&#39;s story seems a little suspicious to me.&#34;Let me translate this. Robin has been using someone else’s credit card for two years...&#34; followed by &#34;I’m on very good terms with Robin.&#34;Clearly, &#39;Robin&#39; is a thief and it is entirely possible that Robin and the freelancer are one and the same. That the freelancer is not asking Robin for the money even though he knows him personally is telling.  Does the freelancer wonder what his good client Robin thinks about the fact that Robin ran up a 12K credit card bill(payable to the freelancer, ultimately) that Robin never paid?(And we know the bill was never paid or there would be no need for the claw-back)And I did not see any mention of where Upwork contacted Robin.  Strange considering he was the one with “a credit card connected in his account that wasn’t actually his”. Is he still on the platform?And then he sent two years worth of work to Upwork to substantiate his claim to the money. But how could Upwork know that the work he sent was legitimately related to the transaction?  Could he not have created a project request for something he had already built?Then he apparently logs ALL of his &#39;time&#39; outside of the system. He said that this time was for &#34;a brainstorming session and a few meetings&#34; with Robin. 230 hours worth!?  I notice that dates of the charge-back transactions were not provided. Was this 230 hours the entirety of the project or just a very small  slice. He wrote that he had made more that 100K on Upwork and that he had other clients.  That leads me to think that this 12K represented all or most of the billing on Robin&#39;s project. Was there any billing for actual implementation, or is it all brainstorming and meetings?This story does not add up to me.edit:  I see in the graphic that apparently the work on Robin&#39;s project was for 1533 hours, so the 230 hours would have been just a portion.  It makes me wonder what/how many other credit cards were used to pay for those other hours.  Hard to believe Robin was above board for the first 1303 hours and then started paying with a stolen credit card."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be looking to get &#34;Robin&#34; to put in writing that he used the wrong card. Surely it is Robin who owes Upwork, not OP who owes Upwork. I&#39;d also want Upwork to answer a few questions:1. Did the cardholder receive their money back?2. If so, how much exactly?3. How much of that amount did you receive, after 
fees?4. Is &#34;Robin&#34; still active on the Upwork platform?5. Do Upwork have the contact details of &#34;Robin&#34;?6. What actions have they taken to recover these costs from &#34;Robin&#34;?7. Who was the person whose card &#34;Robin&#34; had access to?8. Why did it take them so long to spot the charges?There are so many questions here. They can&#39;t just close the case. It&#39;s not a support ticket. This is a legal matter. If OP stops working right now, then he does pay the costs, but he does then have to find another income.For anyone wants to try and help OP, consider liking/retweeting this: https://twitter.com/imdsm/status/1480176898600845312"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;Looking further afield: it seems likely that the end of internal combustion engines will be in sight. Some countries are already scheduling a ban on IC engines to come in after 2030—electric cars are now a maturing technology with clear advantages in every respect except recharge time. Once those IC cars are no longer manufactured, we can expect a very rapid ramp-down of extraction and distribution industries for petrol and diesel fuels, leading to a complete phase-out possibly as early as 2040.&#34;At this point the proposed bans are on the sale of new vehicles that run on fossil fuels.  As far as I know, no one is planning to outright ban ICE vehicles yet.  Headline writers consistently get this wrong, because making the policy sound more extreme than it is attracts ad views.&gt; &#34;As about half of global shipping is engaged in the transport of petrochemicals or coal at this point, this is goin to have impacts far beyond the obvious.&#34;Huh, that&#39;s a lot.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This and more.  The Sail version of TeX is mentioned, but everything else had a usable prototype, too: An early version of Metafont in Sail, an early version of Web (called Doc, though I don’t recall what the names of the Tangle and Weave equivalents were), and an early version of Computer Modern fonts in the early Metafont language.Though fully documented and available via anonymous FTP on the Arpanet, all of these prototypes were experimental proofs-of-concept and were completely discarded, along with the languages they implemented, with the “real” versions rewritten from scratch by Knuth (each first by hand on legal pads, then typed in and debugged as a whole.)And you missed one more obscure but instructive example: To get the camera-ready copy for ACP Vol 2, Knuth purchased an Alphatype CRS phototypesetter. And, unhappy with the manufacturer’s firmware, he rewrote the 8080 code that drives the thing.  Eight simultaneous levels of interrupts coming from various subsystem: the horizontal and vertical step-motors that you had to accelerate just right, while keeping synchronized with four S100 boards that generated slices of each character in realtime from a proprietary outline format, to be flashed into the lens just as it was passing the right spot on the photo paper. (Four identical boards, since you had to fill the second while the first one did its processing; times two for two characters that might overlap due to kerning). Oh, and you had to handle memory management of the font character data since there wasn’t enough RAM for even one job’s worth (see our joint paper).Fun times. I did the driver on the mainframe side, so got to be there for the intense debugging sessions that used only the CRS’s 4x4 hex keypad and 12-character dot-matrix display.Thanks for the DVI shout-out, btw."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think, though, that there was nothing preventing him from developing TeX in Fortran or something, and leaving it at that.  He is just somewhat easily distracted.  He nerd-snipes himself possibly.Yak Shaving is the frustrating work we do because of impedance mismatch in the system.  Libtool is a huge yak shave, for example.  But so is writing a custom CSV parser because an input file is just not quite accessible by the standard, and you could just use python to make the translation, but your environment won&#39;t let you use python in that spot, etc.  Days later nothing is really accomplished, you hate programming, and you can finally start work on the real problem after losing the motivation you had when you started.But I like the idea of a patron saint for this, and Knuth is as good as any.  Perhaps Dijkstra could be the patron saint of Unused Better Solutions.  I&#39;m sure there&#39;s a litany of things that could use saints in this field."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I follow the folks over at 100 rabbits (https://100r.co) and I think they’ve sort of developed yak shaving into a lifestyle.I don’t want to go too far into it cause the website is a treasure trove and exciting to explore on your own but if you follow some of their latest stuff, they’ve built a stack based virtual machine, and a whole set of software around it and it truly feels like they are just exploring every avenue that interests them without rushing themselves. Truly the embodiment of my grow a beard and learn Haskell dreams."</p>

That is a risk these manufacturers accept when they sell their product below market value.Loading up your printer with DRM is having your cake and eating it.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The US policy response has been far more costly and destructive than it needed to be.The pandemic response completely ignored the costs of shutdowns.  There has been little or no consideration of their impact on physical health, mental health, education, business, employment, worship.  It has been as if COVID was the only risk and the only negative, and any other matter was necessarily secondary.  To even mention these matters was considered obtuse.We have also exaggerated the risks.  The disease has a 0.3 risk of fatality, still less for Omicron, and its fatalities largely occur among people with known risk factors.  Children are essentially immune from serious effects, but this has been ignored by policy.ETA: At some point we need a serious reckoning of how we, as a society, mishandled this so badly.  I think we&#39;ll find the mistakes we&#39;ve made aren&#39;t made on COVID only."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This pandemic is very strange mental-wise, all my doctors note that. The US, as far as I understand, has huge lockdowns and that may be the factor, but in my country it&#39;s called &#34;an advisory self-isolation&#34; and everyone basically lives their life like before, except wearing masks in public places and mandatory vaccination to visit a mall or a restaurant (also &#34;manageable&#34;).I&#39;m not a social person (age almost 40), and I ought not to feel any consequences of that, cause even a strict lockdown wouldn&#39;t change my life too much. And I have a friend who isn&#39;t particularly stress-prone (a former warzone guy, 4 kids, a strong mindset).And guess what, we both experienced numerous acute panic attacks in 2020, without realizing what it was. We both have called an ambulance and thought this is the end of me, only to learn later what panic attack is. And we both never got covid. Doctors say that it is a very common phenomenon to observe. Idk about him, but my mental state I find pretty questionable now, because something induces anxiety in it non-stop from the spring 2020. I don&#39;t watch TV, neither read on pandemic situation consciously. Visited therapist for a whole last year.I can imagine what all that does to regular people, and probably can&#39;t imagine what teens may feel about it.Can anyone share similar observations, or am I just a coincidence?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not even a parent, but I&#39;ve been incredibly distressed by this trend. Several of my good friends have had their daughters attempt suicide (luckily, none have succeeded, although 2 extremely close calls). It&#39;s been utterly gut-wrenching to watch these talented, kind, ambitious girls spiral into shells of their former selves.Luckily, all my friends are fellow techies who are upper-middle class, and can afford medication and therapy (and in one case, out-of-state long-term hospitalization.) But even with insurance, they&#39;re looking at many thousands of dollars of treatment.It makes me sick to my stomach to think of all the lower-class parents who are terrified of their kids killing themselves, but can&#39;t afford therapy or psychiatry visits, and can&#39;t get pro-bono help (apparently the wait lists are several months long in many cities.)It&#39;s past time the West reckons with our mental health crisis. Why is it that we&#39;re the wealthiest nations in the world, yet our kids are more stressed and depressed than kids in third-world countries? I think society will only become more and more unstable until we spend time seriously addressing that question and adjust our culture accordingly."</p>

Years ago I was working with Universal on a security project. I&#39;m being driven around with my sales guy on a golfcart. We&#39;re in the back seat, facing backwards, with a guy from Universal, and my sales engineer in the front seats. The driver and my SE are dressed super casual, the sales guy and I both have sport coats and are dressed just well enough to look &#34;important&#34;. Tour bus comes by with the driver doing their spiel and I see a few people looking at us trying to figure out who we are.  I wave to the bus and smile, a couple of people point, and then about 30 people all point their cameras at us and start snapping pics.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A number of moons ago, I switched from a company that used IRC for its internal, real-time, ephemeral communication needs to an enterprise shop that used Microsoft Teams to do that (and of course other communication stuff, as the boundaries for what was better kept in Sharepoint, Confluence, Email/Exchange, the legacy Wiki, and/or Teams were never quite clear :)) there.In the old shop, we eventually had all kinds of important subsystems hooked up to our internal IRC server: Monitoring and alerting. Source control and Wiki activity. The deployment pipeline. Ticket activity reports. All these services were pretty much effortlessly set up to provide useful, real-time status information broadcast to topic-specific channels users could idle in. Everyone could stay informed on topics of their interest, in real time, with no barrier to entry. It was really good, and the implementation completed in a few hours total, for all use-cases, due to irc&#39;s incredible simplicity.Due to the benefits I had reaped from that setup before, I tried to implement parts of it on/for the MS Teams platform at the then-new job. Getting the Teams Python SDK to implement a bot-like entity running alone proved to be a days-long ordeal, and whatever followed wasn&#39;t much more pleasant.In the end, we let someone set up two email-to-teams-channel-forwards which kinda worked, but suffered from obnoxious, multi-minute relay delays.As a consequence of the tedious bringup and the latency shortcoming, the &#34;effortless notification&#34; initiative never really got traction.Not only because of this particular experience I am a firm believer that software/system simplicity is a virtue that can neither be overstated in importance, nor substituted by anything else."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s a real shame how difficult programming is. I don’t mean that it is difficult to write difficult things, but that it is difficult to write simple things. Once upon a time, one could download visual studio, click about to make a new project in (e.g.) Visual Basic, draw a gui in the gui editor, and click the run button. One could then start adding simple functionality (e.g. working through a book). Or even longer ago when a computer might dump you practically straight into BASIC when you turned it on or you might get access to a mainframe/minicomputer with programming tools already set up. Nowadays, an ‘easy’ introduction could involve the horrific process of installing and setting up python on windows (where it is hard to do things other than input/output text) or editing some html/JavaScript files where there are more easily possible interactive things but lots of things are difficult like ‘just drawing things’ or anything that requires a server side.P.S. if you, like me, were wondering what Libera Chat is, it’s the moral successor of Freenode with Freenode now being a shell of its former self."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As an aside, can I just say how refreshing this website is? It&#39;s 100% content, just text. Now view the html source, and be amazed. I daresay the author actually wrote the html by hand. I suppose it could be a very conservative and conscientious site generator that even respects line length, but I&#39;d be surprised. Short css file for minimal style tweaks, and readable markup. Fitting that the article is about simplicity. When I first learned html (late 90s) this is what it looked like. Very nice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I actually use Vim like this, in fact I wrote a plugin to go all the way and make it a completely &#34;normal&#34; editor [1].It&#39;s endlessly surprising to me that still to this day Vim is most commonly considered through the lens of its keybindings. It&#39;s sooo much more than that! It&#39;s a lightweight terminal editor with one of the largest, if not the largest ecosystems of pioneering extensions. It really shouldn&#39;t be weird that you&#39;d want to take advantage of all that without having to submit to the religion of modal editing.1. https://github.com/tombh/novim-mode"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the help pages[0] to help you navigate in this mode:&gt; These Insert mode commands will be useful:&gt; - Use the cursor keys to move around.&gt; - Use CTRL-O to execute one Normal mode command.  When this is a mapping, it is executed as if &#39;insertmode&#39; was off.&gt; - Use CTRL-L to execute a number of Normal mode commands, then use&lt;Esc&gt; to get back to Insert mode.&gt;These items change when &#39;insertmode&#39; is set:&gt; - when starting to edit of a file, Vim goes to Insert mode.&gt; - &lt;Esc&gt; in Insert mode is a no-op and beeps.&gt; - &lt;Esc&gt; in Normal mode makes Vim go to Insert mode.&gt; - CTRL-L in Insert mode is a command, it is not inserted.&gt; - CTRL-Z in Insert mode suspends Vim.I was going to call you out for plagiarizing an idea from a Reddit post[1] as your own, but it turns out you&#39;re the same person, so carry on :)[0]: https://vimhelp.org/options.txt.html#%27insertmode%27[1]: https://old.reddit.com/r/vim/comments/rxedpj/vim_prank_alias..."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29851834">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been working on BookStack for over 6 years now, learning a lot about open source project maintainership during that time. Originally developed it while looking for a documentation system for my mixed-technical-skill workplace. Wanted something easy to use without having to get finance involved when increasing our user count.With Confluence backing away from their self-hosted offerings, hopefully many will find BookStack useful. It&#39;s not supposed to be a direct replacement, and the design &amp; content structure is quite opinionated, but it can serve many of the same use-cases as Confluence had served."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Glad to see any alternatives to confluence (or Atlassian in general). I&#39;ve used Confluence for a good 4 years or so and for the life of me, I can not fathom why anyone would use this for storing documentation for code etc, as opposed to storing things direct in a repo. I can understand it&#39;s use somewhat for business folks, but even then, the way of organising things is abysmal, every solution (such as rich text editing) feels very off the shelf/MVP, uninspiring UI, the list goes on. It feels like most companies that use it already use the Atlassian stack of JIRA/Bitbucket, then feel the need to tack Confluence onto the end because it&#39;s there."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember considering BookStack while looking for a (surprise) replacement for Confluence.The main thing that led me to stop considering it pretty quickly is precisely the concept of books - I find it both unnecessarily complicated and unnecessarily limiting.My Org now uses DokuWiki. It has a lot of issues (the prosemirror visual editor is a good start, but in beta and out of development, for example). But it&#39;s also the least sucking option I&#39;ve found. Most Wiki software severely screws up the editing experience, which may not be such a good idea when you want to get people to document things. I&#39;m glad Bookstack does this right."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"That sounds like a major, incredibly dangerous update to the DB driver. Their 7.1, 7.2, 7.3 versions seem to all have breaking changes [1].Yet they are in obvious violation of SemVer expectations, which they declare to follow [2]:&gt; Mongoid follows versioning guidelines as outlined by the Semantic Versioning Specification, so you can expect only backwards incompatible changes in major versions [sic][1] https://docs.mongodb.com/mongoid/current/tutorials/mongoid-u...[2] https://mongoid.github.io/old/en/mongoid/docs/upgrading.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mongoid docs[1] seem to be pretty cool about this change:&#34;As of Mongoid 7.1, logical operators (and, or, nor and not) have been changed to have the the same semantics as those of ActiveRecord. To obtain the semantics of or as it behaved in Mongoid 7.0 and earlier, use any_of which is described below.&#34;Is it just me or is this one of the most terrible breaking changes in a popular, official library ever?[1] https://docs.mongodb.com/mongoid/current/tutorials/mongoid-q..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We use Mongoid. I treat every upgrade, no matter how small as its own piece of work involving going through the changelogs with a fine-tooth comb. This particular issue got flagged up when we last looked at upgrading. Currently Mongoid upgrades are stalled until we have the time to figure out the impact of some of their more egregious changes.I have a generally low trust approach to all dependency upgrades, irrespective of how minor they are, I&#39;ve been bitten by enough &#34;minor&#34; changes. But I treat Mongoid as an active adversary who is setting out to break things with every update.It&#39;s the complete opposite approach to that of the Rails core team and those that work on ActiveRecord (as the nearest equivalent to Mongoid). Changes to Rails core are always well flagged with really good advance warning of upcoming breaking changes, frequently with deprecation warnings several versions in advance. There just seems to be a core culture of thought and care towards their users."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Freddie de Boer just wrote something on his Substack about this - https://freddiedeboer.substack.com/p/many-kids-dont-have-a-w...The quick takeaway is that school is that for the most vulnerable kids, school is about a lot more than education. Taking school away from those kids can be much more damaging than many people realize.It seems to me like that right strategy would be to just say something like:    We encourage all kids to stay home, but if you can&#39;t, that&#39;s ok. You can come to school and have a warm, quiet place to spend the day, and we&#39;ll provide free lunch to everyone who comes.

Forget about the education piece for a while, just provide the (very important for some people) day care part."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read this post earlier today, and found it quite shocking. I really hope this is an exception rather than the normal.I previously didn&#39;t think about it this way, and thought closing schools was the more sensible choice. But we&#39;re failing a whole generation like this.It more and more feels like we live in a society that sarcrifices their young, just to keep old people on their life support machines a little longer.Yeah, that&#39;s hyperbole. I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the right path, tbh."</p>

This feels...hysterical to me.  Not just because it worries me that this kid is thinking about this in the way they are, but also because it&#39;s wrong.  The risk this person faces is much more likely from the HVAC system in the school, not the study hall.* The way they talk about the other kid asking questions &#34;with their mask down&#34;.  To be obsessed with this sort of minutiae as a kid is scary to me.* Kids thinking about test...and apparently being given something like 5 tests in a single day?  This seems wasteful and hysterical on behalf of the school.* Begin upset at kids for taking these tests in the bathroom instead of at home.It just seems like there is a whole realm of paranoia that this kid is trying to fit on top of their life, and I don&#39;t think this sort of paranoia is in any way reasonable.I think that teaching kids to think about their world with this framing, and at a formative age, is and already has done major damage to their development."</p>

More relevant results than either DDG or Google and a great presentation (like showing snippets from accepted or upvoted SO answers)And I have not even played around with advanced filters like lenses (which people in their discord seem to love).Negatives: So far, I’d say only that the widgets are less usable than DDGs.I had low expectations, but I’m really very positively surprised."</p>

But since fragmentation of streaming services started to happen, I&#39;m going back to things like stremio/torrents/DDL sites.For software, as a hobbyist videographer I wouldn&#39;t purchase the Adobe suite and all the expensive VFX tools I use for my family videos.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The high-level goals of python end up creating these little syntactic landmines that can get even experienced coders. My personal nomination for the worst one of these is that having a comma after a single value often (depending on the surrounding syntax) creates a tuple. It&#39;s easy to miss and creates maddening errors where nothing works how you expect.I&#39;ve moved away from working in Python in general, but I think the #1 feature I want in the core of the language is the ability to make violating type hints an exception[1]. The core team has been slowly integrating type information, but it feels like they have really struggled to articulate a vision about what type information is &#34;for&#34; in the core ecosystem. I think a little more opinion from them would go a long way to ecosystem health.[1] I know there are libraries that do this, I am not seeking recommendations."</p>

Having standard ways to interoperate between different platforms and query and update these goods might make sense (although I still think it goes opposite to the general trend of walled gardens vs. decentralized web, I don&#39;t see why the IP owners would play ball and accept the loss of control).The thing is that in most case those NFTs wouldn&#39;t be trustless. I see people putting forward that a use case would be an NFT that proves that your Rolex is real, or for Fortnite skins, or for the ownership of your house. But in all these situations, there&#39;s a very clear authority (Rolex, Epic Games and the municipal authorities, respectively). These authorities will be allowed to mint new NFTs at will (because who else?) and as such have to be trusted. That opens up interesting questions btw, like &#34;who is Rolex exactly?&#34; which creates a chain of custody of trusted authority involving trademark management among other things. But I digress.But then as soon as an authority is identified, why bother with the extreme overhead (it terms of resources and costs) of blockchain tech? Couldn&#39;t Rolex issue a PGP signed CSV of all valid Rolex serial numbers once a month on IPFS and you&#39;d get the exact same security and trust profile without having to involve any &#34;web3&#34; feature?Like cryptocurrencies, the subset of problems that can only be solved using NFTs is incredibly tiny and speculators rush to make up use cases that, if you think about it for five minutes, clearly make no sense and could be better solved using good old centralized tech."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love syncthing as much as the next guy on here, but this article feels very much like &#34;why doesn&#39;t this square peg fit my round hole?!&#34; Dropbox (and iCloud) are meant more for cloud file storage than pure device-to-device synce. I couldn&#39;t go to a less tech savvy friend and say, &#34;Oh, you use Dropbox for backups? Here, use syncthing instead!&#34; For one, most people don&#39;t have multiple computers they want to keep in sync, and even if they do it&#39;s unlikely that those multiple computers have overlapping periods of being online, which syncthing will need to keep back ups!The author&#39;s baffling reaction to iCloud and Dropbox&#39;s warning just makes my point. Those warnings are super clear to people who use those services for backup - remove this file and it won&#39;t be backed up, hence not available elsewhere. That isn&#39;t those platforms begging for attention (???). Remove those warnings and see how many normies complain to Apple/Dropbox that they didn&#39;t know removing a file from their synced folder meant it wouldn&#39;t be synced anymore. This also applies to the bizarre complaint about cloud storage space limits - of course you need storage space on the service if those files have to live elsewhere!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Syncthing for about a year now, with multiple computers, and it&#39;s fantastic.Dropbox has become a real pain over the years (I&#39;ve also been a paid Dropbox customer for a long time):* adding bloat and features that I don&#39;t want or need* constantly nagging me for upgrades* lying that the admin password is required (it isn&#39;t)* consuming large amounts of CPU when anything changes anywhere in the filesystemIf Dropbox had a subscription plan where I could pay to get just the basic file sync functionality, with no nagging, no prompting, and optimized CPU usage, I would be happy to hand over my money. But it seems the company is run by the marketing team now.I highly recommend syncthing as a very, very capable replacement."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey everyone, glad you all are enjoying the project!To address some of the points I&#39;m seeing, it&#39;s not perfect right now, which is why we&#39;ve considered this a beta release. In particular, there are some issues around name coverage abroad and around engineered features (dams, canals, etc.). A lot of known issues are documented at the top of this page: https://ksonda.github.io/global-river-runner/. Ultimately, we made as much progress as we could, including a lot of manual name suggestions before launching, and decided to publish the tool in beta, with an understanding that we&#39;d take suggestions and otherwise work to improve the tool/data over time.To the points about the distance the paths are starting from a click, it does round coordinates to some extent. As much as I&#39;d like to be more exact, we&#39;re stuck with a limited number of &#34;flowlines&#34; in our dataset and it will look for the closest one, which isn&#39;t always as close as we&#39;d like. It&#39;s most useful for understanding watersheds in broad strokes, but often falls a little short when it comes to the novelty of literally tracing from your address.For both specificity and some of the canal issues, the US-only version of this tool is better than this one (https://river-runner.samlearner.com/) with the obvious limitation that the paths are only within the US.If you have any issues/feedback/suggestions regarding the UI and have a minute, would really appreciate if you&#39;re able to submit them as issues in the project repo on Github: https://github.com/sdl60660/river-runner If you&#39;re experiencing routing/naming issues, you can submit issues in this repo: https://github.com/ksonda/global-river-runnerAgain, thanks for giving the project a look! You can check out some of my other work here: https://www.samlearner.com/ or on my Github (https://github.com/sdl60660).I&#39;d also like to shout out other other people who worked to make this happen: Dave Blodgett (https://github.com/dblodgett-usgs), Kyle Onda (https://github.com/ksonda), and Ben Webb (https://github.com/webb-ben)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t recall what book I was reading that suggested than a civilization based on ecological awareness should be built around watersheds.Maybe half the borders in the world are ridge lines (a natural watershed boundary), while the rest are bodies of water. That means that the consequences of what goes into that water are split between me and perhaps 20 other states/nations. That sort of cross-border negotiation has a lot more friction involved with it.The watershed society would have jurisdictions nested around streams, tributaries, and rivers. I think if you sited your seats of power where your watershed meets the next higher jurisdiction, we probably would have a lot fewer industries running effluent pipes directly into our rivers, because the stuff the mayor is letting into their stream is running past the governor&#39;s house on its way to the president&#39;s."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I spent about a third of 2021 more or less consumed by this phenomenon. In my case it was triggered by job searching: I quit my existing position, intending to do a leisurely search over a few months... and then avoided nearly everything related to the job search for over four months. (While still experiencing a ton of stress as a result of constant anxiety and guilt about it.) Once I actually started, I landed an amazing new position within two months.The thing that made the difference for me was directly and consistently involving my girlfriend. All she did most of the time was sit in the same room as me, working on her own stuff, but some combination of being unable to completely avoid working while she was there, having her there to vent anxiety to, and being able to make commitments to her rather than myself made an enormous amount of difference.I&#39;m not thrilled with myself for the procrastination I did in the first place, but I&#39;m taking it as a hard-won lesson: doing difficult things can be vastly easier if you have someone you trust as support and confidant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had this issue with my first software job right out of college. I was unproductive for weeks, just due to culture shock and (shamefully) malaise. The procrastination snowballed. Luckily a fellow engineer eventually noticed, sat down with me, and recognized exactly what was going on. In the kindest way possible, he sat down behind me and basically made me finally start my next project. He stayed there with me for the rest of the day, answering and asking questions to keep my progress going. It had quite an impact on me. Having another person involved and actively care about my work went a long way."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Excerpt of email reply from Nathan Myhrvold is mostly correct:&gt;The new Java applications are NOT credible threats to traditional PC software any time soon. [...] Cool new technology always expands rapidly into NEW ares (where there is a vacuum).Java&#39;s hype of Write-Once-Run-Anywhere to kill Microsoft Windows didn&#39;t happen on client desktop apps like many expected.  Desktop apps are still C++ and some newer apps are Javascript(Electron).  Yes, there are a few niche desktop apps using Java like JetBrains IDEs but history has shown that Java made more market penetration on server-side code.  The 1990s dot coms like Ebay and Amazon were early users of Java on their servers.  I read that Google uses Java on the web servers to generate the results page.  (To be clear, I think Google uses C++ for the crawlers to build the index and the algorithms for search engine ranking.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Gates was losing sleep because he had come to expect to win everywhere all the time. Myrhvold’s reply (in a lower tweet) is a gentle way of saying that Microsoft doesn’t have to, to succeed as a company.I think as a company finds continuous, outsized success, there is a risk for a leader’s mindset to get warped and resistant to anything but outsized success. Anything less than domination looks like a problem, an anomaly that must be found and destroyed.I think it might explain some otherwise indefensible behavior, like HP spying on their board, or all the shady stuff that Uber was doing, or even MS’s own anti-competitive behavior.I think leaders have to get shocked out of this mindset or just removed. Gates was shocked by MS’s conviction and stepped down. Ballmer and Kalanick were pressured to resign by investors. Both MS and Uber have benefited from new leadership that lowered the temperature and refocused the company.I also think it explains why Facebook is the way it is now.  There doesn’t seem to be such pressure points available for Zuckerberg though."</p>

https://www.baeldung.com/java-17-new-featuresIt is pretty impressive how Java keeps up to date over decades! I think in the long run it is very wise to be conservative over new language features. For example the work von &#34;green threads&#34; (project Loom) is a really good, fundamental approach with backwards compatiblity and there are some voices on the web thinking that such an approach is more clever then introducing &#34;async&#34; to the language (C#, Python, etc).

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Part of the reason it had taken so long is because I put a substantial amount of work into a part of the project that&#39;s no longer necessary due to changing requirements, which I don&#39;t think I could have forseen.One of the things that I&#39;ve experienced with new grad junior devs is that there&#39;s an adjustment needed to change from academic working to business working. In academia, usually the professor gives an assignment and you have to go off and figure it out, without bothering the professor, no matter what. In business, it&#39;s much better to &#39;bother the professor&#39; regularly and check in affirmatively on whether the assignment has changed, or to tell the manager about challenges that arise to re-plan together. As a junior employee, you&#39;re not going to know the full business context of what makes sense, and checking in can save weeks of time that would otherwise be spent off on your own.Not sure if that&#39;s the case here, but certainly something you could consider going forwards to prevent similar situations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"If all of this was planned (and I’m not saying it is), that would have been very clever. It would work like this:1. You “accidentally forget” to disable the feature in hardware. Given how competitive the market is, motherboard manufacturers can be relied upon to enable it in their “1337 OVERCLOCKZ” mode. No conspiracy is needed.2. You “tolerate” this practice just long enough to win the critical initial wave of reviews and benchmarks. Interested buyers will look at those charts for years to come.3. And when you finally do turn the feature off to protect the market for your server chips, you can plausibly claim that you had explicitly forbidden using this configuration from the very beginning. None of this is your fault..Edit/Addendum: Just to clarify my actual opinion, of course an honest mistake is more likely, at least for step 1. Very few “evil schemes” exist in reality because people aren’t all that clever (and all that evil). But the possibility is interesting to speculate on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Much ado about nothing, IMHO.AVX-512 isn&#39;t advertised by Intel as a 12th gen desktop CPU feature and doesn&#39;t provide any advantages for most desktop users anyway.Sure, there&#39;s niche applications like some particular PS3 emulator, but I don&#39;t share the author&#39;s opinion w.r.t. to performance and efficiency in desktop use."</p>

Those Americans will therefore be less enterprising and much more pleasure loving. They will have rebelled against long hours; the chances are that in 2022 few people will work more than seven hours a day, if as much.The effects of this, which I am sure sounds regrettable to many of my readers, will, in my opinion, be good. It was essential that the American race should be capable of intense labor and intense ambition if it was to develop its vast country.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"   &gt;Similar reforms apply to cooking, a great deal of which will survive among old fashioned people, but a great deal more of which will probably be avoided by the use of synthetic foods.

This is very interesting especially if you think &#34;synthetic foods&#34; not just literally but as take out, processed products and such. I know a lot of young professional people who technically never cook. Like almost never and whatever they have at home is just snacks, if you hungry &gt; order. There are a lot people like these.    &gt;It is conceivable, though not certain, that in 2022 a complete meal may be taken in the shape of four pills. This is not entirely visionary; I am convinced that corned beef hash and pumpkin pie will still exist, but the pill lunch will roll by their side.

Well Soylent do exist so that&#39;s not far fetched either."</p>

It&#39;s math and tricks, and if human intelligence is truly nothing more than math and tricks, then what we have today is a tiny, tiny, tiny fraction of the amount of math and tricks in the average human brain, because what we have today isn&#39;t anywhere close."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the early days I worked at a company that had a natural language chatbot product.  It wasn&#39;t an online thing, but rather part of a larger tool.  You could ask it to do things like &#34;show me the quarterly spreadsheet&#34;, and if it didn&#39;t know what &#34;quarterly spreadsheet&#34; was, it&#39;d ask questions in English and learn what &#34;quarterly&#34; and &#34;spreadsheet&#34; meant.  And it could use that new knowledge to update its questions so if you asked for &#34;spreadsheet&#34;, it would know to ask if you wanted the &#34;quarterly&#34; one, and so on.This was in the long ago, so it wasn&#39;t ML, but a very large state machine written by someone that was no doubt a genius, and also had no coding standards to speak of.  Updating it was a maddening process, and thankfully one I rarely had to think about since I was tasked with GUI stuff.When I was hired, I was told it was a fantastic app, customers loved it, and so on.  Later, when I was talking to support reps one day over lunch, I learned that the number one activity they had to do was log into deployments remotely and remove &#34;knowledge&#34; from the state machine of new swear words the customer had taught the machine out of frustration trying to get it to do something, which caused this feedback loop of the interaction swearing at users.I often feel like we&#39;re not in a better state these days."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There also a growing list of states that prohibit asking for salary history. Don’t ever give a salary history if asked. Only share if it is going to help in your negotiation. Advise everyone you know who is job seeking to do the same.This is a very dangerous question to ask because it locks in previous pay discrimination based on protected categories."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The laws were drafted, in large part, to help close the gender pay gap.HIRED’s annual recruiting reports found that a significant driver of this were
candidates asking for far lower than other peers. Many times,
companies would then offer that candidate a greater salary, which was still below the bolder or more comfortable peer. The candidate feels like their company is doing them a favor.So, this aspect should illuminate that many people are not aware that their own company is contributing to pay gaps. Any individual may in fact think the opposite, that it must be some other company with the proverbial bigoted shadow men in a board room disenfranchising everyone that doesn&#39;t look like them. When that picture isn&#39;t whats happening or isn&#39;t necessary, when candidates exacerbate this on their own.Could it be that the candidate has experience being turned down when asking higher rates? Perhaps.Could it be that the company doesnt even realize that they arent getting a deal with the candidate, but really just exacerbating pay gaps? That the candidates asking lower may be disproportionately certain genders and ethnicities?New York City is reducing this to anti-discrimination, making the penalties inherit discrimination frameworks without regard to the circumstances leading up to it. I think thats a great remedy, given how opaque and nuanced the reality really has been.We don&#39;t need to tweak candidate behavior or gradually retrain companies to notice gender and race to conditionally adjust, instead just make the salaries apparent for all."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get why companies play such games when paying someone. I&#39;ve been interviewing with companies and even after doing well on the on site, they keep trying to skirt the issue of compensation by asking weird questions like &#34;so how do you think you did?&#34; Its like you know that i did well, otherwise you wouldn&#39;t even be talking to me, you are just gauging my confidence level so you know how much i&#39;d be willing to bend when it comes to compensation. I wish they just had standard incoming compensation based on titles or something, its exhausting trying to duke it out with HR when all i want is to be paid fairly and write some code. They aren&#39;t doing anyone a favor to underpay because when when people find out, and they will find out, their work quality will decline if they feel they are being used and they will most likely not care about ditching the company for better compensation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Between this and Tesla citing climate change as a reason for dropping crypto, this is actually a very interesting shift, and one that might be very bad for crypto.The amount of money people actually donated or spent with crypto has always been minimal. (Wish I had harder numbers to back this up, but you can see second-order effects from e.g. Steam adding Bitcoin support but then taking it away. Or how Bitpay has stagnated heavily, while a purely investment/speculation platform like Coinbase is worth billions.) However, for a long time, the benefit of accepting Bitcoin as payment was the marketing. Accepting crypto signaled that you were a cool company, you could put out a press release and the news media would run articles about how X service is now accepting cryptocurrency for payments.The same thing happened again years later with &#34;blockchain.&#34; Remember Kodakcoin? Remember Long Island Blockchain? Nothing ever really surfaced from these initiatives, but again, it was all about that big marketing hype that came from saying your company was going to use blockchain for... something.Where it gets interesting is... what if crypto becomes anathema? What if accepting crypto or holding crypto starts become so closely associated with directly causing climate change, that no company is going to want to be openly associated with crypto, NFTs, etc due to the negative association?You have one side hyping up Web3 as the next evolution as the web, but if the perception of crypto continues to be that it&#39;s a significant contributor to climate change -- regardless of how true that may be -- we could see a major decline in mainstream support."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hey congrats on making it 10 months!&#34;Urgent to not block progress, but also ironic that they are asking a person who has no clue what they are doing to deliver critical work&#34;Friend of mine started a role there (this was 4-5 years ago) and was fired (sorry... more or less asked to leave, being told he could keep his signing bonus if he just left) within about six weeks because he wasn&#39;t immediately delivering on some insane amounts of work. Truly, he recapped it for me, the expectations were absolutely incredible and I&#39;d consider him a hard worker who has found a ton of success in his current role.I bag on Amazon a lot on here (which if I were to review with my therapist is likely because I had an absolutely HORRENDOUS experience in an interview loop with them my first step out of college that still makes me nervous in interviews, even 15 years later). But living in Seattle, a notable chunk of my social circle works there. I&#39;d say a few enjoy the scale of things they get to work on or perhaps the brand name, but overall none of them ever talk about liking the work environment/balance/culture.One friend, at a director level, just quit on a whim because he came back from parental leave and his direct reports had all been put on a PIP while he was out.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I see a lot of these comments have taken to a kind of Amazon-bashing and venting their own experiences, where the author actually... didn&#39;t?I thought the author was incredibly fair/objective, and at least the way I read it, it wasn&#39;t so much that he had such a miserable experience or could only stomach 10 months of pain/abuse (in fact if you actually read to the end, he praises his manager, his teammates, etc.), and more so that it only took him 10 months to realize that the company culture and way-of-working was not aligned with his personal preferences. He does have legitimate complaints about parts of his experience, and makes some keen observations about the consequences and tradeoffs of Amazon choosing to adopt the culture that it does (though I also think he&#39;s wrong about a few things too), but overall it&#39;s less of a &#34;Amazon == bad&#34; piece and more of a &#34;this is why it wasn&#39;t to my taste&#34; reflection.Frankly, I would congratulate the author, and think of this as a success-story. Paraphrasing his own words, he learned a lot, met some good people, found some good practices that he&#39;s going to carry forward with him... isn&#39;t that a successful outcome (minus the annoyance of another round of job hunting, but hey in this market, another job hop is probably just an opportunity to level up comp, rather than an existential threat that you might be unemployed and starve)? Obviously the team/org he was in is suffering major attribution problems, and that&#39;s obviously a bad thing, but that&#39;s not his problem either.Note: in case it wasn&#39;t clear, I do work within Amazon, but these opinions are my own, not representing my employer, blah blah"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"At https://www.waiterio.com we use plain webviews for Android, iOS and macOS without any framework and Electron for Windows and Linux.
The problem with frameworks is that once a year Apple make a change to their signature and it can break the framework for several weeks/months before a fix/hack around is found.
By using native webviews you can quickly implement the change needed and get back online in days."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a very odd design document and it makes me think this author has thought a lot about materials and buildings but not actually built anything.The steel moment frame, to someone with shallow knowledge, sounds so strong and resilient.  But in fact, a rigid steel structure is more vulnerable to seismic (and even wind) loads than wooden framing which can flex and move and dampen those loads naturally.The stainless spec for the frame is just pure silliness.  Looking at my notes now, for steel beams buried in the ground:  200 microns of rust per year in very aggressive soils, but it rusts on both sides, so make that 400 microns.

... which means that it takes ~25 years to rust through naked 3/8 steel buried in the most aggressive soils.... which also means that unburied steel, protected from elements, up in the air, is going to last more than 1000 years.Oh, and also, the SS is more brittle so you&#39;ve made your seismic issues even worse....If I had an unlimited budget and was aiming for &gt;1000 years I would pour the piles to bedrock with stainless rebar inside fly-ash concrete and top those pilings with plate connectors into which you could socket large wooden columns (perhaps 8x8) and build the structure with large wooden members connected with steel connectors and column caps, etc.I would only use steel members if the span called for wood that was too big (like a 24&#39; span needing a 8x14 or whatever)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I expected something much simpler : bricks, stones, and wood. It&#39;s not like we are running low on examples of 1000+ years buildings (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/11th_century_in_architecture). These castles, cathedrals, farms, were built to last, so it&#39;s appropriate to use them as examples.We can, however, apply modern technics and materials when they make sense : insulation, windows, waterways... Prefer wood, wool and steel over plastics or composite materials and you&#39;re good to go.On a side note, I&#39;m currently buying a house (old farm) with over 200 years old plain oak carpentry. The thing is absolutely massive and would be unimaginably expensive to build today. With the proper care, it might last another 200 years without issue. Remember, Notre-Dame de Paris used 300 years old trees cut in ~1150 for its roof -before the 2019 fire-. With the proper care it would have still be standing today. I find that to be deeply humbling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If I were to design a house with the idea that it should serve future generations, I&#39;d design it to be reconfigured, recycled, or torn down easily.After reading some of Stewart Brand&#39;s writing, I&#39;ve learned to love ugly buildings."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am absolutely flummoxed by this review. Mine is configured with nearly identical specs (except that I have 64GB RAM) and is one of the worst purchases I&#39;ve ever made.Enabling deep sleep works fine; waking from it is impossible. WiFi stops working. The touch pad becomes hypersensitive. I&#39;ve resorted to turning the whole thing completely off after every use. But the battery still loses power even when the machine is completely powered down.The machine also freezes if I try to open a jpg or a PDF from the file explorer. Just completely freezes. Fan spins up like crazy, but as I mentioned, I have 64GB of RAM in this thing. It should be able to open a single one-page scanned document from my own scanner. If there&#39;s anything wrong with the file, this is the computer that&#39;s making the file poorly.The internet connection also just turns off after about half an hour of use. I have a Belkin dock with Ethernet plugged into it, which is then plugged into my Framework&#39;s USB-C port. This dock supports my work Mac all work day every day with no issues at all, so it&#39;s not the dock&#39;s problem. But the Framework? Internet just stops working after half an hour. And it manages to kill both wired and WiFi when it dies. I can turn them back on, but this is a ridiculous problem to have.This last point is pretty minor, but the hinges are floppy. The whole screen shakes around when I type on it.I have no idea how this author&#39;s experience is so much better than mine unless they just haven&#39;t used it much yet, but I regret absolutely everything about the purchase of this machine and feel like I was sold a bill of goods by all the glowing positive reviews all over the internet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author does not address the screen resolution (and just says the screen is nice) but I&#39;m hearing that the screen res is a bit to high to work with without scaling and a tad to low to do 2x scaling. And people don&#39;t like fractional scaling, at least in Gnome (it seems to look weird). Is this still an issue?I tend to prefer 1080p for this reason on 12-14&#34; screens. My Thinkpad X13 gen 2 has a 13.3&#34;, 1920x1200 screen, windows sets it to 150%, which seems ok, although Ubuntu works well for me without scaling still. The Frame work laptop has an even higher res (2256x1504). I do hear people scaling the fonts and that seems to be a nice solution... I remember from back in the old days that I never really liked the look of this.What do people think of this? I&#39;m hoping that in the future you can choose the screen (and easily get replacements as well, I hear they are working on that).Edit: I hope these issues are being addressed by established DE&#39;s, I&#39;m assuming they won&#39;t be an issue on Canonical&#39;s (hypothetical ;)) Flutter based DE that&#39;s (obviously ;)) coming and on System76&#39;s Rust based new DE for Pop OS [0].[0]: https://www.theregister.com/2021/11/08/system76_developing_n..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been at it intensively for a couple months and my mind simply refuses to cooperate. If anything, after having done 400+ problems I seem to be worse at them than when I started.Yup -- brain fog, paralysis and negative performance are the sure-fire signs of burnout (as least as pertains to your capacity for grinding LC).  Excellent preparation for the daily grind of actually working for companies that rely on these tests.Leetcode isn&#39;t about fun and challenging things, it&#39;s about thinking in one particular way, spitting out solutions using the same exact data structures and jumping through hoops on command without philosophizing or creating anything that can be reused/extended.Exactly.  And these are apparently precisely the &#34;skills&#34; these companies are &#34;desperately&#34; seeking to find among the engineers they invite for an on-site interview.And don&#39;t forget the strong &#34;culture fit&#34; signal indicated by the sheer willingness to grind, grind, grind.You memorize, regurgitate and participate in the agile masquerade. Creativity is shunned. Tried architectures/patterns are what is expected.That&#39;s ticket.  This is exactly the mindset these companies are after.  That&#39;s why they swear up and down on the efficacy of these tests.On the bright side: at least you&#39;ve been freed of any illusions, by this point, about the intrinsic value of your advanced hard science degree."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a 20+ year Senior Software Architect, Team Lead, Senior Developer and a PM (all at the same time at the moment!).  I&#39;ve done everything from C++ to 20 years of .Net to now TypeScript and Angular 13 with .Net Core REST APIs against an Oracle SQL database.I am self-taught and I can&#39;t do these leetcode problems if my life depended on it.I still deliver high quality software on time, and on budget, and have a solid grasp on my career.I wouldn&#39;t worry about this too much.  It depends on what you are going for.Sure, if you want to pass a FAANG interview where you are going to get these types of questions, go for it.  To solve day to day business problems, you rarely need this stuff.  You just need to learn how to write quality, performant, correct code that results in solutions.The best way to do this is develop experience in the industry over the years.My 2 cents."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t see this mentioned by other commenters so let me provide another perspective. Namely, I think OP is doing it wrong.OP claims to have done 400+ LC problems over a couple of months. Let me say it out loud here: this is simply crazy. It strikes me as an attempt to not learn how to tackle these challenges, but to actually brute-force through them. To anyone preparing for an interview: don&#39;t do this! Grab a book like Elements of Programming Interviews (EPI), maybe follow some online courses on programming puzzle patterns, and then start grinding LC. Maybe interleave grinding with learning? Your end goal should be to develop deep understanding of what you are doing, not memorise the solutions.Also, while going through LeetCode, it is very important to realise that the problem classification there is a bit wild at times. Don&#39;t stress that you cannot solve a medium sometimes as they are mislabeled. I did mediums that could be hards, hards that could be mediums, and hards that were just impossibly hard. Typically a very hard problem is not something you should expect in an interview setting as most interviers* don&#39;t expect you to implement KMP on the spot. Doesn&#39;t hurt to know it and impress the interviewer with knowledge, but if you think memorising KMP is the way, you&#39;re mistaken.* - there is still luck involved and you can have a crazy interviewer. It can happen, so just accept it and move on. Don&#39;t treat it as a personal defeat.Source: I grinded and I had offers from most of FAANG letters."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Compiz was probably the single most impactful event for desktop linux of the mid 2000&#39;s. Not that it itself made much of a difference, but the ripples affect many areas we take for granted today. A few reasons:  - it put linux ahead of windows and mac in terms of appearance;

  - it brought many new users and most were a good mix technical and enthusiasts;

  - it showed the advantages of modular software;

  - many plugins were useful and these useful plugins influenced desktops to this day;

  - it was fast, stable and cool enough;

  - it brought many new developers;

  - it was an incentive for vendors to improve 3d linux drivers;

  - it made X.Org developers improve redirection,

  - it came by default on the most popular distro from 2006 to 2012.

Yes, most of the effects were useless but even they helped developers and designers to decide what not to include or do in the future. It pioneered useful things like selecting an area of the screen and saving it directly to a file, useful zoom and quick visualization of non-visible windows. It also showed how important compositing was on the desktop. Although probably not in direct influence, there is a reason android, wayland and whatever comes with ChromeOS all have compositing features.At the time, there was some interesting developments and experimentation: métisse, sun&#39;s looking glass, bumptop, deskgallery... none of them was as successful as compiz. I&#39;m proud I was myself part of it (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-X9bcrJ3TjY) and have my name written in some of its source files to this day, even if almost nobody use it anymore."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Compiz was one of those things I could show off to friends to prove that linux was actually way cooler than any of _their_ operating systems, but since then seems to have been completely forgotten about (at least by me).

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow did this ever take me back. Arguably my first &#34;public code release&#34; was a plugin (&#34;mod&#34; back then I think) for the WWIV BBS system -- a screensaver called &#34;Bubbles&#34; that would draw random circles on the idle screen instead of the dead blinky cursor at top left. BBS owners would basically need to code it as a diff in their own system and recompile the thing.I was maybe 9 or 10 years old. It was probably 50ish lines of C code, and I made some serious assumptions about what video card and modes were present.I really really loved computers and coding back then.Reading the comment below about being elderly and soulless also resonates for me at the moment.I miss the romance of it all. :) I&#39;ve been married to computers for nearly 40 years now, and all of the spice is gone. It&#39;s just comfortable and regular and routine.Oh well, on to another 2-hour interminable sprint planning sesh (sigh) -- &#34;yes dear, I&#39;ll be right there&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is Alina Chan, one of the co-authors of Viral: The Search for the Origin of Covid-19.In defense of a natural origin of Omicron, this study describes the remarkable evolution of SARS-CoV-2 during convalescent plasma treatment of an immunosuppressed patient for 3-4 months; the mutations also reduced sensitivity to neutralizing antibodies: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03291-yWe know that there is a large immunocompromised population in Africa and that Covid-19 is rampant there. We also know that most hospitals, regardless of country, don&#39;t have the resources to track the evolution of SARS-CoV-2 in their immunocompromised patients. So it&#39;s not unexpected that a variant like Omicron could have evolved over an entire year in an immunocompromised individual before finally infecting others.If there is any evidence that a lab in the region was serially passaging SARS-CoV-2 in neutralizing antibodies/patient serum, then I&#39;d say there is something to go on for a potential lab origin. But at the moment, there is not even circumstantial evidence pointing to this happening in Africa. Maybe setting up a secure channel for whistleblowers with evidence of the above would be the most productive approach.The above is not to say that I don&#39;t think there needs to be much more transparency and accountability from scientists working with pathogens.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m open minded, but my bullshit detectors started going off around the point where it was casually implied that we all know and it is widely accepted that delta was leaked from a lab.  I tried googling it but could find nothing.  Then I looked at the two sources the author links:&gt; https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4371212&gt; https://www.taiwannews.com.tw/en/news/4382708Neither of these have nearly enough evidence or support for such a massive claim (the second doesn&#39;t even mention delta), as far as I can tell, and I can find no other reputable sources that make a similar claim.  Heck, I can&#39;t even find un-reputable ones that mention this.Am I missing something?  I&#39;m not going to continue with the article if this is how flimsy the sourcing is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If the author actually had some kind of evidence that there was a lab leak source of Omicron, don’t you think it would be mentioned in the opening paragraphs of the blog?  Instead we have a long list of connect-the-dots tweets, out of context quotes, and unsubstantiated speculation going on for 2/3s of the post before we even get to the Omicron stuff.The meat of the speculation is a scary looking graph plotting genetic delta from the origin.  Here’s a more objective plot from the Wikipedia entry: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/SARS-CoV-2_Omicron_variant#/...Notice anything?  Looks like Gamma and others have similar genetic distances without other mutations.Sensational blogging is pretty sensational.  That’s about it."</p>

So besides SEO, there&#39;s this thing where the recipe itself is basically defenseless against someone stealing it and calling it theirs but the sum of the fluff around it plus the recipe on the other hand can be copyrighted and enjoys all the protections afforded to these kinds of things. So, if say, Jamie Oliver likes your recipe and puts it in a book passing it as his, you can now legally tell him to stop doing that because of said fluff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is probably one of the best write-ups I&#39;ve seen around the basics of automotive control unit reverse engineering.More modern VW control units are the same in broad strokes - they use UDS on ISO-TP instead of KWP on TP2.0, but this is just evolution of the same fundamentals. And instead of the wacky SGO format inside of FRF update files, they use the ASAM MCD-2 D-ODX format to define flashing layers. Most European automakers are similar.One interesting difference and trend in automotive control modules (also mentioned in Willem&#39;s fantastic write-up) is that many EU modules started adding signature checking and encrypted updates in the late 2000s, while most US and Japanese automakers have only done so in the last 2-3 years.These encrypted and signature checked updates are by and large still fairly vulnerable - often due to logic errors in the complex upgrade processes and occasionally due to a strange insistence on using RSA using PKCS#1.5 with e=3 and inadequate padding validation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The electronics seemed to be fabricated using bare dies attached to some substrate, probably to lower cost and improve reliability at higher temperatures. The board is made up of two parts, a low-power part with the CPU and CAN transceivers, and some high-power part with 6 MOSFETs forming a three phase H-Bridge.&gt; https://blog.willemmelching.nl/images/vw/IMG_3181.jpgIt doesn&#39;t really look cheap to me (large machined surfaces on the cast aluminium casing, two ceramic PCBs, everything connected with wire bonding, even the motor windings and the external connector, which means that at least those bonds are carried out on an almost completely assembled product; also look at the sheer size of the motor bonds) but it does look very reliable - everything is bonded or welded, zero connectors, no fasteners, all solid state."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great write up which also illustrates how deep DRM/closed systems are in cars built this century.Until around mid 90&#39;s cars still had lots of relays and barely comprehensible wiring looms if you could get your hands on workshop manuals.The sooner we go back to a BEV with the simplicity of a 1960&#39;s VW Beetle the better imo, not least so that the third world can get a look in."</p>

That kind of walk-before-you-talk behavior is refreshing and respectable in today&#39;s hype-strewn entrepreneurial landscape."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ironic that her board of directors-- one of the most praised aspects of Theranos-- probably hurt her when it came to going after her with criminal charges. These were some of the most well-connected people in the country, and making them look like fools did her no favors. Once it was clear this wouldn&#39;t go away quietly, I&#39;d bet they pushed hard to ensure criminal prosecution. (which I think she deserved anyway.)Especially because it was those same directors&#39; reputations that likely helped the fraud go on so long. There was probably a fair number of skeptics who thought &#34;Surely they wouldn&#39;t put their name on something like this if there was nothing there&#34;. I doubt Kissinger or the people around him want the last of his legacy to be punctuated by Theranos.I&#39;ll be honest: I kind of thought the same thing. That a breakthrough in science of this magnitude with so much silence around its details was strange, especially in the face of some expert skepticism. But the idea that Henry Kissinger etc. would attach themselves to it without compelling evidence made me more or less shrug my shoulders and move on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was in response to mwseibel&#39;s thread, which had a big discussion yesterday:Google no longer producing high quality search results in significant categories - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=29772136 - Jan 2022 (1167 comments, spread over multiple pages - note the &#34;X more comments&#34; links at the bottom)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To some extent, I worry that the problem with search engines is that there isn&#39;t any data worth returning.  Yesterday&#39;s thread talked a lot about reviews.  Writing a review is hard work that requires deep domain expertise, experience with similar products, and months of testing.  If you want a review for something that came out today, there is no way that work could have been done, so there simply isn&#39;t anything to find.  Instead you&#39;ll get a list of &#34;Best TVs 2021&#34; or whatever, with some blurb and an affiliate link, not an actual review.  That&#39;s what people can make for free with a day&#39;s notice, so if you write a search engine that discards those sites, that&#39;s fine, you&#39;ll just return &#34;no results&#34; for every interesting query.I guess what I&#39;m saying is that if you want better reviews, you probably want to start writing reviews and figuring out how to sell them for money.  Many have tried, few have succeeded.  But there probably isn&#39;t some Javascript that will fix this problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Why not try writing a search engine specifically for some category dominated by SEO spam?Back in the olden days, there were lots of organizations that collated high quality content from the best writers. They nurtured expert writers and paid them well. They fact-checked the content and employed diligent editors and proofreaders so it was accurate and well-written. Over the years, they&#39;d build a reputation for reliability and trustworthiness that kept people coming back for more. If you wanted to learn about fitness, or cars, or cooking, or science, you&#39;d find a reputable author and publisher and buy their magazines or books.But then, in the early 2000s, the geniuses from SV &#34;disrupted&#34; the publishing industry and its financial model. They brought us a much better way to find content, the search engine. Because they were so much better than the old-fashioned publishers, search engines gobbled up the advertising money and became the dominant gateway to content. Publishers had to abandon expensive high-quality writing because rankings and eyeballs now mattered more than quality and trustworthiness. Instead of investing in writers, they invested in marketers and SEO specialists.The result: worthless content, writers banging out garbage for peanuts, and useless search engines.Two decades later, looking at the barren wasteland they had created, the SV geniuses thought: I know what we need, more search engines, but smaller ones that collate high-quality content from the best writers. There must be money in that, right?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I saw only this quote on Twitter the other day&gt; The so-called normal distribution of statistics assumes that there are default humans who serve as the standard that the rest of us can be accurately measured against.Which was, frankly, shocking to see coming from Scientific American, something I had assumed was a respectable scholarly publication, if not an actual academic journal, per se. It&#39;s an absolutely mind-boggling mistake to publish in something that claims itself to be about science. That is not at all what a normal distribution is, and the normal distribution makes no such assumption. Anyone who passed a basic Intro to Statistics course should be able to explain why this is wrong.To open with such a profoundly wrong assertion, and then publish an article built on this flawed assumption just beggars belief. I feel like I&#39;ve wandered into some kind of Twilight Zone that there are apparently serious people, charged with informing the public about science, who are publishing obvious falsehoods and expecting us to go along with them.I cannot understand how an editor of a scientific publication read that sentence and did not immediately send the piece back to the author with a note reading &#34;No thank you. You clearly have no idea what you&#39;re talking about&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When did SA change? In the 1970s-80s, its articles were quite technical, for scientifically literate readers to understand something outside their field. When I looked at SA again after a long absence, around 20 years ago, it had already been dumbed down to about what Popular Science was many years ago.SA had another era, in my dad&#39;s day, when its aim was less academic and more for the home enthusiast and hobbyist. I wonder when it became more of a forum for academic researchers to popularize their work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My own major debilating depression was such that I couldn&#39;t get out of bed other than to use the toilet. Worse than that I could see no reason to get out of bed and didn&#39;t care to get out of bed. Taking a shower and getting dressed was out of the question. I knew the strain I was causing in my family, but since I didn&#39;t feel anything, I couldn&#39;t feel enough empathy for them to do anything about it. I knew I used to love them, but that seemed a long time ago and there was no hope of ever feeling again. I thought about suicide often, but my inability to get motivated prevented me from carrying it out. I once had a bounce of energy so I started planning to kill myself and the weird thing was, that I felt the happiest I had ever felt in my life. It was such a feeling of peace and joy that it would soon be over.Fortunately for me, my family would not tolerate me in this condition and forced to me to get out of bed and dragged me to doctors and checked me into mental health units until we found the right doctor who perscribed the right medication that worked. Turns out typical anti-depressants don&#39;t work on me because I am bipolar and was experiencing bipolar depression.It&#39;s been three years of recovery now and I am very happy. I take my quatiepine every night and get the sleep I need so I don&#39;t relaspe into mania and then depression.My family is not sophisticated about mental illness. They would rather not think about it. But the one thing they did is to refuse to let me remain in that state and forced me to take action."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Depression can also manifest in different ways. One way is anger, frustration, and anxiety. My wife’s depression was like this. She would come home from work, find one thing wrong with our apartment - there were dirty dishes in the sink, the clothes hadn’t been folded - and get angry with me for not having taken care of it.The fact that I had cooked dinner and mopped the floors didn’t count.She was angry with me probably 33-50% of the time. For about a year I tried to get out ahead of all the chores. But that’s impossible. Finally I realized that this wasn’t my fault. I wasn’t a bad partner. This was something in her head.I could actually watch in real time as her own brain gaslit her. I’d pay her a compliment — “that dress looks nice” — and see a perceptible lag as her brain figured out how to turn it into an insult — “your other dresses aren’t nice.”Eventually she recognized something was wrong and got help, but it took a couple of years. She is a completely different person now.If you are the partner of a depressed person, your primary responsibility is to yourself. You have to stay sane. THEN, if you can, you can support and help your partner. But if you lose your own mental health you’re pretty much done."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the overarching message with this post is right on whenever you are talking to someone who is struggling: listen, love, and don&#39;t judge. A hug is much better than a suggestion on how the family member can &#34;fix&#34; themselves.I also want to put a plug in for dogs. I have struggled with depression on and off in my life, and two years ago I adopted a dog I saw being abused in the street. She was just a little puppy, and I absolutely did not want anything to do with raising a dog at the time, but I felt I had no choice. I picked her up and took her home.Since then I have not been able to sleep past 7am in the morning without these two little eyes staring me down. But it is wonderful. She gives me relentless love every day, and she gave my life a really healthy structure it desperately needed. We go on walks three times a day looking for her doggy friends. I spent a lot more time in nature, because she doesn&#39;t give a damn for computers or video games. I know even some people look down on me for how much I love my dog, but they have no idea what I was like before. This dog saved my ass.Now it is IMPOSSIBLE for me to just lie in bed, and that is a great thing, not a bad thing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m sorry, but at 7500 words, this is more of a novella than a summary.The summary at the end of the book is shorter than this blog post and contains the big takeaways.I love this book as much as the other person does, but there are much better reads to go deeper into some of the inspiration:https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1059504529111158784Additionally the major influences on the book:https://twitter.com/jamesclear/status/1059521349239169024Tiny Habits for example is super underrated and one of the better habit books if you enjoyed this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I loved reading Atomic Habits during the first lockdown. I was excited to try out its actionables, specially tracking to keep me honest.I tried a bunch of iOS apps, but wanted no friction, no tracking, no cloud, no social, etc. so eventually built https://flathabits.com. Also wanted to own my habit data (as plain text), so I made sure Flat Habits stored its data locally as an org file.I&#39;m an Emacs nutter and can say the strength of a habit tracker lies in removing daily friction from the tracking process itself. The plain text part is cherry on top (bringing piece of mind around lock-in). In my case, it&#39;s been months since I looked at the plain text file itself.As for forming habits themselves (the actual goal)... it&#39;s been well over a year since I started running. I&#39;ve kept it up since reading Atomic Habits (and started tracking)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I read this book and I think this sums it up in a Tweet:The laws are:  Make it obvious, Make it attractive, Make it easy, Make it satisfying; Each law maps to one of the four steps of habit formation:  Make it obvious → Cue Make it attractive → Craving Make it easy → Response Make it satisfying → Reward; Make it Obvious To effectively build a new habit, make the cue for that habit blatantly obvious"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Along similar lines, I&#39;ve adopted a hyper-frequent commit pattern in git. I do a bunch of meaningless micro-commits as I&#39;m making progress, and then rewrite them all into one or two meanginful commits once I&#39;ve reached a working state of whatever I was trying to do.I find it&#39;s helpful for not losing work / easily backing up if as I&#39;m going along I realize I want to change approach.(For the micro commit I have a git command &#34;git cam&#34; that just commits all changes with the message &#34;nt&#34;. Then once I&#39;m ready to do a &#34;real commit&#34;, I have &#34;git wip&#34; which rolls back all the nt commits but leaves them in checkout; then I can make one or two &#34;real&#34; commits.)I wonder if dura would be even better, or if the commit frequency would end up being too fine-grained and obscure?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built a similar tool a couple of years ago here: https://github.com/google/git-sync-changesBoth save uncommitted changes in a hidden ref.Based on the README, the differences seem to be:1. dura runs as a daemon while git-sync-changes is a one shot execution.2. dura saves locally, while git-sync-changes syncs with a remote repo.3. dura only does the save and the restore is manual, whereas git-sync-changes does both steps automatically.I’m glad to see more people exploring this space. I think there’s a lot of untapped potential in tracking pending changes similarly to how we track committed changes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interviews are really a dumb game these days so if you want to really game it you can go with a statistical approach:* Practice questions by company on LeetCode, sort by frequency of last 6 months and work down the list, do maybe 75-100, the list updates once a week* Search for the company on the LeetCode forums and sort by most recent. If a question is not on LC yet it will likely get posted there, so you can get really fresh intel.I&#39;ve read of people doing this and getting like 6/6 questions they&#39;ve seen before."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Almost all advice online about interviewing is written from the point of view of the candidate. Sometimes this is good advice, but sometimes it devolves into some kind of astrology, where candidate are just guessing how things work.I&#39;ve done +300 interviews at FAANG so I can share bit of advice from the interviewer&#39;s side. The caveat is that this is based on how I conduct interviews, so YMMV with other people.* Always ask clarifying questions. Almost all problems have some level of ambiguity that you need to clarify. This is intended. The more senior you are, the more important this becomes.* Explain your approach before you begin, and even while you code. This gives the interviewer a chance to help you if you are down the wrong path, or even just understand what you are up to.* If you get stuck, ask for help! think of this as a pair programming session rather than an interview. I much prefer a candidate who gets stuck, ask for hints, gets unblocked and writes good code, rather than one that doesn&#39;t ask for help and writes not-so-good code.* Caveat: There is a tension with asking questions. There is such a thing as too much help, e.g. I need to explicitly tell you how to solve the problem. Use judiciously.* Take interviewer&#39;s hints. The interviewer has probably asked this question dozens of times and knows it inside out. If they give you a hint, 99% of times they are on to something.* Personally I don&#39;t like &#34;hard LC&#34; problems. Instead I prefer medium difficulty problems, and spend extra time probing the candidate&#39;s coding skills. This includes:1. Write tests.2. Handle corner cases/incorrect inputs.3. Discuss how to scale the code.4. Discuss how to refactor the code.* If nothing else, write the simplest brute force solution you can think of. As an interviewer I need a coding sample to evaluate the candidate. Trying to and failing to implement an optimal solution is worse than implementing a correct brute force one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; After being given the algorithm problem, ask for the specific runtime your solution will need to have. Almost certainly, the interviewer will tell you.In my experience, interviewers will rarely tell you the runtime of the optimal solution.Regardless, very interesting blog post."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You don&#39;t even need an SPA. Having the backend + frontend share the same state makes development so much faster and easier it&#39;s shockingly refreshing. When building a SaaS project last year I decided to just ditch React/Angular/Vue and did everything server-side like it was 2005. I was extremely pleased at the result -- everything feels snappy, secure, and native for the browser. I was shocked at how much time and headache I saved: not having to design/deploy an API and all the trimmings (ACLs, CORS, JWTs etc.), not having to spend X hours a day wrestling with Webpack/hot reloading/npm/tree-shaking/state management, having direct access to backend secrets/state/APIs and just spitting out HTML, it&#39;s just so....lovely. It simplifies performance tuning as well, the only thing I need to optimize is the server, which is easy to do because I have 100% control and visibility, compared to debugging/optimizing JavaScript for a million different clients."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"CORS is such an ugly web standard.  It&#39;s not only a pain in you butt, but it also makes your requests slow through these extra pre-flight round-trips.I have hope that we can remove it, though, in new versions of HTTP.CORS only exists because XMLHTTPRequest broke the assumptions of web 1.0 servers.  Suddenly any web browser loading any page anywhere could make a request to your server without the user&#39;s explicit permission, and a ton of web servers had already been built and were running under the assumption that users would only hit their endpoints by explicitly typing in a URL or clicking on a link.But each time we design a new version of HTTP, we get an opportunity to remove CORS restrictions for it, because there aren&#39;t any servers running the new version yet.And with Braid (https://braid.org), we&#39;re making changes that are big enough that I think it really warrants taking a fresh look at all of this stuff.  So I have hope that we can eliminate CORS and all this ugliness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The irony in this is that with CloudFront at least, it can&#39;t strip the &#34;/api&#34; prefix before sending it to your backend, so you have to have your backend server understand /api/xyz rather than just /xyz calls like when it was on a dedicated api subdomain.But don&#39;t worry! AWS thought of this! They invented Another Cloud Thing, namely Lambda@Edge, to solve this. Now you can run a JS function for every single request that hits your CloudFront Distribution so that you can run logic in there to strip the prefix before it gets passed to your origin. You read that right! Execute code every time a request hits your proxy! But wait, doesn&#39;t executing code for every single request sound insane AND doesn&#39;t it also add latency which this was trying to remove? Yes! Isn&#39;t cloud just lovely?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just researched good/quality crafting printers yesterday. Search results were mostly blogs and crappy websites that offered obviously no insights but were just SEO optimized to direct you to their Amazon affiliate links. Especially sad since those affiliate links to Amazon mostly resulted in &#34;This product is currently not available&#34; sites.Repeated my search on Youtube to find reviews or unboxing. Most video search results were basically &#34;Youtube SEO&#34; again - the most viewed/top-ranked videos did never show a single actual print run or even the printer available. It was mostly marketing websites turned into video (slowly scrolling/moving over product description or pictures clearly taken from the web). And of course, affiliate links in the description.The web has become a crappy place to research products as long as money can be made with those through affiliations. I wonder if outlawing affiliate marketing would make the world a better place.P.S: Whats most ridiculous about my Youtube Printer research experience, the best and most helpful video was a sales video from a home shopping TV station [0], where they actually showed some printing action and handling of one of the models I was interested in.[0]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ytMXgjCReO0"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not just Google---the World Wide Web itself is rapidly becoming a defunct protocol, the culmination of a decades-long shift in the Internet&#39;s center of mass away from browsers and towards centralized and commercialized apps---from personal web pages to LinkedIn/GitHub/Twitter handles, from the ubiquitous WordPress blogs to YouTube videos and Medium posts, and from forums to Tweets and subreddits.The useful information on the Web is now concentrated in a few places---Reddit, Quora, Stack Exchange, Wikipedia, etc. When I want reasonable search results, I search there instead of the Web as a whole. (And even many of these services are in the late stages of the Silicon Valley life cycle---desperate monetization and engagement-increasing gimmicks---with uncertain futures.)Wikipedia, bless its heart, lurches on as a cathedral to early Web&#39;s dream of information democratization. It stands as a wonder of the ancient world: incomplete, built from technology few now understand, and reflecting values and priorities that no longer quite align with contemporary culture. But it persists thanks to its inertia and the undeniable sense of awe it invokes even today."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google was still useful for things that are non-marketable. But in the last year or so, I have started to realize how awfully bad has gotten even at that.Case in point: Open source mailing list archives. For various reasons, some times I have to search for entire email threads that are available in the web interfaces of some mailing list archives. I have part of a phrase of some email, I put that into google with quotes, and it returns some results, usually with the main archive being in the first results. In the last year or so, Google has started returning no results for some phrases of emails that do exist and are available in one or more public archives.When that started to happen, I tried Bing. And Bing returns results with links to archive. So does duckduckgo most times. But for Google, it&#39;s like if that particular email I&#39;m searching at that moment didn&#39;t exist (for other emails in the same mailing list it works fine). It only happens occasionally, but it&#39;s getting worse. So I have started to rely on DDG and Bing more and more, because they always find what I want.So Google is starting to fail at some of the most basic aspects of a search engine, it&#39;s not just the ordering of the search results - there are some public web pages that it won&#39;t see for whatever reason."</p>

Reading a book, reading a paper, etc -- these activities take discipline that most people don&#39;t develop or don&#39;t often apply. This isn&#39;t new. The mistake is thinking that the ability to concentrate on something non-entertaining is the baseline. One reason so many people think they have ADHD is because they make that mistake.We had the same anxieties about radio and TV. Those anxieties were right and wrong.

Psychologists have been enlisted, as they are in every war to try to win it for &#39;their side&#39;, be it one of the big silos or some dying TV or newspaper era behemoth, there is no reasonable way in which you can withstand that kind of frontal onslaught. The only way to really deal with this is to not participate.Beware or you too will be collateral damage on the balance sheets of these media conglomerates. Unmediated reality is still there for you to peruse, but &#39;augmented reality&#39; will be the next big wave for tech and I&#39;m pretty sure that it will end up being used mostly for advertising purposes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This for me is key, these sorts of problems cannot just be solved on an individual level. They are systemic.&#34;Individual abstinence is “not the solution, for the same reason that wearing a gas mask for two days a week outside isn’t the answer to pollution. It might, for a short period of time, keep certain effects at bay, but it’s not sustainable, and it doesn’t address the systemic issues.” He said that our attention is being deeply altered by huge invasive forces in wider society. Saying the solution was to just adjust your own habits – to pledge to break up with your phone, say – was just “pushing it back on to the individual” he said, when “it’s really the environmental changes that will really make the difference”.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;The CDC weekly death counts, which reflect the information on death certificates and so have a lag of up to eight weeks or longer, show that for the week ending Nov. 6, there were far fewer deaths from COVID-19 in Indiana compared to a year ago – 195 verses 336 – but more deaths from other causes – 1,350 versus 1,319.&#34;So last year more covid deaths (particularly among the elderly), but while those numbers have declined, the numbers from younger &#34;working age&#34; people have increased more than enough to make up for it.&gt; &#34;Just 8.9% of ICU beds are available at hospitals in the state, a low for the year, and lower than at any time during the pandemic. But the majority of ICU beds are not taken up by COVID-19 patients – just 37% are, while 54% of the ICU beds are being occupied by people with other illnesses or conditions.&#34;Well a lot of people were avoiding medical care (precisely because of Covid concerns), so this makes some sense.  Couple that with the increased death rate for younger people and something has happened to worsen the health and outcomes generally for that population.  Cue wild speculation and theories."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many people kept insisting &#34;Not many young people are dying from Covid-19&#34; a statement that over looked the fact that, under normal circumstances, not many young people die at all. But there was an article in the New York Times that offered these facts about people aged 20 to 40.July, 2019: 11,000 deadJuly, 2020: 16,000 deadBoth numbers are small in a country where 3 million people die each year, about 250,000 a month. But it&#39;s still a 45% increase, so that age group was the worst affected, in terms of the increase in death. The increase in the death rate of old people was not as dramatic, as older people make up the vast majority of all deaths, every year."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Zotero is, if you&#39;re not in the market for a closed source silo like EndNote, the only game left in town. Mendeley went full on Evil, and Papers for Mac is Mac only, closed source, and missing dozens of functionalities that are absolutely a must have in academic writing and research.An absolute must have is BetterBibTex (https://retorque.re/zotero-better-bibtex/), which adds better Citekey management and, my personal highlight, &#34;export on add&#34; functionality. In short, everything I save into a specific folder in my library gets exported as a .bib file right away. That way I can click a button in my browser and have the citation ready in my LaTeX editor, Word, or Obsidian (https://github.com/hans/obsidian-citation-plugin) within seconds.The latest beta also adds full Markdown export for Notes. I tend to keep my notes on papers in Zotero, attached to the paper, but export them for filing in Obsidian (which I then feed into MkDocs for our work group&#39;s large repo).Unless you need Apple Pages support, which Apple keeps to itself and only sells for mighty moolah to a select few, Zotero can do anything EndNote can do, is Open Source, and with that won&#39;t drive your PI up the wall with yet another expense."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I highly recommend going for the beta version which features a (game-changing) built-in pdf reader[1], with annotations (searchable and synced with the beta iPad app) and many more improvements.Zotero is an amazing tool and I could not imagine writing papers without it. For collaborative writing, it syncs the bibliography with overleaf[2] and google docs. The browser add-on allows to build your library with one click while browsing, and it parses wonderfully meta-data from all (most) publishers and pre-print servers. Then my unique bibfile (symlinked in every project) is continuously updated to reflect new items or manual changes.But I use it even for non-publishing side of research: one can save webpages (with snapshots) and write notes with formatting around them. My personal research workflow involves note-taking with the markdown app Zettlr[2], from which I can cite my Zotero library using simply `@[Author:Title:Year]`. I can then build notes from a twitter thread and stats.stackexchange.com answers, then connect it with papers and blog posts that way, and a specific chapter of a book with my annotation on the cloud. It not always straightforward as a workflow but it works wonders.And the team is very responsive on the forum and on twitter. If one of the dev is ready this, thank you so much for making researchers life way easier !EDIT: I just realised I can share my libraries online. A bit ashamed because it is very messy, but in case you are wondering what a Zotero library looks like, here is the link to mine [4] (without the notes and the embedded pdf and data files because I cannot share all of them. Moreover, I don&#39;t use the folder structure anymore so its very messy).[1] https://www.zotero.org/support/pdf_reader_preview[2] I recommend the BetterBibTex extension for anything related to tex, it&#39;ll save you a lot of time[3] https://zettlr.com, another great app.[4] https://www.zotero.org/wosk/library"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a longtime user of Zotero and a paying subscriber too. I use Zotfile extension to manage PDF files in Zotero. The best feature of this extension is bulk renaming filenames using a predefined filename format such as authors-year-article name. Most academic papers pdf files have weird names such as &#34;1-s2.0-S0007681321001221-main.pdf&#34;. Before Zotero and Zotfile I used to manually rename them. Then I found out that Zotero extracts metadata automatically from PDF files and can use them for renaming the files. Zotfile gives you more control. Check it out:  http://zotfile.comI saw dstillman has commented here. Dan, thanks a lot for your tireless work to make Zotero the best reference manager!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The main issue with &#34;Web3&#34; is that it moves records of transactions from many private places to one public place. Sure this one place may not be controlled by a single entity, but it facilitates tracking at an unprecedented level.Cryptocurrencies are the ultimate example of this and are an absolute boon to tax collectors, forensic accountants and fraudsters. In our current economy financial transactions are recorded in millions of individual ledgers that are kept private, or in the case of cash transactions are often not recorded at all, or are not linked to an individual. There is no central ledger.With crypto currencies however you can not only see all transactions but also trace them back to individual users as long as you can link a wallet to a person. This is a massive increase in centralisation yet discussion of whether this is a good idea seems to be entirely missing. The notion that centralising transactions in one place is somehow an example of decentralisation just seems mad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem with web3 is not that it&#39;s centralized -- that&#39;s irrelevant.The fundamental problem with all crypto&#34;currencies&#34; is as follows: the world uses real currencies and there is only one way this enters into the world of crypto&#34;currencies&#34;: by someone selling a coin to someone else. Thus, regardless of what crypto&#34;currency&#34; we are talking about, it would be a zero sum game if not for transaction fees. However, with transaction fees it becomes a scam because there&#39;s a set of players who are guaranteed to win and there&#39;s another set of players who, en masse, are guaranteed to lose. It utterly doesn&#39;t matter what you do with your crypto&#34;currency&#34;, this is the underpinning scam of it.And once you entered the game, the only way for you to not lose money is to find a greater fool who will take over your crypto&#34;currency&#34;, everyone who owns some becomes a proponent of it. It&#39;s an ingenious scam.And no, nothing in the real world is like this. In the real world, the amount of currency increases when a bank extends a loan which then creates more value by such things as being using as capital, allowing you to enjoy a home now instead of decades later and so forth. Also, stocks are not a zero sum game -- companies actually create value and so forth."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the author makes the mistake of assuming that web3 is a meaningful, tangible term being used in good faith.In reality, web3 is a marketing buzzword that cryptocurrency boosters have started promoting in an attempt to legitimize their resource intensive and otherwise useless financial speculation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"AirDrop is brilliant but it fails silently, no error messages - nothing. At best, it says that it was cancelled.Does anyone knows how to debug it?I also wonder, why this type of file transfer isn&#39;t the industry standart. It&#39;s so straightforward(when it works), why would anyone transfer files in any other way? Okay, maybe a transfer history can also be useful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe AirDrop is a a great example of how Apples vertical integration and full ownership of software and hardware really thrives. It may not offer interoperability with other platforms, but that’s because other platforms don’t have the control needed to implement the same level of integration of hardware and software needed.Without the direct low level control of the radio hardware they would not have been able to integrate both Bluetooth and WiFi in the way that AirDrop does.I hope one day standards for this type of functionality appear so that other platforms can implement it. Ideally apple would contribute their tech to create the standard but that’s probably wishful thinking."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"No book influenced my attitude toward philosophy more than Wittgenstein&#39;s Blue Book. Here are a couple gems:&gt; The questions, &#34;What is length?&#34;, &#34;What is meaning?&#34;, &#34;What is the number one?&#34; etc., produce in us a mental cramp. We feel that we can&#39;t point to anything in reply to them and yet ought to point to something. (We are up against one of the great sources of philosophical bewilderment: we try to find a substance for a substantive.)&gt; The idea that in order to get clear about the meaning of a general term one had to find the common element in all its applications, has shackled philosophical investigation; for it has not only led to no result, but also made the philosopher dismiss as irrelevant the concrete cases, which alone could have helped him to understand the usage of the general term. When Socrates asks the question, “what is knowledge?” he does not even regard it as a preliminary answer to enumerate cases of knowledge. If I wished to find out what sort of thing arithmetic is, I should be very content indeed to have investigated the case of a finite cardinal arithmetic. For:
(a) this would lead me on to all the more complicated cases,
(b) a finite cardinal arithmetic is not incomplete, it has no gaps which are then filled in by the rest of arithmetic.&gt; Now I don&#39;t say that this is not possible. Only, putting it in this way immediately shows you that it need not happen. This, by the way, illustrates the method of philosophy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not quite all public domain. (in English) [0] (maybe? gray area)I&#39;d highly recommend checking out his work on (and coining of the term) &#34;language games&#34; [1] I&#39;m not sure I agree with all of the thinking behind them, but it&#39;s a fascinating concept that has useful nuggets whether or not you agree with everything Wittgenstein says about them. They are explored pretty fully in his work &#34;Philosophical Investigations&#34; [2] This work pretty much set aside a fair amount of his thinking in Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, which is still an interesting work in its own right. I think that even a cursory ELI5 treatment of this material in a standard college course would be very useful in arming students with tools needed to dissect language. I&#39;ve used it (in brief) when teaching a course on Informal Logic in relation to propaganda.[0] It seems copyright on the English translation might still be in effect, or at least a gray area of determination. Since it&#39;s a common text use in college courses I&#39;m guessing the copyright owners may fight public domain release. The issue will be whether or not the translation was a work for hire or if it can be considered sufficiently different to constitute an original work. The English translation by Anscombe, Hacker, and Schulte occured posthumously, and so might not be considered work for hire. Hopefully it will resolve in favor of public domain. For a shorter consideration of &#34;language games&#34; check out Blue Book.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language_game_(philosophy)[2] https://www.amazon.com/Philosophical-Investigations-Ludwig-W..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do we know what Wittgenstein himself would have thought of this? Did he have opinions on &#34;intellectual property&#34; regimes?Did the &#34;intellectual property&#34; regime contemporaneous with him writing encourage or discourage his output?I mean, there&#39;s some thought that Giuseppe Verdi reduced his output when copyright was introduced: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1336802"</p>
