								<p class="story__comment_others">"I checked out the user supplied examples.On the Appalachian Trail map the Title of the Legend is &#34;Bathymetry&#34;. Something tells me that is not right. Global warming must be a bigger problem for the east coast than I had been misled to expect.The map of community solar proposals also has a problem in the legend. All the line sizes for the transmission capacity players are identical in the legend even though they are graduated sizes on the map.In addition, there actually end up being two map legends as you can see in the Appalachian Trip planner. The first one is tied to the base map and the symbology fits for the base map. You need to zoom in to see any Campground or Trailhead points since they are features common to the National Parks along the route. The second one is the user added note with Planned Stops and Estimated Date.Points associated with the second legend (or note or whatever) are all you see at the initial scale. This might be confusing for some users who would expect all map layers to belong to one legend so this should be clarified.With these in mind, it would pay off for them to examine their Legend tools so that they can become legendarily good because right now they serve as a perfect example of how not to do a map legend. They are supposed to convey useful information that aids visual interpretation of map features and layers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Doesn&#39;t look like the author knows what he is talking about. His point about early stage startup should not use K8S is fine. But the next advice about not using a different language for frontend and backend is wrong. I think the most appropriate advice is to choose a stack which the founding team is most familiar with. If that means RoR then RoR is fine. If it means PHP then PHP is fine too. Another option is to use a technology which is best suited for the product your are trying to build. For example, if you are building a managed cloud service, then building on top of K8S, or FireCracker or Nomad can be a good choice. But then it means you need to learn the tech being used inside out.Also he talks about all of this and then gives example of WhatsApp at the end. WhatsApp chose Erlang for the backend and their front end was written in Java and Objective-C. They could have chosen Java for backend to keep frontend language same but they didn&#39;t. They used Erlang because they based their architecture on Ejabberd which was open source and was built with Erlang. Also WhatsApp managed all their servers by themselves and didn&#39;t even move to managed cloud services when they became available. They were self hosting till FB acquired them and moved them to FB data centres later on (Source: http://highscalability.com/blog/2014/2/26/the-whatsapp-archi...)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree entirely.I like to call what the author is referring to as, &#34;What-If Engineering&#34;. It&#39;s the science of thinking you&#39;ll be Google next week, so you build for that level of scale today. It involves picking extremely complicated, expensive (both in compute and skilled labour) technologies to deploy a Rails app that has two features. And it all boils down to, &#34;But what if...&#34; pre-optimising.It happens at all levels.At the individual unit level: &#34;I&#39;ll make these four lines of code a function in case I need to call it more than once later on - you know, what if that&#39;s needed?&#34;It also happens at the database level: &#34;What if we need to change the schema later on? Do we really want to be restricted to a hard schema in MySQL? Let&#39;s use MongoDB&#34;.What&#39;s even worse, is Helm and the likes make it possible to spin up these kinds of solutions in a heart beat. And, as witnessed and evidenced by several comments below, developers think that&#39;s that... all done. It&#39;s a perfect solution. It won&#39;t fail because K8s will manage it. Oh boy.Start with a monolith on two VMs and a load balancer. Chips and networks are cheaper than labour, and right now, anyone with K8s experience is demanding $150k + 10% Superannuation here in Australia... minimum!https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MonolithFirst.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lean conservative in my tech choices but I just don&#39;t see the big issue with Kubernetes. If you use a managed service like GKE it is really a breeze. I have seen teams with no prior experience set up simple deployments in a day or two and operate them without issues. Sure, it is often better to avoid the &#34;inner platform&#34; of K8s and run your application using a container service + managed SQL offering. But the difference isn&#39;t huge and the IaC ends up being about as complex as the K8s YAML. For setting up things like background jobs, cron jobs, managed certificates and so on I haven&#39;t found K8s less convenient than using whatever infrastructure alternatives are provided by cloud vendors.The main issue I have seen in startups is premature architecture complexity. Lambda soup, multiple databases, self-managed message brokers, unnecessary caching, microservices etc. Whether you use K8s or not, architectural complexity will bite your head off at small scales. K8s is an enabler for overly complicated architectures but it is not problematic with simple ones.&gt;Did users ask for this?Not an argument. Users don&#39;t ask for implementation details. They don&#39;t ask us to use Git or build automation or React. But if you always opt for less sophisticated workflows and technologies in the name of &#34;just getting stuff done right now&#34; you will end up bogged down really quickly. As in, weeks or months. I&#39;ve worked with teams who wanted to email source archives around because Git was &#34;too complicated.&#34; At some point you have to make the call of what is and isn&#39;t worth it. And that depends on the product, the team, projected future decisions and so on."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have witnessed something quite similar. During the flash-floods in 2021 in Germany, locals in the Ahr region absolutely rose to the occasion. Farmers were evacuating people in head-high water with their tractors during the night, local restaurants were already providing hot food and water the next morning wherever they could reach, pharmacies were loading whatever they had available on ATVs to somehow get much-needed medicine down precarious mudpaths. Local construction companies were already clearing rubble and building emergency bridges out of it. One Excavator was just basically standing in the middle of the river and ferrying people and rescue partys across. The local racetrack basically just organized everything while politicians were still playing the blame game. When our local firebrigade was officially pulled back from active duty because we lost one of ours during rescue operations in the first day, basically everyone just went down again and just tried to do whatever was possible. Absolutely stunning what people will do when they are face to face with disaster. I freely admit that I was crying like a little girl when I first saw the endless columns of Bundeswehr, THW, Fire Brigades, Farmers, basically everyone who could just streaming to help people they never met but were neighbors and friends for me.Sorry for the rambling, but I am still not emotionally disconnected enough from it to concisely talk about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And the most unusual thing about all this is: None of this is unusual. At least not within the national tapestry that is The Great American Small Town.It also isn&#39;t unusual in the cities. Humans are wonderful and terrible everywhere. It reminds me of the 30 Rock episode where Jack and Liz go to Georgia to find a new comedian in touch with the &#34;real America&#34; and Liz keeps insisting that all Americans are real Americans and there is no &#34;real America.&#34;The acts of people after 9/11 in NYC remind us of the good in humans just as this small town inspires us.As Mr Rogers said, &#34;When I was a boy and I would see scary things in the news, my mother would say to me, &#34;Look for the helpers. You will always find people who are helping.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For some reason this reminded me of the Ray Bradbury story, &#34;The Town Where Noone Got Off&#34; which is a dark little story indeed about two men and a small town on a railroad line.  This one is a bit more positive.However, it turns out this whole incident was apparently due to the lack of a railroad crossing guard system of any kind at the intersection.  The most basic system has flashing lights warning of oncoming trains, and even that wasn&#39;t present.https://www.kwch.com/2022/06/30/amtrak-derailment-places-spo...In that respect it&#39;s also a story about the poor state of American infrastructure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Given some of the people here might run their own servers, the self-hosted alternative is to have something like Sonarr PVR for newsgroups and torrents, alongside a tracker indexer like Jackett, and then Plex for the frontend. In this combination, you &#34;subscribe&#34; to TV shows and select movies on the Sonarr system, and then the downloading is taken care for you even when new episodes arrive. These will then appear on Plex which is refreshed by the pipeline automatically. The system integrates with private trackers and is capable of maintaining your seed-ratio if that&#39;s important.I recently fell into this rabbit-hole while trying to organise my music. For music there is Lidarr, which also ID3 tags your music and reorganizes it into folder structures. This is convenient since organizing anything using Plex is a nightmare."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I became a single parent when my daughter turned 1 year old. When she got old enough we&#39;d go fishing, bicycling, swimming, and hiking a lot. We&#39;d also go to a used book store twice a month (on pay day) so she could pick out a few books to read. She loved doing that.She had no interest at all in learning how to code or gaming but she loved helping in the garden and in the kitchen prepping and cooking meals.When she got to Jr. High she wanted to join the &#34;Cheerleader&#34; squad so there were a lot early morning rides to school I had to make, and lot&#39;s of Basketball games I attended until she graduated, but I had a lot fun cheering along with them.During those years I setup a campsite on our property so her and her friends could go hang out there. I&#39;m sure they had more fun than most parents would approve of but they never got into any real trouble, the police were never called, and no one got hurt bad enough for the parents to call me. For the most part all those parents knew exactly where their kids were and what they were doing. And that I was close enough to deal with anything that came up. But there were never any serious issues.She&#39;s 37 years old now, still loves to hike, backpack, swim, fish, garden, and cook, and most important, she still likes to hang out with me!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My son is 12 y/o, and he&#39;s into Minecraft.Yesterday he discovered the server mc.openredstone.org. He spent all day yesterday and about one hour today, and he ended up building a 4-bit adder.On this server players learn how to build logic gates, and mix them so they eventually build CPUs. It&#39;s fully gamified, so beginners are called &#34;students&#34; and more advanced players are called &#34;builders&#34;. To become a &#34;builder&#34; you need to pass some trials. The &#34;builders&#34; probably have their own challenges (not sure, my son is still a student), in any case, they behave like teachers. So a student will find a builder who will give them instructions, and guide them through more and more complex designs.So, yesterday my son had no idea what XOR or NAND is, and today he already built a 4-bit adder, and has dreams of building an ALU.I&#39;m quite excited to be honest. By the way, I&#39;m not in any way connected with whomever put together this Minecraft server. I don&#39;t even think it&#39;s a for-profit thing, as far as I can tell, it&#39;s fully non-profit."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Might be off topic but a nugget from having two girls (5 and 11). Kids don’t care about budget or how much things cost. We have toys we’ve spent hundreds of dollars on only to have the near free to free one be a hit. I say this to make sure you know your employment status likely only effects your kids if it effects you. Or said differently, to the extent it effects you it will effect them.Kids will generally have fun with anything you show a degree of interest in. The copper pipe plumbing example in this thread is a perfect example. A simple Task became a life long activity for the kid. They will remember it forever and tell someone in the future “this time I welded with my dad”… they won’t remember that time my dad didn’t hire a plumber.Things off the top of my head that have been a hit - 
Planting plants 
Fashion design 
Basic coding activities or contests 
Shooting
Anything that requires safety procedures 
Lawn work (but make it fun or set a timer)
Writing a story where they write some of it, you add in silly bits, they write more , repeat till laughing out loud. 
Both my girls super in to etiquetteBest of luck buddy and squeeze these years for as much as you can."</p>

Please, please, don&#39;t write it off until you&#39;ve read the book.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Do 1 task a day, no matter how small it is, do it consistently for a week or two. Then every other day you do 2 tasks for a month, and you start working up to a point where you feel you do what you can within your limits and get joy from that 1 (or 2) items you can scrap off.If you live with family focus your tasks maybe on easing their life, pull out 10  weeds out of the garden, take out the trash, fix a squeaking door. Small but attainable things.Chronical pain is a mess, it&#39;s relentless and it&#39;s always there, it doesn&#39;t go away, but you learn to deal with it. Focus on the pain initially, learn what pain you have and focus on it. I learned to focus on it and make a mental note (do not know how else to say) that it&#39;s not worth paying attention to, and I get by without medication. It&#39;s not always easy and there are days where you want to cry and cry and just fall asleep so you do not have to feel it.
It&#39;s normal and accept that not all days will be the same and successful.It&#39;s a tough hill you are up against, but all shall pass and all will be well in the end. It&#39;s unbelievable sometimes, but all shall pass. Remember that.Good luck, don&#39;t falter, reaching out is the first step!"</p>

I don&#39;t know your exact situation or your disabilities, but if you can deliver pizzas to at least keep your head above the water, do that. Having gone through YC you&#39;re obviously also a bright and intelligent person, how many different companies have you tried consulting for? Some companies could be more understanding than others of your situation, in which cases making 1500 a month shouldn&#39;t be a huge problem in this industry.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I sure wish Starlink supported IPv6. They&#39;re a brand new ISP planning for millions of customers and decided from the start they couldn&#39;t get enough IPv4 addresses for everyone. Fair enough! But we&#39;re stuck with Carrier Grade NAT and it is a drag.On Starlink it&#39;s impossible to host a server socket directly, which makes any peer to peer networking a PITA. Geocoding IP addresses doesn&#39;t work so I have to bend over backwards to convince, say, Youtube TV that I&#39;m in the Sacramento metro and not LA where the POP is. Also the shared IP addresses seem to trip a lot of DDOS protection; I fill out 10x as many CAPTCHAs on Starlink as I do on my other ISP. And I sometimes get random network stability problems; a few weeks ago Starlink screwed something up so no one could keep a persistent connection up more than a few minutes. Seems to be fixed now, but I bet it was their CGNAT system.I realize half the world lives with CGNAT. It&#39;s not unusable, at least web browsing works more or less. But IPv6 would solve all these problems. A little surprised that a new ISP created in 2021 wouldn&#39;t have IPv6 support as one of their launch features. There&#39;s hints they are trying to get it working but it&#39;s not an official thing now.

If 20% of users want to be able to do something in TypeScript that the language doesn&#39;t support, they either can try to get the change into the core language, or live without it (or fork it). If it changes, it&#39;ll change for everyone using TypeScriptBut in Clojure (lisps in general), you don&#39;t have this restriction, so modifying the language for your own need, becomes a lot easier. Lots of work on Clojure is simply done in libraries, as it&#39;s possible and doesn&#39;t impact the core of the language, which everyone shares."</p>

You are entitled to modify the code. You are entitled to distribute your modifications.Are you entitled to be part of the development process and to state your opinions about how things are going? Yes...if those are the rules of the project. The thing is, that has nothing to do with open source, it&#39;s always project-specific, so the full post largely doesn&#39;t make any sense as a comment on open source."</p>

Then, some Z-Library copied Libgen and added some more books, without making it mirrorable. The goal is to make these new books, which are not mirrorable — mirrorable (i.e. to &#34;preserve&#34; them).So, why not just re-upload them to Libgen, then? I guess somebody will do that now anyway, but you could easily done it in the first place, without making your own mirror, which is not a mirror of Libgen. Just upload them to Libgen and make a mirror of Libgen."</p>

It also quickly mentions that it&#39;s a &#34;build tool&#34;. Finally. So, like gulp or grunt, I guess? But it doesn&#39;t even mention those, or any other build tools it supposedly replaces.

There&#39;s an absolute onslaught of languages, frameworks, patterns and now also &#34;tools&#34; that never really work in you editor, and you never really grasp before moving on to the next thing.I think me and my team have spent 90% of our time working with tooling, and all creativity and joy has gone out the window - because you never become a master, an expert og know your way around the codebase before you&#39;re suddenly 2 years behind.It&#39;s a shitshow and no one really seems to know what the hell they are doing - even the teachers of this stuff - they just know &#34;how&#34; rarely why.Way, way too much complexity and abstraction for simple tasks. Some things &#34;should have&#34; become easier with quick scaffolding, auth templates or whatever, but they always only work 95% and you use an endless amount of time fixing the last 5% instead of building creatively.Vite was the same thing, faster yes, but my VSCODE broke because of the myriad of build tools and plugins on top of each other from older projects."</p>

Clock starts ticking.2) Management then fails to settle on the requirements for months and/or continuously moves the goalposts while people are trying to work, turning an unreasonable deadline into an impossible deadline3) Developers start realizing that they&#39;re going to receive the blame when impossible deadline isn&#39;t achieved, despite not having any control in the matter. They start leaving for new jobs, and the death spiral begins.It&#39;s the universal pattern of a management team that doesn&#39;t know how to do anything other than make demands and then apply pressure.

A bunch of developers left fearing a layoff. That was bad enough, but what he really meant was sales. He gutted the sales team and brought in his guys. Sales tanked, company growth stopped, hard. Features dwindled and bugs grew. This clown and his cronies were gone after two years and the company still struggles today.Second time. A $10B company acquired a $4B company. The parent demanded high margins from the company that had been running on low margins and legacy, near end of life applications. Layoffs ensued and the parent was choking on the acquisition. They’d been sold on a bogus modernization effort that ended as soon as the acquisition closed. That acquisition is a drag on their earnings today, six years later.Getting to see these type of disasters first hand is pretty cool imo."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually gave away a Porsche 911. This was not a mall giveaway but a marketing experiment for my new startup: Flat 6 Club.Yes, we wanted something in return, in this case, we wanted you to buy a t-shirt or start a subscription (merch+content+events), which gives us essentially all the same info, which would enter you in a sweepstakes to win the car. We also wanted to promote the club, which we did.We researched it and contracted a sweepstakes company who helped us run the sweepstakes legally.In the end, we gave away the car to a very nice man and his wife, who we flew in from Minnesota to San Diego for the giveaway event.Some people did think it was a scam.But there are several operations that actually do give cars away such a Omaze, Diesel Brothers and many more.There’s a model there based on the new post-search world we live in that has to do with high engagement increasing Return On Ad Spend and other AdTech voodoo.No doubt there are lots of scams but there are also real winners out there.We’ve only given away 1 car. We learned a ton.I decided to kill the monthly subscription after we gave away the car because we grossly underestimated the amount of up-front ad spend required to achieve a good ROAS and I knew we wouldn’t be giving away another car for a long time.The biggest surprise to me was hearing from people that were sad that we killed the paid membership/giveaway program.This was $9.11/mo for membership and occasional swag drops and automatic entry into our next giveaway —whenever that might be. I communicated personally with some of these folks.The gist of what I learned was that for $9.11/mo, people enjoyed the hope that they may one day win a 911. We literally had people beg us to bring it back. This is probably the same happiness that a lottery ticket brings to many people. It’s not really that they expect to win. As long as someone wins, they’re buying some hope, some excitement… a dream."</p>

The confinement of mono-iron hydroxyl sites in a porous matrix demonstrates a strategy for C–H bond activation in CH4 to drive the direct photosynthesis of CH3OH.https://www.nature.com/articles/s41563-022-01279-1Selective C-H bond activation (of which this paper is an example) is extremely difficult. It has been the focus of intense research for decades. Having a tunable catalysts system that performed this transformation would be a game-changer for the production of just of about every organic molecule. The authors just focused on methane as the hydrocarbon feedstock, so it&#39;s hard to know how general the process might be."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many don&#39;t know this but the most important thing to know about solar is that it is so far the only method of direct power generation that exists. Nuclear and various fossil fuels create heat that boils water to generate steam that turns a turbine to generate power. This adds cost and complexity that you can never get away from.But solar by virtue of being direct avoids all of this so has a lower bound in cost that other methods of power generation will find it hard to compete with. Solar cells can be small so solar power is highly flexible. Plus it has no moving parts (other than sometimes solar cells are moved slowly to face the Sun as it moves through the sky) so it&#39;s upper bound for reliability is hard to beat.I actually think solar is and will be the most important method of power generation in the coming centuries that will culminate in space-based solar power collectors.So solar has the potential to be extraordinarily cheap, reliable and require no expensive infrastructure like power lines. Creating methanol is essentially a way of storing excess energy so this could be a real game-changer for developing nations that lack such infrastructure."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a great write up. I&#39;ve already sent it to a few people.On the question of what happens if a file&#39;s contents change after the initial checksum, the man page for rsync[0] has an interesting explanation of the *--checksum* option:&gt; This changes the way rsync checks if the files have been changed and are in need of a transfer. Without this option, rsync uses a &#34;quick check&#34; that (by default) checks if each file&#39;s size and time of last modification match between the sender and receiver. This option changes this to compare a 128-bit checksum for each file that has a matching size. Generating the checksums means that both sides will expend a lot of disk I/O reading all the data in the files in the transfer (and this is prior to any reading that will be done to transfer changed files), so this can slow things down significantly.&gt; The sending side generates its checksums while it is doing the file-system scan that builds the list of the available files. The receiver generates its checksums when it is scanning for changed files, and will checksum any file that has the same size as the corresponding sender&#39;s file: files with either a changed size or a changed checksum are selected for transfer.&gt; Note that rsync always verifies that each transferred file was correctly reconstructed on the receiving side by checking a whole-file checksum that is generated as the file is transferred, but that automatic after-the-transfer verification has nothing to do with this option&#39;s before-the-transfer &#34;Does this file need to be updated?&#34; check.
For protocol 30 and beyond (first supported in 3.0.0), the checksum used is MD5. For older protocols, the checksum used is MD4.[0]: https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice write up. rsync is great as an application but I found it more cumbersome to use when wanting to integrate it into my own application. There&#39;s librsync but the documentation is threadbare and it requires an rsync server to run. I found bita/bitar (https://github.com/oll3/bita) which is inspired by rsync &amp; family. It works more like zsync which leverages HTTP Range requests so it doesn&#39;t require anything running on the server to get chunks. Works like a treat using s3/b2 storage to serve files and get incremental differential updates on the client side!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My mind works best with examples, I was about to ask here when I stumbled upon it on the TLA site [0].The example starts out with a simple piece of code that exposes a bug, then the bug gets fixed and the following question is asked:&gt; Does the issue go away because we’ve solved it, or because we’ve made it rarer? Without being able to explore the actual consequences of the designs, we can’t guarantee we’ve solved anything&gt; The purpose of TLA+, then, is to programmatically explore these design issues. We want to give the tooling a system and a requirements and it can tell us whether or not we can break the requirement. If it can, then we know to change our design. If it can’t, we can be more confident that we’re correct.[0]: https://www.learntla.com/intro/conceptual-overview.html"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder if it&#39;s possible to model how fucked up the Golang concurrency model is with TLA+?As a TLA non-SME I couldn&#39;t say, but would definitely find it useful and probably impressive.  Maybe Brad Fitzpatrick could team up with Aphyr and use it to make golang v2 a bit less crap.Note: I write this with love, as someone who&#39;s written hundreds of thousands of lines of Go, and am now turned off and afraid of the behavior at the sketchy edge boundaries. I&#39;ve now shifted to learning Rust, albeit slowly and finding it saddeningly challenging compared to what I can pump out with the Go.For reference, see &#34;Data Race Patterns in Go&#34;, posted 21 days ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31698503"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just started reading the book a couple of days ago.  Sigh...  :-)One thing that I wish websites did is to make it easy to report simple typos and grammatical errors without having to go through GitHub.  For example, on https://www.learntla.com/intro/faq.html &#34;losting&#34; should be &#34;losing&#34;.  It would be great to simply and quickly report them without having to context switch and go through the overhead of opening an issue or creating a PR.  (In any case, I don&#39;t even have a GitHub account.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Netherlands will be especially impacted by this. We refused actual legalization for many reasons, many of which will be invalidated by Germany decriminalizing. Our current stance on weed is so confusing that it&#39;s hard to explain to any foreigner, but strictly speaking weed isn&#39;t legal and not even decriminalized... But yes, Amsterdam is in The Netherlands."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the legalization of cannabis in Europe has a lot of potential. I just wish that we would take measures to avoid the ever increasing levels of THC dosage in weed to insane levels, like you see in the US or California specifically. I firmly believe that cannabis can do a lot of good, but the poison is in the dosage. It has been shown in the past that increasing THC while decreasing CBD leads to an increase in negative side effects, some being permanent [1].Let&#39;s see how it&#39;ll work out. I also think it&#39;s quite funny that the German meme &#34;Bubatz&#34; has made it into the highest levels of our government.[1]: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6312155/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In South Africa Cannabis has been legal for personal use in &#34;places where you have an expectation of privacy&#34; (but selling is still illegal) for several years now. So far the world has not ended, the country doesn&#39;t sit around stoned all day and we&#39;re not all hooked on Heroin.There&#39;s talk of introducing legislation to restrict quantities (government has plenty of securicrat control freaks), but since that violates the very principles which underpinned the Constitutional Court&#39;s overturning the legislation that made weed illegal in the first place, I can&#39;t see it going very far."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; &#34;You&#39;d be surprised how many people get turned off by seeing something that other people tell them is simple, and then it&#39;s not simple to them.&#34;This. This should be every platform/infrastructure engineer&#39;s motto. Don&#39;t tell me your DSL is simple. Don&#39;t tell me that Puppet is so simple because oh my god, it uses Ruby. Don&#39;t tell me that HCL or terraform or whatever yaml crap is so simple because &#34;they are in yaml&#34;. No. They are not.Don&#39;t. Make. Me. Learn. It&#39;s not because I don&#39;t want to learn. It&#39;s because I want to learn fundamentals instead of your specific, non-generalizable, 6-month-or-less half-life stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this idea (for digitalocean) of &#34;documentation as marketing&#34;. Every time I read one of their articles, I feel like &#34;oh wow their engineers must really know what they&#39;re doing, to be able to explain this so clearly&#34;. I didn&#39;t know they had a team of professional editors... kudos!Another team that&#39;s really great at producing documentation is the Cloudflare retrospectives/postmortems folks, who can very clearly explain the cascading failures from complex systems.I wish more devs/engineers wrote like that!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Insanely effective tip: watch a junior dev use your docs, offer no assistance, and have them say out loud what they&#39;re thinking and doing. You&#39;ll discover dozens of ambiguities, &#39;gotchas&#39;, and shortcomings!It&#39;s important to use a new junior each time (i.e. if they&#39;ve used your docs before, don&#39;t use that person again). They should also try to accomplish a real task (not just proofreading the docs, but actually using the docs for their intended purpose).I&#39;ve used docs from Salesforce and Google and can tell they haven&#39;t been tested in this way since they contain (glaring) problems that would easily be found and addressed in a few minutes.I use this approach often, and gain enormously from it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Python logging module is one of the worst modules in the stdlib. You can see it’s Java inspiration all over it, as being one of the oldest modules it was created before anyone really knew what “pythonic” code was.Things I really dislike about it is the lack of “context”. Usually log messages are about something - often a request. You can’t attach a request ID or something else a nested set of function calls that log.The whole library is just really rubbish and has not aged well. There’s no standard way of outputting JSON logs, but there’s a built in way to spawn a socket server that allows the logging configuration to be updated remotely via a bespoke protocol? And everything is built mostly around logging to files.It also hits that perfect sweet spot of being both overly engineered and totally inflexible. I wanted to funnel our log messages to s3 via the “s3fs” module, which supports a “file like” object that gets written to s3. I had to hack around the various handlers to support this because it assumes it’s a “real” file.Hate it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another great project for Python logging is loguru:
https://loguru.readthedocs.io/en/stable/overview.htmlOne of my favorite features of loguru is the ability to contextualize logging messages using a context manager.  with logger.contextualize(user_name=user_name):
    handle_request(...)

Within the context manager, all loguru logging messages include the contextual information. This is especially nice when used in combination with loguru&#39;s native JSON formatting support and a JSON-compatible log archiving system.One downside of loguru is that it doesn&#39;t include messages from Python&#39;s standard logging system, but it can be integrated as a logging handler for the standard logging system. At the company where I work we&#39;ve created a helper similar to Datadog&#39;s ddtrace-run executable to automatically set up these integrations and log message formatting with loguru"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I mentioned this almost every time logging and python come up but one of my favorite feature is logging.exception: https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html#logging.Logge.... It allows you to attach the whole exception with stack trace without having to explicitly used “as e” and then use traceback or embed the error in the message. Something like logger.exception(“Failed to connect.”) will print the message and the exception in one go."</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=31945841">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Much of this is due to the reversal of the tight hiring market.For the past several years tech companies were desperate to hire because everyone was growing and the hiring market was tight. This inevitably results in companies loosening their hiring standards and retaining underperforming employees because they can&#39;t afford to reduce team sizes.Layoffs combined with hiring freezes (or slowdowns) signal real stress within a company. However, many of these layoffs are single-digit percentage layoffs from companies that are still hiring across the board. That&#39;s not so much a traditional layoff as a pruning of the workforce. That pruning wasn&#39;t happening as much when hiring was tight, but now that hiring is easier and real, actual layoffs have put more good candidates back onto the market, the companies who simply collected too many underperforming employees can afford to churn some of them back out of the company. Doing it as a &#34;layoff&#34; makes it more palatable than going on a firing spree.That said, when it comes to interviewing you shouldn&#39;t assume that a laid off employee was necessarily underperforming. A lot of companies don&#39;t really perform layoffs with surgical precision and will instead drop entire teams at once. I&#39;ve watched great engineers get swept up in minor staff reductions simply because they were assigned to bad managers or doomed teams that they couldn&#39;t save by themselves. I&#39;ve also hired great people who came right out of layoffs at other companies and I would have missed those resumes if I had been using dumb filtering rules like ignoring anyone who had been laid off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All this panic about tech layoffs seems a little premature given we haven’t even begun to see the impact of rates hikes on quarterly earnings yet. Many companies still have open recs and budgets to keep hiring.I work at a company that just laid off 18% of the workforce (Coinbase) including many people in engineering. The day this happened my email, LinkedIn, Twitter inboxes exploded with companies asking me if I knew of anyone looking for a job or if I myself had been impacted.I reached out to many of my former colleagues who had been impacted to see if they needed help. All had multiple interviews in flight and were not having trouble finding jobs.Aside from many crypto companies the inbound jobs were from many public and private companies and spanned many industries.I expect tech layoffs to get worse and the white collar job market to tighten towards the end of this year and 2023.I expect the main driver for this will be cost reduction at public and private companies in the lead up to earnings or quarterly reports. Main cost for a tech company obviously being labor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While there is still a open question about how much the sudden reversal of monetary policy from the last 15 years of &#34;hey! all the money can print&#34; that led to companies going into debt to purchase their own stock to &#34;oh crap, inflation, let&#39;s tighten the money supply&#34; affects the durability of companies...that said...There are some very hyperbolic people comparing this to the .COM crash and also to 2008/2009.In 2001, there was literally a site doing nothing but reporting in flamboyant terms all of the &#34;fucked companies&#34; going under. IIRC, it was dozens a day, at one point, with people stating that the Internet had failed, and it was all going down the drain.In 2008, absolutely no one had any clue what was going on but everyone knew it was catastrophically bad. People were trying to guess if it would be merely the worst recession ever or the second great depression.This so far seems like a fairly normal correction. We will see if Debt blows up and changes that."</p>

They weren&#39;t seeing other kids their age, they felt like they had no friends, and there was one point when it seemed like they even stopped missing other people altogether.But my son, especially, was deep into Minecraft Youtube at the time, and I could tell that this cast of creators was really important to him. It often felt like he was on a call with his fun and hilarious buddies, just on mute.I think Technoblade, and other creators like him, helped get my son through the past couple years. I&#39;m so grateful to him for that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My teenage daughter made an irregular visit to my study about an hour ago to let me know of this news.  I let her know that I didn&#39;t know this Technoblade, but this news seemed to hit my usually tough exterior daughter pretty hard, so he had some type of positive impact to my family.  It is a touching tribute video they released."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"22 is far too young. I&#39;ve been watching his videos since 2017- the picture in today&#39;s video of him in a hospital bed with his 10 million subscriber play button absolutely destroyed me. He used to joke all the time about hitting 10 million subscribers as if it could never happen, and the fact that it did is a monument to all the time and effort he put in- should&#39;ve lived to 100 million. A reminder to us all- life is precious, live it to the fullest while you still can.They&#39;re all good, but if you want a video to watch, I&#39;d recommend his 1 million subscriber special: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3rnhyu000w"</p>

They can&#39;t report to city traffic control about their condition.We should be innovating in infrastructure instead - create standardised computer readable infrared road markings, equip each traffic light and each lamp post with a radio beacon, each crash barrier could have a radio marker, create PUBLIC maps of each city, have a central traffic control sypercomputer in each city provide directions to cars. Have each car painted with infrared markers so they recognise each-other. Provide cyclists with something these cars can recognise.We could even make radar-reflective pants so that autonomous cars see them better.the whoe traffic system needs to be looked at and brought to a new set of standards, whatever they may be. I am not sure what they are, but it should be clear to anyome with half a brain thay having a car use a camera to tell if the traffic light is red or green is idiotic.untill a new system is ready, no car without AGI level ai will ever be safeThe only problem is that such collective approach conflicts with the way VCs work."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Related. I listed something for sale on Craigslist recently and got a bunch of messages right away that asked obvious questions that were in the listing. One suggested that his wife pick it up, and can I take Zelle? Went silent when I said cash only.But the most interesting scammer said: &#34;for my safety, can I send you a 6-digit number, and you confirm it, so I know the listing is not fake?&#34; I say yes, unsure what the scam was going to be, but sure it was a scam. Moments later I got an SMS from Google Voice asking me to verify my phone number. Mofo tried to steal my number, presumably to use it to scam other people. I was pissed and impressed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"For a while I grew quite fond of wasting phone scammers time. I’d pick up, talk suuuuuuper slowly— like Emo Phillips speed at one syllable every one or two seconds— interrupt with irrelevant questions or anecdotes, and overall just see how long I could keep them on the phone without giving them any information. The best strategy I found was telling them that, yes indeed I did remember owing the IRS or whoever money and I could pay them however and insisting that first they needed to take down my new email address… I’d just start spelling random words incredibly slowly, say I messed up and start over, ask if they needed my checking account number to keep them engaged and then start spelling my email address again. They prey on intellectually disabled folks so pantomiming a stereotypical version of that wastes a ton of time while keeping their interest. Got boring after a while but I got pretty good at it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, how interesting. I started getting these a few months ago, right after starting a new job in a somewhat high-profile area. I have been getting 1-2 per month but found them quite unusual because none of them ever progressed to an actual scam - just a few messages back and forth about the fabricated &#34;wrong number&#34; situation and then each thread would stop, seemingly earnestly.Since there was no obvious scam, I&#39;ve been wondering what the motivation for these was, and actually started worrying about whether someone might be trying to compromise my phone via some yet-undisclosed SMS exploit - why else would there be a systematic effort to get me to spend time exchanging a few pointless messages around the &#34;wrong number&#34; pretext that otherwise went nowhere?I tried calling the senders by phone and found they were all Google Voice numbers, which eliminated the possibility that some actual rich guy had innocuously ended up with a number similar to mine.I asked a few friends and no one else was experiencing the same thing. Glad to hear it&#39;s not just me."</p>

Good for a game of logical fallacy bingo.The only interesting development seems to be the methodology but that only gets a passing mention.The rest is basically fearmongering.&gt; In humans, for example, gut bacteria influence how the immune system responds to pathogens and allergens, or interact with the brain, affecting mood.Ok.  But what does that have to do with diversity?  Humans have not been an emotionally rational species at any point in the past.  Arguably the relationship between gut biome diversity and civilization is inverse.  Maybe we want fewer microbes.Lifespan has also increased with decreased gut biome diversity.This is why correlation alone is uninteresting.  You can find it anywhere.&gt; Splitting the difference, people in less developed parts of the world have between 60 and 65 of those bacterial groups, an observation that ties the decrease in microbial diversity to urbanization.Oh come on.  How does a line like this get published?  This is fine if you define “ties” as “moves with” but not “is connected to”.  IOW correlation doesn’t imply causation.&gt; Kyle Meyer, a microbiologist at UC Berkeley, argues such losses are not necessarily a problem. “Maybe we don’t need them,” he points out. But Moeller is worried. “We are really doing some scary stuff to our microbiomes,” he warns.Why is it “scary”?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the US at least, any refrigeration technician should already have passed his EPA 608 or 609 and be fully aware that venting a unit can cost him his card rendering him unable to buy refrigerants. Before working on all but small self contained units he must have access to a refrigerant recovery unit. This a compressor sort of thing that can move the gas from the installed unit into a tank for either reuse on site or taking to a reclamation center, where allegedly they can be paid for it.(Yes, my AC units broke and the time to even get a technician to look at them, was so long I researched how to diagnose them and do the easy fixes, ran into the EPA requirement, studied the material and got my EPA certification, bought a bunch of gear off Amazon and refrigerant from a “good old boy” at an exorbitant price (global shortage, plus most is sold in palette quantities), and fixed my own unit in half the time it would have taken to get an appointment with a professional company. The first unit is working. If I succeed at the second unit I’ll even be money ahead. Of course if my yak had already been shaved maybe it could have tolerated the heat.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problematic refrigerants are pretty diverse, being made up of short carbon chains (1-4 atoms typically) decorated mainly with chlorine or flourine atoms. For example:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2,3,3,3-TetrafluoropropeneInterestingly the best option for a refrigerant may be CO2 itself, which if collected from the atmosphere has no global warming or ozone depletion issues.  The only drawback is CO2 refrigeration equipment has to operate at relatively high pressure, but this isn&#39;t a major problem:https://www.rsi.edu/blog/hvacr/carbon-dioxide-refrigerant/Getting rid of the chloro-flouro stuff makes lots of sense, but not producing any of it in the first place would be even better."</p>

Politics concerns regulation of the world and work happens in the world.Whenever an executive starts complaining[1] about how politics is impacting their workplace I see management incompetence. Politics exists. It exists for everyone. If your company is having an unusually difficult time getting work done in a given political environment, the conditions that are causing that probably have more to do with the company environment than politics writ large.Prohibition is always a largely ineffective policy. People have feelings about the world.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Crypto&#39;s biggest friction point imo has been that people are used to interacting [primarily with centralized services. Average people don&#39;t want to manage their own crypto wallet because they aren&#39;t used to being the sole person responsible for managing things like that. They don&#39;t want all their money to be tied to a single computer, or QR code, or device, they want it tied to an account held by a big company, where all they have to do is prove who they are to access their stuff. 
Because of this habit it feels like decentralized services will always end up as a collection of siloed centralized services. And with centralized services you get things like this data selling. Unless there&#39;s a paradigm shift in how non-technical people interact with decentralized services things like this are going to keep happening. That said, they&#39;re saying they&#39;re only providing publicly available data to ICE, but if it&#39;s publicly available and non-identifiable, why does ICE even need it, and why wouldn&#39;t they be able to get it themselves?

Saying that for full disclosure because I&#39;m biased and this feels like a hit piece to me.When I worked there, they disclosed all financials in our internal Confluence site. There was a policy of full transparency with the employees. The owners (Mike and Scott) had impressive business discipline. They were profitable every quarter. They had many many opportunities to get vc money and go wild. When they finally took VC money, It was a modest amount ($60M I think) and the purpose was explained to us as setting up an ESOP program and putting Atlassian on the path to go public.A year or two later, Doug Berman, the founder of Great Plains software became chairman of the Atlassian board. He gave a presentation to all of the employees at the Sydney office. One thing that stood out was that he said, it&#39;s actually bad to be profitable when you&#39;re growing. I&#39;m paraphrasing here but he essentially said, you&#39;re leaving growth on the table. His thesis was growth is more important than profits.So whether you agree with that or not, that is obviously the idea they are operating on rather than uncontrolled spending and helicopter dropping stock on employees heads out of desperation."</p>

Do I have that reasoning correct?We need to:- migrate the bug queue- have all links in commit history break- application integration with githib for bug reporting be removed- update documentation- find a new website host (and no longer github.io)- find a new CI/CD (we were already burned by travis, github workflows are nice)- teach our user contributors to actually use git! There has been a lot of heartache from them that they have to use the pencil icon on a web ui to edit config files, now we have to take them back to using a git GUI client! We were on github before that blessed pencil icon feature came out, there was no end to the wailing about how unapproachable the process was (super frustrating when users see they have to do something.. frustrating for us because our users wanted to just email is stuff so we could then do the uploading to git work)- lose all PR history- migrate project tracking- find a new place to host release artifacts- update our website to use a new distribution URL (the website scrapes github api to get latest version for download link; it&#39;s nice never updating website as we do releases on every merge)- figure out and migrate repository permissions. (We have a hundred repositories of user generated plugin content, everything about migrating that would be a lot of work and missing important features)- lose our search ranking and rebuild our SEOWhat else to add to this pile.. and all because co-pilot smells?? Meanwhile all of that work is busy work, and not at all feature-pare. That kind of migration would take a long time, seems like that pivot without good reason is the worst kind of churn.

I figured they wanted to make a profit when I signed up even ... not sure how that would surprise anyone now.Co-pilot, I personally don&#39;t feel there is a compelling reason to leave github due to that either.Maybe I&#39;m not versed enough in some of this but as a rando dev I&#39;m just not having any problems on github these days ...I&#39;m not saying the author is wrong or right or that I&#39;m right or wrong, just that I&#39;m not finding that article very convincing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Headlines about Supreme Court cases are almost uniformly misleading, because they suggest the Court is making decisions on policy issues rather than legal issues.The very first words of the opinion, on p. 2, make clear that the legal issue before the Court is very different: https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/20-1530_n758.pdfThe Clean Air Act does not purport to give the EPA blanket regulatory authority over anything involving emissions into the air. It has detailed provisions focused on reducing the amount of toxic pollutants, in particular through the use of control (scrubbing) technologies. This case concerns whether the EPA can use its power to impose control technologies on power plants, to force the industry to use a particular mix of power generation sources (solar, gas, etc.). The Court decided that the statute did not confer on the EPA the power to do that.  The relevant discussion begins on page 16.This decision gives legs to something that has been called the &#34;major questions doctrine.&#34; The gist of that doctrine is that an agency can&#39;t stretch some pre-existing grant of Congressional authority to create sweeping regulations addressing a major new problem. As applied here, that means that the EPA can&#39;t rely on authority delegated by Congress to, for example, tell coal plants what kind of scrubbers they have to use, to tackle climate change. pp. 17-19."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What’s interesting about this ruling (if you listened to the oral arguments and read the ruling) is that it appears to undercut the ability for any executive agency to make a rule, under them claim that congress cannot delegate its powers.So the FAA can’t determine and then require that aircraft have transponders.  Congress has to do this.If they continue down this path it will be chaos."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with &#34;congress cannot delegate it&#39;s powers&#34; to a certain extent.Negative example: The BATF has a splendid history of literally doing nothing except putting it&#39;s critics behind bars, while solving 0 actual crime and preventing any sort of mass tradgedies.Positive example: The FAA has done an incredible job making air-travel safer than car travel. I have a feeling that a lot of the higher-ups are former engineers and have been able to put politics and red/blue crap aside for a common mission.Mixed example: The FCC has done a great job on spectrum allocation. They&#39;ve done a shitty job when on broadband and content regulation, with it quickly becoming politicalized and more concern about red/blue.Good example: The FDA has done a great job in regulating the industry for their namesake: food and drugs. We have unprecedented levels of safety in both despite not having a complete knowledge of how all drugs work (biology is just complex with a lot of hidden downstream after-effects).Poor example: The NRC has pretty much just said &#34;No&#34; to fucking everything in nuclear. No progress has been made. We should have 3-5 reactors (on average) in every state. Instead we&#39;re still running 50 year old designs (not _necessarily bad_ but not great either) when we could have Generation III+ with passive failure modes.That brings me to the EPA. I think they&#39;ve done a lot of good: energy efficiency ultimately benefits the consumer in nearly every case. I have an air conditioner that kicks out a splendid 58degree air stream in the summer heat and extraordinarily low energy consumption levels. The EPA has successfully sued countless corporations and created superfund sights when they just dump industrial waste without a plan to handle it.Unfortunately, as red/blue politics get involved in an agency, everyone loses. And the finger pointing begins. As such, the only &#34;way out&#34; may be to say delegate it to Congress. I&#39;m not sure where we go from here."</p>

Watching them, it starts to become clear just how skilled and efficient they are.This tech demo is amazing, but my mind immediately compares it to things like the ruby-throated hummingbird migration, in which a 5 gram bird[0] flies 500+ MILES nonstop over open water, on maybe 2 grams of fat storage.Then they feed by hovering so accurately that they can reliably thread a 1/8&#34; beak into a moving 1/4&#34; target.They can do this directly into 20 mph headwinds [0]. Also in rainstorms where they are constantly getting pelted with their bodyweight in wet missiles every few seconds.They can also fly 30mph in level flight, which in body lengths / second is ~4x times faster than an SR-71.[0] US nickels weigh 5 grams, for comparison.[1] https://www.kqed.org/science/28759/what-happens-when-you-put..."</p>

He filed a patent for an &#34;ionocraft&#34; in 1959.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Throwaway account for reasons that will become obvious.I know someone who was able to work with JR at EA at a very high level, and who was familiar with internal goings-on at Unity a few years ago. His assessment of JR&#39;s leadership style was that he thought competition between executives was a good thing, and the result was a lot of mistrust and chaos.I&#39;m not sure the specifics of how this played out at EA, but what I do know is that during his tenure, there were a number of poorly-executed moves towards expanding franchises (Dead Space 3, Medal of Honor: Warfighter, Army of Two: The Devil&#39;s Cartel), adding live service components to games that didn&#39;t benefit (SimCity), pivots to free-to-play that failed (Plants Vs Zombies 2, Bejeweled Skies, Dungeon Keeper), rushed releases meant to fill schedules (Dragon Age 2), and several massive acquisitions at hugely inflated prices that were almost total wastes of money (Playfish, PopCap).There were many internal groups battling for control: Multiple product management teams who wanted to influence monetization strategy across mobile games, several small studios who were able to release games with little to no oversight (an HTML5/JS web game team that made a Command and Conquer game, and another team that made several Dragon Age Flash games), and the ill-fated initiative to turn BioWare into a huge umbrella label that lasted about a year before SWTOR came out and then Ray and Greg were basically forced into retirement.Lots of really messy stuff.From the folks I&#39;ve talked to who work at Unity, it&#39;s pretty chaotic there too. And why wouldn&#39;t it be? They doubled headcount in a short period of time, are tackling a ton of different markets, they&#39;ve pushed and then deprecated or removed support for a multiplayer solution, analytics service, a UI rewrite, and probably more I&#39;m forgetting. Then there are the &#34;this is the new hotness&#34; features that STILL AREN&#39;T FINISHED even two, three, four, or more years after they were announced, like the two competing and incompatible rendering pipelines, ECS, and more. And I&#39;ve been told that the reason that longstanding bugs in major features like 2D sprites and physics take so long to be fixed is that each of those major features only has one, maybe two people working on it.No wonder things are rocky at Unity."</p>

The vast majority of magic tricks are the opposite. The effect is amazing but the method is actually quite mundane. This is one reason magicians don&#39;t reveal &#34;secrets&#34;. The reality is most magical methods are rather disappointing compared to the astonishing impact of the effect created.For any magical effect there are almost always many possible methods and, conversely, for each method there are multiple possible effects. This method provides a way to know the location (or absence) of each card in a shuffled deck without the performer handling the deck. For most of the effects which could be accomplished with this method there exist a wide variety of alternate, much simpler, methods. Using any of those easier and cheaper methods would likely appear identically amazing to audiences. And that&#39;s why I love this method. As a technologist and magician, I&#39;ve always had a special fondness for wildly complex methods - that rare kind of magic where the method actually IS as amazing as the effect."</p>

We experience it when we feel rusty in a foreign language or sports that we have not practised in a while. Practice is important to maintain skills but it is also key when learning new ones. This is a reason why many textbooks and courses feature exercises. However, the solutions to the exercises feel often overly brief, or are sometimes not available at all. Rather than an opportunity to practice the new skills, the exercises then become a source of frustration and are ignored.Typical exercise soltion: How to draw an owl. 1. Draw some circles. 2.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Side-note on digital calendars: What I&#39;d really like is a continuously scrolling calendar to help with long-ish term planning (3-4 months). Most apps are stuck in the single-month page view analogy to physical calendars, which for me keeps breaking my mental flow of stringing activities across the boundary/long distances. And I get why (standard behavior/components and user expectations) but it just seems like a missed opportunity. Not sure how many want this but I suspect more would do if they were exposed to it.A few calendar apps allow a stretch of &gt;4 weeks and there&#39;s this POC web version: https://madebyevan.com/calendar/app/ but all I can do for now is constantly switch from a Gantt app to my calendar app (Thunderbird or Google Calendar)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, this is where design really falls flat.It looks nice, the idea is appealing, but the result is awful. This thing is totally unusable. You need to remember to slide the frame every month. It doesn&#39;t even tell you that you did or not. Sliding the frame requires checking the number of days there are in the month. When you&#39;re in the last week, having the 31 always there is a pain in the ass. Knowing the next month is kind of useful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Neat. Some limitations:- It doesn&#39;t tell you how many days there are in the month (31/30/28/29).- Working out how to move the frame at the end of the month isn&#39;t very difficult, but it&#39;s not trivial either (especially given the previous point)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something not mentioned in the article: Middle Earth is depopulated. Without large market, it does not make sense to produce at scale, nor you will have the capital to do it.The main characters travel hundreds of kilometers down the biggest river around and they don&#39;t encounter other vessels or a populated settlement until they reach Minas Tirith. And I&#39;m not even mentioning the missing cities and villages in the inland part of the travel. We can say that this is due to lower birth rate in the numenorians who obviously have reproductive issues as mentioned in the books. Another reason is the brain, knowledge and capital drain caused by the large elvian immigration going for centuries. Dwarfs have the excuse of a long generation length to explain why they are not multiplying like rabbits for the thousands of years since the last world war, however, Tolkien does not provide a good reason for the other human nations, the orcs or even the hobbits.Possible explanation might be the unstable security situation on the continent, however, most of the societies are not described as being constantly under the risk of a raid from nearby orc. Aragorn is able to defend most of the north with a few hundred irregulars, while the east participated in only one war 60 years ago that was done in a few weeks time. The south is not described, but nothing unusual there as well as far as the books go."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I highly recommend &#34;The Last Ring Bearer&#34; for people who like to have a bit of fun with Tokien.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_RingbearerEskov&#39;s version of the story describes Mordor as a peaceful constitutional monarchy on the verge of an industrial revolution, that poses a threat to the war-mongering and imperialistic faction represented by Gandalf (whose attitude has been described by Saruman as &#34;crafting the Final Solution to the Mordorian problem&#34;) and the racist elves.[2] For example, Barad-dûr, Sauron&#39;s citadel, appears in chapter 2 as...that amazing city of alchemists and poets, mechanics and astronomers, philosophers and physicians, the heart of the only civilization in Middle-earth to bet on rational knowledge and bravely pitch its barely adolescent technology against ancient magic. The shining tower of the Barad-dûr citadel rose over the plains of Mordor almost as high as Orodruin like a monument to Man – free Man who had politely but firmly declined the guardianship of the Dwellers on High and started living by his own reason. It was a challenge to the bone-headed aggressive West, which was still picking lice in its log ‘castles’ to the monotonous chanting of scalds extolling the wonders of never-existing Númenor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article presents an engineering answer to s sociological question.The reason technology did not advance in Middle Earth is because innovation was not rewarded. Innovation and experimentation were punished.Mine a little too deeply? You awaken a balrog that kills you an everyone you have ever known.Want to expand into that verdant area across the river? You didn&#39;t expect giant spiders, did you?Build a disruptive startup and bank $50B? You&#39;ll hear dragon wings a-flappen.Middle Earth was not filled with innovative disrupters because the risk and reward equation strongly discouraged innovation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally I think they should not be able to decide such things. A payment provider should be forced to accept all legitimate customers. It is absolutely unwanted for a private business (in an unrelated category no less) to be playing the role of legislator.The problem is once a majority of payment providers (especially in this category where there&#39;s only really 2 major ones) starts blocking things, it becomes really difficult for fringe groups that are in fact perfectly legal. I understand that porn payments are a bit more risky but the providers can simply have a policy to deny chargebacks for this category and shift the risk to the customer. Similar to the way returns of sex toys are not accepted for hygiene reasons.Recently there was a lot of news in the Netherlands about prostitutes not being able to open bank account because all banks refused them. Think of prostitution what you will but over there it&#39;s legal work and they pay their taxes. But not being able to get a bank account gets them into very difficult situations and pushes them to shady people (which was exactly what the legalisation was avoiding).Also other platforms like fetlife have recently been forced to validate their users, leading to potentially serious consequences if this data ever becomes compromised. Many people there don&#39;t even show their face so the result is that they have to give a lot more personal info now than they would have wanted to."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an author of pinephone keyboard firmware, I spent a bit of time thinking and trying to use keyboard like this. I can say that what hinders portability/serious use of all of these layout designs that try to emulate regular big keyboard is that they try to emulate big keyboard layout. That layout is made with an asumption that you have many fingers available, and that they can easily reach anywhere if you like.If you have only two thumbs available for typing, that can only reach about half the keyboard each (quite a hard limit!), you realize how asumptions this layout makes suddenly don&#39;t hold, and normal things like ctrl+a or alt+shift+1, or alt+shift+any arrow are almost impossible.Yes, you can modify the shortcuts in i3wm,screen,... (not Firefox, which is quite resistant to modifying keyboard shortcuts by design) specially for your &#34;PDA&#34;. But  if you just want a portable device you can painlessly migrate your tasks to for a few days a year, spending a lot of time designing shortcuts for your DE, or terminal multiplexer, is not that appealing.It would be probably more useful if key layout was designed from the start to allow various modifier combos to be invoked by dedicated keys, or layout designed so that more modifiers were symetricaly placed (or something even less traditional, and have all letter/number keys on the right and all modifier/modifier combos/special keys on the left), instead of wasting space on big enter key, or big spacebar (for which you may spend several HW iterations just to make those right and reactive on their whole surface), etc. Due to size, it&#39;s usually uncomfortable to press 3 key combos even with the keyboard laying on the table.Also comfortable position for the most comonly used keys (usually modifiers) is not on the edge of the keyboard. That&#39;s really pretty bad for your thumbs.The layout of these things just needs a lot more thought.Sad thing is, that if someone would spend a ton of research and thinking on making something usable and comfortable, most people would completely poopoo it as a freaky unusable layout, just because it would look unfamiliar, lol."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ugh, every time I see a device like this (and even the larger Reform) I&#39;m so tempted. But I learned my lesson form-factor wise with the GPD Win Max: even as a travel laptop it&#39;s painfully small after about a day or two of use. And the sad reality is that the performance-freedom tradeoff is still immense. If we assume the best system module is faster than say a Raspberry Pi 4 (which seems optimistic), it&#39;d still get absolutely walked by an 11-year old i5 (e.g., Tx20 generation Thinkpad which are coreboot-able these days).Any kind of performance-critical stuff is clearly not the point, but it&#39;s hard to not think that smartphones have killed off this form-factor/performance tier for good reason. Makes a lot of sense as a Raspberry Pi with a screen and keyboard, but not really as a &#34;laptop.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m fascinated, ongoingly by a Linux phone. I spent effort making many versions of the Sharp Zaurus cellular(ish) back in the day, even going as far as writing a sync tool for Evolution back in 2003. I&#39;d love a Linux cellphone.  My needs are very simple, and I&#39;d love to know the state of anything that can (and with stability).1. Be a decent phone (voice, sms)
2. Contacts/Mail/Calendar sync
3. Run android apps that require voice (Telegram, Signal, WhatsApp, etc)?
4. Take pictures + videos (not even at a high level)
5. eSIMEverything else is gravy. But those 5 items are the base requirement that I personally have for a phone. Every time I dip in, it&#39;s at best unclear."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is of course a flood of negative comments...So in the interest of balance I have to say thunderbird is a excellent program. I use it as my daily driver in work and for personal use.It has so many features that puts me, the user, in control that I totally take them for granted until I have to use outlook for something.I use it in a multinational, I used it with exchange and now with office 365. People can complain away but there are many like me who rely on it every single day and it has a real, positive impact on our work lives every single day.Some days are just email client and Web browser, and without thunderbird and Firefox working for me as the user...... I dunno, work would be a lot more frustrating I guess. MASSIVE thanks to all the contributors to thunderbird!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; One of the core philosophies behind the development of Thunderbird 102 was doing more with less.&gt; ...you’ll find out-of-box support for the popular, decentralized chat protocol Matrix in Thunderbird 102Personally, I see these two statements as being directly contradictory. I&#39;m glad to see Thunderbird&#39;s maintenance continuing well, but I want it to be a focused app. On the other hand, I have been glad to have out of the box Lightning integration, so perhaps I will come to enjoy the Matrix addition as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few months ago I was tasked with switching our office from Gmail&#39;s web interface to Thunderbird and it&#39;s gone surprisingly well. Usually new software meets a lot of resistance and complaints from the staff, but I&#39;ve heard mostly praise.I&#39;ve been playing around with a testing version (beta? nightly? can&#39;t remember) and am very excited about the chat integration. I&#39;m not sure if it will be useful in the office, which is small enough for people to just talk to one another, but it could come in handy in some circumstances where we&#39;d normally use an email chain."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article is informative.  I have found that databases in general tend to be less sexy than the front-end apps...especially with the recent cohort of devs. As an old bastard,  I would pass on one thing:  Realize that any reasonably used database will likely outlast the applications leveraging it. This is especially true the bigger it gets, and the longer it stays in production.  That said, if you are influencing the design of a database, imagine years later what someone looking at it might want to know if having to rip all the data out into some other store.  Having migrated many legacy systems, I tend to sleep better when I know the data is well-structured and easy to normalize.  In those cases, I really don&#39;t care so much about the apps.  If I can sort out (haha) the data, I worry less about the new apps I need to design.  I have been known to bury documentation into for-purpose tables...that way I know that info won&#39;t be lost.  Export the schema regularly, version it, check it in somewhere.  And, if you can, please, limit the use of anything that can hold a NULL. Not every RDBMS handles NULL the same way.   Big old databases live a looooong time."</p>

The user clicked the link after getting it in their mailbox but then Auth0 throws up an error page because the e-mail address has already been verified (by Outlook scanning). 
The problem becomes worse if for some reason the mail ends up in the junk mail folder so the user thinks they&#39;ve never received the mail but when you check it looks like the e-mail address was verified successfully.
That has caused a lot of annoying back and forth trying to figure out what the hell is going on.

Super annoying."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s not just in megaprojects either. In my large, fairly dense US city, basic, easy-to-build, local infrastructure like adding a 1-mile bike lane to a straight street is impossible because a handful of NIMBYs are constantly taken seriously by local politicians.My city has many bike lanes that are popular and well-used, as well as a bike-share program that is extremely popular. It also has a large number of cyclist deaths - including children! - due to the spottiness of existing bike infrastructure and overall lack of protected bike lanes. It seems like improving that infrastructure would be both easy, cheap, and popular, given the popularity of cycling and its existing infra, and the cheapness of plopping a concrete barrier onto a street. But no - the second anyone mentions protected bike lanes, a handful of NIMBYs write in with &#34;but muh cars&#34; and the politicians throw up their hands and surrender.I don&#39;t understand why NIMBYs have been taken so seriously in the US in the past 50 years. It seems like at any point in history, any local project will be opposed by somebody, no matter who they are or what the project is. But previous generations seemed to be able to get over that in favor of building. For today&#39;s generation it seems like doing nothing has become better than doing something. If this were the 1900s, government would have told the NIMBYs to get bent, we&#39;re building Thing X because it&#39;s good for society and if you don&#39;t like it, tough. That&#39;s what living in city means sometimes!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the things I love about Palladium (and closely related, Samo Burja&#39;s newsletter) is the depth of research.Like the detail that one of the most egregious episodes from California HSR involved a Spanish company that performed excellently on rail projects in Spain. Overall, this piece makes a strong case that the problem is specifically NIMBYism and loss of government institutional capacity.I think the million dollar question is how government organizations can hire and retain better. The current situation looks dire. Obviously a charismatic leader with a broad anti-NIMBY mandate would go a ways at getting competent people to want to work in government. You saw that succeed on a small scale with orgs like US Digital Service.The elephant, after that, is merit-based pay and promotion. Someone needs to sell this to the public. RN literally random cops and plumbers make mid six figures thru overtime while the directors of $100b mega-project are low-energy lifers making less than that. That&#39;s not gonna work."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People generally call out NIMBY-ism as though it&#39;s just some sort of irrational bias that people have, but I don&#39;t think that always explains it.  Sure, in a lot of cases, people are overprotective of their neighborhoods or communities.  But where did that attitude come from?  I&#39;d argue it came from decades of corporate greed and government dysfunction that bred a general distrust of large institutions.  It&#39;s not like people have no reason to feel like big business doesn&#39;t have their best interests in mind.Another commenter gave the construction of highways as an example, saying that people used to look at large infrastructure projects like that with a positive attitude.  Well, I&#39;d say look where that got them.  The way highways were built in this country completely wrecked communities (especially poor ones located in less desirable parts of town) and eventually led to the uniquely American aesthetic of the urban and suburban wasteland.If large organizations in this country want to undertake large projects, they have to first work to regain the trust of the average person by acting like they actually give a damn and really want to the world to be a better place for their efforts."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Prominent crypto hedge fund Three Arrows Capital has defaulted on a loan worth more than $670 million. Digital asset brokerage Voyager Digital issued a notice on Monday morning, stating that the fund failed to repay a loan of $350 million in the U.S. dollar-pegged stablecoin, USDC, and 15,250 bitcoin, worth about $323 million at today’s prices.In other words, the $670 million that 3AC defaulted on was ~50:50 USDC and bitcoin.Then later:&gt; Zhu [3AC founder] is known for his incredibly bullish view of bitcoin. He said last year the world’s largest cryptocurrency could be worth $2.5 million per coin. But in May this year, as the crypto market began its meltdown, Zhu said on Twitter that his “supercycle price thesis was regrettably wrong.”This seems odd. How does a person convinced that bitcoin exchange is headed to $2.5 million take out a loan of 15K bitcoin if he actually thinks he&#39;ll be paying back it back at a higher exchange rate? Either the founder was bullish in principle but bearish in practice, or didn&#39;t have the first clue about what he was doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really don’t understand the business model of making massive fiat loans to “firms” to buy bitcoin. If crypto goes up, you get a small amount of interest. If crypto goes down, you lose everything. What? Lol. Just spend a fraction of the sum on bitcoin and do something safe with the rest. What was the plan?Edit: I guess when someone has “20 billion dollars” a 700mm loan doesn’t seem like a big risk."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a good overview, but even by 2014 we weren&#39;t calling hlt - there&#39;s a few problems there. Imagine the situation where you fork() a process on one CPU, and you have another CPU that recently called hlt. Ideally you&#39;d schedule it immediately instead of waiting for the next scheduler interrupt, but sending interrupts from one CPU to another (to break it out of hlt) is kind of expensive. The replacement is an instruction called mwait, which will (like hlt) wake the CPU up on interrupts, but will also wake up the CPU on a write to a specific memory address. If you want to wake up an idle CPU, the working CPU can just do that memory write and then the idle CPU will wake up back into the scheduler and figure out it has work to do.(Edit: there are still actually some circumstances in which hlt is called rather than mwait, but this is very CPU dependent and is based on vendor recommendations. Also, before mwait showed up, switching to deep CPU power saving states tended to involve performing magic IO port accesses rather than calling hlt, and yes the world was worse back then)"</p>

Asyncio has its place but is waaay overused. Typing was a cool idea, but so awkward in practice.All of it has really turned me off, personally. It’s getting to where reading libraries is just painful.  The simplicity of the language was really beautiful and when I wanted type safety, etc. I’d use something else.  I can still write simple Python, but it’s more all the other code I need to grok.I find myself going to Go more and more for stuff I used to use Python for. It’s easier to set up a dev environment for other people, easier to distribute code, and gives me type safety and concurrency as first class citizens while being a very small language.I miss dictionary comprehensions and other shortcuts from time to time. But it actually feels more ergonomic now.All personal opinion. I’m fine shifting languages.  I still write C from time to time to bang bits.  I play with various LISPs to exercise my brain.  I never used Python for performance critical code.  I guess ML is changing that need.But I know others that want Java to have functional features and Python to have this stuff.I’m not saying I’m “right”, just uncomfortable in a place I used to love to hang out in."</p>

  &gt; to have it respected.

Without judging whether the goal is good or not, I will gently point out that your current approach doesn&#39;t seem to be effective. A Google search for &#34;BoppreH&#34; turned up several results on the first page with what appears to be your full name, along with other results linking to various emails that have been associated with that name. Results include Github commits, mailing list archives, and third-party code that cited your Github account as &#34;work by $NAME&#34;.As a purely practical matter -- again, not going into whether this is how things should be, merely how they do be -- it is futile to want the internet as a whole to have a concept of privacy, or to respect the concept of a &#34;digital personal space&#34;. If your phone number or other PII has ever been associated with your identity, that association will be in place indefinitely and is probably available on multiple data broker sites.The best way to be anonymous on the internet is to be anonymous, which means posting without any name or identifier at all. If that isn&#39;t practical, then using a non-meaningful pseudonym and not posting anything personally identifiable is recommended."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At 35 I decided to fuck the &#34;normal life&#34; and just go RVing with my wife. We saw the country (US). Fast forward 7 years and we are now building our own house paycheck to paycheck. It&#39;s a beautiful property. I know there are people on here that have much, much more and could afford to buy an already existing house. But my dreams are to have a different kind of life, so in that sense I am definitely living that. Yes there are mornings I wish I can wake up and NOT want to install my own well pump, install mini splits in 105 degree weather, install siding, dig foundations, run 40 80-pound bags of cement in a mixer, 2 at a time. etc etc etc...But my alternative life would have been spending the last 7 years playing new versions of Call of Duty and kinda pissing time away."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; You should organize each day as if it were your last, so that you neither need to long for nor fear the next day.I&#39;ve come to find this &#34;live each day like it&#39;s your last&#34; advice to be pretty unhelpful. My favorite quote about it is, &#34;all that goes to show you is some people would spend their last day giving you stupid advice&#34;.The problem is that if it actually was your last day, most people would give the finger to all of their responsibilities and go party, eat cake, see friends, familiy, lovers, etc. Which is simply not an actual way to live your life. It&#39;s a way to exit your life.An alternative framing that I&#39;ve come to find more helpful is to take your life expectancy, and cut it by 2/3. Now what do you do? For example, if you&#39;re 20 years old and your life expectancy is 80 (ie. 60 more years), pretend that you only have 20 more, so you&#39;ll only live until you&#39;re 40. It&#39;s nice cause it naturally adjusts as you get older. You&#39;ll have smaller windows to work with.This approach strikes a nice balance. It gives you enough time to be able to really do something and change directions if you want. But not so much time that you can really waste any. It forces you to ask the hard questions about whether your day to day is truly connecting with your dreams, and whether you&#39;re on a path to get there.Of course, Seneca didn&#39;t have life expectancy tables to work with. But I think he would have approved. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article buries its lede, which is about how honey bees get all the attention but are at less risk than wild bees:&gt; And that brings us to the actual problem. The honey bee (Apis mellifera) is only one of about 20 thousand different bee species. The non-honey bees are usually referred to as wild bees, and each location has its native species. According to an estimate from researchers at Cornell University in 2006, wild bees contribute to the pollination of 85 percent of crops in agriculture.&#34;&gt; [...]&gt; But last year the magazine Cell published the results of a study with a global estimate for the situation of wild bees. The authors looked at the numbers of bee species that were collected or observed over time using data publicly available at the Global Biodiversity Information Facility. They found that even though the number of records has been increasing, the number of different species in the records has been sharply decreasing in the past decades.&gt; The decline rates differ between the continents, but the species numbers are dropping steeply everywhere except for Oceania. The researchers say there’s a number of factors in play here, such as the expansion of monocultures, loss of native habitat, pesticides, climate change, and bee trade that also trades around pathogens.&gt; So the problems that wild bees face are similar to those of honey bees, but they have an additional problem which is… honeybees. Honey bees compete with wild bees for food and habitat and they also pass on viruses. Now, a big honey bee colony can deal with viruses by throwing out the infected bees. But this doesn’t work for wild bees because they don’t live in large colonies. And worse, when honey bees and wild bees fight for food they seem to both lose out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"(1) Stop using neonicotinoid pesticides. There are plenty of alternatives for protecting food crops from insect infestations, such as neem oil applied as a foliar spray or a soil soak in response to infestations.  Neonictoninoides are based on the tobacco nicotine molecule structure, but are typically chlorinated and modified to make them more persistent and toxic to insects relative to animals.  There&#39;s a good argument for banning the entire class due to their persistent ecological effects on beneficial native insect populations.https://organic-center.org/research/neonicotinoid-pesticides...(2) Have undisturbed habitat set aside for wild bee populations.  This can be something as simple as maintaining undisturbed hedgerows on the sides of agricultural fields, but in general means maintaining a fair amount of undisturbed native habitat.https://www.planetbee.org/planet-bee-blog//native-bee-series..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I appreciate that she draws the link between monoculture crops, land use, and the health of ecosystems upon which agriculture depends.Organics are important not because GMOs are the enemy but rather because the land use change is inherently bad for all life in that area. GMOs don&#39;t have to lead to monoculture crops that span acres or rampant neonicotinoid insecticides, but they often do, and it&#39;s precisely at that point we can see drastic changes in a biome&#39;s stability and therefore the health of bees among many other pollinators. That&#39;s why we need to be talking about insect numbers at large and not only bees.The study of biodiversity has an extremely difficult time modeling these kinds of changes, and that&#39;s probably why many scientists won&#39;t go to bat against this kind of land use change. A self-respecting scientist won&#39;t say that converting croplands to monocultures ready for insecticide use lead to biodiversity die-off because it&#39;s hard to actually track the fluctuations between species. It takes so much time to collect data to analyze before we even get an inkling of the interplay. We understand so little about the microscale interactions and how it fits into our larger understanding of agriculture and land development.For those who think this is all overblown and alarmist, go sit on the grass -- if you can find a patch -- and stare at a spot until it comes alive. Things are moving around and teeming with a multitude of species of plants and insects. The reality you see escapes unnoticed until you stop to think about the ecological systems that underpin our fragile existence. Our health depends on a functional biosphere. If we cannot figure out how to share the earth with its other inhabitants, what the fuck are we doing going to Mars?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;The main difference between what Ridley views this all in terms of and what I view it all in terms of is as follows. To me, the replicants (or androids, if you will) are deplorable because [inaudible] they are cold, they are selfish, they are heartless, they are completely self-centered, they have no empathy, they don&#39;t care about what happens to other creatures, and to me this is essentially a less-than-human entity for that reason. Now, Ridley said that he regarded them as supermen who couldn&#39;t fly. He said they are smarter than humans, they are stronger than humans, and they have faster reflexes than humans. Well, then I said &#39;well, gee Ridley, I mean, holy smokes, uh, golly,&#39; and that was about all I could think of to say, you know. That&#39;s rather a great divergence, you see: we&#39;ve gone from somebody who is a simulation of the authentic human to somebody who is literally superior to the authentic human. So we&#39;ve now flipped all the cards on the table, you see, when we do that: in other words, all the cards that were up are now down and all the ones that were down are now up. And I was at a loss at that point, you know, to respond, I mean. I said, &#39;okay, now the theme of the book is that Rick Deckard is dehumanized in his job of tracking down the replicants and killing them, that in other words he winds up essentially like they are.&#39; And Ridley said that he regarded that as an intellectual idea and he was not interested in making an esoteric film.&#34;-- Philip K.

One piece of advice I got from my publisher when authoring a technical book was to first break down what I was going write into headings and subheadings, and if possible, into sub-subheadings. Then review that to see if your flow is coherent and whether there are sections that are missing, or could be extracted into another text.Personally, my process after this is to express my thoughts in bullet points, followed by inserting any placeholders and captions for any graphics (e.g. charts or diagrams), and then finally I start rewriting my bullet points into proper sentences, expanding my examples, and adding any interstitial text necessary to make things flow.Also, I see some comments on keeping things short and to the point. In general, I agree with this, but depending on the medium, sometimes it doesn’t hurt to inject a bit of personality into your writing. Technical writing can be dry at times, and this can deter engagement. Try to use concrete examples whenever possible or refer to other supporting texts."</p>

Anchor tag is used for additional random key material (so it wont leave ya browser and files will always be encrypted regardless).You can roll your own too with the terraform code in it. It costs me barely anything (never go over free tier limit) to run it because files never live more than 10 days (there is a catchall lifecycle rule on the bucket) and when users select durations, i also put them in bucket prefix that has lifecycle rule place on objects under them for that duration. Note that we can&#39;t rely on lifecycle rule all the time so i also make sure when lambda is called to access the object, it checks the time-stamp, the duration and if it is meant to expire and not yet cleaned up by s3 - lambda function deletes it.I learnt a ton of cool things about s3 after this neat little project and really dig the API, the lifecycle rule, signing url etc...Ps: for these type of tool, you should definitely mitm it to see if plaintext file or password ever leave the browser... Relaysecret does leave one item unencrypted and that is the file name. You can change it upon upload but i like to leave it there so people know what they are downloading. I have simple idea of encrypting that with just the anchor key but haven&#39;t gotten around to put that in yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if Google was an absolute saint without a trillion-dollar ad business, there&#39;s still a problem of &#34;bug-compatibility&#34;.Without a second browser engine to test pages in, it&#39;s really hard to know what is a bug and what is intentional. Devs don&#39;t know all the specs by heart. They write whatever happens to work for them, but sometimes they accidentally depend on obscure edge cases in the implementation that were never meant to exist.In the long term it&#39;s paralysing for the engine maintainers, because any change in implementation could be changing some subtle behavior that breaks some pages. W3C requires two independent implementations, so that they&#39;ll share intentional behaviors, but hopefully their bugs will differ.The single-engine Web will be as fun to maintain as Windows: Windows 11 Explorer has a shiny new context menu with an option to reopen it as an older, uglier context menu, because Microsoft couldn&#39;t touch a line of code of the old context menu without breaking apps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The chromium-only web is not google’s fault. It is a symptom of a body of web standards that has grown wild to the point of being all but unimplementable.Building a browser for the modern standards-based web is effectively impossible, because it costs too much, takes too long, and requires a standing army to keep up with.We are at an impasse. The standards cannot be deprecated because they are used all over the web, and because they are used all over the web a new browser maker has little choice except forking chromium or firefox. Even microsoft couldn’t afford to keep adding all the standards to their browser engine. Normally the solution for a messy overgrown implementation is a grand reboot. But we can’t do a grand reboot of the web because we cannot get rid of the legacy. The only viable strategy I see to have real browser engine diversity without giving up on compatibility is moving as much of the standards implementation as possible into JS modules, so new browser makers can start with a small engine that loads the publicly hosted  standards modules."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article does an incredible job as painting Apple as a dystopian corporation that is strangling the web with forced WebKit, but spends so little time actually refuting the statement &#34;if WebKit weren&#39;t mandated, Chromium would take over&#34;. It pretty much comes down to &#34;if Apple were forced to open their platform, they would spend money improving Safari, and user&#39;s wouldn&#39;t switch because Apple has a gorillian dollars&#34;. The author seems to ignore that Google also has a gorillian dollars, plus the added inertia of Chromium itself, plus the pervasive network of Search and YouTube that would shove ads for Chrome down the throats of users. Money alone, even billions, cannot create a competitive browser engine. Microsoft tried. I&#39;m not sure that, if you actually cared about browser diversity, that forcing Apple to open up iOS and then hoping they don&#39;t mismanage Safari trying to compete with Chrome is a losing bet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To me, I felt this take was so disconnected from my reality as a user that I didn&#39;t even know where to start.Looking at the author bio, I can see he&#39;s very invested in the Blink project so it&#39;s difficult to shake the feeling that by arguing for &#34;browser diversity&#34;, he&#39;s simply pushing for increased Blink dominance.If one truly wanted to get more diversity in the Browser space, the number one objective should be getting Google to divest from the Chrome project. This would finally create space for other players to come in and have real influence over the future of the web.As it is today, everything Web-related gravitates around what Google wants. Apple is not playing ball, and so Google is getting the community to push regulators to intervene and make them kneel.Well, that&#39;s my view at least, maybe I&#39;m too cynical."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s not just WebKit. Devs can’t extent WebKit very much. Orion is trying but they’ve barely gotten anything done on the iOS extension side. There are limitations on what you can do by linking into the iOS web browser API, it seems.I recently switched to Mac with  great success. So I decided to try out the iPhone. I hadn’t used one for years and I was sick of Android.I’m still no great fan of Android. And so many little things are better on iOS.However, the SINGLE BIGGEST THING is absolutely broken. Browsing on iOS is unusable if you’re used to uBlock Origin. I can run that on Fennec/Firefox. I cannot do so on iOS. I was hoping the content blockers and extensions might come close. They do not in any way.I don’t even REALLY like FF and I don’t like Android but those are the options if I want browsing that doesn’t suck.Or maybe I’m missing something and someone can enlighten me before I return the iPhone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article buried the lede, which I think is this-- Google as email provider had information all along that DMCA notices it was sending to its YouTube property were not legitimate.  Google even went so far as to flag and reject some of those notices because of false personalities, but instead of going to the root cause to stop abuse of its systems it allowed the same user to plug along long enough to manipulate YouTube in a way that caused Bungie an alleged $7.6m in damages.  Then the icing is that when Bungie came knocking Google initially resisted a court-related request to allow Bungie to identify the user and stop the abuse.  Wow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A side note that I found particularly interesting&gt; On March 22, the Reynolds account logged out of Google and less than a second later, the Wiland account logged in, suggesting the same person was behind both accounts.I&#39;ve always wondered how often timing analysis is used in practice by surveillence big tech. I suspect that as people become more privacy aware, and start using VPNs, pseudonames, multiple accounts, etc, that big tech will start using timing analysis more and more to correlate traffic and identify users. Like if your friend sends you a Reddit link on WhatsApp, and you immediately open it in your browser, that Reddit session is now linked to you.Another more complex example: let&#39;s say Google has already identified your Reddit account. You open a Reddit discussion, and deep in the discussion it links to a Youtube video, and you open it in your browser. Now even if you weren&#39;t logged into Youtube, Google could guess that it&#39;s you based on the timing of when your Reddit account opened the discussion, and when the linked Youtube video was accessed. And not just that video, but now every Youtube video watched in the same browsing session, is now linked back to you (assuming you have first-party cookies enabled, which is basically required if you ever want to log into anything).Seems a bit paranoid, but I actually suspect this happened to me a few months ago. I was using a FOSS reddit client and clicked a youtube link buried deep in a reddit thread, and opened it in Newpipe (a FOSS youtube client). I wasn&#39;t logged in, and was using a VPN, and yet the next day on my Youtube feed I started getting recommendations based on that video (and those recommendations were very different from my usual ones). Scary stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My understanding is that if you wanted to hurt a YouTube channel, you could do so like this   1. Use a VPN create a gmail address.
   2. Use that address to file a DMCA notice on each channel video.
   3. Google auto-accepts; the channel challenges each notice.
   4. You deny all challenges.

And just like that, you can destroy any YouTube channel, without any accountability. Is this correct?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did a digital detox in July of 2020, I had become overwhelmed with Discord and Reddit moderation and trying to Keep Up. I burned out hard. I turned off all electronics for a month and uninstalled the apps and restricted my phone use to calls and responding to 3 close friend&#39;s texts at a set time each day--I didn&#39;t keep it on me at all. No video games, no TV, no watch or music streaming. I had my library of local music loaded to my trusty Zune and used that exclusively for music as the only device I carried with me.I read through the entirety of the Percy Jackson books and the Heroes sequels, the Mortal Instruments, the Seven Realms Novels, and the complete unabridged HHGTG. All it took to get my book-a-day self back was bringing myself back to my teen years when I wasn&#39;t allowed on the computer with access to the internet and my texts cost .3 minutes to read or send and I only got 100/mo. I was averaging roughly 350 pages per day.When I wasn&#39;t reading I was drawing or writing or outside being active when it was cool enough which improved my mental health even in spite of my heat based SAD.At the end of the month I had the attention span when I got back online to attend to a cross country move and secure a job and an apartment by the end of August. I had been intending to move for the 3 years prior.I wonder how I could go about taking advantage of the burst of creativity and focus while still being online enough to develop some of the software ideas I have that I never follow through on without getting overstimulated and distracted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; When I pulled up at a stoplight waiting for the light to change, I would instinctively reached for my phone (mounted on my dash) to check my email (personal + work), check ESPN, look up something on Amazon, etc. While pumping gas in the car, I’d whip out my phone while waiting. Stuck in line somewhere? Time for my phone. Waiting in an elevator? The phone. Riding the train? The phone. Going to the bathroom? Make sure to bring the phone! Eating breakfast? The phone. Any spare or idle moment? The phoneThis describes every single person I know under the age of 25, and I&#39;m in that demographic. It must be the single greatest public health experiment of all time.The crazy part is, not one single person I know thinks of it as a bad thing. They just seem to accept it as part of life, which makes me feel so alienated whenever interacting with them, since I am hardly ever using my phone (the computer on the other hand...)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This stories reminds me of the times before tech dominance, when programmers and innovators needed to get permission to do almost anything. Tech people were not allowed to run companies, or even manage people -- you needed MBAs for that.Anything &#34;disruptive&#34; would be immediately shut down and threatened from the dominant industry. Anti-societal violence in video games were under constant protest (like the original Grand Theft Auto, or Mortal Kombat), and don&#39;t even think about trying to start a business like Uber or Spotify.New file formats could be immediately crushed by IP concerns. Even web pages posting content about circumventing current systems or linking to sites like that were targeted. If you weren&#39;t a big player, you didn&#39;t have any way to accept money (besides asking people to mail you checks).While tech is seen as too powerful now, I think it&#39;s at least nice that we no longer have the anxiety that plagued any idea or project in the past. You don&#39;t have to worry about going to jail for programming crypto code, or be unable to find a hosting provider for your website that shows scraped public data."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find people are religious about being git cli purists and only interacting with it in this black box (the terminal). On top of that a lot of people stop learning git after add commit push pull branch and merge so concepts like rebasing and cherry picking are scary.
In this day and age we have state of the art GUI tools that change the game and allow git users to see and interact with the state of a git repository in real time. It&#39;s a great way to demystify things like rebasing and interactive rebasing because they show you what&#39;s happening in a modern UI designed specifically for git.
I often suggest git CLI purists to get something like git kraken and just use it as a visual dashboard. Watch what happens when you run git commands. You can see everyone else&#39;s remote branches and have a much better idea of what&#39;s going on than you can without it.  
I&#39;ve worked on teams that just didn&#39;t rebase at all and I think people are oblivious to the mess they make on branches with their chaotic merge strategies.  
These days, I tend to envision the state of the branch that I want and make that happen. It&#39;s so easy to create a new branch before I do anything that if I think something might go south, I just hard reset to my previous state (a branch I created right before the operation)  
Gitkraken also has an undo button that handles all sorts of scenarios and I rarely click it without getting exactly what I expected."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My mental model of a git repo is basically a bramble bush with labels on it.The bramble stems and branches are the commit history (which may join and well as split, unlike a bramble). The labels are stuck to particular bits of the bramble. Some labels are even stuck to other labels!You can move the labels around, and you can glue extra bits of bramble to the tips of what you have. You can even hack about with the bramble, but this is not recommended. Label moving often happens automatically, e.g. when &#39;growing&#39; a bramble tip.It gets interesting when you compare two brambles (e.g. remote and local repos). You might determine that one bramble is identical to another, just with the labels moved. Or one bramble is the same as the other but with extra stems added. Or both brambles had a common ancestor bramble, but now they both have extra stems. Or perhaps they are completely irreconcilable.Better visualisation tooling would help."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This book changed me. I was an idle eight year old, and my school didn&#39;t give us homework to do. So my father decided to set me homework of his own devising, which on one occasion was reading Flowers for Algernon.I was moved by the story of a man who had little natural ability, straining to make the best of what he had. Then becoming smarter than everyone around him, and then what follows.There&#39;s many things to take from this story. I took away that we should make the best of what we have. To do otherwise is to miss out. Never take what you have for granted. Everything is a blessing; don&#39;t waste it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think too many of us believe that intelligence is valuable, in and of itself.  Instead, I think we should value personal excellence.  That is, making the most of the intelligence you’re given.The arc of intelligence in Flowers of Algernon is the same arc that we’ll all experience over our lifetime.  With old age, we, too, will lose our intelligence.  If we value intelligence, in and of itself, we’ll eventually face a crisis of sorts.  But, if we value making the most of our intelligence, we are resilient.Applying this framework to Charlie, there’s much less to be sad about.  He made the most of the intelligence he was gifted, and that’s what really matters."</p>

I still like to collect them anyway.I think OSCP was the most legitimately useful in tech https://www.offensive-security.com/pwk-oscp/PMP has been useful to take on Project Manager roles, but really PrM roles aren&#39;t all that exciting to begin with. Still helps when you want to run your own projects.I&#39;m currently studying to be a certified parliamentarian from the National Association of Parliamentarians. I&#39;m interested in corporate governance and learning Roberts Rules of Order definitely helps.I&#39;m also a certified farmer (yeah its a thing), I have 5 sailing certs, 3 scuba certs, Wilderness Emergency Medical Responder cert, working on my pilots license, getting my real estate sales license, ham radio operator general class, almost done with my CDL, there&#39;s lots more I&#39;d have to check my notes on.I do want to get a Kubernetes cert done this year. Long term I want to knock out my CPA/CFA exams, but those are a huge commitment so we will see if it pans out.Most of this response hasn&#39;t answered your question at all, because certs really are mostly useless. Still fun to collect.I&#39;d imagine financial certs would be the most useful (CFA in particular).If anyone knows any other fun certs let me know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This will not apply to all companies, but for our hiring decisions certs have an adverse effect. If someone puts many certifications on their resume my expectations are lower and I likely won&#39;t consider them for interviews. It&#39;s a negative signal in my experience. Your time is better spent working on side projects, contributing to open source, writing a blog, etc. I.e. do real-world stuff instead of wasting time on artificial tests that require memorization and exist largely as a revenue stream for certification providers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"MCSE really helped me.In the late 90s, 98 I think, I worked for an internet startup that didn’t end up being huge. We were on Novell and a bit if solaris and had just launched a product that used windows nt and server side activex.I was a college dropout web dev/web master making $50k. They had a hard time hiring devs who knew nt and could design and automate server farms. I learned on the job and did an ok job running it. But they wouldn’t promote me because I was really young and didn’t have a degree.I went to a Microsoft conference and would buy a study book each day and take the test there. I did 3 exams during the conference and took the other three when I got home and with all 6 certs got my Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer (with a stamp of bill gates’ signature).They gave me a raise to $60k (and the college grads went from 50-55). I then got $70k six months later and $80k six months after that as I was the “certified person.”I always thought it was funny that I did the same job before and after the certs. The Networking cert was really useful and I still remember how to do subnets and dns and dhcp and stuff."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anecdata: exercise massively reduces my otherwise constant craving for processed sugars, deep fried and smoked or cured things, alcohol and smokes.I&#39;m not less hungry, but I&#39;m less hungry for nasty stuff, so from my perspective there seems to be a lot of truth in this!Context: I&#39;m natively extremely lazy (phisically, not intellectually), I find any phisical activity a pain an a nuisance, I derive zero pleasure from any kind of sport and phyisical exercise (except hiking and skidiving, but not the phisical effort aspects of them), the release-endorphines-on-effort circuit is 100% broken for me or I just lack the receptors for those endophins... eg. 100%-lazy-cat except not fat because genetically I come from a line of people slim-no-matter-what-we-eat. (Probably more average or atletic people&#39;s bodies just don&#39;t work like mine...)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Although this is my guess based on experience, I think said anti-hunger effect can be had without intense exercise.  I&#39;ve noticed consistently that walking has an anti-hunger effect.  Walking does take more time than running, but it doesn&#39;t really register as stress to the body in the same way that running and other forms of cardio do, meaning a lower cortisol response.  Maybe it&#39;s not as strong an effect as with something like running, but I think it&#39;s worth observing and considering.  In weighing the pros and cons, I think that walking is better in terms of longevity.  Cortisol and stress on joints are things you don&#39;t really want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article mentions that a substance (lactose-phenylalanine) appears
after exercise in several animal studies. There&#39;s a suggestion of a
strong connection of this to reduced appetite. But this isn&#39;t
explained and more importantly there&#39;s no hypothesised mechanism. Why
would it be a metabolic advantage to reduce hunger after exertion?
Maybe it creates a buffer-period. Otherwise, common sense/intuition
would say we feel hungrier after exercise. What gives?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Just want to encourage anyone with kids...I woke my son up this morning and we went outside and looked at these. We didn&#39;t stay outside very long (maybe 5 minutes). But walking him back inside he stopped and said &#34;thanks for waking me up to see this. I really liked it&#34;. Then we both went back to sleep.It may seem trivial but these are great moments to share with your kids/spouse/SO—there is so much in our lives that we can&#39;t see or touch nowadays and it is really meaningful to be able to point up in the sky (even without binocs/assistance) and &#34;see&#34; these planets we talk about but only usually see in pictures.It can be a real spiritual experience."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Is there any way to get alerts on your phone of these events before they happen? It always seem like by the time they make the press and get disseminated on sites like HN it is too late. Was very frustrated by the solar eclipse  a while back because by the time the mainstream press picked up on it, glasses were sold out everywhere. There is too much going on to have to manually research and systematically keep track of every topic of interest. Isn&#39;t that the point of the News, and sites like Reddit/HN?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A surprising experience to me was seeing Saturn through a telescope.  Despite working on PhD in physics at the time and being a lab demonstrator for an undergraduate astronomy course, I looked at it and thought &#34;shit, it&#39;s real!&#34;Though it was a nice enthusiast-level telescope, I think it was just seeing the rings that did it.  So I reckon a cheaper one would have had the same effect."</p>
