Then any otter in a hurry could skim through the left column, find topics they liked, and just read that part from the right.Sorry, it&#39;s not really a fair criticism, and I did like the art style - I just don&#39;t like Kafka much because I had to deal with it in places where it didn&#39;t make much sense."</p>

Officials have not said who put the language in the Senate budget document, only that they learned of it for the first time last week,&#34; the Akron Beacon Journal wrote on June 13.&#34;How did we end up with such a gross lack of accountability? That seems more scandalous than the bad idea itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Fairlawn&#39;s city-run FairlawnGig network has consistently ranked as one of the fastest ISPs in the country, serving residents and businesses in Fairlawn, Akron, and Bath with affordable gigabit Internet services. The slowest service tier delivers 300Mbps symmetrical speeds for $55/month. The municipal network has resulted in more businesses choosing to locate in Fairlawn, and at least 700 jobs can be directly attributed to the network. In recent subscriber surveys, 95 percent of respondents rated FairlawnGig&#39;s service as &#34;very good to excellent,&#34; with some customer testimonials referring to the network as &#34;a life saver&#34; throughout the pandemic.From the article. That is very impressive and a really bad sign for private broadband to be beat out like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand the opposition to another government service on ideological grounds, but the response in Ohio seems merely pro-monopoly and not pro-market. Is there anywhere in the country where state Republicans are looking for ways to increase competition in the broadband market? Everyone uses the internet, I don&#39;t understand why only one party is looking for a solution to this problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I would caution against just jumping into this and trying to be a real ISP if your experience is in software development, sysadmin stuff, or something kind of tech industry adjacent but you&#39;ve never worked for an ISP in a NOC environment, as a junior network engineer or similar for somebody else&#39;s medium to large sized ISP. There&#39;s a lot of missteps that can be made without experience.In general I would recommend thinking of starting a small ISP as a depth and breadth of knowledge base you need to develop, similar to how an apprentice electrician is expected to work under some more senior/experienced persons in their field for a number of years before being able to operate independently.I do not want to discourage anyone but I&#39;ve seen a myriad of &#39;oh my god why did they do that&#39; small WISPs with anywhere from 50 to 1500 customers. Going down the wrong network architecture/topology/business plan path can be very costly later on if you&#39;re 100% learning as you go.Overall I think a site like this is a great idea, but the sheer scope of things that would need to be written down in a wiki-like format for everything to start your own ISP, and what systems/subsystems/technologies you will want to be familiar with, could fill thousands of pages if printed in book form. It&#39;s a gargantuan task to make a website that has everything needed to start an ISP from scratch, assuming the reader hasn&#39;t been involved in somebody else&#39;s ISP operations first."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I thought this was going to be a game reliving my experience as the System Administrator at our local dialup internet service back in the 1990s. I wasn&#39;t there at the start, but I ran the thing for 2 years, serving about 200 customers. I wrote the &#34;Internet Installation&#34; floppy disks that people used to install networking on Windows 3.1, and configured dialup icons on their desktop. I was the ONLY technical support they had.I learned that people don&#39;t use the same words we technical folks do, so if you get a support call and ask &#34;Have you installed anything?&#34; the answer they give is no, but, if you ask &#34;do you have any new programs or stuff&#34;, the answer will be yes.Why? - My theory is that they either didn&#39;t know what &#34;installing&#34; was (nobody opened up the computer to put something in), or they themselves didn&#39;t do it.You have to have a very strong ability to route around the person on the other end of the phones preconceptions of the world and get the right answers anyway.If you&#39;re going to be an ISP, you&#39;re going to be on call 24/7/365, and you&#39;re going to see weird shit. More than once we had to deal with people wanting to post adult content for money.... and this was back in the days of dialup.  Who knows what the heck the folks are doing today."</p>

Very, very happy with this; works smoothly, lets us use the latest Python and Qt versions and lets us make professional-looking installers that we can distribute."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nuitka is the best python compiler I&#39;ve used. I have tried at least three others and none worked as good as nuitka. And I&#39;m talking about complicated dependencies such as pytorch, selenium, tesseract - that type of stuff."</p>

An oracle is basically a server that reports the outcome of an event. And servers can be attacked in ways that systems like Ethereum can&#39;t.So a lot of the hype around Ethereum and its &#34;smart contracts&#34; is really people just misunderstanding the security model.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is definitely an example where &#34;character&#34; was the wrong word. We start out OK with bytes being distinct, but by the end we&#39;re talking about how a character is made out of several characters. If we think in terms of code points (Rust&#39;s native char type actually provides here a slightly different thing, a Unicode Scalar Value, which certain types of code point are not, but close enough) clearly a code point isn&#39;t made out of several code points, so we needed a different word.I like squiggle, if you&#39;re a text rendering engine you might want to use &#34;glyph&#34; although you might already need that word for something else. But try to avoid character because that word already has far too many meanings, most of which won&#39;t be what you wanted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminds me of a blog post that I can no longer remember that discusses how Chinese is a lot of arranging several related kanji into a single character to express a new idea (please link it if you can find it).I would love to see unicode characters to allow for arbitrary combinations beyond those defined using just ZWJ to allow more flexibility (e.g. blizzard could be created by adding like &#34;slowflake x 5&#34; which creates a single character with five snowflakes, without having to create an entirely new character representing blizzard from snowflake + ZWJ + snowflake).As an aside, my favorite ZWJ magic is black flag + ZWJ + skull and crossbones = pirate flag.Also see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blissymbols for more symbol language fun."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I see a lot of people in the comments describe triplebyte as a “market leader” and discuss how good they are. I can’t believe how gullible everyone is especially on a startup forum. Let me spell it out to y’all, nobody pivots and changes their entire business model if they are crushing it. So the implication is that triplebyte are not crushing it. So, this probably has gone the same way as lots of other tech startups. They’ve raised a bunch of money spent it all on ads , distorted the market for a while (usually just the advertising market) and now are on the way out. No matter what fluff or spin they put on it, that’s what’s happening."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"By far the most exciting thing about this announcement is this feature: &#34;Detailed information on what a recruiter did with your application.&#34;I&#39;ve been wishing for something like this for years. Especially for early-career engineers or people from non-traditional backgrounds, this is insanely valuable because it helps you to know avoid wasting time on applications that will never go anywhere; avoid typing in your resume, line by line, into another form after already submitting your pdf. Avoid writing a cover letter to a job that&#39;s already been filled. Avoid applying to a posting that&#39;s really just out there for a company to &#34;gauge&#34; interest, not for filling a real role.If an application is rejected, fine. But getting a follow-up request 7 months after submitting a resume into a black hole is ridiculous, and I think any system that decreases the information asymmetry between the applicant and the employer that allows people to intelligently approach their career search is going to be tapping into something truly valuable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A benefit of Triplebyte to big enterprises not mentioned in Triplebyte’s discussion here: acting as engineering assessment proxy for engineering hiring managers stuck with pathologically risk averse enterprise HR departments.Often enterprise HR is paranoid of honestly evaluating anyone for anything, to the point that many HR teams tell one another and engineering hiring managers that it’s “illegal” to assess candidate abilities on the way in the door, at all.If you think about joining a dev team where no one checked if any candidate could FizzBuzz, you can imagine the workplace environment that can end up with.Triplebyte is able to provide engineering managers with a stack of pre-vetted resumes so an enterprise can interview by its lowest common denominator HR policies, while still having a prayer a team will at least be made of candidates who can code.The value of this to an enterprise stuck in this position is hard to overstate.Hopefully along with expanding the talent pool per this post, Triplebyte can figure out a way to get well paid for this ability to help land actual coders on actual dev teams despite enterprise HR.The need for this is huge.// I see a comment below from a Triplebyte PM about score matching: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27542621 … That would be slick: land candidates that genuinely raise the bar, but aren’t so far ahead as to be speaking a foreign language to the team.  Of course, this would require also assessing the target team, and oops, we’re right back up against that HR policy…"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a former felon, I&#39;ve learned first-hand the fallout from being named in crime stories. The AP has it right in that a lot of it isn&#39;t realized by readers or society.Upon being charged with crimes, I had to make my way through the court system. As a consequence of my actions, the courts punished me. Once I had showed that I was not a serial offender but instead someone who had moments of weakness, lost identity, and subsequently poor judgement, the courts let me go.Once I paid my debts to the court — figuratively and literally — I was free to live my life without the government watching over my shoulder or further being a burden to my future. My dealings with them had a fixed amount of time attached to it. Once that time limit expired, I was free.Society was far less kind, and hardly as forgiving.No, I&#39;m not talking about employment — I am and always have been very gainfully employed. No, I&#39;m not talking about renting an apartment, or getting a loan, or opening a bank account.I&#39;m talking about new acquaintances.As we have seen over the past 5 years, in the minds of many a website is a single source of truth. To a large number of people, simply having a website is enough to give confidence to the reader that what&#39;s written is an absolute and authoritative source. It is only correct, completely unbiased, and contains 100% factual sourcing.When there&#39;s a webpage with dirty laundry on it, it rarely gets updated to say &#34;later, Judge Judy found suspect to be of good character, and they&#39;ve since paid their debts to the court.&#34;No, it just has absolute worst moment on repeat, leaving out all the context and any depth that goes into a legal proceeding. It&#39;s entirely the worst part of a nightmare.I&#39;ve personally had a number of articles written in addition to a 15-second segment on the local evening news. Getting a call from a partner who is sobbing, &#34;my parents Googled you.&#34; is absolutely stomach-turning. Knowing my little sister had to go to school the day after the clip played next day was something I am more ashamed about than I can put into words. Thankfully she was too young for a cell phone and social media was still in its infancy.My partner very privy to my dirty laundry. When they first learned of it they were actually surprised. It didn&#39;t bother them though as they knew who I was as a person and that my days of making mistakes were behind me.Their parents were less understanding. They didn&#39;t know me like my partner did. They just saw a series of mugshots and some local news articles from mistakes I made as a young adult.It wasn&#39;t the first and it wasn&#39;t the last time it happened, either.I have always been transparent and forthcoming with mistakes I&#39;ve made. I&#39;m just as candid with friends as I am here on HN. Hell, my profile even says I&#39;m a former felon!One point does not make a pattern. Many minor crime stories are just a point. That point, on the internet, is a scar, and those who come across them out of curiosity, suspicion, or nosiness re-open the wound.Since my bad decisions, I&#39;ve had success in contacting the authors of the articles highlighting my worst-moment-kept-in-a-non-governmental-database asking if they&#39;d consider removing their article. I mentioned I had completed probation and was doing something with my life, and that the article was hurting me and my relationships with people. They obliged.Edit: This isn&#39;t the first time I&#39;ve mentioned I&#39;m a felon in a comment. I&#39;ve received a surprising number of emails over the years from other felons (or felons-to-be) asking &#34;how did you reintegrate into society?&#34; or &#34;do you have any advice?&#34;. If you&#39;re one of them and reading this, you&#39;re more than welcome drop me an email."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an interesting (and confounding) topic.On a corollary note, Austin recently experienced a mass shooting in a popular Downton area. 14 people were shot. One died. Another is paralyzed. The local paper of record explicitly declined to publish the description of the suspects as released by the police so as to not &#34;perpetuate stereotypes&#34;. The question I have is, what is the obligation to report the facts of a story, regardless of consequence? My belief is that reporting should report all the facts and let the chips fall where they may. But I also understand that reasonable people can disagree. (In this case, it seemed unreasonable to me as one shooter was still at large.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My interpretation of their intent is they will no longer name suspects in &#34;florida man&#34; style stories. Like, really, nobody needs to know that it was specifically 30 year old resident Pimble McGringleberry who lives on 1234 S Main St, nowheresville, arkansas was the lady who was throwing office chairs off the top of the target parking structure.The person is presumably dealing with the aftermath of whatever caused them to be in the news in the first place. There is no reason to give internet users a rope, or 6 lines by the hand of the person to hang them with.I think this is a positive move and hope to see more of it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had really bad nausea and pain, went to my doctor, who said I likely had a kidney stone, and the next step was to get an MRI. I was between jobs with no insurance and few funds, so I asked what it cost. The doctor had someone in his office call the hospital and got a quote for $1,500. I got the MRI knowing only that.A month later I got a bill for $3,500. I drove out to the hospital (2 hours) to ask wtf. They didn&#39;t help at all, wouldn&#39;t budge.So I went home and wrote them a check for $1,500, marked as paid in full, with a cover letter explaining my side of it. It worked. They cashed the check and I never heard another word. I&#39;ve done further business there with no problem. It&#39;s well worth pushing back."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I did some research into this for my current employer and the challenges are pretty well laid out here: the penalties are minimal ($300 / day or $~110,000 per year), the data is kept in the invoice or billing systems, which are complex, and the hospitals do not want to share the truly groundbreaking data, which is the per-provider costs.In addition, when you Google for competitors you don&#39;t find a lot of them, but once you start looking at hospital websites you find that quite a few of them (about 50% of the ones I looked at) have at least a partial solution, often provided by their analytics company as an add-on or footnote.It does not appear there is a great market opportunity here unless the penalties increase (which the CMS has talked about vaguely, but hospitals are already asking for relief until after the pandemic)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife is trying to work on price transparency at her practice by offering bundled rates for the surgery she does. She has worked with all the various providers - anasthesia, pathology, the hospital etc to come up with a cash rate that she publishes on her website for the surgery. Most of the parties are very open to it but also extremely worried about outliers. Patients that end up costing 10x what was expected due to complications.
For her this is a minuscule risk, but in her negotiations it has been their main worry."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting. I thought I recalled talking about this on HN previously:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10355868    _-__--- on Oct 8, 2015 | parent | favorite | on: Verizon revives &#34;zombie cookie&#34; device tracking on...

    Tor as an OS-level feature may not spark the best reaction. It&#39;s been given a bad name (&#34;deep web,&#34; silk road, etc) in mass media and many people don&#39;t understand it enough to think of it as anything other than bad.
    I think that it&#39;d be cool to have, but I don&#39;t think that Apple would ever implement it.

        jameshart on Oct 8, 2015 [–]

        Agree, it&#39;s phenomenally unlikely, but then again there is a part of me which could actually imagine Apple doing something like it. They wouldn&#39;t use Tor, of course, they&#39;d build a proprietary equivalent, and then come out on a black stage to &#39;introduce Apple Undercover, a revolutionary enhancement to personal network privacy and security&#39;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Props to Apple for the design of this service. It doesn&#39;t hit all the privacy targets that long-time personal VPN users might be looking for, and it doesn&#39;t get into the game of trying to circumvent region locked content*, but otherwise it&#39;s likely to be a solid privacy improvement for almost all users in a careful and deliberate way.I use a VPN for other reasons (downloading Ubuntu ISOs mostly) but I&#39;ll probably turn this on and leave it running on all my devices because of how transparent it appears to be. I trust Apple&#39;s onion-routing design more than I trust my VPN provider not to log things.* I&#39;m actually glad they don&#39;t try to get around region locks. I consume a lot of BBC content and live in the UK. I&#39;m constantly struggling with my VPNs (with UK endpoints) being blocked because others outside the UK could be using them. It would be nice if the BBC didn&#39;t block like this, but UK residents do typically pay for the content whereas those outside the UK are unable to."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been trying to point this out to people but YouTube personalities have a louder voice than anyone else so you end up with bad information.Props to Apple for offering an (albeit low entropy) onion router on their own infrastructure.  I can&#39;t imagine this is going to win them any friends in government circles but it&#39;s definitely a step in the right direction.I&#39;d also really like to see Apple come clean about the iCloud backup encryption debacle.  A lot of people are trusting it to be something it&#39;s not and it should really be clarified on-device what it is and is not before opting in."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m the author of #6 on the same list.  It&#39;s definitely interesting to see it has been used thousands of times on GitHub, and who knows how many more in proprietary code.  I don&#39;t think it&#39;s buggy, but I now think it could definitely be improved.I think this shows an example of a big problem with StackOverflow compared to its initial vision.  I remember listening to Jeff and Joel&#39;s podcast, and hearing the vision of applying the Wikipedia model to tech Q&amp;A.  The idea was that answers would continue to improve over time.For the most part, they don&#39;t.  I&#39;m not quite sure if it&#39;s an issue of incentives or culture.  Probably some of both.  I think that having a person&#39;s name attached to their answer, along with a visible score really gives a sense of ownership.  As a result, other people don&#39;t feel enabled to come along and tweak the answer to improve it.Then, once an answer is listed at the top, it is given more opportunity for upvotes, so other improved answers don&#39;t seem to bubble up.  This is a larger issue with most websites that sort by ratings.  Generally they sort items based on the total number of votes, including hacker news itself.  Instead, to measure the quality of an item, we should look at the number of votes, divided by the number of views.  It may be tough to measure the number of views of an item, but we should be able to get a rough estimate based on the position on a page, for example.If the top comment on a HN discussion is getting 100 views in a minute and 10 upvotes, but the 10th comment down gets 20 views and 5 upvotes, the 10th comment is likely a better quality comment.  It should be sorted above the top ranked comment!  There would still need to be some smoothing and promotion of new comments to get them enough views to measure their quality as well.Such a policy on StackOverflow would also help newer, but better answers sort to the top."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"At the time when digital cellular was first designed, the main objective was to design sufficiently strong authentication to stem the rampant theft of service then occurring on the analog cellular systems. In the US this was estimated at roughly $2 billion/annum.Encrypting traffic for privacy purposes was less important. Prior analog cellular telephony systems were unencrypted, as were analog and digital wireline services. Thus, the privacy cryptography was intended to be strong enough to make it a little more inconvenient/expensive to eavesdrop on digital cellular than it was on analog cellular or wireline services without significantly impeding law enforcement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All of the GSM algorithms were weak, and deliberately so. It is well known that the French wanted it that way, while the German side wanted a bit more safety on account of the ongoing Cold War. So compromises like the infamous A5 algorithm were created whose security was mainly based on the algorithm itself being kept a secret - the cardinal sin of cryptography."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a European, living in Europe, developing software. Lack of imagination is not our problem. It&#39;s so good that we supply our best talent to the US where it does extremely well revolutionizing AI, designing hardware for Apple, developing games, stream online music, etc. E.g. Amazon&#39;s CTO is Dutch. Basically the person that has been running AWS. The people and the education system are fine.Europe does have a few issues that make it unnecessarily hard to build successful startups here. People do start companies here but more often than not success is followed by US investment and before you know it the company is headquartered in the US. There are many reasons for that but a big one has to be that raising similar amounts of money in Europe is super hard. Investors drag their heels, founders have to take on more risk, etc.A second reason is simply that the US as a big homogeneous market is a nice one to tackle for European companies as well. And often that means having a (big) presence in the US. The EU is basically many markets unified by really complex rules, bureaucracy, etc. There is free traffic of people but companies have a harder time dealing with local variations in legislation, hurdles for billing and taxation (e.g. VAT), banking, bureaucracy, etc.That&#39;s much less of a thing in the US (though it is a bit of a thing there too between states). And that&#39;s before you consider language and cultural differences. Simply put, the same company in the EU will have a very hard time growing compared to doing that in the US. Being successful in the US market, means having the deep pockets to go international. Doing the same from a small country means you barely have enough to expand to another small country. Going international is hard work. Not something you do with your MVP. It&#39;s not very scalable either: you need to worry about cultural differences, bureaucracy, localization, understanding the local market, ramping up sales, marketing, etc. Especially with SAAS companies this is super expensive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I take offense at such massive overgeneralizations as &#34;Europe lacks imagination.&#34;What it lacks is freely flowing funding such that risky enterprises can be funded even if 1 out of ten or 1 out of hundred actually are successful. This kills business models which cannot show any profit whatsoever, and a large portion of the remainder are killed by data regulations forbidding &#34;alternate paths of monetization&#34; (to put it charitably.)Rather, a problem is that once a European project becomes successful enough, it soon becomes an American project, either by acquisition or by moving to where the investment money is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This problem will never get fixed. The author forgot to mention in depth the main reason why EU isn&#39;t even in the game: culture.In order to be innovative and compete, we need very flexible working laws, people with a big growth mindset, a less relaxing lifestyle and AMBITIOUS people.A lot of third world countries are years ahead of the whole EU continent in that aspect. I say this because I live in Europe for the quality of life, come from a third world country, and I see how kids and adults are spoiled here. Much of what they have was just given to them. At least for the strong countries in west EU, lifestyle is very relaxed and any ambitious is frowned upon, it is extremely demotivating, not to mention bureaucracy. Corporations and regulations will just drive your small company out of the market no matter what.I find for me more likely to save some money, move to my country and create my own business and sell in Europe. People here are too lazy to compete in the fast world we live in, there in my country there is so many skilled people, so little capital, here is the reverse. Good amount of capital and foreigners working in tech. For instance, I live in Berlin and almost all the &#34;working people&#34; from tech companies here are foreigners. Germans are generally the executives and/or management. It is quite rare to find a german software developer on Startups.I personally think(my opinion, not the ultimate truth)... that Europe is definitely a very interesting market for companies to come here and sell their stuff, but not to make it.Instead I think Europe should focus on its strengths, which is healthy market regulations, creating a good playing field for companies from above, rather on its weaknesses. It should also figure out a way to keep part of the profits inside the continent to benefits its inhabitants.More important than competing is to know where and when to compete."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My first job out of college was at a magazine. The two editors there were in their 70s and notorious for being bullies (although for what it&#39;s worth, one of them mellowed out after their editorial assistant committed suicide). There wasn&#39;t a day when I wasn&#39;t yelled at repeatedly, and the taint seeped down, with everybody lower down the rung yelling at anybody below them.  It was easily the most toxic environment that I&#39;ve ever experienced, and I&#39;ve worked in academia! People were breaking down in tears all the time. Ex editorial assistants would send in letters written in crayon from insane asylums. The funny thing was that instead of resenting their tormenters, most people adopted a very protective stance towards these editors, as if they were children. Sadly, the impression that I got was that a lot of other publications had similar problems--smart but extremely neurotic bosses who regularly demeaned their employees. This was in 2000, around the time when &#34;The Devil Wears Prada&#34; came out. The one upside was that it permanently scared me out of publishing, which turned out to be an excellent career choice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m very sorry to hear that Matthew Butterick had some bad experiences.  He&#39;s been a brilliant and energetic contributor to the Racket community.  Clearly, something went wrong.For what it&#39;s worth (looking at some of the comments from people not very familiar), my own experiences with Matthias Felleisen have been positive.  (I started contributing to what was then called PLT Scheme around 2000, have had lunch with him twice, and a few times over the years have had some mutually-candid conversations with him, about concerns affecting the project/community.)While I might describe Matthias as a freethinker and straight-talker, everything I&#39;m aware of that he&#39;s said or done in the two decades I&#39;ve been around seems to come from altruistic intentions.I know Matthias cares about the community.  (He was very welcoming when I started, and we&#39;ve discussed it over the years.)  I think he&#39;ll want to personally investigate and consider what happened that resulted in alienating Matthew B., and try to correct any problems that he can.This isn&#39;t just about Matthew B., but also about constantly seeing how we can be the best community for everyone.  That&#39;s not a solved problem, and I suggest it&#39;s best approached as an ongoing process of humility, honesty, and support -- everyone feeling safe to raise concerns/problems, and everyone feeling safe to examine how we can improve."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve followed Racket and the OP&#39;s work from a distance for some time.  This post rang bells for me, based on similar interactions with a few bad apples over about twenty years in the field of physics.I applaud the poster for the clear and measured language of his post,  for his bravery in calling out this kind of behavior, and for taking steps needed to remove himself from the situation. I hope the Racket community takes steps to eliminate the problem at the root."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I really like the idea of this. Some thoughts:1. It&#39;s difficult for me to tell which spaces are open for play and which aren&#39;t -- the border is hard to parse. (Is that this cell&#39;s border, or the adjacent cell?) This isn&#39;t really an issue during placement, but it is an issue for signalling that a cell has been &#34;captured,&#34; which is hard for me to tell.2. Hexagon grid is absolutely the right call. :)3. The influence mechanic is very opaque: it&#39;s very hard for me to predict what will happen next, which makes me feel like I&#39;m playing a little &#34;intuitively,&#34; instead of planning out my moves with intention. Some way to see &#34;this is the current state and this will be the next state&#34; would help with that, but I think as long as influence is a continuous quantity it&#39;s going to be difficult to visualize and predict.4. Making the board itself hexagonal (ala Hexxagon) will give you an odd number of cells, preventing ties. Might also be nice to smooth out cell-strength discontinuities around the top and bottom edges.5. Balancing the first-player advantage by making the first move a &#34;weak stone&#34; was very confusing to me, because an adjacent move by player two will &#34;capture&#34; my initial stone with a single stone of theirs. I didn&#39;t understand this until I saw your comment about it here. I think the pie rule would work well in this game, but it&#39;s hard for me to reason about since edge moves are offensively weaker but defensively stronger... I&#39;m not sure how well it would shake out, if you haven&#39;t tried it already.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_rule"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, a couple of comments.First, I understand you were trying to make an approachable presentation, but the rules as you presented them are incomplete (how does influence work? what is a &#34;threshold&#34;?), and I think for a board game that&#39;s a big mistake. What makes games like those cool is that rules work deterministically, even for games that involve randomness. Having to guess the rules is something I actively dislike.Second, have you considered a square board instead of an hexagonal one? Using Go terminology, it feels like the groups have too many liberties.Other than that, the game is pretty good. I feel it captures the attack/defense territory-based gameplay of Go perfectly.Have you tried to measure the first move advantage?edit: Wow this thing is a drug. Hard AI is deceptively good, I managed to tie a game 25-25 after several attempts, but you definitely can&#39;t afford to be sloppy if you want to stay afloat!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At the end of every turn, each tile influences its neighbors and imparts some of its color. Tiles with a dark border can no longer be selected.The rules are simple but it takes awhile to master. What is your best score against the Hard AI? I got 27 (me on green) – 23 (AI).Would you want to see some sort of match-making to play against others online?See demo gameplay or view the source code at https://github.com/jawslouis/Influence-Game"</p>

I pick ticks off of them now and then and patch up their share of bruises).But fundamentally, what I want most is to be somewhere my kids can ride bikes or walk alone to school, to friends, to the shop, etc. from the age of 7 or so. As best I can tell that pretty much means the Netherlands, parts of Denmark, or perhaps Japan (more for transit than cycling).Children can&#39;t drive, which means unless you&#39;re lucky enough to live very close to your friends, and ideally on the same side of the street, your home is effectively your prison in the US and Canada.And yes, I suppose you _can_ let your kid ride a bike to school alone in the US at 7, but you would be risking arrest, and death. It&#39;s often forgotten that drivers are, by far, the leading killers of children. Far more than people with guns. I was an avid cyclist in the US for the first 30 years of my life and I still have a bruised rib and too many memories of very, very close calls with death.NotJustBikes, who moved from Canadian suburbia to the Netherlands, explores this in more depth at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ul_xzyCDT98"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the problem &#34;de-risking&#34; childhood is only an instance of the bigger problem of what Roger Scruton calls &#34;Risk De-aggregation&#34;. Risk Deaggregation is taking a single point of risk (and its associated metric), and optimizing to reduce that risk as if it exists in isolation from other risks. I.e. Risk occurs in aggregate, not as individual threats. Risk deaggregation happens everywhere from Climate Change policy, to Covid, to children.I think this type of risk deaggregation arises from the fact that in a sufficiently complicated space (climate, economy, children, etc) there are really only two heuristics:1) Ignore all but a manageable number of variables and optimize for them2) Recognize a larger number of necessary variable, acknowledge there is no optimal solution, and balance the trade offs between those variables. [0]Heuristic 1 is the easiest, requires no nuance, and seems the type of thing our political and media class love to latch onto.

The challenge is when the adults inject a ridiculous level of risk to something that should be a learning experience. For example, allowing police to arrest and charge a child for bad behavior at school (i.e. won&#39;t obey the teacher, outbursts - not for actually criminally violent behavior). Another is lifetime academic and other records. When risk is too high, learning stops and risk avoidance takes over."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"During my time as a research assistant / grad student there was a remarkable shift in the atmosphere. It started with massive layoffs of research staff, linked to the more general savings of our government.More esoteric professors were replaced with more efficient manuscript machines submitting manuscripts to more prestigious journals. Soon after the layoffs, the university&#39;s innovation and commercialization services became extremely active. Recurring events at lecture rooms where we were blasted on how our work is IP of the university, how the university takes only 50% cut if something works, how cool is it to be a researcher who commercializes ideas in comparison to being one those dusty farts in the science cave studying one protein or butterfly for their entire life.Being a believer and practitioner of open source, I once asked how does this all this apply to computational science. Basically all algorithms and tools should be passed through them to see if they have commercial potential - if no, we can go ahead. Found it appalling and interfering with my intellectual freedom, one of the many events that made me pursue life outside the academia."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wouldn&#39;t be the first time universities have acted like patent trolls. For example, you know the filament-style LED lightbulbs that are really popular these days? The University of California has been going after a bunch of retailers with patent lawsuits for selling them, complete with PR push about how it was their invention that had been stolen from them. I looked at what they&#39;d actually invented and patented at the time, and it was nothing like those filament LED lightbulbs - it was a old-fashioned resin-dome LED that replaced the metal anvil the die is usually mounted on with a TIR reflector, supposedly to improve efficiency. This was completely impractical, pointless and had no market value - the metal anvil is really useful both as mechanical support and a heatsink, you&#39;d almost certainly lose any possible efficiency gain that resulted from capturing more of the rear light output due to higher temperatures. However, they&#39;d worded their patent claims in such a broad way that they could cover nearly anything, and the university used this to file for patents that were actually similar to the LED filaments after they&#39;d already been invented by someone else and put on the market but backdated in validity to their original patent.This isn&#39;t just a software-related problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Grants from the NSF, etc. should only be granted on the condition that the research produced enters the public domain. Taxpayer dollars should not go towards producing research the public cannot benefit from without paying to license a patent or access a $100 journal article."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Starting conditions (where one was born, levels of wealth and opportunity there, one&#39;s parents&#39; education and jobs) are shockingly predictive about an individual&#39;s future. Hard work leading to social mobility has always been the exception, not the rule. Most will not beat the odds since if they did, those wouldn&#39;t BE the odds. A lot of us are just so deluded by survivorship bias borne of listening only to success stories, but it seems more and more people are seeing through the illusion. In my opinion, that&#39;s a good thing, as recognizing the true state of things is the first step to improving them, and this combination of consciousness and lived experience can prove to be potent immunization against bad faith actors who want to maintain the illusion of widespread social mobility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working hard but doing so for someone else can often not lead to significant gains.  Many services like Uber or InstaCart or even McDonalds or Amazon Warehouse or Walmart or Retail Sales or call center, you can work hard but there is no where to progress to.  Your rewards are capped.You need to find a way to work hard such that your rewards are not capped artificially.  Startups were you get equity.  Large companies where you can progress to high salaries if you are able to rise.  Starting your own business and being competent at it.  Working on commissions in an area where the commissions can be large -- true sales, or real estate.  Being a professional, e.g. doctor, accountant, lawyer, has traditionally had high wages and you often run your own business.You need to work hard in a way that has unlimited rewards, or at least high rewards possible, and that aligns with your aptitudes.You need to not work hard at a minimum wage job if you can get something better.And if you are stuck in a minimum wage job, maybe you can organize with your fellow employees to demand better wages and benefits?  This is also another way of working hard in order to get more for yourself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As trite as it sounds, &#34;Success = Hard Work + Opportunity&#34; is still the default equation that makes the most sense to me.And while people from all strata of life work very hard, opportunities are obviously and incredibly unequally distributed (and perhaps becoming more so?).If you were born middle-class in US/Canada 20 - 40 years ago, your access to opportunities to improve your station were/are immense. Layer on your ethnicity, if your parents were in a stable relationship, if you grew up in relative safety, if you had a decent education... hard not to think that your opportunities were 10x or 100x someone who had none of those things.But you also need to define &#34;success&#34;. To this crowd, is &#34;success&#34; merely &#34;leading a better life&#34;? I&#39;d argue most of us already have this as our default reality. I.e. the gradual reward for working hard via promotions and relative safety of career.I remember after my startup was acquired, a few people would say to me (well-meaning obviously) &#34;wow it&#39;s great your hard work paid off!&#34;. And I just said something like &#34;thanks, ya, lots of people work a lot harder than me but didn&#39;t get the same outcome - so there was a lot of luck involved too!&#34; etc. Even thinking of my own immigrant grandparents - what THEY did was HARD.I think about those exchanges often. Tech -- at this particular moment in history -- disproportionately rewards &#34;hard work&#34; (which many of us find fun anyways). Or perhaps better to say that Tech provides access to the right kind of opportunities that allow for a DEFAULT &#34;life gets better&#34;, with the possibilities of &#34;life suddenly gets 100x better&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m always super intrigued by the reMarkable 2, but I think it&#39;s because it paints an image of the type of person I think it&#39;d be cool to be, someone who can just write down notes and draw stuff with a really cool, slim device. Someone who carries around moleskines and uses them, instead of just buying so many of them in different shapes and leaving them in a drawer packed to the brim with notebooks.The problem keeps coming back to the fact that I&#39;m absolutely not the type of person who wants to carry that thing around everywhere and who likes or is good at hand writing or drawing. I realize I won&#39;t base all my life and processes around this one device that is also supposedly hard to get info off of easily into things like OneNote. If I was somewhere without a computer, then I wouldn&#39;t be carrying this big tablet on me. I&#39;ve bought enough tablets and laptops with writable screens and MS surfaces over the years to know that I still never drew or took notes with the pen, but I still keep buying them hoping I will.The thing is still so cool and I want it, but maybe I&#39;ll wait for version 3 or 4 and extra disposable income that will go to waste on it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought a Remarkable 2 a month or two ago because I wanted a cool hackable e-ink Linux computer. But instead I immediately started using it as an e-book and document reader and note-taking pad, and nothing else. And, so far at least, that&#39;s perfect.The screen is beautiful (a bit gray, but the black is really black so the contrast is still good), the device is thin and reasonably light, I only have to charge it once a week or so, and there are absolutely no distractions. I have even rediscovered the visceral pleasantness of writing by hand.I especially like that it&#39;s *not* running Android (which I dislike more with each release). The biggest drawbacks, to me, are the fragile pen nibs and the inability to just SCP a PDF or EPUB to the device and have it work (their sync software works but isn&#39;t great)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought the Onyx Boox Note Air some months ago, and I must say that I&#39;m really happy with it. Screen refresh is good, there&#39;s almost no ghosting in default mode, and refresh rates are acceptable.There are only two downsides about it: The vendor does not respect FOSS and does not publish the sources for their modified Linux kernel, and the device constantly phones home to China. However, the device can be rooted easily [1], and you can install a firewall to stop the preloaded apps from phoning home (verified it with Wireshark).[1]: https://blog.tho.ms/hacks/2021/03/27/hacking-onyx-boox-note-..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a great example of why Google FLoC is not incentive-compatible with consumers nor business owners.  Amazon (like Facebook) has a monopoly on ad targeting on their target properties—- properties they own.  Google FLoC is Google’s attempt to (further) monopolize their target properties—- the web at large, which Google does NOT own.  Google does NOT pay to service the traffic they generate.  Google does NOT pay to fulfill consumer orders.  Google wants you to think they’re acting in your best interests with FLoC.  Maybe if Google offered more free GCloud credits and subsidized conversions they generate, that would be a different story. (Maybe Google could start by paying Wikipedia for some of the traffic they generate).  But Sundar wants you to think FLoC is about privacy, because Sundar has said time and time again that Google has lost people’s trust."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, the bias in this article is unbelievably blatant:&#34;[Amazon is] preventing Google’s tracking system FLoC — or Federated Learning of Cohorts — from gathering valuable data reflecting the products people research in Amazon’s vast e-commerce universe&#34;Compare with, e.g.:&#34;Amazon is taking steps to protect its user&#39;s privacy by blocking Google&#39;s heavy-handed overreach in leveraging its Chrome browser to spy on user&#39;s personal shopping habits and sell that information to other retailers&#34;.(Note: I&#39;m not saying my rewrite is unbiased.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To me this editor gets it right in the sense that we don’t need to get rid of code as the “nocode” movement is trying. Instead we need to make coding more enjoyable and figure out ways to make it more interactive.One specific thing Utopia addresses to me is the need for the code and the actual thing to be treated more as one single interactable component and not two separate things.Instead we&#39;re treating the thing as a one-way compile step. There&#39;s no way to sync the DevTools in-memory changes we make to the DOM with the actual code.The fact that Utopia allows the two things to be treated as one is a huge step towards making webdev more enjoyable.And they’re following good steps… SwiftUI’s editor is very similar in this regard. Using the code as the main thing but having all kinds of interactable components around it that make writing code simpler with cool visual autocomplete widgets &amp; visual aids.Before with direct DOM changes building something like this was impossible but now with the React paradigm is seems natural to have this sync between code and visuals.Kudos to the team for pulling this off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Product designer here. I just spent the past few hours fine-tuning some visual details in our Figma component library. Now I need to file tickets for each change and work with our frontend developers to make sure the updated Figma details get properly mapped over to React.I&#39;ve grown numb to the friction, but I think this Utopia demo just reset my pain tolerance. Going back to manually mapping designs from Figma mocks to React components feels so dated. Almost like those PSD2HTML websites of the early 2000s.The market absolutely needs a product like this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After five minutes of playing with it and failing to find it... where is the panel of components to drag and drop into the tree? Seems like the most basic functionality in an editor like this. Something that VB had in 1993. This should be something that is obvious and visible on a first glance.Another issue I have with the UI is that a lot of elements are greyed out even though they remain interactive. The convention is that UI elements that are greyed out are not interactive due to the current state of the application (wrong mode, unmatched requisites etc). This application seems to violate that and I&#39;m still baffled as to what greying out of UI elements means in in this app. If they aren&#39;t disabled why are they greyed out?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can’t help but see some kind of special interest or agenda whenever I hear a news story now. You have to ask why they chose to report this, why they slant things one way or another with their choice of wording and emphasis. What is the aspect of this story that is too politically incorrect or unfashionable to be included?I have never researched a topic deeply and found that the media had been covering that topic accurately, ever. The harsh truth is that generally speaking the news is almost completely useless. You might as well just never watch it.I think the very final nail in the coffin was the leaked recordings of the CNN technical director basically admitting what everyone pretty much already knew. That they spread misinformation deliberately, only give interviews to subject experts who they know will say what CNN prefers them to say and ultimately design everything they put on the screen to get hooks inside your limbic system and keep your eyes glued. The main tool they use to do this is the emotion of fear, and it was for this reason and no other that they created a COVID death counter. And every single one of those points is explicitly, literally and plainly stated on video by a very senior employee of CNN for all to see. so I’m afraid that I can’t be brushed aside as a Russian bot. It’s right there on YouTube.And what about all the other media companies? This CNN leak, which is maybe the very embodiment of a scoop, was not on the front page of any major newspaper or news website. It was not elaborated on. It was basically not reported."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone else burnt out from the outrage cycle in recent times?I don’t know if it’s selfish but I just don’t have the energy anymore to care about what bad thing person X or company Y did this week.My current philosophy is to treat news/Reddit/social media like email in the old days.That is: log on to a desktop computer once a week and read the highlights. It is not accessible except through the desktop computer.The funny thing is this approach is completely opposite the “stories” trend in social media. It makes you really aware of the FOMO-by-design pattern these days."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this post has a lot of hindsight bias in it. People are going to get things wrong sometimes. I think there&#39;s a lot of things to legit criticize mainstream media for, but not having 100% accurate crystal ball isn&#39;t one of them.If the thesis of this piece is that newswriters sometimes get things wrong, or sometimes write sensationalized things, all i can say is, no duh."</p>

The approach take was: instruct pupils to draw a house on paper, using only straight lines; teach them briefly what a coordinate system is (assigning numeric addresses - pairs of numbers - to points), which they haven&#39;t had in their maths curriculum at that stage, but which they easily picked up; translate the paper-based house into a sequence of PyTurtle Python commands."</p>

Per https://support.stripe.com/questions/managing-your-id-verifi... customers of Stripe Identity have API access to &#34;captured images of the ID document, selfies, extracted data from the ID document, keyed-in information, and the verification result&#34;.Thus, when you use Stripe Identity to verify your identity, you have to trust that:1. The website doesn&#39;t download, retain, and later leak your selfie and identity information.2. The website&#39;s Stripe API token isn&#39;t compromised and exploited by identity thieves to access your selfie and identity information.Stripe appears to be leaning heavily on their claim that they don&#39;t disclose &#34;biometric identifiers&#34; to websites and that these &#34;biometric identifiers&#34; are deleted from their systems within 48 hours. This is extremely deceptive considering that biometric identifiers can be reconstructed from the selfie."</p>

Does anyone find those usages to be unnecessarily intrusive? Maybe it&#39;s just me, but a chat app or shipping site asking me for a drivers license scan + selfie would make me never want to use the service again. It&#39;s appalling how this sort of stuff is getting normalized, eg. google asking for id scans for age verification."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Smart. Banks haven&#39;t been allowed to monetize their KYC data, but this new non-bank class of payments companies have this opportunity. Interac has been trying to do this for many years.Some years ago I worked on a system let banks do identity assertions with proofs via SAML attributes instead of sharing customer PII. It is now a federation of banks in wide use for govt services in Canada. The use cases were really limited because the federation partners were too conservative to extend the identity services to relying party consumer applications real people actually wanted to use, and institutional sales cycles meant product feedback was glacial, so it has existed for over a decade in this relative backwater of gov-tech. I think identity companies have mostly failed to get traction because of a terminal lack of consumer sexiness, whereas Stripe has the jelly.Other companies in the identity space have been working on protocols and platforms, but none of them had a user base to extend an identity federation services into, which means they have never been able to make a real or viable product, just interesting techs. An internet payment provider with young consumer traction getting into identity is a Very Big Deal.It&#39;s going to position Stripe to knock out a lot of retail banks who can&#39;t offer similar services. Imo, this could make them bigger than Apple."</p>

I mean it was never cold, but right now seems to be insane.If the work-from-home thing has given you thoughts about what you like, now is the time to go. I see very few firms insisting on onsite work though, having interviewed with quite a few over the last few weeks. Even guys that I know would rather have people in the office and would pay them very well are feeling forced to let people work from home at least a couple of days.Salary wise it seems like it&#39;s breaking upwards too, though of course all I have is my own offers and the word of some recruiters. There&#39;s also just a lot of firms out there who are happy to create roles for people they like, or discuss new ventures with new people.Also, don&#39;t forget if you&#39;re going to look, absolutely everyone is interviewing remotely. You can sit at home at interviews all day until you find the job for you, something you might not be able to once more firms go back in the office."</p>

The real estate market in our city is shattered and broken. So we will also move 60 miles south to a different city... before the pandemic I was remote and missed the office. Post pandemic... fuck the office and 1+ hour commutes purely because the city, state, and country have mismanaged infrastructure for 20 years."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This appears to actually go significantly beyond enforced password disclosure.  From the text ( http://www.justice.ie/en/JELR/Gen_Scheme_of_AGS_(Powers)_Bil... ), on Head 16 (p 28):- An officer can use these requirements on anyone who &#34;appears to him or her to have access&#34;.  They don&#39;t appear to need any evidence beyond that.  The person does not need to be a suspect or, it appears, the subject of a warrant, just a person present at the location subject to the search warrant.- It applies not just to access to information on the device, but information &#34;which can be accessed by the use of that computer&#34;, and thus presumably includes information that is on other machine, or potentially not even in Ireland or the EU.- It allows officers to freely operate computers on site during a search (this seems like horrible forensic practice?), and use passwords found on the site to try to access any information accessible from the computer.- It does not just include disclosing passwords.  It includes &#34;any password or encryption key&#34;, and anything &#34;to otherwise enable [the officer] to examine the information accessible by the computer&#34;.- It even appears that it allows officers to compel people not just to disclose passwords but to actually operate the device for them so as to enable information access, and &#34;to produce the information in a form in which it can be removed&#34;.- It is not clear to me that there is any restriction on the scope of information, so long as it is in some way accessible.- Head 17 appears to allow even legally (or otherwise) privileged information to be seized, so long as &#34;the confidentiality of the material can be maintained pending the determination by the court of the issue as to whether the material is privileged material&#34;.Combining these powers would seem to be able to result in ridiculous situations, for example, forcing a person to take data from a US server using an SSH key on their laptop, potentially violating US law by doing so, and for the person to do all the work necessary to do this themselves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interestingly, such a law does nothing against proper criminals. People that know they have incriminating evidence will either not carry it on their phones or uses some form of steganography to hide it perfectly. In the worst case, they will have some form of wipe-me passphrase that cleans the device before unlocking.Normal people, on the other hand, do not have these kind of (mental, time) resources. They will be forced to unlock their phones and something incriminating (for instance regarding &#34;hate speech&#34; or &#34;intellectual property rights&#34; or just &#34;traffic violations&#34;) will be found. I consider this approach one step more in the direction of keeping every citizen an on-demand criminal. There are so many, sometimes incomprehensible, laws nowadays that pretty much everyone is not compliant."</p>

As much ELI5 info as possible - the barrier to exercise for a lot of people (myself included despite my experience) can be not knowing wtf something is, or why to do it, and generally what the benefits are.4. Treat warmups like any exercise - a critical part of the routine. Include lots of warm up exercises, whether it&#39;s something you make quantifiable progress with or not. Everything from skipping rope and light jogging to dead bugs. Include these as part of program generation.Maybe something does this, but my favourite tracker (Strong) doesn&#39;t cover all of it and I&#39;d switch in an instant if something did.

If that&#39;s 3 sets of 5 reps, fine. Do that. If you can get yourself to consistently do more than that over time, you&#39;ll benefit from the increase in volume.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Narrower tires, necessarily inflated to a high pressure, are actually inefficient on a bumpy surface.A tire&#39;s job is to absorb surface defects in the road, and that is not only for comfort, but rolling efficiency.The extreme example of this occurs off-road. Off-road vehicles benefit from wider tires that are inflated to a lower pressure. If you have an off-road vehicle, it behooves you to take some of the air out of the tires when you go off-road.25mm road bike tires basically require a polished velodrome; real roads consist of pitted, eroded and cracked asphalt.If your bike is vibrating from the crappy road, you&#39;re probably not going as fast as you could be. Letting some of the air out for a more efficient, smoother ride is risky, if the tires a narrow; you risk snakebite flats and damage to the rim.For commuting in run-down city with aging infrastructure, you want at at least 38 mm tires. 40 mm is a nice round number. You can vary the pressure for the kinds of roads you&#39;re riding on with a lot of margin, and can take it quite low for dirt roads.I&#39;ve commuted around town with pressures as low as 45 psi in the back, 35 in the front, in 45 mm tires.I have story in relation to that. One time I was riding along NW Marine Drive in Vancouver, from UBC down to Spanish Banks. I came down from the hill and then along the flats there were some Spandex-clad road cyclists ahead of me. I pulled up to them and we were neck and neck. There was road work going on up ahead and the pavement had been scraped, leaving it horribly bumpy. I stood on the pedals and just cranked right through it, hardly slowing down. I saw in the mirror mounted on my eyeglasses that road bike guys dropped off as if a sniper had taken them out.What is the use of narrow tires? It&#39;s just fashion, like stiletto heels."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From my perspective, I was in SWE at Apple for over a decade, their documentation started going downhill as iOS development ramped up. By the time they got to the yearly release cycle for macOS and iOS documentation was an afterthought. Most was generated with doxygen from inline docstrings.The reason I think the quality and quantity dropped was the internal schedules barely (or don&#39;t) leave enough time for the engineering work so there&#39;s very little time available for high level documentation. Internally tons of &#34;documentation&#34; existed as Radar comments or exchanges on internal mailing lists. Maybe a group&#39;s wiki had some crystallized documentation or high level architectural descriptions but good luck accessing it from outside that org. My favorite was some discussion about overall design or architecture that got the &#34;let&#39;s take this offline&#34; where all the helpful details ended up shared in an in-person meeting.The internal secrecy and rapid development pace made it really difficult to get good overviews of technologies internally. I really sympathize with outside developers trying to cobble together an understanding of something where the documentation sucks or is missing.The DocC tooling isn&#39;t going to be anymore effective than doxygen or other auto generated documentation without good architectural documentation. A function definition is nice but knowing you need to decombulate a frobnob before snizzlizing or that decombulation can only safely be done on the main thread is often more important. I can read a function signature but I can&#39;t necessarily know all the keys that go into some configuration NSDict passed into it.I hope the situation improves if the DocC tooling lowers the friction for writing documentation. It sucks having to mix a WWDC presentation, sample code, and iffy docs into a semblance of usable architectural documentation."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This speaks to me. I’m not deeply involved in the iOS development world but I do a lot of webview-adjacent stuff so I keep a close eye on the WKWebView documentation.It’s a mess. Case in point: introduced in the new beta: loadSimulatedRequest:https://developer.apple.com/documentation/webkit/wkwebview/3...What does it do? Don’t know. I can make a few informed guesses from the name but I’m not sure if it’s maybe a performance measurement tool, or just a way of loading faked data. There is no documentation. To the best of my knowledge it isn’t covered in any talks either."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Isn&#39;t the real time most software documentation started going down hill was as the internet became the primary way of distributing and updating software?When software distribution was tied to hardware mediums, it froze snapshots in time, and the documentation thereof could be snapshotted with it (to varying levels of success). Even needed to be.But once it all became primarily net based, it meant the software was always fluid, in motion. Imagine the tech writer approaching a developer now days:&#34;Explain how this works to me&#34;&#34;Ok, right now, it works like this, but we&#39;re working on a revised version for next year...&#34;&#34;Sigh. Ok, explain that to me too.&#34;&#34;You bet, but make sure and check back with me before you publish, because some things might change yet.&#34;It&#39;s an irony, that the original dream of &#34;the web&#34;, a distributed documentation system, is rendered ever instantly out dated in the realm of software because of the distribution models it eventually enabled. Unintended side effects I guess.As a side anecdote, consider man pages for venerable established Unix commands. Now consider the man pages for newer Unix utilities. IME, the newer features are often under documented and require going to code portals to get detailed/up to date answers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Rust has an interesting, and somewhat difficult, memory model.First, there&#39;s the single ownership tree. Single ownership is checked by the borrow checker. You can have only one mutable reference to a data object at a time, and that&#39;s also checked by the borrow checker. If you can stay within that model, if the program compiles, it will probably work at the data access level.But then there are all the escape hatches.There&#39;s &#34;Rc&#34;, which is reference counting for read-only use. This works fine for immutable objects, but not for mutable ones.There&#39;s &#34;Cell&#34; and &#34;RefCell&#34;. These allow multiple ownership, and only one mutable access at a time. Request mutable access via two routes and you get a panic, or an error if you use try_borrow();
The static analysis of the borrow checker is not able to figure out when you&#39;re headed for trouble via this route.There&#39;s &#34;Arc&#34; and &#34;Mutex&#34;, which allows access across thread boundaries. Request access via two routes in the same thread, and you deadlock.Designing the data structures for something tightly coupled with concurrency, like a window manager or a game, is difficult."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, I&#39;m surprised I never ran across this excellent essay before.I also liked the use of the term &#34;memory model&#34; in this case to mean conceptual model, because the metaphors and affordances of a language are what give (or restrict) its expressive power and the level of abstraction you can bring to bear.  A mixed blessing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Memory model&#34; has yet a third meaning, referring to interference between operations in multiple CPU cores, and mediated by variously-shared parts of cache systems of varying complexity.Here, complexity of the memory model is traded off against complexity of the primitives to manage the interference, (compare-and-set, load-locked/store conditional, etc.) and with the complexity of the cache system.Java&#39;s original memory model, perhaps the first formally specified, turned out to be unimplementable on common actual machines. The next language to get a formal memory model was C++, followed shortly by C and then others.Real multicore machines have sorted themselves out into two models of cache coherency; one more forgiving represented by mainstream x86 and now Apple M1, relying on deeply complex cache designs, and the other by the remaining lottery survivors, non-Apple ARM, and Power. The various RISC-V implementations will probably straddle the divide, like ARM/ARM-M1.Java, C++, and C can with some discipine be coded to work transparently on either, but very often programs accidentally depend on the x86/Apple model, never having been tested beyond it. Rust, absent &#34;unsafe&#34;, is happy on either. The Linux kernel works on either, and once supported other more exotic variations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You really don&#39;t need anything fancy to implement a queue using SQL. You need a table with a primary id and a &#34;status&#34; field. An &#34;expired&#34; field can be used instead of the &#34;status&#34;. We used the latter because it allows easy retries.1. SELECT item_id WHERE expire = 0. If this is empty, no items are available.2. UPDATE SET expire = some_future_time WHERE item_id = $selected_item_id AND expire = 0. Then check whether UPDATE affected any rows. If it did, item_id is yours. If not, loop. If the database has a sane optimizer it&#39;ll note at most one document needs locking as the primary id is given.All this needs is a very weak property: document level atomic UPDATE which can return whether it changed anything. (How weak? MongoDB could do that in 2009.)Source code at https://git.drupalcode.org/project/drupal/-/blob/9.2.x/core/... (We cooked this up for Drupal in 2009 but I am reasonably sure we didn&#39;t invent anything new.)Of course, this is not the fastest job queue there is but it is quite often good enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think one of the biggest advantages of using Redis for job queing vs Postgres comes down to library support.For example Python has Celery and Ruby has Sidekiq. As far as I know there&#39;s no libraries in either language that has something as battle hardened with comparable features for background tasks using Postgres as a backend.There&#39;s a big difference between getting something to work in a demo (achievable by skimming PG&#39;s docs and rolling your own job queue) vs using something that has tens of thousands of hours of dev time and tons of real world usage.I&#39;m all for using PG for things like full text search when I can because it drastically reduces operation complexity if you can avoid needing to run Elasticsearch, but Redis on the other hand is a swiss army knife of awesome. It&#39;s often used for caching or as a session back-end so you probably have it as part of your stack already. It&#39;s also really easy to run, uses almost no resources and is in the same tier as nginx in terms of how crazy efficient it is and how reliable it is. I don&#39;t see not using Redis for a job queue as that big of a win."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Redis to me is the magic solution to solve so many complex multiple process syncing issues, a global lock, rate limiter, uniqueness with a set, stasher of all the temporary things… no migration, quick solution to complex problems- streams of events to organize pending tasks, etc… to me it’s all about the temporal / temporary state my application needs to keep track in order to work in a multiuser - multiprocess and multi service environment… just a different tool for a different job then what I would use a database for… but really it’s computer science, to each is their own"</p>

The physics simulation is, to my understanding, very good. And everything described in this article is present in the game to be played around with.VTOL VR taught me about &#34;Radar Notching&#34;. The article briefly mentions how radar can actively detect the doppler shift of targets. If you think about it, the doppler shift of the ground would be neutral, right? Or roughly the speed of the aircraft. So lets say you&#39;ve been locked on by a fighter at high altitude and they&#39;ve fired a radar seeker at you. Your backdrop is the ground, it can pick you out because you&#39;re moving so fast. So what you do is bank your aircraft to fly at a 90 degree angle to the oncoming missile. Now your doppler shift is the same as the ground and you blend in, the radar filters out the ground because of it&#39;s expected speed, which is now the relative speed you are moving. You get &#34;notched out&#34;, and the missile will lose track."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Becoming more religious has helped me identify religious tendencies in the secular world. Ideology doesn’t imply supernatural deities, and some worldly phenomenon can be elevated to a supernatural level.  Secular belief contains rituals, origin stories, deities, saints, priesthood, blasphemy, vice &amp; virtue just as religion does.One aspect of religion I appreciate is that these aspects are well codified and debated – i.e. much more explicit.In the secular world these aspects exist but they are implicit, making them difficult to debate and attack.Few people understand that most religions e.g. Judaism and Christianity have an apologetic discipline – a deliberate arm open to debate.The secular world would benefit from adopting more formal definitions of their belief system. I think that would reduce the conflict and neurosis that comes from engaging a nebulous system.If you believe you are not religious, it just means that you don’t have the cognitive tools to recognize the secular ideology that you have adopted."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to point out that this is incorrect:&gt; It’s rare to hear someone accused of being un-Swedish or un-British—but un-American is a common slur, slung by both left and right against the other. Being called un-American is like being called “un-Christian” or “un-Islamic,” a charge akin to heresy.In fact to be unswedish is not just a common idiom it’s a positive one. It’s when you don’t show the typical negative Swedishness. You aren’t “accused” of it, you are congratulated.“-I went to say hello to all the neighbors in my building. -What a nice and unswedish thing to do!”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think the real issue is laid out at the end&gt;&#34;If matters of good and evil are not to be resolved by an omniscient God in the future, then Americans will judge and render punishment now. We are a nation of believers. If only Americans could begin believing in politics less fervently, realizing instead that life is elsewhere. But this would come at a cost—because to believe in politics also means believing we can, and probably should, be better&#34;I think the author is part of a group of largely public intellectuals in the US who have subscribed to the theory of &#34;religion is the opium of the people, but that&#39;s a good thing&#34;.Yes, the loss of religion does away with a glue that in some sense kept a sort of false peace intact. Injustices can no longer be explained away with metaphysical explanations, superficial alliances under the banner of faith cannot be maintained. The people who stand to lose from this are the kind of people who write these op-eds. People who benefit from delaying conflict. The people who stand to benefit from the loss of religion are the people who need some justice in this world, not in the next one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve got two nephews aged 34 and 32 who still live at home and play video games all the time and rarely leave their rooms. Neither has ever had a job that lasted more than a month or so. Neither ever learned to drive even though they live in a town with little or no public transit. They haven&#39;t had any education beyond high school. They seem wholly unprepared to navigate life without their parents. It&#39;s a slow motion tragedy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What are the things that motivates them, and what do they themselves want to do in life?I ask this because much of the undertone in the article and in this thread is about the failure of meeting the gender role expectations that are put on young men. Do they have a job and a car? Have they studied hard so they can get a good job in order to support a wife and kid?Culture in the last several decades have hammered down on the negative aspects of stereotyping. A person who is 35 has gone through a life time of TV, movie and politics that on repeat has talked about the negative of gender roles for women, while the expectations on men has remained fairly unchanged. I do not find it strange at all if an increasing portion of men under this culture has rejected the role put on them.Which goes back to the original question I started with. What motivates them and what do they want to do with their life? If we want to avoid the slow motion tragedy, maybe the way forward is to help them answer those question in the absent of imposed gender roles."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article suggests that you should not play too aggressive and not take continents too early (maximizing Reinforcing Feedback), because other players will then unite against you (Balancing Feedback).However, this article fails to understand that in Risk, most players are not willing to unite. In fact, if player A and player B decide to unite against me and player A had his turn and stopped me, player B is highly likely to backstab player A and then emerge as the winner.I&#39;ve found that playing very aggressively, and really get as many continents as possible within the first few turns, is the best way to win the game. I always win if I can get 2-3 continents in the first few turns, and if I fail then the game is usually won by whomever did manage to do just that.Being a turtle or &#34;mongolian horde&#34; as we call it can be interesting, but your only viable strategy is to wait for an opening while everyone else stockpiles their continental forces. If you wait too long, you&#39;re just an annoyance to the other players, but you don&#39;t actually have a good chance to win."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In our gaming group, we decided Risk just isn&#39;t that good of a game. It&#39;s old and clunky and extremely long, there are 100 other better board games now. Our main plays have been Dominion, DnD, Gloomhaven, Wingspan, and Crokinole, all of which we greatly prefer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a clickbait article. I’m really disappointed. The premise is interesting: win every time using a  new strategy. Then, discussion about the concept and preview of the “systems thinking” mentality. Not too bad (although the bathtub example was a pretty weak way to advocate for systems thinking, maybe that’s just me but it seems even in that example to be an overly reductive and not terribly insightful method of thought, but it was enough to entertain the next section). However, during the discussion of the strategy everything falls apart. “Let the other players fight each other. Win the game every time by not participating and hoping to inconspicuously amass an incredible army such that you can take over half the board and then turn the tide in your favor in one fell swoop.” If this fails the suggestion is then to play the meta game and beg for pity. Not a single piece of data to back up the claim that this strategy wins every time. In my experience it doesn’t. It also happens to be the strategy that most every player headquartered around Russia-Asia ends up playing because you simply cant control that part of the board early on. No “systems thinking required”. The author also claims hoarding cards is “safe” and wont trigger other players to consider you a threat to the balance of the system. Well, that’s just naive either on part of the author or requires other players to be pretty green to not account for the risk card factor. In reality, another player also using systems thinking would immediately identify you as a threat because they would be tracking unit quantity flow in and out for the players on the board and using that to inform their understanding of what constitutes a threat. I think that’s the disappointment kinda summed up: this strategy doesn&#39;t work in a game where everyone uses it because it depends on your opponents not paying attention rather than you making strategic moves to win the game. The author does not sufficiently incorporate all the complexities of the game and people to yield a solved game."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Copyright 1991. This was probably making the rounds of homeschooling circles I hung out in.We tend to do a sucky job of teaching math to kids. A lot of elementary school teachers are women who were encouraged to go into early education because they weren&#39;t doing so well in math and this is very much gender bias.My ex husband wasn&#39;t good at math. No one told him he should spend his days teaching little kids because of it. He was a career soldier and he just got tutored in college (by me) for his math classes. He was just expected to work at it if it didn&#39;t come naturally and he did.So we just culturally pass around this idea that math is scary and little kids can&#39;t learn it rather than going &#34;Well, adults just need to up their game and, by god, explain it better.&#34;My oldest was math phobic by the time I pulled him out of school to homeschool. My one and only goal for math was to get him over his phobia.He loves physics. I hate calculus. Calculus makes sense to him and he has read calculus books for fun.I was good at explaining the math to him and he learned lots of solid math concepts even though he likely has dyscalculia and isn&#39;t good at crunching the numbers. But I got the concepts through to him and that&#39;s more important.He&#39;s what gets called &#34;calculator dependent&#34; in some circles."</p>

First/second grade math curriculums are centered around basic multiplication, shape recognition and counting.7-year olds aside, I don&#39;t even think most of the high-schooler freshmen I&#39;ve taught would be able to grasp this content."</p>

I&#39;ve always been good at math, and was one of five kids (out of class of 120) that took Calculus as a senior in high school in the early 1990&#39;s.  To even take Calculus as a senior, you had to have taken four years of math in the previous three years.  I was even the HS Math Champion&#34; for my state.However, when I took Calculus in High School, it was taught similarly to this.  Lots and lots and lots of math foundations, infinite series, areas under curves, and I was able to trudge through it but I didn&#39;t really grasp what it all meant or why I was doing it.  Finally, about 2/3 of the way through the year, I was working on a problem and had an &#34;oh, shit, this is just about how things are changing&#34;.  It was a Eureka moment, and entirely based on such a simple statement that was never brought up in lectures or our crusty 1960&#39;s texbook."</p>

Containers, tankers, even rocket booster segments.Yes, we&#39;re absolutely taking a short term hit, but investing in general purpose infrastructure that can be adapted for new technology and demands is a good thing. The continental rail network started off with coal powered steam trains, then diesel, now diesel-electric and even some pure electric locomotives.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I was learning to program, I tried to make a toy artificial life evolution simulation. Particle organisms on a 2D plane had &#39;dna&#39; which was a list of heritable traits, like size, speed, number of offspring.  Bigger organisms could eat smaller organisms, but they burn energy faster. 0 energy = death. When two organisms of opposite gender collided and had sufficient energy, they&#39;d give some of their energy split among the offspring, with each offspring&#39;s &#39;dna&#39; values set to one of the parent&#39;s +/- 5%.As I was developing this, I hadn&#39;t figured out how I wanted to do food yet, so as an easy first step, I just had a constant amount of energy that was split amongst all organisms on the screen.  Lots of little dots buzzing around, was kind of neat but nothing too special. I left it to run overnight.When I came back I was very surprised:  previously i was running at about 30FPS - now it was running at about 4 seconds per frame.  The screen was filled with dense expanding circles of tiny slow organisms emanating from where organisms had mated and nothing else.My simulation evolved to outsmart my simple food algorithm: when food is divided equally among all organisms, the best strategy is to use minimal energy and maximize offspring count.  I had populated the world with a default offspring count of ~5 and they had evolved to the tens of thousands. The more offspring an organism had, the greater the amount of the energy pool would go to their offspring.It was a very cool &#34;Life, uh, finds a way&#34; moment - that such a simple toy simulation of evolution was able to find an unanticipated optimal solution to the environment I created overnight was very humbling and gave me a lot of respect for the power of evolution."</p>

Griffin explained that it wasn’t Google policy to take things like that out of the index just because people didn’t want it there. Principles always make sense until it’s personal,” she says.&gt; Then in July 2005, a CNET reporter used Schmidt as an example of how much personal information Google search could expose. Though she used only information that anyone would see if they typed Schmidt’s name into his company’s search box, Schmidt was so furious that he blackballed the news organization for a year.&gt; “My personal view is that private information that is really private, you should be able to delete from history,” Schmidt once said.

I let a line form once people had their printouts. I&#39;d find the single pair of brackets in a ten line listing, and I&#39;d explain how their index was out of bounds. They thought I was a genius. Late one Saturday night, I made a misguided visit to the computer center while high, smelled sweat and fear, and spun to leave. Too late, a woman&#39;s voice: &#34;Dave! I told Professor Pryor he needed you!&#34; We didn&#39;t know that Fred Pryor was the economics graduate student freed in the 1962 &#34;Bridge of Spies&#34; prisoner exchange.

See where you initialize this index?” He was spectacularly grateful.One cannot overstate the rend in the universe that an APL terminal presented, catapulting me decades into the future. I quickly dreamed in APL. For $3 an hour for ten hours (a massive overcharge) I took a professor’s 300 line APL program translated literally from BASIC, and wrote a ten line APL program that was much faster. One line was classic APL, swapping + and * in an iterated matrix product for max and min. The other nine lines were input, output. The professor took years to realize I wasn’t also calling his code, then published my program.Summer of 1977 I worked as a commercial APL programmer. Normally one never hires college students for the summer and expects them to be productive. The New York-based vice president was taking the train every day to Philadelphia because the Philly office was so far underwater, and desperate to try anything to save himself the commute. He knew Swarthmore had a terminal, and heard about me. At my interview I made a home-run derby of the questions from the Philly boss. The VP kept trying to intervene so he could put me in my place before hiring me. The tough questions were “dead key problems”. How do you write the following program, if the following keys are broken?Our client was a mineral mining company, our task a reporting system. The reports were 2-dimensional projections of a 9-dimensional database. The accountants wanted all totals to be consistent across reports, and to be exactly the sums of their rounded components. I broke the news to our team that we needed to start over, rounding the 9-dimensional database once and for all, before generating each report. This took a few weeks; I wrote plenty of report generation helper routines. My coworkers overheard me say on a phone call that I was being paid $5 an hour, and at the time I didn’t understand which way they were shocked. I didn’t have much to do, the rest of the summer.The mining company VP found me one morning, to ask for a different report, a few pages. He sketched it for me. He found me a few hours later to update his spec. He loved the printout he saw, imagining it was a prototype. “It’s done. I can make your changes in half an hour.”At a later meeting he explained his own background in computing, how it had been key to his corporate rise. Their Fortran shop would take a month to even begin a project like I had knocked off in a morning, then weeks to finish it. He pleaded with me to pass on Harvard grad school and become his protege.Some Lisp programmers had similar experiences, back in the day. Today, APL just sounds like another exotic language. In its heyday it was radical."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back in university (1974), I took a course in AI. The prof wanted us to write a brute-force solution to solve the 8-queens problem -- any language!I wrote the solution in APL in about an hour and it only had 3 lines of code. The rest of the class spent days on their terminals and keypunches trying to solve it. Most solutions took hundreds of lines of code.I got a D from my professor. I questioned why and was told that it was unreadable, and that the solution was inefficient. This annoyed me because he didn&#39;t know APL, and I figured that  since I solved the problem in one hour, while the rest took days, it was very efficient.I protested the result with the department head (who liked APL) and ended up getting an A+. As you can imagine, all the rest of my assignments, written in a variety of languages, were graded by that AI prof with significant prejudice.I passed nonetheless. I loved APL and ended up working for one of the major APL providers as my first job out of school."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a theory on why we&#39;re seeing so much &#34;bad management&#34; for software engineers: most leaders at workplaces have not been engineers themselves at a company with a great engineering culture (I wrote about what I think this means [1]: it&#39;s all the high-growth small and large tech companies we know)The CEO, and the people under the CEO know and understand traditional, top-down management. Let the people with context and decision power make the big decisions, and pass this downwards. Works with finance, works with marketing, works with IT support, and should work with engineering as well... right?But it actually doesn&#39;t work with software engineers as well as it could. Or with designers. UX researchers. PMs... all these people would produce a magnitude more output when given proper context and autonomy.A few leaders read about this, and try giving autonomy. These results end up even worse than the status quo, as you can&#39;t just make it a free-for-all and expect it works overnight.And to prove this point: look at companies where the founder had worked at a high-performing company before. Before founding Twilio, Jeff Lawson spent years at Amazon (he was one of the first AWS PMs), and in his book Ask Your Developer, he writes about just how much this experience shaped him, and all the practices he adopted from Amazon.There&#39;s this really weird divide between &#34;forward-looking tech companies&#34;[2] who &#34;get it&#34;, and everyone else. Which heavily benefits this first group.[1] https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/the-developer-culture-tes...[2] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25717390"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In most companies, management is actually to blame for deliberately isolating engineers from discovering the customer&#39;s needs. News flash! Developers actually like the idea of figuring out and fulfilling needs with epic software solutions and are fairly neutral-to-downright-annoyed at spending their time creating something that no customer wants.I agree with the first statement but disagree with the second. Yes, management is often at fault for not involving or engaging developers. That said, I&#39;ve seen many really solid developers be motivated by solving complex technical challenges instead of work that actually creates business/product value. Of course, it&#39;s management&#39;s responsibility to harness that energy and align it with creating value... But just saying, a lot of really smart people are driven more by intellectual challenges than product impact."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Developers have opportunities to improve management by increasing management-visible headlines about user goals, and decreasing management-visible headlines about implementation details such as UI, WBS, wireframes, flowcharts, and tech.Try this thought experiment: Imagine you have team task list with headlines such as &#34;Add red button to top of home page&#34;. Imagine rewriting the headlines such as &#34;Customer wants to contact us&#34; and similar kinds of user stories.When managers continually see headlines with user emphasis, and do not see headlines with implementation details, then management improves and developer autonomy improves, because both groups are looking toward users.It turns out focus on user stories can help significantly, even more than some developers might intuit. Look at your task board headlines and the opening paragraphs of your management-visible writing-- can you improve your writing to emphasize user goals?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I disagree with so much of this! Though I can tell the author is coming from a lot of experience.How often is it that you don&#39;t know if you&#39;re expecting a map or a keyword list? I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever intentionally put myself in that situation (though it&#39;s nice that access supports both).They say to avoid piping result tuples, but I actually think their example code shows the strength and weaknesses of both approaches. I use pattern matching on tuples when you want more complicated behavior (that might be hard to read in a big else block for a with) and a nice with statement when there&#39;s &#39;one true path.&#39;In general, I think one of my favorite things about Elixir is that they&#39;ve done a good job of avoiding adding features you should never use. These all feel like personal judgements about tradeoffs rather than actual hard rules."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love this article to bits. The elixir community loves blogging, but so much elixir content is absolute beginner stuff, and so much of the remainder is unopinionated, descriptive stuff. I&#39;ve found it really hard to strike on some good &#34;how to best do xyz, what are the tradeoffs&#34; style knowledge. This article is the first elixir thing I&#39;ve read in a long time that really made me go &#34;o wow yeah, I&#39;ve been doing that wrong&#34;. Cool stuff!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good stuff. I disagree about the first point, though, and have actually gone the opposite way, going from generic Access via `[]` to specific `Map.get` and `Keyword.get`.The reason is that the underlying data structures are quite different, and operations and access patterns on them shouldn&#39;t be agnostic.You should use Keywords basically only as options to functions, in my opinion, and that&#39;s just for historical consistency and interop with Erlang. Otherwise key-value pairs should be a map. And using `Keyword.get` and `Map.get` make it immediately obvious what the underlying data structure is, as well as prompt you to think about whether you should use the `!` version or provide defaults.Otherwise, I think the tips are all decent to great. I am a little on the fence with exceptions, though. I know there&#39;s a meme in the community of &#34;let it crash&#34;, but in my experience, that rarely feels like the right thing to do. I much prefer a Rust-style, &#34;Result-all-the-things&#34;. It seems hard, in practice, to rely on crashes and restarts to maintain the right state invariants."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you can afford a one off 1 second of latency for your SQL queries, then using logical replication with pgbouncer seems way easier :- setup logical replication between the old and the new server (limitations exist on what is replicated, read the docs)- PAUSE the pgbouncer (virtual) database. Your app will hang, but not disconnect from pgbouncer- Copy the sequences from the old to new server. Sequences are not replicated with logical replication- RESUME the pgbouncer virtual database.You&#39;re done. If everything is automated, your app will see a temporary increase of the SQL latency. But they will keep their TCP connections, so virtually no outage."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Braintree (IIRC) had a really clever migration strategy, although I can&#39;t seem to find the blog post now.  They paused all traffic at the load balancer, cut over to the new DB, and then resumed traffic.  No requests failed, just a slight bump in latency while the LBs were paused.This app apparently had robust enough retry mechanisms that they were able just eat the errors and not have customer issues—Color me impressed!  I&#39;m not sure how many teams can make that claim; that&#39;s a hard thing to nail down."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one of the areas where Postgres is so far behind MySQL is embarrassing. Zero downtime migrations in MySQL have been a common method for over 10 years. This solution is far from ideal due to the use of Triggers which can greatly increase the load on the database and slow down transactions. If you don&#39;t have a lot of load on your DB thats fine, but if you are pushing your DB this will bring it down.In MySQL they started with triggers with PT-OSC, but now there is GH-OST which does it with Replication. You can do something like this with Postgres by using Logical replication, but its still requires hand holding, and to my knowledge there is no way to &#34;throttle&#34; the migration like you can with GH-OST. Where I work now we are building all this out so we can have first class online migrations, but the chasm is still pretty big."</p>

Require app developers to submit a template string (and not &#34;\(message)&#34;) for each notification the app can deliver for approval in the App Store and let me have an on/off switch for each one.&#34;Notifications&#34; across every platform drive me crazy, because they usually start out as useful, but because people tend to pay them more attention than all the other channels that have already been tuned out, companies start juicing them for engagement.

Not because of some technical or legal thing, but because mindless browsing is a good thing. We need it. Mindless browsing is like a walk through the woods, just looking for what is happening, navigating a huge amount of information that is hardly important at the moment – oh, the cherry tree is blooming – but could be important later.The &#39;outside&#39; is made up of myriads of tiny details – wind is moving the leaves, slowly and irregularly, the birds are singing, insects flying through the air, the earth feels soft and damp and smells of freshness after the rain, the movements of clouds and the sun are inexorably changing the lighting. We are, however, spending time in concrete boxes where nothing ever moves, and even seal off the sounds and air flow from the outside. Within those boxes we sit and lie and enter other, flatter spaces of our screens, which nonetheless offer us the possibility of some kind of change, movement in the world.. Of course we will browse those changes mindlessly.Since mainstream social media has turned into a manipulative toxic landscape, I find myself retreating to more niche and better moderated sites, devoid of hate and over-strained emotions. I also find myself wishing for a digital space, be it a game or a website, that would feel similar to a walk in the woods – where a lot is happening but not much is important. Like watching the breaking of waves on the beach. Like sitting at a campfire. Like watching the tree tops move in the wind.I like mindless browsing. I enjoy it. Just give me the right space for it."</p>

I think learning the ins and outs of it was more fun than doing anything productive.I used to hack away at it all day and night. Learning about interrupts, tinkering with the BIOS settings, hacking the serial port, irq, etc. Now everything is just locked down. In my latest phone I can&#39;t even run `fastboot` as that too has been locked down permanently because &#34;security&#34;.Thank god we have Linux created before all this Bullshit started happening.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Note that if you are just interested in US sales taxes, and only need to collect tax in the ~1/2 of the states that are part of the Streamlines Sales Tax (SST) project, you can have your tax rate calculation, registration, reporting, and filing all done for free.The member states of SST have agreed to pay for those services from several  tax SaaS companies. (There is one catch: to avail yourself of this, you must collect tax for all SST states, even though you might be below the threshold in some of them).The companies participating are Avalara, TaxCloud, Sovos, and Accurate Tax.For small online businesses I suspect that a lot more can take advantage of this than you might expect. Here&#39;s a map showing the SST member states [1]. Although it is missing some big states that you probably do a lot of business in (California for instance), a lot of those big states have quite high thresholds for sales or number of transactions before tax kicks in.Some of the companies that provide the fee SST service will also add non-SST states for a fee. If you only need one or two non-SST states, it will still probably come out cheaper than using Stripe (and will include reporting and filing).[1] https://www.streamlinedsalestax.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was lucky to be part of the beta for my SaaS (https://turnshift.app) and I must say this new feature simplifies things A LOT.Especially as a EU business owner, I previously had to sync every VAT tax rate possible, use a complex workflow to know if a customer needed to pay taxes or not, link tax rates to customers, and create taxes reports for my accountant. Stripe tax does all of that automatically, based on the customer full address and VAT numbers.Here&#39;s a twitter thread of everything you had to do previously: https://twitter.com/vvoyer/status/1347488977738149888PS: Yes there were other services (Paddle) providing this (and much more to be honest), but the Stripe API and customization options makes it my go-to solution for integrating payments."</p>

I believe their pricing structure was not very far from the competition. What did they offer to attract users even though they lacked such important features?I want to learn."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years back, I had the opportunity to lead the Product Team of a 200+ people company. It took me over a month to understood who does what, and I tend to try to know things around me and at least have the idea of “what to do in an emergency.”I stumble on one DevOps guy who wrote every bloody thing happening in the system. He likes doing it, but from the way people were asking questions in the common chatrooms, group emails, I knew nobody read them. He loves plain text, nicely formatted with the old-school Unix-styles et al. I had talks with him outside of work and found him fascinating; I asked him help with my hobby, home-lab tinkerings, etc.By that time, I had already started internal blog groups and was encouraging people to write. And indeed, a lot of people came out to write about engineering, marketing, product, and it became a routine for people to show off what they can do, what they love, and what they are good at.In one of my regular company-wide emailers, I dedicated a big piece to the DevOps guy, pointing to his work and the beauty of his documentations. People loved it, and they began reading it. He remained a friend. That mailer was the only way I could highlight people I encounter doing good work, to the whole team up to the CxOs.By the time I left the company, I was responsible for many vital things in the company, but I could transition everything smoothly with the documents and credential details (thanks to 1Password).In the last year or so, I have been thinking more about -- always be dying. I think the similar vein of Always be Quitting; I try to document, write out details, just in case I die and my family has to figure out the intricacies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are a range of anti-vaccine opinions from idiotic (the example Linus quotes) to more reasonable. The way this issue has been handled is emblematic of the way many such political issues are handled: fringe views are promoted and &#34;debunked&#34; while more reasonable views that go against mainstream narratives are ignored. This is amplified by various high profile personalities in the media who shape the views people are presented with, so that all critics of the mainstream narrative appear to be lunatics. Thus stigmatizing anyone who has a more reasonable objection. This is not a new phenomenon but has played out much more frequently over the last year or so.Also, I got the vaccine, so if you interpret this as some sort of veiled anti-vaccine comment you are part of the problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the interesting things that happened at my company is that productivity instantly doubled when we started working remotely. The reality at my company is that people are only getting 20 hours or so of work done in the office - the rest is socialization, pointless meetings, lunches, or trying to look busy. When we went home for lockdown and kept working 40 hour weeks, not only did productive output double, but everyone burned out in a few weeks.In my opinion, the reality of working from home is that 20-30 hour work weeks need to be acceptable and we should use the rest of our time on non-working things, just like we did in the office, but now that time can be more meaningful to us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So yes, as a &#34;boss&#34;, the work-from-home future is definitely and absolutely destroying my brain, but I think the whole discussion around control in the article completely misses my point. I couldn&#39;t care less about control and never cared about seat-in-the-ass time before.But as an engineer become manager, I can absolutely feel both sides here:While everything development is massively more chill remote (no interruptions and hey, just go fill your dishwasher while stuff compiles), everything about managing remotely completely sucks for me.Videocalls. Whiteboarding. Interviewing. Strategic work. Reading emotions and connecting to people. What was a matter of just getting six people in a war room for a week and getting that hard problem done now takes eternities and every meeting is an energy hog.Honestly, I really enjoyed being a leader for a technology organization, but right now, I absolutely hate it. There seem to be others who cope better, but it&#39;s certainly not for me.I&#39;m pretty curious on how all of this will turn out."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Now, someone insufferable will read this and say “NOT ALL MIDDLE MANAGERS,” and let me tell you, if you’re thinking that, you are probably part of the problem.Clever.  Take the obvious objection--that this is all based on stereotyping of the role and, frankly, cynical assumptions about the way management is or can be structured--and then just turn it into another symptom of management dysfunction!How very tautological: Before you tell me I&#39;m wrong, let me tell you you&#39;re wrong for telling me I&#39;m wrong.And yes, I&#39;m a manager.  And no, I never spent time &#39;[walking] the floors, “[keeping] an eye on people” and, in meetings, “[speaking] for the group.”&#39;&#39; because I have far far more important things to do, like helping my staff understand the corporate vision so they can make good, independent decisions; helping solve problems for my staff when they come to me with issues; working with our sales team to manage customer expectations and negotiate on projects and solutions; managing the expectations of senior management based on the information I&#39;m getting from my staff.  And the list goes on and on.But, who am I to say.  I&#39;m just a middle manager who is, I&#39;m sure, just part of the problem..."</p>

It specifies a granularity of points are allowed to be endpoints of a validity period, but these are still POINTS AFAICT.&gt; It means that, for example 10:00:01 is AFTER 10:00, even though 10:00:01 is not a valid endpoint of a validity period (and it doesn&#39;t have to be, as it is a measurement result, not a validity period endpoint).&gt; Does RFC or BR requires a browser to round down the measured current time to full seconds, before comparing them against the validity period?As a random member of the public, this seems like a reasonable interpretation to me... though the time format which expiry dates are required to be expressed in is explicitly not allowed to include fractional seconds... so maybe it is meant as an interval not a point in time."</p>

Apple built a platform, where they take some cut for themselves, while allowing other people to sell digital contents on their platform.Other than the argument that this could be an anti-trust situation (i.e. in that case, the argument would be that Apple is abusing their market position), what differentiates these two cases ?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Being a hedgehog is useful on the journey to domain mastery because sticking to frameworks saves you time and headache compared to not having any frameworks at all.The 3 stages of domain mastery:Stage 1 - No knowledge or structure to approach a domain (everything is hard, pitfalls are everywhere)Stage 2 - Frameworks that are useful to approach the domain (Map to avoid pitfall areas)Stage 3 - Detailed understanding of the domain (in which you can move through pitfall areas freely and see where frameworks fall short)Hedgehogs are at stage 2. You move from stage 1 to stage 2 by adopting frameworks; hence, hedgehogs are seen as &#34;thought leaders&#34; because they teach the frameworks that lead MOST people to more mastery. Except when you&#39;re at stage 3, in which case frameworks lead you to more inefficiencies compared to your own understanding.All good decisions must be made by stage 3 persons, but ironically, training is most efficiently done by stage 2 persons. Hedgehogs get more limelight because 90% of the population is at stage 1 and values the knowledge of stage 2 (and can&#39;t grasp the complexities and nuances of stage 3).Many hedgehogs struggle to touch stage 3, and instead see stage 2 as mastery. This is compounded by the positive feedback loops of success - the frameworks save time, it gives them reputation, it allows them to save stage 1 persons from their ignorance, and it&#39;s the foundation of their current level and achievements. Frameworks are also convenient and broadly applicable to many problems; detailed domain mastery in contrast is difficult, time consuming, and  highly contextualized.All of this makes it hard to move beyond stage 2 into stage 3."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s cathartic to read other people who have to go through this.I&#39;m fighting red tape for my team as we build out a dashboard.Outlook is packed with 1–2 hour meetings for the next 3 months where so far I&#39;m:* being asked to load test our system to make sure it can handle the load (of 3 people?)* being asked to integrate with various analytics platforms so we can alert some poor schmuck at 3 AM in case the API goes down then (it&#39;s not a vital part of any platform)* told to have this run in k8s since everything runs in k8s* other pedantic tasks by Sys Ops who think everything is a nail and love to argue their points ad exhaustium (or worse, argue why their fav stack is the golden child)I understand the need for standards and making sure they&#39;re followed, but there really needs to be a human element of, &#34;is this truly needed for what I&#39;m trying to do?&#34;. So many engineering departments are all about automation, but don&#39;t truly think through how much automation is needed, rather than a 1 size fits all approach.I appreciate that this article comes to the conclusion that the more correct an answer will be, the more complicated it tends to be. I wish more people in decision making positions would understand this."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed that read. I suspect that it probably pissed off a few folks.I&#39;m a grizzled, scarred old codger that spent most of his career, saying &#34;Are you sure that&#39;s a good idea?&#34;, only to be ignored, and then put in charge of mopping up the blood.I have learned that &#34;I told you so.&#34; is absolutely, 1000% worthless. It doesn&#39;t even feel good, saying it.What I have learned, is that, when I see someone dancing along a cliff edge, I quietly start figuring out where the mops are kept. If that person has any authority at all, I&#39;ll never be able to stop them from their calisthenics.One of my favorite quotes is one that pretty much describes &#34;hedgehogs&#34;:    &#34;There&#39;s always an easy solution to every human problem; Neat, plausible and wrong.&#34;

There&#39;s another one, by the same chap (H. L. Mencken):    &#34;The fact that I have no remedy for all the sorrows of the world is no reason for my accepting yours. It simply supports the strong probability that yours is a fake.&#34;

Of course, the issue is that for every 10,000 appalling, messy, featured-on-rotten-dot-com failures, there&#39;s one spectacular success. Since humans are biased to think of successful outcomes as more likely than they actually are, the ingredients for that success become a &#34;recipe,&#34; and are slavishly reproduced, without any critical thought, or flexibility.It&#39;s like a witch doctor&#39;s formula for headache cure is bat urine, dandruff from the shrunken head of a fallen warrior chief, eye of newt, boiled alligator snot, and ground willow bark. The willow bark is what did it, but the dandruff thing is the most eye-catching ingredient, so it gets the credit, and everytime the chief gets a hangover, they start a war.Somewhere down the road, a copycat substitutes hemlock for the willow bark, and headaches become a death sentence."</p>

Reading this one, even through the sometimes-broken English, is inspirational and a wonderful look at how things fall apart and come back together.

Most families in towns like El Zonte do not have bank accounts, and rely on services such as Western Union WU +0.5%, which take 5-10% in fees. The closest Western Union is approximately one hour by bus, requiring the recipient of the cash transfer to take the bus back with cash on hand, creating a safety issue.&#34; [0][0] https://www.forbes.com/sites/tatianakoffman/2020/07/14/this-..."</p>

The primary beneficiaries of this will be organised crime, who will now be able to wash the Bitcoin via El Salvador to convert it to dollars, which they can use to buy trade items and export the profits.The number one export of El Salvador is actually people. If they were concerned about remittance fees they could just set up a bank in the US with low fees, instead of getting kickbacks from OCGs and Western Union / Money Gram etc.El Salvador is set to be a big climate change loser, and every joule spent on bitcoin is bringing them closer to disaster.&#34;El Salvador has seen a steady increase in extreme events (storms, floods and droughts) during the last 30 years. The Pacific coastline is already experiencing rising sea levels and it is expected that 10–28 percent of the country’s coastal zone territory will be lost by the end of the century. Coastal areas, home to over 30 percent of the population, are highly vulnerable to the combination of sea level rise and El Niño events.&#34;https://www.climatelinks.org/resources/climate-risk-profile-...Coastal flooding risk is significant due to loss of mangroves.https://thinkhazard.org/en/report/75-el-salvador/CF"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"To give some technical background: yes, using Lightning (as they seem to do) for affordable BTC payments is challenging for most. As far as I am aware that is why they rely on custodial solutions [1]. People hold their money with someone from their village they trust, which is not ideal but neither is being unbanked. Down the road I could easily see this trust being spread over multiple people using multisig wallets.The amazing thing about all this is that everyone can become a BTC &#34;bank&#34;. You need a bit of capital but orders of magnitude less than a normal bank would require, maybe 2k$ to get started of which you might spend 400$ on hardware and fees to open some channels. The trustless nature of lightning lets you and your users then join the global payment network without asking for permission from anyone and you can engage in commerce internationally.I think, while we are still early, that this is an awesome experiment. It will highlight the UX problems so we can fix them. Hopefully at some point all this will make sense to the average westerner too, so we can finally have a money not controlled by anyone (states, incumbent banks) again. But that might take a long time.[1] https://github.com/GaloyMoney/galoy#status-of-the-project"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Your problem is not with SMS as a second factor though. (Unless you think the attacker had your password as well). It is with the use of SMS as a single recovery factor.The very things that make SMS a uniquely good second factor make it an awful only factor. Use of SMS for account recovery should in general (or at least for important accounts) have a delay (order of days) that allows the real user to intervene."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I lost my Microsoft account years ago. I still get emails from Microsoft stating that there&#39;s suspicious activity on the account. I got two just yesterday.Despite that, despite still having access to the email the account is on, I cannot recover the Microsoft account. Despite Microsoft notifying me that the account is still, years later to this day, being abused, cannot use any form of recovery. I cannot access the account with help from support or even after visiting a brick-and-mortar store.It&#39;s one big reason that I&#39;ve long since refused to purchase anything more from Microsoft and have ditched Windows.Good luck recovering your stuff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As others have said, it is not that SMS 2FA is insecure; it is that thieves have figured out how to defeat it using SIM jacking and a bit of facebooking and googling.  It is now trivial to figure out your home town, your favorite pet, etc.  Also as others have said, the current alternatives have their problems.  What if you lose all your Yubi keys?  What if your phone was accidentally wiped and you never got around to backing it up?  You cannot prove you are you and so customer support cannot help you.  Google, Microsoft, and Apple are not known for helping consumers get themselves out of this catch-22.It is a mistake to ask consumers to protect, backup, and secure their digital lives themselves.  Consumers don&#39;t have the time or skills to keep up with the hackers.  If Apple, Google, ATT, Verizon etc. cannot provide digital security, this is an opportunity for someone else to step in.  My personal suggestion is this is a ripe opportunity for someone like the US Post Office or Department of Motor Vehicles.  Consumers would go to the US Post Office or DMV and purchase a Yubi key from them.  The additional value they add, is they can verify the identity of the consumers who is purchasing the Yubi key and replace the key if it is lost/stolen.  Similar to how they process driver licenses or passports.  This service is optional and would actually cost money.  I would gladly pay a monthly fee for this peace of mind."</p>

But there&#39;s reason to think that may go even better, not worse; I am really curious to see how it plays out and glad more companies are continuing to let people work remotely."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been back in my company&#39;s office in person (medium-sized tech company) for the last week with a small subset of employees before we all go back, and I&#39;ve become pretty convinced that these hybrid models will not go well. Even while wearing masks and social distancing, I feel far more connected to the others that work in the office, and whether it&#39;s fair or not, personal connection and trust play a huge role in collaborating effectively and deciding who gets what work, who gets promoted, etc. If everyone can choose whatever combination of remote and in-person they want, it seems impossible to me that there won&#39;t be extremely strong in-group/out-group effects that will cause big organizational problems for companies.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Vivaldi Mail? That took a while :-DVivaldi is developed by a team created by the former Opera founder and CEO. Vivaldi kind of tries to re-create the spirit of Opera, but I think it&#39;s going to be too hard to do it.For those who didn&#39;t use it, Opera was first a paid browser (which limited its reach), then an ad-supported browser (which again limited its reach). It then finally became a free browser but by then it was too late.It had its own, super fast, rendering engine (I forget its name, Presto?). It had a built in email client, feed reader, calendar (unfortunately with no Exchange or Gmail integration), a notes app, a powerful download manager and even a Bitorrent client. And a TON of features and UI flexibility.It was super compact, a marvel of engineering and UX design that managed to pack all those things in a package of about 5MB at the time, and you wouldn&#39;t even see or load the extra functionality like the email client if you didn&#39;t use it.Unfortunately with HTML5 and the Chrome-ification of the web, it couldn&#39;t keep up :-(Vivaldi tries to do the same on top of web techs and web techs just can&#39;t handle it. Web techs are almost as flexible but they&#39;re really slow and bulky.Still, I wish them luck."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want to offer Vivaldi some praise, I switched to it as my main browser a few years ago, and it&#39;s been great. I had to look for a new browser when Firefox (that I had used since the Firebird days) kept breaking my settings and plugins with their updates. After yet another Firefox update I wasn&#39;t able to restore the browser to how I want it to be, so I tried Vivaldi.I&#39;m not even a big fan of the original Opera, but love Vivaldi&#39;s features such as easy screen splitting between two tabs and one-click actions to disable images or apply certain filters to a page. Picture-in-picture and pop-outs for media are also great, periodic tab reload is occasionally very useful.Ideally I&#39;d like to use a fully FOSS browser, but my patience with Firefox ran out, and Vivaldi is Chromium + custom open-source parts + closed-source UI layer. Good enough for me, though not ideal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I switched to Vivaldi from Chrome earlier this year as I was uncomfortable with the level of Google integration in that browser.Vivaldi is based on Chromium and has lots of improvements over Chrome, like gestures out of the box, side panels, lots of clear options. And Chrome extensions work perfectly.
I&#39;ve had no issues so far.The complexity of managing a browser engine that does what everyone expects requires humongous resources so I can understand the move to Chromium. As long as the google bits are removed and the extensions work, it&#39;s great to have an alternative to Edge and Chrome.I mostly use Firefox as my daily browser and nothing would make me abandon it but it&#39;s nice to be able to segregate your various professional/private persona using different browsers."</p>

So if you wanted to print FOO.DOC on the printer in CP/M PIP you could say PRN: = FOO.DOC but not PRN = FOO.DOC.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thread inaccurately describes the limitation of these special names being on the &#34;OS level&#34; -- it&#39;s actually one layer down, in the DOS and Win32 subsystems. Windows NT doesn&#39;t throw fits about these file names if the subsystem you run under (see: POSIX, LXSS, OS/2) doesn&#39;t care about them. Cygwin can even override the Win32 behavior by just passing all its file handlers through the native NT API instead of the Win32 API."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The mob is a huge problem with Twitter (and adjacent social media), and the issue with a mob is purely that of its size. It&#39;s the size that makes the mob, and everyone who has ever considered chiming in to add their voice why so-and-so was bad should stop to think about whether the world really needs that additional voice. Each individual voice may be perfectly right. So-and-so may really have done wrong. But did they really do such wrong that the 10,000th voice is needed?I am ashamed to say I&#39;ve done it myself, back when I was on Twitter. My feed would start lighting up with some really Bad thing that so-and-so said -- and generally it was &#34;Bad&#34; -- and I&#39;d add my voice somewhere to that cacophony. Not necessarily writing to the Bad Person, but chiming in on someone&#39;s long thread.Now I look back and see I was another participant in the mob.Look, the author described in the post absolutely did herself no favors. Her book may have been great, but the way she interacted with people on social media was absolutely not. But being the 10,000th person to tell her that is never necessary. That&#39;s just wanting to join a mob, because mobs are fun, because you&#39;re all justified in this act together.Mobs are scary, because everyone thinks they are justified. A good friend of mine grew up in Kenya and recounted that when he was about nine, he saw a mob catch a thief. Joining in with everyone else, he took a wire and whipped the man. Next thing he knew, the crowd had put tires over the alleged thief and set him on fire. He has never forgotten the guilt he felt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not that the people who form a twitter mob don&#39;t think or &#34;let twitter think for them&#34;.It&#39;s that they actively enjoy hurting someone as a mob. They get a kick out of it, and it&#39;s not discouraged (as would be actually forming a mob out in the streets be). If anything, it&#39;s encouraging, and gives them not just the joy of kicking someone who is down, but also &#34;good person&#34; credits (because the one getting kicked is a bad person, of course).In other words, people are not mislead &#34;against their better nature&#34;: they are just encouraged to embrace their badness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are so many comments here blaming Twitter while blissfully unaware that HN fuels the exact same online outrage. Almost every day there&#39;s a &#34;&lt;company&gt; did bad thing to me&#34; article on the front page and people immediately pick up their pitchforks and join the mob. You cannot fix the problem without acknowledging that we are all part of it."</p>

Corporate taxes are being reduced because companies are moving profits to foreign jurisdictions.3. Estate taxes &amp; income taxes are being avoided by the creation of charitable foundations.The 2nd and 3rd points are very valid, and I wish the author had spent more time on them.  Unfortunately instead, the author spends much more time on point 1, conflating wealth with income, and avoiding the obvious argument that capital gains are eventually taxed - the rich are not escaping that....unless point 3 (foundation) occurs.  And that should be the main story.Squabbling over a wealth tax is not useful.  The real issue is that the super rich create these personal &#34;foundations&#34; that act as never-taxed income holes, and then use them as personal and political tools.In total, there&#39;s nothing very revealing about this article.  It&#39;s everything we&#39;ve already known.  IMO, we need to curb foreign tax havens, and severely limit tax exemptions for charitable donations.A more interesting question is how did ProPublica get a copy of Jeff Bezos&#39; tax returns.  Seems like a leak at the IRS?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article does not conflates income and wealth, stop saying that. This is NOT what it says. 
Thats&#39; the whole damn point, they say that the system &#34;tax the income&#34; is flawed because it allows to borrow as much as your wealth allows, and live your life exactly as if you had that in income, without ever paying the income tax.I am quoting &#34;Their wealth derives from the skyrocketing value of their assets, like stock and property. Those gains are not defined by U.S. laws as taxable income unless and until the billionaires sell&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unless you are a wage or salary earner, it is trivially easy to avoid having to pay taxes, at least in the USA. Same with the much lauded “inheritance tax” and even, to a lesser extent, sales taxes. It costs about 4000us a year to maintain the legal structures required to pay essentially no taxes, except sales taxes in some locations.  In many cases, for lower levels of income, just having a small business can negate income tax burdens.Taxation always has been, and continues to be, a burden for the servile class to bear. The rich or enterprising pay taxes only when they are ill prepared or choose to, often to reduce scrutiny.The &#34; I should pay more taxes&#34; rhetoric from the wealthy is merely virtue signaling, it is totally legal to pay more taxes than you owe, and you can even reclaim the money later if you need to. There is nothing preventing anyone from paying the taxes that they feel that they should owe, in excess of legal requirements.By and large, sales taxes are more evenly applied, but that too is far from perfect."</p>

When you google &#34;flight from a to b&#34;, rather then seeing search results linking to websites for flight search, the first thing you see is the results of Google&#39;s own flight search. Is that wrong? What about image search? When you search for &#34;skyline berlin&#34;, you&#39;ll see images of berlin&#39;s skyline, before you see links to other image search sites.Same is true for a lot other stuff. If you search &#34;timer&#34;, you&#39;ll see a timer, not links to various timers that look ugly as shit.As a consumer, I love it. So much easier.On the other hand, google could take over almost any business like this. At least, any business that is &#34;functional&#34; in the sense that the only thing you really want is to get some output based on your input.There&#39;s a clear tradeoff here between what&#39;s good for consumers, and concerns about democracy, the concentration of power, etc..

The only variables your Terraform code should have should be credentials / other secrets that are not loaded from environment variables by providers. A great public example of this usage pattern is supplied by https://github.com/concourse/governance to manage their GitHub repositories."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been sitting on the fence wrt Terraform and other such tools for quite some time now. After being _forced_ to finally write massive k8s YAML files (and ansible YAML files) for a consulting gig, I&#39;ve been wondering whether these tools should be developed as _libraries_, that you glue together using a full-fledged programming language, instead of shoe-horning a programming language in YAML.For example, could the following be library functions that you could glue together in the programming language of your choice: (a) get current state of infra, (b) calculate diff between desired state and current state, (c) perform a single step (safely) that represents a granular change in infra, (d) perform a series of steps representing infra changes with safe rollback?Does something like this already exist?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Congrats to the talented people at Hashicorp.I love Terraform and have used it for years (before 0.12 I think). The workflow, meaningful diffs and reproducible &#39;infrastructure-as-code&#39; gave a user experience that really was a massive step up to what I was used to (basically cloud console and scripts in CI).In fact the Terraform workflow / philosophy inspired some of the design of an OSS &#39;data-as-code&#39; tool (https://www.getsynth.com/) that we&#39;re building a company around. We wanted to use HCL instead of JSON for our config to start off with, but the Rust HCL parsers when we started the project weren&#39;t really robust so we settled.Anyway, congratulations Hashicorp!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good essay overall, but this footnote in particular stood out to me:&gt; [2] Tiger parents, as parents so often do, are fighting the last war. Grades mattered more in the old days when the route to success was to acquire credentials while ascending some predefined ladder. But it&#39;s just as well that their tactics are focused on grades. How awful it would be if they invaded the territory of projects, and thereby gave their kids a distaste for this kind of work by forcing them to do it. Grades are already a grim, fake world, and aren&#39;t harmed much by parental interference, but working on one&#39;s own projects is a more delicate, private thing that could be damaged very easily.It&#39;s so true. I got obsessed with programming around 11, started off with my shitty vb6 programs and moved on to reverse engineering video games and writing hacks. I never told any adults what I was doing until I was nearly an adult myself, out of fear they&#39;d ruin my hobby like they did everything else. I remember thinking to myself how much school sucked and being determined not to let that poison the one thing I liked worked on. My parents thought I was a degenerate who did nothing but play computer games all day. Blew them away when I got my first programming job and eventually skipped college to start working right out of high school.I have a bunch of friends who say the same thing. They&#39;d find some new cool thing, show even the slightest interest in it and their mom would immediately start making them drill it three hours a day until they hated it and weren&#39;t interested in it anymore. It&#39;s a sad story."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Jared Diamond, in his book &#34;The Day Before Yesterday&#34;, talks about how children in Papua New Guinea when he was an anthropologist there would play at making a garden or raising pigs.  The kid would have a toy, wooden pig, and then eventually be given a piglet, and then gradually their &#34;play&#34; would become more realistic until it shaded into adult work.My daughter, as a youngun&#39;, wanted to play &#34;coffeeshop&#34; where she would set up a coffeeshop at home and charge her mother and I for drinks.  I think this says something about how much she saw the inside of coffeeshops while I was programming there.The main obstacle to still using the play-better-until-it&#39;s-real path, is that we don&#39;t have a good way for kids to see what adults are doing, in most jobs.  Otherwise, their natural instincts are still to &#34;play&#34; at doing what they see the adults doing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another aspect of personal projects is that if they’re truly enjoyable they can be a kind of salve for burnout.* If you feel like you can’t even open your IDE, a personal project can generate the excitement that reinvigorates your passion.There’s also less of a speed limit with personal projects — the things like: “before you go down that road let’s talk with X; hold off on that idea for now; let’s wait until...”This freedom is conducive to learning new things. My career success rests heavily on skills I gained pursuing personal projects, where I was able to try ridiculously complicated or “out there” ideas. I’ve worked for people in the past who were strongly against me spending free time on personal projects, but benefited from all the skills I had gained doing so. Beware of this mindset — it’s fear based and leads to unsuccessful outcomes in other ways.* Side note is: careful not to burn out on what’s supposed to be a fun personal project."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice that the cost has come down. Unfortunately, that which makes electric cars and planes feasible, namely energy density (Wh/litre) and specific energy (Wh/kg), has not improved that rapidly. The article mentions a factor of 3.4 over 30 years for energy density, ie 4% p.a., or doubling every 17 years. I think electric aircraft need another doubling or two in specific energy to become feasible, so another few decades :-/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; on the good side of things, getting an Intel CPU to enter the red state is not easy to accomplish. In fact, it should never happen unless there are vulnerabilities in the Intel Management Engine (ME), an almost undocumented subsystem present in all Intel CPUs since 2008 that Intel says is required to provide full performance.&#34;unless there are vulnerabilities or backdoors in the Intel Management Engine (ME)&#34;.There, fixed it for you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My initial guess was &#34;WRMSR, and the 64-bit version of WRMSR&#34;. Fortunately, this appears to be an actually new finding rather than the memorable case a few years back of someone claiming to have discovered something that was clearly documented in the datasheet.The whole idea that there&#39;s a &#34;red state&#34; and a bunch of others on a CPU, normally hidden, should immediately raise the attention of many who wonder what those extra modes can do, and more interestingly, why they&#39;re hidden. From the (very little!) research I&#39;ve done, it appears this is not unlike SGX where only Intel has the key[1] to some part of the hardware you bought from them, and based on some leaked internal documents, it&#39;s very plausible that this is indeed a backdoor which only they can use. Ostensibly, for debugging purposes. Here&#39;s a previous comment I made on this: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26521359[1] If these keys were leaked, which I very much hope will happen at some point, no doubt the &#34;security&#34; community will be heavily against it and spread plenty of FUD about how it makes everyone&#39;s computers insecure. But IMHO it should be eagerly awaited and received with the same optimism as the other DRM key leaks (HDCP, HDDVD, etc.) --- it is a path to freedom."</p>

It&#39;s a double whammy, in that the network has been blown wide open and the AFP is now telling Ayik to hand himself in to avoid recriminations from his associates.  No doubt there will be a movie about this one."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As to how the FBI got access to the messages, Vice says[1] after Vincent Ramos of Phantom Secure was arrested in 2018, a confidential human source offered Anom, which the source was developing, to the FBI (probably in exchange for immunity or a reduced sentence, in my opinion). The source then seeded Anom phones to his existing distributors as a replacement for Phantom Secure phones, and from their they made their way into criminal organisations.[1] https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgkwj/operation-trojan-shie..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What we&#39;ve learned is only what was in Austrlia&#39;s piece of the cake, given they started their day already. New Zeland had theirs already, too. I imagine thousands of arrests are still happening worldwide and several press conferences are going to be held today. Looking at the seal of the operation (https://www.anom.io/trojan_shield_seal.jpg), following countries participated in the operation:
Canada, Australia, US, Sweden, The Netherlands, Lithuania, Finland, Hungary, Norway, Austria, UK, New Zeland, Estonia, Scotland, Germany, Denmark.I expect this to be bigger than Panama Papers. Way bigger. I expect a few prominent politicians to be soon either arrested  or &#34;convinced&#34; to step down. I expect the US to have gained a lot of intel and leverage over those from the countries who did not participate in this. We will absolutely not learn about everything they discovered. CIA will and the respective intelligence agencies will.EDIT: Europol will hold their conference live on YouTube at 10 AM CST: https://twitter.com/janoorth/status/1402164252266409987EDIT 2: given how Serbia was in the top 4 of messages sent, I really hope that the info gathered will help Interpol fight child trafficking and exploitation in the EU.From the VICE article (https://www.vice.com/en/article/akgkwj/operation-trojan-shie...) quoted elsewhere here:&#34;Additionally, the review of Anom messages has initiated numerous high-level public corruption cases in several countries. The most prominent distributors are currently being investigated by the FBI for participating in an enterprise which promotes international drug trafficking, money laundering, and obstruction of justice.&#34;&#34;Late Monday, the FBI said that it would be holding &#34;a news conference announcing a massive worldwide takedown based on the San Diego FBI’s unprecedented investigation involving the interception of encrypted communications&#34; on Tuesday.&#34;"</p>
