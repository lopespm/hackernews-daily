								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These advertising networks are destroying web performance. Most of these &#34;Supercookies&#34; are optimizations to improve performance. By abusing them, advertisers have turned what should be a great performance tool into a liability. I know FF suggests this won&#39;t significantly affect most websites performance, but web advertising and trackers are already responsible for a huge chunk of performance issues already.Of course we&#39;ll have the inevitable guy pop in here and talk up how awesome web tracking is because it helps sites monetize better, but that&#39;s all bullshit. At this point, all the advertising profits are sucked out of the web by Facebook and Google. The rest of the industry, including publishers are just struggling to get by while two trillion dollar behemoths throw them scraps."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;In the case of Firefox’s image cache, a tracker can create a supercookie by  “encoding” an identifier for the user in a cached image on one website, and then “retrieving” that identifier on a different website by embedding the same image.&#34;Clever. And so frustrating that optimisations need to be turned off due to bad actors."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Per-site caching negates the principal selling point of centrally-hosted JS and resources, including fonts. The convenience remains, but all speed-related perks (due to the resources being reused from earlier visits to unrelated sites) are no more... which is actually great, because it reduces the value that unscrupulous free CDN providers can derive from their &#34;properties&#34;.It also means that I can remove fonts.google.com from the uBlock blacklist.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I run a small company and offer an app to monitor sales reps work. Managers use it also to see how much time employees spend in the field. To count how much time is spend in some specific location my app uses background location updates.10 years ago I was distributing just the apk file. Then I moved to Play store. It turned out that most people on their company owned Android devices don&#39;t configure Play Store. App updates are disabled until you log in. So I had to educate my customer employees how to log in to Play Store and install my app. The additional benefit was that people had security updates of Chrome and other apps.Two months ago my app was suspended after I made all necessary changes to support Android 10. The Gbot claims that background location updates aren&#39;t essential for my app. As you may guess I wrote appeal without success. My customers pay mainly for that time report feature but Gbot knows better what my paying customers want.And I just do not care about securing my customer devices and Play Store any longer. Now I distribute apk files again and train people how to install apk files from unknown sources."</p>

There&#39;s plenty of alternative stores, it&#39;s easy to set up one yourself for your apps, and you can always distribute your apk files through your website."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://pgm.di.unipi.it/">PGM Indexes: Learned indexes that match B-tree performance with 83x less space</a></h3>
				</div>
				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25899286">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Some context: A few years ago, there was a paper from Google (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3183713.3196909) that made learned data structures popular for a while. They started from the idea that indexes such as B-trees approximate an increasing function with one-sided error. By using that perspective and allowing two-sided error, they were able to make the index very small (and consequently quite fast).Many data structure researchers got interested in the idea and developed a number of improvements. The PGM-index is one of those. Its main idea is to use piecewise linear approximations (that can be built in a single quick pass over the data) instead of the machine learning black box the Google paper was using."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a major practical advance from the succinct data structure community.This community has produced so many brilliant results in the past years. But, they work in the shadows. Since the rise of interest in neural network methods, I&#39;ve often described their work as &#34;machine learning where epsilon goes to 0.&#34; It&#39;s not sexy, but it is extremely useful.For instance, Ferragina previously helped to develop the FM-index that enabled the sequence alignment algorithms used for the primary analysis of short genomic reads (100-250bp). These tools were simply transformative, because they reduced the amount of memory required to write genome mappers by orders of magnitude, allowing the construction of full-text indexes of the genome on what was then (~2009) commodity hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get it. I&#39;ve implemented B-trees. The majority of space the used by a B-tree is the data itself. Each N-ary leaf of the tree is a basically a vector of data with maybe some bookkeeping at the ends. The leaves are more than half of the tree.Sure, you can compress the data. But that depends on the data, completely random data can&#39;t be compress. Other data can be. But a point blank 83x space claim seems bizarre - or it&#39;s comparing to a very inefficient implementation of a B-tree.Edit: It seems the 83x claim is a product of the HN submission. I could not find it on the page. But even the page should say something like &#34;a compressed index that allows full speed look-up&#34; (akin to succinct data structures) and then it would make sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I had once suggested that the main page be woven out of a combination of popular + new, perhaps 50/50:1. popular2. new3. popular4. newThis injects a lot of noise into the front page, because most of new is noise, but it helps.Another option is to front-load popular stories, then have 10-20 &#34;new&#34; items at the bottom of the page. That way the front page remains highly salient, but anyone who merely scrolls more will also see a small chunk of new. So 1-30 popular (as it is now), then 30-45 new (making the frontpage longer)."</p>

Many of them seem reasonable submissions (not on TV, not click bait), so I keep wondering why they are flagged. Not sure if some people flag duplicates, but finding out whether it is duplicate takes quite a while, especially on a phone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ask yourself, how much brighter is it outside than inside (assuming a sunny day vs a brightly lit office)?Before looking into this, I would have guessed 2X or 3X, but would you believe it&#39;s actually over 100X!I bet most people&#39;s guess would also be off by 1 or 2 orders of magnitude.Even outdoors in the shade, it is over 50X brighter than indoors.(For specific numbers and comparisons, see: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6656201/ )Apparently, our eyes adjust so quickly to the difference that we have a very poor sense of the magnitude of light change between indoors and outdoors.I bring this up because one of the largest factors in myopia development appears to be outdoor light exposure in childhood.Genetics are likely a factor too, but light exposure seems to have a huge effect: 
&#34;The prevalence of myopia in 6- and 7-year-old children of Chinese ethnicity was significantly lower in Sydney (3.3%) than in Singapore (29.1%), while patterns of daily outdoor light exposure showed that children living in Singapore were exposed to significantly less daily outdoor light than Australian children.&#34; (from the same study linked above)The obvious takeaway for parents, schools, and governments: ensure your children have plenty of outdoor playtime. It will greatly reduce instances of myopia (not to mention the benefits from higher Vitamin D levels, exercise, etc)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Off on a complete tangent here, only remotely related.Yo, fellow four-eyed geeks.I noticed that when lying down and looking up in a room with a light source, with my glasses on, if there is a small droplet of water on the lens (say, due to having just cleaned the glasses and not wicked up every last drop), this droplet can bend the light in such a way that when it subsequently hits the cornea and pupa, a perfectly straight, parallel beam of light passes through the vitreous humor right to the retina.The consequence of this is that all the junk floating in your eye is rendered in &#34;4K clarity&#34; in a circle of light, regardless of whether it is next to the retina, or floating somewhere in the middle.Imperfections in your cornea or elsewhere are also rendered, making themselves evident."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Correcting? They mean temporarily  cure... If this works, it&#39;s fascinating!One thing I have been wondering for a while, and I thought this what it was when I read the title, is, why can&#39;t we have zoom lenses with a camera turned inword to the retina applying autofocus algorithms?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ken White has been talking about the potential for this suit for a couple weeks now. He spends a lot of time talking about what isn&#39;t defamation --- people use defamation suits and threats thereof to chill free speech, and he&#39;s a 1st Amendment guy --- but the Dominion cases are apparently examples of very serious defamation cases.The core of defamation is (1) a false statement of purported fact that (2) causes damage (there are some exceptions to (2) that aren&#39;t relevant here). Most defamation cases you hear about fall apart on (1) - they target non-falsifiable statements of opinion, which can&#39;t be defamation because they don&#39;t purport to relate an objective fact. What makes Dominion&#39;s cases terrifying is that they are chock full of purported facts, all of which are batshit, and have so devastated Dominion&#39;s reputation, in a reputation-intensive business, that it had to hire private security to protect its employees from death threats.What makes the case challenging for Dominion is that they will almost certainly be treated as a public figure for the purposes of the case. The standard for defamation of a public figure is higher than that of a normal person; we add a condition (3): actual malice or negligence, meaning Dominion must show that Giuliani either intended to destroy Dominion&#39;s reputation by spreading facts he knew to be false, or that he was at least negligent, acting with reckless disregard for the truth.The problem is that it&#39;s not totally clear whether Giuliani believed any of his crazy-talk. It may actually be the case that Giuliani is just off his rocker. If he himself was sold by the (false) facts he received from others, he is a more difficult defamation target.Here&#39;s attorney Akiva Cohen analyzing the case a bit:https://twitter.com/AkivaMCohen/status/1353700596407283721"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think it&#39;s nuts for a modern democracy to allow for anything but open source software being used to count paper ballots with chain-of-custody records, voter ID validation, biometric markings, and redacted ballots being published on the web for all to view and count independently.Software systems can easily be hacked, and it isn&#39;t easy to inspect and tell. A vote is a one time, one sided transaction. It&#39;s not as easy to detect fraud in an election as it is with say, a double entry banking record."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a superb set of resources for anyone interested in the history of computing in the 80s and 90s. I&#39;d go so far as to say it&#39;s great even if you don&#39;t intend to watch the show (although you should!). I wish this had existed back when I was teaching history of technology.One of the best decisions the show made was to set the series at a series of fictitious minor companies and startups struggling down there in the trenches of the computer revolution without ever quite making it big. This avoids the trap of teleology and gives you a sense of how things could easily have turned out differently. It is why the show is so much better as both computing history and drama than all those films about Apple or Steve Jobs and the rest that tediously rehash the same stories of the winners. (Although one of the main characters, Joe Macmillan, has some Jobs-like character features. I do not mean this as a compliment.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve probably said this before, but I was a computer engineer in Texas in the 80s and this show captures that culture perfectly.* I first learned &#34;Halt and Catch Fire&#34; as an obscure illegal instruction on the 6800 processor that would lock it up. When I heard about this show my first reaction was &#34;How dare they title a show with a meme from an obscure part of my hindbrain! Guess I can&#39;t use that for a password any more.&#34;*Well almost perfectly. I don&#39;t remember many engineers or coders being as attractive as the actors on this show."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The strange thing is that the “instruction” Halt and Catch Fire originated in a joke System/360 “green card” (reference summary) from the 1960s, along with Rewind and Break Tape, Execute (or Punch) Operator, and many others I&#39;ve long since forgotten. Reference is sometimes made to an undocumented Motorola 6800 instruction, but the term is from the Big Iron era, and has nothing to do with personal computing. It&#39;s really from the &#34;Blinkenlichts&#34; era, when people commonly put up cartoons in the machine room showing a floating-point adder as a snake in a birdbath.By the way, Big Iron&#39;s abilities in the physical world were real. I occasionally operated a System/360 with 4 2311 disk drives, 7.5MB monsters with the form factor of washing machines. When running the IBM sort program, these clunkers were apt to move around the machine room."</p>

The aim is to stimulate demand to develop an industry. Large cities also banned motorbikes and scooters, with the same aim.This is no way market driven demand, BYD is a very interesting company to look into. It is my understanding that Warren buffet has a large share in this company.My believe is China sees oil dependence as a long term strategic weakness. In the event of a navel blockade it will be much harder for them to get the oil they need to run the economy. If a large part of the consumer sector is driven by electric powered by local sources (coal, hydro, nuclear) they can keep the logistic channels open. As a side benefit they get to fund a sector hoping to have the same success as they did with solar panels.The article might have pointed this out but it was paid past a certain point on my device."</p>

That said, watching perl trying to kill perl5 with perl6 (unsuccessful) and python trying to kill python 2 with python 3 (more successful) it struck me how ridiculous it is that open source languages have to put up with this.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m in an awkward chain of dependencies.  You see, in my industry there are very few players, and the current version of their software depends on much functionality and rather exacting specifications from products which are made using ArcGIS 10.2.1.  Not 10.2.  Not 10.2.2.This is a very conservative hunk of software because this is not a &#34;move fast and break things&#34; industry.  This is a &#34;people die when we screw up&#34; industry.  So they haven&#39;t moved from ArcGIS 10.2.1 for our version.  Change is coming but they have to be careful.So ArcGIS 10.2.1 comes with a python install of 2.7.2 (I am pretty sure it is .2).  And you are very strongly advised NOT TO UPGRADE THAT in big bold letters on the relevant help pages.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To reiterate, the APIs were not designed to be used by third-party software, so short of a complete rewrite, there is no unfortunately no option.The unfortunate (for Google) reality is (as had already been pointed out to this fellow multiple times before he said that): whether they turn off these Linux distros&#39; keys, people can still write third-party software to (ab)use these APIs, using Google&#39;s own keys. The CFAA is only going to keep legit uses from using Google&#39;s keys. This does not, in any way, fix the issue that Google is claiming it fixes."</p>

https://github.com/brave/go-syncI doubt Chromium authors would accept changes to authentication (even if you put guards around it like `#ifndef GOOGLE_CHROME_BRANDING`). If there were a 100% compatible service available, you can change the service URL using CLI arg `--sync-url`There is also a local sync backend which is interesting as it writes to disk. You could potentially sync this via OneDrive or something similar. You can enable with the CLI arg `--enable-local-sync-backend`. Directory settable using `--local-sync-backend-dir`You can watch the data being synced via chrome://sync-internals"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been 100% remote and run remote teams since 2014 and I promise that it won&#39;t stick for the broader society. Here&#39;s why:1. Socializing is the primary activity that happens at work for the vast majority of workers. The gal or guy coming by your desk to &#34;check in&#34; or &#34;see how your weekend was&#34; etc... is literally where they find their social outlets and personal connections.2. Managers like to be able to watch their direct reports because it makes them feel more in control than they are3. The commuting routine, even if it&#39;s a nightmare, offers a sense of normalcy that most people have gotten used to and in a weird way rely on for grounding.4. For a huge swath of Americans at least, work is an escape from the drudgery of the home.To truly work from home 100% of the time you have to be a master at controlling yourself and your ability to be distracted. Most people don&#39;t have this control and need a framework to insert themselves into. Add to that the contextual dimension of an &#34;other&#34; place that is a world apart from your home life and you have something that allows for a depressurization for most people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a little disappointed at the percentage of comments which extrapolate personal anecdotes into societal behavior, and without addressing the data in this study - even to poke holes in the methodology, which is totally fair game (though IMO quite good, especially for what they had to work with).The whole point of a 15,000-person survey like this is so that we&#39;re not all stuck guessing based on our own experiences. Obviously one can argue that what employers were telling employees they would do post-COVID as of October 2020 is not what employers will actually do (and give reasons why!), but it&#39;s still likely to be more accurate than any individual&#39;s speculation (including mine!).In particular, the survey addressed 2 topics that a lot of comments seem to not incorporate:1. At population, employer, and individual level, it&#39;s not either/or. The paper title doesn&#39;t do a good job of conveying this. All 3 entities seem open to everything on the continuum, based on their employees, work type, and so on.Statements like &#34;I promise that it won&#39;t stick for the broader society&#34; imply a more binary outcome than the survey results predict (and maybe than anything predicts). The survey concludes that, of the roughly 50% of employees who can work from home, they&#39;ll average 2 days per week (or 23% of total hours worked). IOW, WFH doesn&#39;t need to move everyone all the time in order to have massive effects. Some people changing some of the time is enough.2. Employer plans vs. employee desires. Lots of commenters state their preferences and then try to generalize from that, but.. the survey captured that too. To just skim those results, scroll to page 60 for employee-desired vs. employer-planned % of working days. Gist: if WFH is roughly the same productivity, employers plan ~22% of days and employees desire ~45% of days to be WFH. In all productivity cases, employees preferred a higher % of days to be WFH than employers.Page 43 shows answers to the pay raise or cut employees would take in order to work from home 2-3 days per week.It also breaks down the change in perception about WFH by demographic cohort on page 55. For example, those with no children and those with children at home both had significant improvements in their perception of WFH. Those with children had more improvement in perception than those without children. As the study wrote: &#34;This 23 percent figure [post-COVID WFH as a % of full time days] is almost five times larger than in the pre-pandemic time use data, but still half as large as what workers want in a post-pandemic world.&#34;Of course, there&#39;s a place for speculation and anecdotes. This paper - and hopefully soon, more studies like it - should let us evolve from speculating based on only our personal experience to thinking about its methodology and results."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is ironic coming from Stanford, who is currently fucking up every single aspect of their handling of covid, as many Stanford students will attest to. Colleges are basically scammers at this point. The whole benefit of going to college is being able to meet like-minded smart, young people like yourself. Remote college isn&#39;t a thing and never will be. College is about people, as much as it is about learning. The unfortunate K-12 and college students are learning this the hard way.Personally, I don&#39;t think that remote is here to stay. I think working will be augmented by remote tools, but it cannot be replaced by remote. Humans just aren&#39;t robots and they need community, and work is the biggest source of community after college. To me, online college is a complete joke and is not what students after high school need. It&#39;s just not healthy.  Humans need interaction in person, and they do their best work when they are working with people who they see on a weekly basis, especially young 20-somethings.This whole thing is becoming evident as people are starting to really just not care for the lockdowns at this point. Parks in SF are a complete shitshow because people want to be out and about. You will never be able to force them to be purely remote, and after covid, if your company is purely remote, you will not attract the best young talent, period. You might attract older folks, but you know you want young talent.This whole thing makes no sense."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something particularly concerning about this incident is buried further down in the article.Under the heading &#34;Why Facebook Doesn&#39;t Ban Everyone&#34;, Lincoln explains how social network theory can identify individuals in networks that are influential. This isn&#39;t an exaggeration - basic graph heuristics (such as comparing in/out degree of an individual relative to other parts of the social graph) can easily identify such individuals. Censoring those individuals can have an amplified effect on the graph structure as a whole.For an example of how just a few individuals can make a big difference on graph structure, check out Watts &amp; Strogatz&#39;s 1998 paper, Collective dynamics of &#39;small-world&#39; networks [0][1]. I&#39;d highly recommend reading it - it&#39;s very short and easy to understand.Essentially, a small number of connectors connecting with random individuals can seriously reduce the average number of steps to connect any two individuals. If Facebook wanted to stop the spread of a narrative that they didn&#39;t like, censoring just these few individuals would make it much harder for information to flow through the graph as a whole, and hardly anyone would notice (since Facebook&#39;s only censoring a few people.)Scary.[0]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watts–Strogatz_model[1]: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9623998/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think FB has a fundamental issue here, which is that:1) they don&#39;t feel they can NOT police content2) they are wayyyyy too big to police content manually3) any AI they train to police content, is not going to be able to state clearly why a given post/account was banned, and anyway...4) if you state objective, clear rules that are automated, it will be pretty easy to game them (e.g. using euphemisms or code words for objectionable content)I don&#39;t see how FB can get out of this situation.  Any social network that is as large as it is, which relies on advertising (and thus cannot be as content-neutral as e.g. phone companies are regarding what you talk about on the phone), is going to face the same situation.Of course, if FB ends up getting way smaller as a result, that would be fine by me.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Stress resilience is one of the most important things when it comes to knowledge work, also one of the most neglected aspect. Mindfulness, stoicism, exercise help, but nothing helps as much as a good night sleep. Also the other thing people usually fail to note is the vicious stress-sleep cycle (lack of sleep induced stress &lt;-&gt; stress induced lack of sleep). It took me years to realize that so much of my problems with bedtime revenge, burnout, non-clinical depression, permastress was basically just lack of quality sleep. FWIW, it helps to think of productivity in terms of sleep and stress when you are working in the knowledge economy. Just like sleep debt, you can also accumulate productivity debt due to lack of stress resilience, lack of sleep, which can eventually lead to things like burnout."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had great success picking up a consistent meditation habit with the greasing the groove-approach[1].. in essence, every time I would feel a bit foggy in the head, I would take a 3-15 minute meditation session. It usually results to 3-5 sessions per day. It&#39;s such a great mental reset, and I haven&#39;t since experienced the kind of complete depletion that you get from pushing yourself hard through the day.I bet some Zen master would reprimand me for this being the wrong approach, but I found it quite difficult to get into the habit of doing, say, a single 30-60 minute session per day. Now I can consistently drop into the meditation session with no urge for procrastination and have also successfully experimented with longer ones.[1] refers to the method of increasing your pull-up capability by installing a pull-up bar in your office / bedroom doorway and doing a set every time you pass through the doorway"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many of us are wearing devices with continuous optical heart rate monitors. Heart rate variability at rest is one of the best indicators of stress and these devices are pretty good at estimating sleep duration and sleep cycles.Regulators need to recognize that continuous tracking devices are a new tool for establishing a health baseline and they should not be expected to match the performance of single-test medical devices. Apple, Garmin, and Fitbit need to build standards to share this baseline data with medical professionals and offer analytics to determine when changes occur.Questionnaire based medicine seems backwards given the digital tools available."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"WhatsApp worldwide usage is estimated to be more than 2B+ users. Even if this article is accurate, it doesn’t really mean much. In the HN bubble lots of people have migrated to Signal with all of their contacts but outside of that bubble nothing much seems to be happening. Note that I’m not agreeing with these changes, I’m just observing reality.To put things into perspective, let’s assume that 25M users (as stated in the article) actually moved to Telegram - which I use and like by the way. Let’s assume they fully moved and stopped using WhatsApp (very unlikely). That means less than 1.25% users moved to another platform - and this means assuming many things that aren’t probably real.It reminds me a bit of the articles about DuckDuckGo vs Google where many people think big changes in usage are happening while ignoring that the average Joe will keep using whatever it’s using unless there’s way too much trouble to continue using it."</p>

Grocers, delivery people — it goes on. My bank and credit card relationship managers communicate with me on WhatsApp. They are never &#34;migrating to&#34; Signal.I am the only one among my contacts who will be moving away from WhatsApp — everyone else (among my people who are using Signal sparsely or actively as of now) have WhatsApp installed and will keep it.Most of my recent Signal convert contacts have already started replying on Signal after hours or days, some have uninstalled. Most of those people will soon uninstall it is what I expect.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I understand why FB needs to do this, but the execution was so out of touch it&#39;s bizarre. My elderly parents called me and were alarmed that WhatsApp is threatening with removing their account unless they agree to share their data. They wondered if FB will be able to track their transactions or perhaps even get into their bank accounts. After years in the tech industry, I&#39;ve learned that my parents&#39; feedback is a good predictor for how well my messaging will be perceived by the wider world. I would have assumed that at FB they would do something similar (or rather, that their testing is 100x more sophisticated), so it&#39;s bizarre that they would miss the mark with messaging and with their prediction of overall success when it came to something so strategically important and sensitive."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For any non-Brits, the SWP is the main left of Labour party in Britain. As a student in the 80s I remember them as an earnest, way too serious bunch of ideological zombies ranting into microphones at the Student&#39;s Union about the latest crimes against humanity perpetrated by &#39;Thatcher&#39;. They&#39;re the kind of people that come up to you in the street with leaflets about some atrocity in Africa and shout &#34;Would you murder children&#34; at you. I&#39;m not entirely sure they&#39;d recognise what an actual &#39;Worker&#39; was if they met one. I always found them quite comical.However they are a serious party, they&#39;re a highly motivated  and active movement with significant influence in the Labour Party grass roots. They&#39;re sort of our equivalent of Antifa in that they are a significant organising presence in lefty street protests, but much more politically active and spend a lot of time in conferences and action committees wondering what Capitalism ever did for us.Importantly, they are in no way shape or form a terrorist or criminal organisation. I would not be at all surprised if some ultra-violent or would-be Red Army Faction types joined or associated with them, but that&#39;s not at all who the SWP are as an organisation. They&#39;re the well meaning, impressionable white middle class girl next door with a class guilt complex and a side shave that&#39;s been going to BLM protests.If they are getting banned by Facebook something has gone horribly wrong. Quite possibly some of them got a bit excited and posted things they shouldn&#39;t, so I&#39;m not saying this is for sure Facebook&#39;s fault, but they&#39;re not about to murder any bobbies in Parliament Square."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How is this not foreign political interference?The UK media has been preaching to us about dangers of Russian election interference for years at this point, but simultaneously they seem completely unconcerned that a handful of wealthy Americans how the power to censor popular media outlets, entire political movements and political activists at a whim.The SWP is massive. I don&#39;t know for sure, but I suspect they had millions of followers on Facebook. This isn&#39;t some fringe, extremist group by any sane interpretation of those terms.It seems we&#39;re now quickly moving on from just censoring those with extremist political views to simply censoring anyone who who dares express a non-establishment political view online."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a positive thing for these ejections to be across the political spectrum, because it makes the demand for distributed moderation come from across the political spectrum.I hope that demand congeals on support for an open blogging protocol, such that people can very easily post once and direct it to multiple platforms or any listener. If this becomes popular enough, and posts aren&#39;t owned by a particular platform, the big platforms lose their power to control the conversation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;People who do this are generally trying to be polite by not jumping right into the request, like one would in person or on the phone - and that&#39;s great!Different people have different reasons but I notice that many people that do a naked &#34;hi&#34; / &#34;hey&#34; are trying to see if the receiver is present for an immediate reply.In other words, the sender deliberately wants a synchronous instead of asynchronous convo.They don&#39;t want to type out a bunch of words for a question if the reply isn&#39;t going to happen for a few hours.EDIT to reply:  &#34;Then send it in an email.&#34;To clarify, some people don&#39;t want an async communication so switching to email doesn&#39;t solve their problem at all.The issue is that some personality styles do not like sending questions into an indeterminant void.  Thus, a naked &#34;hi&#34; for them is shorthand for &#34;r u there to talk to me RIGHT NOW?&#34;I sympathize with their need for immediacy but I made a previous comment on why it drives me crazy:  https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=17255452Yep, some people are really confused as to why many async-preference people like me do not want to answer the phone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will forever associate Larry King with the movie “Spin”. [1] It’s a rather brilliant indie documentary about the 1992 (Bill Clinton / HW Bush) election based on a fascinating technological element: back then, Satellite TV feeds would often just keep running during commercial breaks, or warmups.So the director recorded a TON of footage from these moments where the politicians and news anchors acted themselves, seemingly unaware that anyone was watching.The segments with Larry King are, um, memorable. Very candid moments.1: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(1995_film)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned English watching Larry King Live, because that was my father&#39;s favourite talkshow during the 90s.I didn&#39;t understand half of what was going on in those conversations, but what stuck with me was the broad spectrum of people he interviewed and how consistently respectful he was towards his interviewees."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Always enjoyed his interviews and his style.  I happened to just watched a very short clip of him talking about his fear of death with Norm Macdonald last night.  Guess we all have to face that moment, and even though he had a long and successful life i&#39;m sorry for him and his family now.I linked the clip[1] below, but it may be a bit disconcerting and too soon to view for some.[1] https://youtu.be/8ZKq7CoZv4w"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Materials aging in space is a pretty deep subject. That it is the Russian Zvevda module that is leaking/cracking is likely related to the fact that it is also the oldest module in the ISS.The ISS is/was scheduled to be retired in 2024 (aka 3 years from now) but there are calls to keep it going. My fantasy would be to have SpaceX move it into the Lunar L1 Lagrange point which would keep it in use but it would have to deal with more cosmic rays, also station keeping would be an issue unless we could really get energized tether station keeping to work (lots of solar energy to provide power, but not a lot of mass to provide thrust, so tethers are energized conductors that push against the Earth&#39;s magnetic field)Parking it in L4 or L5 could keep it for future generations but it would be even more of a challenge to go visit."</p>

Every single bullet point, 10/10.Okay, okay, actually I have one qualm~&gt; Standups are actually useful for keeping an eye on the newbies.Unfair. Standups are useful for communication between a team in general, if kept brief. If senior engineer X is working on Y and other engineer M has already dealt with Y (unbeknowst to X), it&#39;s a great chance for X to say &#34;I&#39;m currently looking for a solution to Y&#34; and for M to say &#34;Oh I had to solve that same problem last month!&#34;Seniority has nothing to do with this. Communication/coordination/knowledge-sharing matter at all levels."</p>

I&#39;m a consultant and a lot of my client absolutely insist on using DynamoDB for everything. I&#39;m building an internal facing app that will have users numbering in the hundreds, maybe. The hoops we are jumping through to break this app up into &#34;microservices&#34; are absolutely astounding. Who needs joins? Who needs relational integrity?

Clarity trumps all other concerns.My measurement is &#34;simple and clean&#34; code. Is it simple and clean? No? make it so!&gt; After performing over 100 interviews: interviewing is thoroughly broken. I also have no idea how to actually make it better.If a good developer you know, recommends someone they worked with: It&#39;s almost an instant hire. But for the rest, yeah, it&#39;s incredibly tough.One last thing I like to remind myself: &#34;Good enough is always good enough&#34;. Sometimes &#34;good enough&#34; has a low bar, sometimes high. You always need to reach it, but never want to go too far above it."</p>

There&#39;s a whole street with at least ten different retail vendors/repair shops in Rawalpindi."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Pretty neat. Definitely recycles a lot of electronics in a good way. On the GPIO pins I would definitely replace the connector! I can tell you from experience that even if the pins straighten out, some random plugging/unplugging later and the pin will break off and the next person will end up replacing the connector. This is much easier if you have a setup already for doing the work.This is also a really great way to &#34;pay yourself&#34; to learn to do rework. Buying 200 at £61 and selling the fully restored ones (which appears to &gt; 100) at £9 is at least £900 revenue from the experience. Granted, since you are &#34;learning&#34; that would be slow work at first, but later it would become fairly routine. So something someone in high school could easily do."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; I’m doing it for the blog content and the experience and to hopefully provide you guys with some very cheap Raspberry Pi’s for your projects!One other thing here that makes me happy is that these repaired Pis will not end up in a landfill, which I bet would have otherwise been the end result.  Yes, there are electronics recycling services, but who knows if the original owner would have gone that route, and I imagine there still ends up being quite a bit of unrecycleable waste, not to mention the energy required to do the recycling itself.Meanwhile, I have a thermoelectric wine fridge that died recently.  Looks like it&#39;s the logic board, but the manufacturer doesn&#39;t make them anymore (couldn&#39;t find anything on ebay etc. either).  I feel really awful that I&#39;ll likely have to have to toss the thing due to what is probably a really cheap and easy-to-replace dead part.  (I need to take another look at it to see if there&#39;s something obvious like a blown capacitor that I can replace.)&gt; Instead I will be donating the proceeds of the sales to the Raspberry Pi Foundation and they can decide what to do with the Money!This is just really awesome.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regarding performance, I wrote a bit about this a few months ago in a post comparing different workload isolation techniques:https://fly.io/blog/sandboxing-and-workload-isolation/Two useful links from my Pinboard research for that post:A person at Red Hat optimizing QEMU boot time:http://oirase.annexia.org/tmp/paper.pdfAn Intel deck talking about qemu-lite:http://events17.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slide...(The other thing to follow up on if you&#39;re interested in the background on this stuff is kvmtool).In both cases, a big part of the answer seems to be eliminating BIOS overhead; getting rid of oproms appears to have been the single biggest win for Intel. But the Red Hat article also finds lots of overhead in QEMU itself, and both pieces talk about kernel config issues (for instance, scrubbing the kernel you boot of subsystems that have expensive initcalls).By comparison: Firecracker is purpose-built in Rust for this one task, provides no BIOS, and offers only network, block, keyboard, and serial device support --- with tiny drivers (the serial support is less than 300 lines of code)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Another incredible blog post from Julia Evans.Julia if you&#39;re reading, I&#39;m a big fan.  One request:  could you add the date/time to the post, preferably near the title?I do see a `&lt;time&gt;` tag in the HTML, but it doesn&#39;t render any human readable text.  The datetime is also part of the URL which is &#34;good enough,&#34; but it always takes me a minute to remember that and Ctrl+F won&#39;t find it.I&#39;m a little ADD about knowing when things were published, so far from an average person.

In not so distant future, it looks like Android will sandbox platform workloads (running outside the Android framework?) managed by crosvm, to considerably improve security [3].I looked for but couldn&#39;t find ChromeOS GCP instances. I mean, ChromeOS might be a great platform to run multi-tenant server workloads at this point.[0] https://archive.is/T1ZNJ[1] One can run custom Linux containers (other than the debian-based penguin) but not VMs (other than termina) at this point: https://chromeos.dev/en/linux/linux-on-chromeos-faq[2] https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/master/c...[3] https://lwn.net/Articles/836693/"</p>

To buy Parler&#39;s contract claim, you&#39;d have to believe that Amazon&#39;s lawyers are so stupid that they set out a TOS for the world&#39;s largest hosting provider that didn&#39;t give AWS the right to boot customers, which is something AWS --- really, every hosting provider --- has to do all the time. You almost have to not know anything about the hosting business to think there could be a case here.But if you need to read a judge laughing Parler&#39;s claims off, well, now you can. Real &#34;based&#34; energy in excerpting the AWS AUP in their complaint and clipping it right before the clause that gives AWS the right to terminate service without notice to customers who violate their AUP. The judge, uh, noticed.(As the judge points out, among the many problems with Parler&#39;s restraint of trade argument, there&#39;s the fact that AWS doesn&#39;t host Twitter&#39;s feed.)"</p>

It doesn&#39;t take a genius to know that such a controversial website is going to get dropped, even if it&#39;s just because it makes the webhost look bad.Yes it&#39;s unfair that Twitter gets away with hosting way worse content, but life is unfair, that doesn&#39;t mean you stick your head in the sand and pretend the risk of de-platforming never existed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been trying to come to grips with the societal impact of echo chambers, &#34;hate&#34; speech, and the obligations vs. rights of sites and hosting providers.So far, my take is that websites have less obligation than hosting. It concerns me that AWS booted a site off their platform for speech issues - I am leaning more and more to the idea that colos, IaaS and ISPs should be considered common carriers, and that only a court order should get a site booted off the web entirely."</p>

However, Adium seems kind of dead? Last commit (https://github.com/adium/adium/) was in 2016.I build a MacOSX app bundle for the original Pidgin long time ago (https://sourceforge.net/projects/pidgin-macosx/). At that point in time, this was not so trivial, as the GTK support for native MacOSX was experimental (http://www.gtk-osx.org/). You could simply use the X11 GTK version but I rather wanted to have a native version. I have no idea what the current state is with GTK on MacOSX. This Pidgin build is obviously very outdated now (from 2009), and probably does not run on recent MacOSX versions (they are frequently breaking backward compatibility...)."</p>

I loved Digsby because it acted as a POP client too.I even worked for a company that forked Ignite Realtime Spark and tried adding Gtalk and MSN support.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; On one scuba diving excursion while in the compound having lunch, Brad engaged a couple from Germany in conversation. Brad asked about the fellow travelers occupation and discovered he was a computer programmer. Lifewise, Brad was asked about his life&#39;s work and stated I am also a computer programmer. &#34;What do you do?&#34; Brad was asked. I wrote Objective-C. Astonished, the gentlerman said, &#34;No, Brad Cox wrote that&#34;. &#34;Hi, I am Brad Cox&#34;, was the response and the introduction.Wonderful story. I wish his family all the best.I love Objective-C and consider it a beautiful language. Back in the day I re-discovered my love for programming when I started to learn this language. This was when I was still in the Java world.As a side project I tried to build a drone (unmanned navel vehicle) powered by objective-c. I have abandoned the effort but posted the code on GitHub - it was a joy to work with the language and the funnest side project I’ve worked with.These days I work with python and golang for job/hobby but I always am grateful to have spent time with objective-c. Reflecting back if I haven’t spent time with this language, today I would of not been a programmer.Thank you Brad Cox for your work and positive influence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am giving a talk in work soon around method swizzling in iOS and was delving into the history of Objective-C a bit and came across Alan Kay&#39;s talk about the power of simplicity and how we&#39;ve all screwed up OOP.In the talk, Alan talks about the ant who lives his life on a single plane of existence, the &#34;Gulley World&#34; or &#34;Reality&#34;.The ant goes to work, he finds stuff to eat, he lives his life in this Gulley World, which is depicted as a pink 2D plane. However some times on this pink plane there are little spots of blue. They represent thoughts that don&#39;t belong in the pink plane.Sometimes those blue spots turn into blue planes, and the ant we are following starts to move along that plane instead of the pink one. Everyone in the pink plane thinks he is wrong. Everyone can see the pink plane, in all its reality. It is not until you walk on the blue plane until you can see &#34;another way&#34;.The metaphor being that we developers built a world where we started to take the general idea of OOP and construct a lot of &#34;reality&#34; around it. A lot of process, a lot of formalization so we could build mechanical systems of gears that slotted together. I think Alan&#39;s idea of OOP was something more fluid, more organic than this. The world is messy and we often try to abstract the mess away in these overbearingly weighty and hierarchical programs that everyone agrees is the right way.I think Objective-C was the most widely used and successful walk on this blue plane. Millions of developers were exposed to the idea of message passing as a form of OOP, which is an astounding accomplishment. It really is a neat language, and I had a lot of fun learning it.Brad definitely walked on the blue plane. RIP."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I met him once in the late 1990s, when his travels took him to Zurich and he asked me whether I could book a talk for him at ETH Zurich, where I was a grad student.I did not quite share his confidence in my abilities in that area, but to my relief, Jürg Gutknecht agreed to sponsor the talk, and I got to spend lunch with Brad Cox, Niklaus Wirth, and Jürg Gutknecht. Given their highly divergent aesthetics in language syntax, I expected some fireworks, but the conversation was quite pleasant, even when they were discussing Perl.I was at the time the maintainer of the Mac port of Perl, and had taken some classes with Wirth, but the idea of discussing Perl with him struck me as akin to discussing masturbation with the Pope. However, Wirth conceded that in the area of text processing, general purpose languages tended to be somewhat clumsy, and there had always been a successful niche for languages like Snobol and now Perl.Brad Cox was a splendid conversationalist in many other areas as well. His talk focused on Superdistribution as the next evolution of the Software IC concept, and he very skillfully pitched this to a Swiss audience that a banking nation should be a natural superpower to take the lead in a micropayment world. He was very good at painting visions like this, but I&#39;m not sure how much of it ultimately came to pass:a) I don&#39;t think we&#39;re any closer to plug and play &#34;Software ICs&#34; than we were in the mid-1980s when he introduced the term. In the Objective C ecosystem, the closest there was to that was maybe Interface Builder with its Outlets and Actions, but I think that part did NOT originate with Cox (I may be mistaken, though).b) Likewise, I don&#39;t see any move to distributed micropayments. If anything, more and more of the software revenue seems to come from centrally billed cloud services, e.g. comparing the Microsoft Office revenue model 20 years ago and now."</p>

While I was technically aware of how powerful smallish servers have become, this article really crystallized that for me.64 cores and 24 NVME drives in a 2U spot on a rack is just insane compared to what we used to have to do to get a beefy database server.  And it&#39;s not some exotic thing, just a popular mainstream Dell SKU.If you price it out on Dell&#39;s site, you get a retail price north of $200k.  That is really what made it clear for me.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m thankful for their OpenZFS tuning doc which they developed as part of this server migration: https://github.com/letsencrypt/openzfs-nvme-databasesThe one thing that I get hung up on when it comes to RAID and SSDs is the wear pattern vs. HDDs. Take for example this quote from the README.md:We use RAID-1+0, in order to achieve the best possible performance without being vulnerable to a single-drive failure.Failure on SSDs is predictable and usually expressed with Terabytes Written (TBW). Failure on spinning disk HDDs is comparatively random. In my mind, it makes sense to mirror SSD-based vdevs only for performance reasons and not for data integrity. The reason is that the mirrors are expected to fail after the same amount of TBW, and thus the availability/redundancy guarantee of mirroring is relatively unreliable.Maybe someone with more experience in this area can change my mind, but if it were up to me, I would have configured the mirror drives as spares, and relied on a local HDD-based zpool for quick backup/restore capability. I imagine that would be a better solution, although it probably wouldn&#39;t have fit into tryingq&#39;s ideal 2U space."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Truly mind blowing being able to actually see the atoms align in an instant and the crystal structure just pop into existence.Hard to believe it’s not a computer model. I mean, I guess underneath there must be a hell of a lot of signal processing going on to render that video, but atomic-scale video is wild.Funny that it looks kinda like MPEGS online circa 1990s."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is incredibly cool:&gt; Two novel techniques, atomic-resolution real-time video and conical carbon nanotube confinement, allow researchers to view never-before-seen details about crystal formation. The observations confirm theoretical predictions about how salt crystals form and could inform general theories about the way in which crystal formation produces different ordered structures from an otherwise disordered chemical mixture.&gt; To hold samples in place, we use atom-thick carbon nanohorns, one of our previous inventions. With the stunning videos Sakakibara captured, we immediately noticed the opportunity to study the structural and statistical aspects of crystal nucleation in unprecedented detail.Creating shaped nucleation sites using carbon nanotubes (nanohorns?) sounds like a fascinating technology. I don&#39;t have access to the paper unfortunately - I&#39;m curious what other types of crystals could theoretically be grown with this technology. The authors mention graphite - what about silicon? Could it be used to grow more regular crystals for use in electronics? With fewer defects, I&#39;d imagine we could reduce the failure rate in manufacturing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Salt is just our first model substance to probe the fundamentals of nucleation events,” said University Professor Eiichi Nakamura. “Salt only crystallizes one way. But other molecules, such as carbon, can crystallize in multiple ways, leading to graphite or diamond. This is called polymorphism and no one has seen the early stages of the nucleation that leads to it. I hope our study provides the first step in understanding the mechanism of polymorphism.”I&#39;m amused that Chemists / Physicists also have the word &#34;Polymorphism&#34; and that it means something completely different from the programming term."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) has completed a regulation permitting low volume motor vehicle manufacturers to begin selling replica cars that resemble vehicles produced at least 25 years ago. Congress enacted a DeLorean Motor Company-backed bill backed by the Specialty Equipment Market Association (SEMA) DeLorean Motor Company, and others into law in 2015, which streamlined requirements for small automakers, but implementation was delayed while awaiting the NHTSA regulations. Companies like DeLorean will now be able to apply for authorization to produce and sell vehicles under this program.I assume this means they waive certain modern safety regulations in order to allow companies to make new cars (in low volume) that resemble old cars?&gt; That said, with EV’s becoming more mainstream, we’ve been considering switching to an all-electric as the future. It certainly makes for an easier path through emissions maze which still looms large over any internal combustion engine.That makes sense.  If ever there was a car that looks like it should be an EV, it&#39;s the Delorean.  They could even do a stickshift EV if they wanted to, though most car companies seem to not think it&#39;s worth the complexity/maintenance, and I get the impression that electric motors are hard on transmissions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; 700k paintingsThis figure immediately reminded me of a very interesting EconTalk episode[0] on the management of art museums. The premises from the discussion (as I recall):- Art museums have more than 10x the number of pieces in their archives as they do on display. Some of this art will never be seen by the pubic.- When art galleries charge admission, patrons feel the need to &#34;get their money&#39;s worth&#34; so they rush to see as much of the exhibits as possible, without taking time to thoroughly enjoy anything.- The purpose of art is to be enjoyed. The above two points make this goal much harder.The conclusions:- Museums should be free admission and funded by selling pieces from the archive (really interesting discussion on how this is taboo for curators)The second-order effects:- Patrons can sit and enjoy a very small section of the museum instead of rushing through, since they can simply come back for more later- More people get to see fine art- Second- and third-tier museums start to gain access to better art, since they can simply buy it instead of waiting for estate donations (which go to larger museums)I think it&#39;s worth a listen.[0]: https://www.econtalk.org/michael-ohare-on-art-museums/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"People in the UK should know that the Tate Gallery, being a publicly-funded museum, are required to make any items in their collection available for you to see on request. When studying sculpture I was really interested in a 1972 piece by Marcel Broothaers called Tractatus Logico-Catalogicus and noticed that the Tate had it in their collection. I emailed them and set up a time to visit a warehouse in SE London, and they brought it out for me to look at it. It&#39;s so much better than seeing things in a packed gallery, let alone a packed Tate, and you get a real sense of what the work is like in the flesh, stripped of all the spectacle and didactic trash that generally surrounds works in somewhere like the Tate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I do not get why people are coming down on AWS here. Elastic made the software available under the Apache License. That gives AWS the right to offer this service. Maybe they did not have right to trademarks, there are courts to settle that.AWS contributes improvements to the project. This is just about Elastic and their business model. They could have not made it open source and it probably just would not have been widely used and successful. It is up to Elastic to come up with a business model that works, not blame others if it is not."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"AWS are the good guys here. Elastic built a popular product off the work of countless open source contributors. That&#39;s how they became a market leader in this product space. It&#39;s how open source works. The people who contributed to the product did so with no expectation of reward except that their efforts would remain open source.Elasticsearch got popular, and now Elastic wants to reap all the rewards and make money off the product. They&#39;re free to do that, and create restricted-license or closed-source versions for future enhancements. But the community doesn&#39;t have to buy into that and continue to contribute to what is no longer truly an open source product. AWS is forking it and continuing with the original, truly open source license.This is pretty much exactly what happened to MySQL, and now we have MariaDB, which is a better and truly open source product.AWS does plenty of things worth criticizing, and one can even criticize them in this particular instance for not working with Elastic to provide more support to whatever it was they were asking for. And Elastic may very well have a legitimate gripe about trademarks. But yanking the Apache license out and moving to a more-restrictive license is not the right solution, and is not what everyone who contributed to building the product signed up for.You can&#39;t create an open source project, wait for it to gain market dominance, decide to be less open source, and expect the community to continue contributing.Elastic shot themselves in the foot and now they can either revert their decision or get left behind as the community moves on to what will ultimately end up being the better product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it&#39;s great that AWS has indeed contributed fixes to upstream Elasticsearch, they link to 9 PRs that are generally on the trivial end of the scale.

They might have contributed more, but if there was something significant, they probably would have mentioned.Notable new features like &#34;ultrawarm&#34; they did not attempt to contribute upstream, nor open source at all: https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2020/05/aws-annou..."</p>

You are between 40 and 42 degrees North latitude, and between 58 and 60 degrees West longitude.&#34;&#34;You must be a programmer,&#34; says the balloonist.&#34;I am,&#34; replies the man. &#34;How did you know?&#34;&#34;Well,&#34; says the balloonist, &#34;everything you have told me is technically correct, but I have no idea what to make of your information, and the fact is I am still lost.&#34;The man below says, &#34;You must be a project manager&#34;&#34;I am,&#34; replies the balloonist, &#34;but how did you know?&#34;&#34;Well,&#34; says the man, &#34;you don&#39;t know where you are or where you are going.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"(Not my joke)At a recent real-time Java conference, the participants were given an awkward question to answer:
&#34;If you had just boarded an airliner and discovered that your team of programmers had been responsible for the flight control software, how many of you would disembark immediately?&#34;
Among the forest of raised hands only one man sat motionless. When asked what he would do, he replied that he would be quite content to stay aboard. With his team&#39;s software, he said, the plane was unlikely to even taxi as far as the runway, let alone take off."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an oldie (I first heard it in the 80s) but is one of my all time favorites.  While it can be told about any two classes of people it really applies to a lot of code I encounter:  A physicist is showing a thermos to her friend, a programmer.

  &#34;It&#39;s amazing&#34;, she said.  &#34;You put a cold drink inside and regardless of how hot it is outside the drink stays cold&#34;.

  The programmer is suitably impressed.

  &#34;But that&#39;s not all&#34;, she continued.  &#34;You can put a *hot* drink inside and no matter how cold it is outside the drink stays hot&#34;.

  Now the programmer is perplexed.

  Plaintively he asks, &#34;But how does it know?&#34;


I think of this whenever I read code that contains a gratuitous state variable that explains the type or content of some data structure rather than make the data structure self-explaining.  Even more annoying when it&#39;s a class.Having to coordinate two variables is a recipe for bugs down the road.  Seems like it should be a beginner&#39;s mistake but I see it all the time in &#34;non beginner&#34; code."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is an encouraging move.My secondhand understanding was that Intel was losing top talent due to pressure to pay closer to median industry compensation. Top engineers recognized they were underpaid and left the company.I&#39;ve been part of a similar downhill slide at a smaller company in the billion dollar revenue range. To be blunt, once the [mediocre] MBAs start realizing that the engineers are getting paid more than they are, the pressure to reduce engineering compensation is strong. Frankly, there are plenty of engineering candidates on the market who are happy with median compensation. Many of them are even great engineers and great employees.However, being a top company in a winner-take-all market requires the top engineers. The only way to attract and retain them at scale is to offer high compensation. I&#39;m hoping that&#39;s part of what&#39;s happening here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bit off topic but I remember when Intel set up a special career fair presentation for my major.I forget the specific role the manager was hiring for, but it sounded like a quality/reliability engineer. Basically run a bunch of tests, identify and analyze errors on newly manufactured equipment.I immediately lost interest when the manager said the role would either work until 9 PM or start the next day at 4 AM due to an important (daily?) 7 AM meeting where the results would be presented. Ontop of that, it was required that you be on call during every weekend and most holidays. You would be required to do this for your first two years as an entry bachelor degree worker. Entering masters level students wouldn&#39;t need to be on call.After that, he mentioned this role would pay ~$65,000 USD. Bonus &lt; $5000. To live in the bay area. Then he bragged to us about the ability to buy intel stock at a 15% discount or something like that.The manager presented in a room with fully qualified people to work at any FANG/Graphics/Aerospace company.I sold all my intel stock the next day [late 2019], it made up most of my portfolio at the time. I just did not see how intel would attract talent if it over-worked and under-compensated entry level employees like that. Compared to the FANG employee getting free meals, game rooms, huge salary, etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In my estimation, Intel has four categories in which it is being outperformed by key competitors:1. TSMC/Samsung - fabrication2. AMD/Amazon-Graviton - Cloud Server3. Apple-M1/AMD - Laptop4. Nvidia/Amazon - Cloud ML/DL AcceleratorIntel has made giant blunders in the past (e.g. Itanium [1], Atom [2], WiMAX [3]) but I&#39;m not sure that any of these past challenges were equivalent to the current four-front war. I would not count Intel out at this point but it will be several years before we know if they were able to right the ship.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Itanium[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(system_on_a_chip)[3] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WiMAX"</p>

It&#39;s one of the best books I read last year, and I read constantly.http://unsongbook.com/Ebookhttps://github.com/JasonGross/unsong_scraperSample:“I AM BUSY.

Substack is much worse than a standard WordPress blog when it comes to that sort of casual reading and creating a permanent home for posts that are timeless.

Some communities adjacent to SSC (and some near HN) have helped me find some amazingly smart and cool people, and I&#39;m very thankful that they exist (and that Scott can continue blogging as well), and if anything I hope we can encourage significantly more niche community building on the Internet, and with many more modalities than blogs, forums, and comments (which SSC indeed has).His notes about people being afraid to express themselves, have open discussions, be honest, and share with one another are pretty saddening however, and I hope that we can progress towards a better area here, even if progress sometimes seems slow or impossible."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I got some hands-on time with the Pico and made a video for it [1], with a tiny project I decided to try out with MicroPython.It was the first time I&#39;d ever tried MicroPython, and I have to say I&#39;m a huge fan. As a dev who came from PHP/Javascript into Java and Python (heh, not quite the same thing but that&#39;s how life was), I find MicroPython a lot more intuitive than the Arduino language or raw C.I also learned that Adafruit maintains their own flavor, CircuitPython [2].Definitely worth trying out if you haven&#39;t, and know any Python![1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUCgYXF01Do[2] https://circuitpython.org"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some high level info on the Pico [1]:  - New RP2040 microcontroller with 2M Flash
  - Micro-USB B port for power and data (and for reprogramming the Flash)
  - 40 pin 21x51 &#39;DIP&#39; style 1mm thick PCB with 0.1&#34; through-hole pins also with edge castellations
   - Exposes 26 multi-function 3.3V General Purpose I/O (GPIO) 
   - 23 GPIO are digital-only and 3 are ADC capable
   - Can be surface mounted as a module
  - 3-pin ARM Serial Wire Debug (SWD) port
  - The power supply achitecture is pretty simple (you can power the unit from micro-USB, external supplies or batteries)
  - Buy price is $USD 4.00
  - MicroPython &amp; C++ SDK
  - Pinout Diagram: https://files.littlebird.com.au/Shared-Image-2021-01-21-17-39-47-GVzHd.png
  - When using MicroPython, the programming model is similar to other boards where you have to unplug and plug back in the board. I hope this is ok on the Micro-USB port.
  - The isn&#39;t currently a version with header pins, so you&#39;ll have to add your own, or get one from a Reseller who will mode them for you (like this one [2]).

The burried the lede is that Raspberry Pi have created their own silicon (just like that other fruit company).
They call their Microcontroller the &#34;RP2040&#34;:It boasts some impressive specs:  - Dual-core cortex M0+ at up to 133MHz
  - On-chip PLL allows variable core frequency
  - 264K multi-bank high performance SRAM
  - External Quad-SPI Flash with eXecute In Place (XIP)

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bet that future Raspberry Pi boards will have a RP2040 or successor chip onboard, to do the bit banging/realtime jobs on the I/O port.Or they will even integrate it into their SOC.Shame though, that they didn&#39;t make the IO ports 5V capable. It&#39;s nowadays pretty common for microcontrollers that are meant for industrial and automotive use to have a separate supply for the I/O ports, that can go up to 5V, independent from the core/peripheral voltage.The main use is to drive (logic-level) MOSFETs directly, interface to 5V buses like SENT, CAN, etc. without having to use level shifters."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There is one thing that has been and is always going to be counterproductive, especially in such situations: blind actionism. Many people flooded the Internet (read: forums, Reddit, bug trackers of projects), inciting panic and suggesting to move to some other “free” hosted platform. This is clearly not a solution. Any hosting platform will sooner or later have to comply with such a request. It can become very expensive if you end up in court."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Regarding GitHub, it is sad that they took down the repository at all. It’s a well-known pattern: platforms rather comply with such requests than risking litigation, requiring projects to invest time and money to fund lawyers themselves (or hope for an association such as the EFF to pick up their case). The moment they published the request and took down the repositories, many experts immediately raised concerns that the request itself is illegal. It remains questionable why GitHub’s legal team didn’t recognize this.ok... am I crazy? I thought when someone sends a DMCA request to you, the platform, that you are required to take the content down and wait for a counter notice from that contents author. The legality of the message is not your problem. You receive the DMCA, you take the content down, if you get a counter claim, you put it back up, the two parties go to court.If that&#39;s correct, then can you really criticize github for following an odious law? Whether we like it or not, they are bound by these requirements."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really clever. I&#39;ve been wanting to try the WASM version of SQLite for something - this is a really smart usage of it.My https://datasette.io/ project is built around a similar idea to this: the original inspiration for it was Zeit Now (now Vercel) and my realization that SQLite read-only workloads are an amazing fit for serverless providers, since you don&#39;t need to pay for an additional database server - you can literally bundle your data with the rest of your application code (the SQLite database is just a binary file).If you want to serve a SQLite API in an edge-closest-to-the-user manner for much larger database files (100MB+) I&#39;ve had some success running Datasette on https://fly.io/ - which runs Docker containers in a geo-load-balanced manner.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve also experimented with this, unfortunately the 50ms CPU time isn&#39;t enough for datasets larger than 1.5MB. And the wasm init add at least 100ms to each request even when &#34;hot&#34; in cache.Also, out of a cost perspective, running a VM with SSD for cheap with SQlite will give much more requests than a CF worker for much less.Adding writes to this is also very limited due to the max 1sec write per KV key limit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As the developer of a pretty popular &#34;utility&#34; browser extension, I&#39;ve been shocked by the volume of email I get every week about it.On a daily basis, I will get requests to sell the extension. Once or twice a week, I will receive an offer to add &#34;a couple lines of code&#34; to my extension which are always generously described as &#34;allowed in the Chrome Web Store&#34; by little fly-by-night organizations that only even have a landing page half the time and usually have throwaway-looking gmail accounts. Out of curiosity, I&#39;ve asked a few what their code does and they never fully describe it, but it either collects analytics to ship home (my extension runs on all sites, so it&#39;s appetizing to them!) or places paid results at the top of any search results, for which I can make &#34;thousands of dollars a month based on the number of North American users I have&#34;.Here is an example email I received yesterday. It&#39;s a good example of how they call it &#34;an SDK&#34; and looks like one of the more legit ones (they registered a domain to send email from, at least).  We at [redacted] are considering purchasing the complete license and ownership of the extensions which have 50K+ active users, may I know if you would be interested in selling? If so, - what is your estimated price?

  Regarding the SDK monetization which we discussed earlier, as it is not distractive and is compatible with any other monetization. We have straightforward terms and provide support for your users agreement. Our partners generate 3-20 K USD monthly with our solution for the browser extensions.

  As a kind reminder, we are [redacted] — a reputable global peer-to-peer ethical proxy network. All our clients are big reputable companies, we authorize their business before providing any proxy plans. 

  Look forward to your further feedback and discussing further details of our financial proposal for your Software in a short Zoom call or here by emails.

Finally, I am also hounded by teams at Microsoft and Apple, who want me to port the extension to their new plugin ecosystems so it can be featured/showcased. I worked with Apple on one similar thing for an extension and it caused such a huge jump in support and feature requests from users that I was overwhelmed, so I am not keen to do it again until I have more free time. They can&#39;t understand why I don&#39;t want to grow by tens of thousands of users a week, but I&#39;m just one person and don&#39;t make money from it whatsoever."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I find interesting that GNOME Screensaver&#39;s security depends on it to not crash.Meanwhile, in KDE the lock screen is managed by KDE Session Management Server which ensures that lock screen cannot be bypassed by simply crashing its process.The way it works is follows: ksmserver draws a black rectangle over everything and spawns kscreenlocker. If kscreenlocker crashes, the black rectangle is still here, and ksmserver will spawn kscreenlocker again but this time with software rendering (just in case it crashed due to graphics driver issue). If kscreenlocker crashes four times then KDE Session Management Server gives up, stops respawning kscreenlocker and simply draws the following text on the screen.  The screen locker is broken and unlocking is not possible anymore.
  In order to unlock switch to a virtual terminal (e.g. Ctrl+Alt+F2),
  log in and execute the command:
  
  loginctl unlock-session %1
  
  Afterwards switch back to the running session (Ctrl+Alt+F%2).

If ksmserver itself crashes then the entire session closes.I&#39;m not sure why GNOME screensaver cannot do something like this. Lock screen crashing seems like something inevitable (especially considering buggy graphic card drivers and so on), and it makes sense to prepare for it so that crashes won&#39;t bypass the screen locker."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does anyone know why lockscreens in Linux have been such a joke? I remember trying Ubuntu couple years ago and when waking up my laptop it would show me my entire desktop with all the information displayed right there in the open for about 10-20 seconds before suddenly engaging the lockscreen. All you had to do was close the lid and open it again and you could just copy whatever was on the screen before the lock screen appeared. I guess it&#39;s because the lockscreen was a separate process that had to start up? Still, what an awful awful design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Years ago I taught a high school typing class in a K-12 school.  The school didn&#39;t have the funds to get a commercial typing program so I wrote my own typing program.  It evolved over time with features to help me track the students&#39; progress etc.  One day we had a school open house where all the parents could come to school.  We had a bunch of different activities set up in different classrooms and I ended up getting assigned to the 3rd grade classroom to set up my typing program so anyone coming through could test their typing speed.  It was a DOS program and I didn&#39;t want people using anything other than my typing program, so I modified it so you couldn&#39;t quit the typing program.  Over the course of the day the 3rd graders were hanging out in their homeroom not really doing anything productive.  Of course the computer was a novel attraction and they were just smashing keys and exploring my program&#39;s UI.  Eventually at one point I noticed that they had somehow crashed my program with a segfault in what had otherwise become a pretty stable piece of software.  To this day I have absolutely no idea what the bug was."</p>

While digging around for a solution to that problem, I thought it was odd that no one had built a Adrium/Trillian/Meebo chat app for modern chat networks. I buried that thought for a while, until I learned about Matrix two years ago.Matrix is the holy grail of chat. It&#39;s end-to-end encrypted by default, federated and open source. The only problem is that not a single one of my friends or family was on it! Luckily the Matrix folks had already envisioned a solution to this problem - they built an API enabling &#39;bridges&#39; between Matrix and other chat networks. This struck a chord with me, maybe we could finally build a single app that I could use to chat with all my friends, regardless of which chat app they used. Through the Matrix community I met Tulir, the most prolific bridge developer and we started working together on what would become Beeper. I&#39;ve been using it as my primary chat client for almost 2 years now. I could not imagine going back to the hot mess of 12 different chat apps I had before!Beeper is a paid service because I think it aligns interests between us and our users. We make a featureful and secure app, in exchange you pay us money. For those who prefer to self-host, you can run the entire Beeper backend stack on your own server. The vast majority of the code we&#39;ve written for Beeper is open source on gitlab.com/nova. Our desktop client is closed source, but you can use Element (or any open source Matrix client) if you prefer. See our FAQ for more info or I&#39;d be happy to explain more."</p>

Like tomorrow Slack would decide to disallow any third-party apps and you&#39;re done."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well done site.
I have a little mixed feelings about the target audience.
Working out for many years (gym and calisthenics) I know a lot of exercises. Beginners might be tempted to approach their fitness by asking that question:what muscle I want to grow today?That is not the way to go.
If you start out or especially during a pandemic where you need to work with everything you can get go for composite exercises that hit more muscles and are the opposite of isolation exercises you might be tempted to choose from a page like this.
Beginners: full body workouts.
Advanced: 2 to 3 day split.
Expert: you know your drill. and will do whatever works for you.So who should be using this site?
Beginners and advanced should use a plan that is preconfigured. Pros know what exercises they want to configure into their routines.Don’t get me wrong: It’s nice to have for reference but do yourself a favor and use some preconfigured workouts if  you’re starting out.You won’t get a sixpack by only working out abs. Train your whole body and reduce body fat. That’s the way to go."</p>

But the problem isn&#39;t Chrome per se, it&#39;s DRM-encumbered media.And that&#39;s why I buy audiobooks from Libro.fm†, games from GOG†, and (out of necessity) movies and TV shows from iTunes—which are still DRM&#39;d by default but are at least relatively easy to decrypt.----------† Among others, I don&#39;t use any one source."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apart from the general consternation about an OSS license becoming non-OSS, can we also talk about the problem that companies are formed, invest a whole lot of resources into creating a product, open-source it, and then have Amazon eat into their profits by just installing and maintaining that product as a service?No matter how you slice it, I think Amazon is bad for us end-users, and Elastic is good. Elastic could have released ES as closed source, but they didn&#39;t, and the OSS ecosystem is better for it. They were hoping to make money off their product, which I don&#39;t think anyone can fault them for, but instead Amazon came in and took a bunch of that money while not giving anything back.Now Elastic is not happy, and I wouldn&#39;t be either. As an end user, I&#39;m grateful the circumstances exist that allow companies to make a living from OSS, and I want to encourage that. AWS is the fly in the ointment there, and I don&#39;t see how blaming Elastic for not giving us stuff for free any more is anything other than entitled. We should be grateful that ES is OSS at all, and we should want an environment where companies that produce OSS can thrive, instead of blaming them for wanting to get paid for the work that they release freely into the world.Amazon hinders that, period. I don&#39;t think Elastic is in the wrong here, I think Amazon is."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think I have grown a rather hard stance on this over the years: putting an open source license on a product isn&#39;t a business model. It&#39;s, by and large, a part of a larger business model.A license is a choice. It means you choose to not gain revenue by directly licensing the IP. Instead, you choose to put the code out there without any further legal obligations on your part as well as those who use that code.It also means that you have to find alternate ways of making revenue e.g. by providing consultancy, building services or licensing the trademark (which is an entirely different ball game from open sourcing the code!).The trouble isn&#39;t that Amazon decided to use ElasticSearch in their own offering. The trouble is that Amazon simply out-competes ElasticSearch with their own product when it comes to consultancy, services, etc.To add insult to injury, Amazon made the mistake of leveraging the ElasticSearch brand a few times too many in ways that just rub the ElasticSearch people the wrong way.Of course, the founders of ES could never predict how successful their product would become after a decade. There are plenty of open source products engineered by commercial companies  that never catch the eye of behemoths like Amazon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My wild guess is that watermarking is done on the client. Doing it at the server stage requires running an encoder for each user connected to the meeting, which increases broadcast costs imensily for Zoom. It would make sense for security reasons, but the trend with them seems to be profit instead.If watermarking is therefore done at the client stage just before being heard/seen at each endpoint, then there is a good chance that it is hackable and watermarking code could be patched or audio/video extracted before watermarking occurs.It would still require whistle-blowers to take this more envolved step before leaking a meeting though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some articles found by googling [1] [2] from two years ago describe this capability as &#34;ultrasonic watermark&#34; so it is not new. I think this is coming to light as Zoom has become popular with the pandemic. For a journalist wanting to sanitize audio I would think they need to remove anything higher than 15kHz.[1] https://www.nojitter.com/video-collaboration-av/zoom-takes-v...[2] https://venturebeat.com/2019/01/22/zoom-is-bringing-ultrason..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is fascinating and really made me think.  The article is pitched at leakers but it could just as likely be pitched at journalists.  If you consume news from an outlet that doesn’t follow The Intercept’s advice then complain immediately to the editor.When you leak something it needs to be credible.  Removing watermarks also reduces the fidelity and therefore the credibility.  If 99% of the screen is blurred and the audio has been transcribed then how does the receiver know this is a real leak at all?The answer lies in reputation.  Leak high fidelity material to a trusted third party, usually a journalist.  This can include just showing them the material though that involves meeting in person.  They will verify the source material, summarise and down sample it to conceal the source actor, and maybe even destroy the source material itself.The economics are simple: if you get a reputation for revealing sources then people will stop leaking secrets to you.  Newsrooms that rebroadcast Zoom caps verbatim are revealing sources and need to clean up their act if we are to continue to rely on what’s left of The Fourth Estate."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I spent 6 months in lock down in a 1 bedroom apartment in Australia. Working from home. 1hr outdoor/exercise a day. No more than 5km from home. We had pretty strict rules. I went for a walk around the block with my mate once a week and spoke to my family on zoom once a fortnight and that was about the extent of my social contact for a large part of 2020.I managed pretty well. I&#39;m a naturally introverted person, which is perhaps a good trait to have in this situation. I&#39;m already used to spending a lot of time by myself and I have things I like to do. This is key, I think. I spent long hours making DJ mixes in Ableton and playing records on my hi-fi. That&#39;s a creative place for me and it was very satisfying to have the time to bury myself in it.I wrote code, not heaps, but I played around with a few things.I dug up some old/remake computer games (Half Life Black Mesa was by far the best)! I watched a bunch of old films I haven&#39;t seen in years, and a few bits and pieces on Netflix. I read books. I went for a 1hr walk every day and enjoyed the sight of trees and the sound of birds. I said a sincere thanks and smiled with my eyes at the people who staff the stores I shopped at once/twice a week. They have a hard job and I think it&#39;s important to convey gratitude to them.I&#39;d be lying if I said it was all fine, there were definitely days when I was bored stiff, depressed or otherwise not in a great place, but it was helpful to remember that everyone was in the same boat, and my sacrifice, along with everyone else&#39;s, are what is going to pull us through.Keep your chins up. Especially you guys in the USA. What a mess you have to fix over there. I hope this year is productive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Personally, I&#39;m not burnt out.To void burn out, I did a few things which I feel are extremely helpful.1. Have a room that is a dedicated office. When I leave this room, I leave the &#34;office&#34;.2. Establish communication throughout the day. This means having slack conversations (typed and video) that are casual. It&#39;s okay to vent on these calls.3. Have a defined schedule - Awake at 6am, washed/dressed by 6:30am, Red Bull (or if you like food) and at my desk by 7am. I do work long hours, but I enjoy it because I&#39;m accomplishing something.4. Work on something that excites you or find joy in your work somehow.5. Lastly, realize most of the mental stress can be managed with a little mindfulness, learning to accept that you still can grow and find joy even when at home and cut back on social media; or if you&#39;re like me, I cut out 99% of social media.I hope everyone remains positive. Do something today, that makes you better tomorrow."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had to leave California (been there 6 years). I was lucky because I had four other room mates to keep me company but even with that it was tough. I also wasn&#39;t really enjoying what I was working on at my previous company (adtech) and needed a change.I ended up moving to Taiwan a few weeks ago. Zero COVID here, and was surprisingly easy to immigrate (coming from someone who was dealing with the US immigration system as a Canadian). Working at a fun startup back on the consumer product side instead. Went to a bar for the first time in a year last week and was able to just sit in a coffee shop with 10 other people this morning. I&#39;m still teaching myself to read/speak Chinese but it&#39;s totally worth it.Anyone with experience with TypeScript/React interested in tagging along to Taiwan, send me an email (my email is in my hacker news profile). I&#39;m actively hiring engineers now. We&#39;re a distributed team across many different countries but a few of us hang out in Taipei together at a coworking space. It&#39;s the best of both worlds, I&#39;m able to WFH when I feel like it but still go to a public space to be around people"</p>

At that point the idea of developing on ARM and deploying on x86 will be unpleasant, especially since Graviton 2 is already cheaper per compute unit than x86 is for some work loads; imagine what Graviton 3 &amp; 4 will offer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The thing about all of these articles analyzing Intel&#39;s problems is that nobody really knows the details of Intel&#39;s &#34;problems&#34; because it comes down to just one &#34;problem&#34; that we have no insight into: node size. What failures happened in Intel&#39;s engineering/engineering management of its fabs that led to it getting stuck at 14 nm? Only the people in charge of Intel&#39;s fabs know exactly what went wrong, and to my knowledge they&#39;re not talking. If Intel had kept chugging along and got down to 10 nm years ago when they first said they would, and then 7 nm by now, it wouldn&#39;t have any of these other problems. And we don&#39;t know exactly why that didn&#39;t happen."</p>

We don&#39;t want to wake up one day and find they&#39;ve flexed their muscles on their regional neighbors similar to their rare earths strong-arming from 2010-2014 and not have fab capabilities to fall back on in the West.(For that matter, I&#39;m astounded that after 2014 the status quo returned on rare earths with very little state-level strategy or subsidy to address the risk there.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the article they mention a user being angry that they lost their kick data. It felt like they were highlighting this scenario like it was somehow weird or unusual that a pregnant mother was upset that she lost this data.This &#34;fascination&#34; from the author is unhelpful IMHO.I am not surprised that the pregnant mother was upset - in the UK it is now drilled into you that you need to keep track of kick data for your child and that you must - must - call the hospital as soon as you notice any change at all in kicking from your unborn child (1).They are deliberately very vague and unclear about what a &#34;change&#34; constitutes - just that if you feel something has changed at all or in any way then you need to call. From experience, these calls always end with a request that you go into hospital for a check from a midwife. So 55 kicks today, but 60 yesterday?  Come in and a midwife will hook you up to keep track of your baby&#39;s vitals for an hour just to be sure with lots of reassurance that you did the right thing by coming in and getting it checked.So no shit if you&#39;ve entrusted this data to an app and they&#39;ve dropped the ball, no wonder you are angry: this is not just data for data&#39;s sake - not having it potentially endangers the life of your unborn child because you don&#39;t have your historical data to compare against any more, so you can&#39;t know anymore if today&#39;s kicks are changed from yesterday&#39;s or the day before etc.I am sure many people will scoff and call this an overreaction (including apparently the author of the article) but this is the current recommendation from the NHS here, and not everyone has a totally normal medical history or otherwise-textbook pregnancy where it is all skipping through meadows of wild daisys and baby ducklings quietly nuzzling at your feet followed by the perfect stress and pain free delivery. People can and do have medical circumstances that influence pregnancy. It ain&#39;t all plain sailing.People have reason to need to trust that their medical data is stored safely and reliably. To insinuate that is is odd is deeply unhelpful.1 - https://www.nhs.uk/pregnancy/keeping-well/your-babys-movemen..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The way Thai&#39;s feel about honor and defamation is a lot more complex and causes friction when the (existing Western) system tries to apply legal rules of how conflict is resolved (and punishment is applied) in an environment where the old values of honor are still valid.when I still lived in the South of Thailand early 90ies we took people diving from Koh Samui, Koh Phan-gan, Koh Tao. The relationship between Thai&#39;s and the law is a strange one. It&#39;s almost like there are 2 systems. One for Thais one for &#34;Farang&#34;.A Thai would not dare to speak ill of the monarchs. They leave the room if a &#34;farang&#34; has had one too many and says something critical (they&#39;re peace loving but their love of peace might end there). This applies to both the very rich and the very poor.We hired the captain from another region of the South to transport our divers. He was with the company since the day these islands were still 100% jungle and the place belonged to local fishermen. The reason why he left the region was because he had an argument and killed his neighbor. The deal was that he would not get killed only if he left the region and settled without ever returning to his family - this is considered not just shameful but seen as a huge disadvantage to make a living. They settled it without police, lawyer, bailiff, or judge, all among themselves.Our other captain (in charge of the boat that left Koh Phangan) was also the right hand man of the most powerful person on the island. That guy was like a major, or village elder because he owned what was then the only &#34;super market&#34; on the island, and lot of the land. Our captain and &#34;right hand man&#34; to this guy was a devout monk (every year for several months left his wife to sweep the floor in silence in the monastery). He was a family man, highly respected within the community, and it was no secret among Thais that he was also heavily armed and had a body count of 12 people in his short life (late 20ies).While murder is obviously illegal by law in Thailand, it is still used as a way by locals to settle disputes within rural areas of the South. The illegality isn&#39;t even considered here since in this case they see it as their moral duty which still trumps whatever some judge/lawyer&#39;s definition of justice is who has never before left Krung Thep.Long story short it&#39;s quite complex to transform what is still in ways a tribal society into what we call &#34;law-abiding&#34; citizen. Especially when the law contradicts the values of society. And even more so when the existing police force is just a show for the tourists and to the urban population."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In Poland, we still have a blasphemy law. A newspaper along the lines of Charlie Hebdo had its owner dragged over courts for over 8 YEARS. The offense was illustrating an article about emptying churches with a surprised Jesus in a road sign. The newspaper routinely posts much more offensive content: cartoon dicks, cartoon sex, caricatures of pope, Jews, politicians (some dick-headed or engaged in homosexual sex), national flags in dog shit... But it was ostensibly a surprised Jesus that crossed the line.Since the current government entrenched itself, police is investigating things like suspicious duck-shaped snowmen next to statues (related to last name Kaczyński). The party leader that had 80 police squad cars guarding his villa.One of worst parts of thin skinned politicians is fabricating excuses to harass people they don&#39;t like."</p>

That means if messanger.com or meet.google.com or zoom.com wanted to make zoom.com/embed/this/url/as/iframe/to/spy/on/people.html they could, and then sell that service for ads to embed in their ads.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good analyses, but I was expecting more discussion of how best to work with (conceptual) state machines when writing code.I&#39;m no expert on the matter, but there are code-generative tools out there that help make state machines very explicit: you describe the state machine, and the system generates the code. This should help to avoid issues with transitions that you failed to consider, which may be of real value as such unexpected transitions may pose a serious security issue when implementing the state machine &#39;by hand&#39; in code. More so than many design patterns, it seems to make good sense to use a code-generative approach for state-machines.This is of course related to how regex works, as regex is implemented with state machines, but state-machine code-generator systems might not make use of the usual regex syntax.Related reading: Turning vaguely reassuring finite-state machines into regular expressions, https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=25496045"</p>

Not all software is created equal, some might be more secure and have fewer vulnerabilities than others. But a single exposed vuln, no matter how severe, is pretty much never enough to judge which software is which.I remember hearing about this exact bug in Facetime, but I had no idea that, as OP demonstrated, an analagous bug effected pretty much every popular similar A/V group chat software. Including the vaunted Signal.Did this one OP find and reveal it in all of them? wow.Also, I really wonder how many of these the NSA knew about before we did, but who can say (except the NSA)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In my experience, the output from GPT-3, DALL-E, et al is similar to what you get from googling the prompt and stitching together snippets from the top results. These transformers are trained on &#34;what was visible to google&#34;, which provides the limitation on their utility.I think of the value proposition of GPT-X as &#34;what would you do with a team of hundreds of people who can solve arbitrary problems only by googling them?&#34;. And honestly, not a lot of productive applications come to mind.This is basically the description of a modern content farm. You give N people a topic, ie &#34;dating advice&#34;, and they&#39;ll use google to put together different ideas, sentences and paragraphs to produce dozens of articles per day. You could also write very basic code with this, similar to googling a code snippet and combining the results from the first several stackoverflow pages that come up (which, incidentally, is how I program now). After a few more versions, you could probably use GPT to produce fiction that matches the quality of the average self published ebook. And DALL-E can come up with novel images in the same way that a graphic designer can visually merge the google image results for a given query.One limitation of this theoretical &#34;team of automated googlers&#34; is that what they search for content is cached on the date of the last GPT model update. Right now the big news story is the Jan 6th, 20201 insurrection at the US Capitol. GPT-3 can produce infinite bad articles about politics, but won&#39;t be able to say anything about current events in real time.I generally think that GPT-3 is awesome, and it&#39;s a damn shame that &#34;Open&#34;AI couldn&#39;t find a way to actually be open. At this point, it seems like a very interesting technology that is still in desperate need of a Killer App"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"HR is not your friend and your company is not your family.Regardless of intent there are commercial realities that exist within the context of a company that may never be present in a non-work relationship. This has varying degrees of impact on the nature of the relationship itself and may not present itself until you are at your most vulnerable.I find that a collegial environment with shared goals and responsibilities can be equally rewarding as non-work relationships even if we all have some level of underlying self-interest at heart. Our day-to-day interactions can also be made more pleasant if we are not constantly reminded of the at times competitive, zero-sum, structure of professional engagements.At a team level your colleagues may be your friends but one shouldn&#39;t conflate professional relationships with personal ones."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really don&#39;t enjoy the tone here. The derision with which it speaks about managers, like they are either evil or incompetent, is unfair in my experience.(my) Managers are just people. They have a task, they do their best to get that task done. Sometimes they decisions that seem bad to me. Often that is because I misunderstand their goals. Sometimes, it is because I know something they don&#39;t, and something they couldn&#39;t verify if I told them. And other times, they just made a mistake, or weren&#39;t told the relevant information by me or others.Indeed, sometimes their goals are somewhat self serving. But often it just has to do with wider business goals than what I am working at. I am grateful for them keeping an eye on those. Leaving me to worry less about the biggest of pictures. That however, doesn&#39;t mean I should just bog down on the small picture of my work, and deem everything that seems bad in that context as stupid."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Performance reviews are a joke because almost nobody knows how to measure anyone else&#39;s effectiveness. They are just a continuation of the same popularity contests you thought you left behind from middle school, high school, and maybe even your college/university days.This has a bit of truth. In my experience climbing up the ladder is so disconnected from actual reality. There’s quite a bit of a buddy buddy / quid pro quo system that goes on when it comes to promos.There are people who do the actual work and take it 99%, and others who stitch the last 1% and take credit for all of it. Our Industry loves rewarding for features over things that customers actually care about. I’ve seen many feature promos in my life. One year later we’d have to kill the whole feature because it’s not worth the maintenance cost.One of my managers believed folks who write python and JS are not real programmers, C and go programmers faced hard problems therefore they are more real. There was also the unconscious bias that women can’t lead projects so opportunities weren’t given to them. Over time women kept leaving. Over time really stellar frontend engineers kept on leaving.It also baffles me how much energy is spent on hiring people, vs mentoring and fostering them so they grow and are promoted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The issue with estimates are expectations. While nobody acknowledges it, you&#39;re not actually asked for an estimate, you&#39;re being asked for a quote.The difference is when you&#39;re asked for a quote, you&#39;re asked how much you will be charging, with the expectations that you&#39;ll be willing to eat into your own margins to give a lower quote. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a negotiation, where you negotiate how much extra effort, time and headcount you&#39;re willing to give, how much tech dept you&#39;re willing to take, etc., for the privilege of getting their business.If you see it for what it really is, you&#39;ll see that it works pretty well actually. The business gets more out of you for less to them. It was never about having an accurate timeline or helping with planning or prioritizing, and always about negotiating a better contract with the dev team.Now keep in mind that the &#34;business&#34; in this case is a person who need to report that through their amazing prowess of administration and management, they personally managed to get X feature out during their last review cycle at Y cost with impact Z. This person will not need to deal with developer satisfaction, retention and performance. They will not need to deal with the impact the lower margins they pushed for had on the next feature delivery, or the continued maintainance of the systems. And if the dev team had to lower the quality too much in order to meet the quote they put out, that will be 100% their fault, the &#34;business&#34; will know not to use them for their next contract, or they&#39;ll expect the dev team to take on fixing all the issues at their own expense once more."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s unfortunate that this HN thread has been reduced to the generic discussion about software estimates when the article is specifically talking about research done on the topic of software estimates.According to the article, proper research remains a struggle due to outdated datasets from before modern agile methodologies, and that the modern datasets from industry are hard if not impossible to gather.If industry is truly interested in improving software development and estimation, their data should be anonymized and made available to researchers for analysis."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If someone can conclusively teach inexperienced programmers good approach to estimates (methodology) + help embed this into sales process of a software house-type company, I know some folks who&#39;d love to have this :)My own experience has been this: people make estimates, client has expectations based on some variant of those, and something later happens but so much change is introduced during the actual software development, that there seems to be no sane way to compare what happened with original estimates. (new features, changed features, lots of new information, market shifts/product vision shifts, quality assumptions change, etc. etc.)But at that point nobody cares! People go on with further projects, and no data is ever collected.Nobody learns.When f*ckups happen, i.e. a gross over- or under-estimate, this is often not shared with the broader organization (ashamed/afraid sales people/PMs/devs say nothing/hide it/sugarcoat it). Client walks away.Sometimes project is severly underestimated but usually not just because of the software part. Again, no decoupling and estimation of contributing factors is done.It&#39;s insane."</p>

Naming a variable while listening to your favorite songs&#39; lyrics may result in cognitive overload.

My flow state is drastically improved by music, and I have never ever named a variable after the song name or song artist I&#39;m listening to in my life.Edit: Nor have I ever seen a variable named after a song name or artist.Edit2: NotoriousViewController.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve recently been assigned a course to teach where I need to mark lots of assignments. These assignments have 12 short answer questions and each student must do them.Slowest part about marking these is having to context switch for each question. So I&#39;d mark Q1 , then Q2 etc for one assignment, then go over to the next one and start back at Q1.I figured this was super inefficient since I needed to have the answer and context of the question in my mind and keep switching.So I wrote a program to parse all of the questions from all of the reports and present them to me in question batches. So now I see all of Q1 one after the other for each student&#39;s and mark those. Then once all of the Q1&#39;s are done, I mark all the Q2&#39;s. After all the marking is done, I run that through another program that then formats that data to each student so it&#39;s back onto their individual report plus any comments or deductions.I find that apart from saving the time to have to open tonnes of docx files, now it takes maybe 5 mins to mark everything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Rarely have I read an article with such a perfect balance between a premise I agree with an examples I do not. But I think this illustrates something important: what constitutes a context switch is not universal. It depends on what parts of a task you need to think about.In the kitchen, from long practice, I do not have to think about prep, technique, or washing up. There are no decisions I need to make for those tasks. They take very little attention. This frees me to spend my focus on the more abstract goals of what I want to cook, and for me it is not a context switch to wash a bowl while an onion is sauteeing. I can certainly cook while keeping the kitchen clean more efficiently than I could cook and then clean it. But when I was first cooking, it was a context switch to go from chopping an onion to chopping a carrot. Both tasks required my attention and focus."</p>

But you know it&#39;s possible that sometimes I&#39;ll prescribe something different, based on your metastudies.&#34;To which you replied:&gt; &#34;And that isn&#39;t worth something? Prescribing better treatments?&#34;Imagine walking into the office of someone who spent the last ~10 years at school and then potentially 20 years practicing their craft as a successful psychologist and then you waltz in and tell them what they prescribe is wrong and your automated treatment plan is better."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m kind of concerned that people read this as satire but miss the most important part, namely the absence of concern about the safety and validity of the results.  You know, the part where he stuck some statistical software in front of a database populated by a &#34;motley crew&#34; of contractors and wanted doctors to use it as a shortcut for making patient care decisions.  The part where he implicitly compares the HTML spit out by his system to peer-reviewed work by professional researchers.  The part where he is proud of &#34;beating&#34; a &#34;record&#34; for least discriminating meta-analysis.Reading this story and talking about his marketing and product development process feels like watching Lovecraft Country and then then only talking about the time travel physics of it.  There&#39;s something real and awful here, hopefully presented in a fictionalized or highly exaggerated form.  The people in my social circles who mistrust tech and despise startup culture -- this is exactly how they see us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article&#39;s thesis seems to be that medical professionals are not incentized to provide the best interventions, and as a result, wouldn&#39;t pay for this service. However, what the author fails to mention is the competitors in this space that are successful, such as Up To Date, which provides really high-quality research trial data: https://www.uptodate.com/homeRather than building a product that informs medical professionals about effective interventions, I wonder if the creator would have had more success if he deeply explored what sources of information these medical professionals pay for now - do they pay for anything at all, such as UpToDate, and don&#39;t want to pay this because it&#39;s an additional expense? If the creator found which sources people are using, the creator could sell this database as a feature for these partners and widely disseminate this data through partner channels rather than creating a competing source of information. It seems to be a case of this being a good instance of a B2B2C model, where selling this service to other businesses that sell directly to medical professionals could be more viable than trying to sell directly to them.Alternatively, if the creator wanted to sell to patients, rather than medical professionals, the blueprint here is all of the consumer reports companies, such as Wirecutter, which is one of the New York Times&#39;s most popular services. Here, again, a &#34;Wirecutter for medical interventions&#34; could be quite successful, and you could sell this service to media companies that provide consumer reports as a service that would bolster these companies.It&#39;s bad the creator wasn&#39;t able to find traction, as getting more medical data into the hands of consumers could have a huge postive impact over time."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was a foster kid for 11 years. My social worker and foster parents were likely the only reason I am still here. My social worker would visit his children weekly-- even on weekends and did whatever it took for us. Still, he was just one man. I still talk to him regularly. During one discussion, I asked him about the other kids that I remembered. There were only two of us left.
I think people forget about the trauma foster kids deal with. First, the reason kids went into care. Second, the separation of the kid from their families. My experiences showed me that this trauma, combined with an institutional care system does not equip most kids to function in society."</p>

Literally Pulling her drunk biological dad out of a ditch, to realize that they were dragging her down.She does aight these days.Foster kids can be helped, but  you really need multiple strong families or support groups dedicated to the task.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think something else that would be of interest would be doing this for drug prescriptions: compare the cost that my employer, the NHS, pay for a compound and those that Americans pay for the exact same compound. This is easy on my end at least -- prices and prescription guidance are released in the BNF / British National Formulary annually and are all made available in public. I have never understood the US system of &#34;co-pays&#34; and found the whole thing very confusing.For a few &#34;popular&#34; random examples that I think HN might have heard of: one branded Epi-Pen is £26.45; Naproxen (the NSAID painkiller) is £4.29 / 56 pack; and omeprazole (PPI used to treat gastric reflux) is £0.84 / 28 pack.A more expensive example might be the cystic fibrosis &#34;designer drugs&#34; lumacaftor with ivacaftor -- 112 tablets are £8000 (to be prescribed by a specialist, if the patient has the genotype to respond to it -- a total annual cost of about £26k). The US equivalent is $379,780 [1].(NB: The price you pay as a British patient is usually £0, unless you are a working-aged and working English person -- at which point it is £9.15 per item [independent of its cost] or a fixed &#34;all you can eat&#34; prepayment certificate that works out at about £8.83/month -- which is what I have.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Careful abusing these tricks. Over 10 years ago I decided to implement an RC4 (arcfour) cypher to generate pseudorandom noise for a test program.The algorithm looks like (from wikipedia):  i := 0
  j := 0
  while GeneratingOutput:
    i := (i + 1) mod 256
    j := (j + S[i]) mod 256
    swap values of S[i] and S[j]
    K := S[(S[i] + S[j]) mod 256]
    output K
  endwhile

Being a smartass 1337 coder (and declaring intermediate variables always being a bit of a bother in C89) in my implementation I decided to implement the swap using the xor trick:   s[i] ^= s[j];
   s[j] ^= s[i];
   s[i] ^= s[j];

I then ran a few basic test vectors, everything seems to work fine.A little while later I noticed that the output of the cypher was weird, the longer it ran the more zeroes I would get, eventually getting only zeroes.The keen reader will already have spotted the problem: whenever i and j happen to be equal instead of doing nothing the code sets the entry to 0 (since x ^ x == 0 for any x).And that&#39;s the story of how I never used this trick ever again.In general it&#39;s always better to write clear, concise code and let the compiler optimize it. If it turns that the code is performance critical and the compiler doesn&#39;t do a good enough job then you can see if the smart solution is worth it.And if you fail an interview because the interviewer expected you to know how to find a duplicate in an integer list by using xor then you probably dodged a bullet anyway. What a silly trivia question."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A fun party trick not mentioned here is reducing storage in a doubly linked-ish list:  Normally each node stores 2 pointers:  struct Node {void * prev;void * next}The trick is to use only 1 &#39;pointer&#39;, storing prev XOR next:  struct Node {void* xored;}While traversing, you remember not only the current position, but also where you came from.  So forward traversal goes: next= current.xored XOR previous.  Backwards also works: Node 
 * previous=(Node * )current.xored XOR (Node * ) next.The first and last node can use 0 as previous or next node, or you make a circular list.  You do have to store a pointer to the first and last node, as usual.I&#39;ve never seen this used in the real world, which is probably a good thing.  It also plays hell with garbage collectors like Boehm, as they can&#39;t derive the 2 used adresses.UPDATE: And of course wikipedia knows everything: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_linked_list"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As mentioned in this article, x ^ x == 0. Fun fact, this is frequently used by compilers as a &#34;cheap&#34; way to zero out a register.In addition, there are comparatively few cases in programming where we XOR. Sure, it happens in things like games quite a lot, but the main use is actually _cryptography_.Between these two facts (more like hints really), I managed to reverse engineer the bulk of a piece of malware I was given to analyse in a an internship. I was handed the malware, a copy of IDA Pro, and given a few days to see what I could find. All I could remember when presented with a wall of hex encoded machine code were the hints above. I looked for XORs of different values, assumed it was crypto, and extrapolated from there. Found a routine happening three times in quick succession and guessed it was triple-DES. Then I guessed that writing your own 3DES from scratch was unlikely, so googled for crypto libraries and happened to find one that nearly matched (I think an earlier/unmodified version), and worked my way up tagging the operations until I got to the purpose, exfiltrating various registry keys and browser history to [somewhere].It was a fun exercise, and therefore these facts will stay with me for far longer than they are accurate I&#39;m sure!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Corneal surgeon here ! (Note : I never implanted a keratoprosthesis. This is an extremely unfrequent procedure, usually performed by a handful of surgeons in a given country). 
Some insights about this topic.
This looks like a great device (never heard before !).
This is a keratoprosthesis, meaning this is a last recourse, &#34;no-hope-except-maybe-that&#34;, procedure.
However it looks infinitely more simple and respectful of the eye integrity than current keratoprosthesis, and, if it really acts like a scaffold for native corneal cells and allows a colonization and the obtention of a satisfying corneal surface, it could be a game changer. It is way too soon to know.A significant percentage (I would say around 40-70%, depending on the 
country) of corneal graft indications originates from pathologies coming from the inner layer of the cornea (corneal endothelium). Posterior lamellar graft (DMEK) allows today to change only the thin cellular layer which is pathological, with an usually quick recovery. Even the best performing keratoprosthesis won&#39;t replace this procedure, because we care to preserve the eye&#39;s integrity as much as we can.It is interesting to remember that corneal transplantation is a very special topic because the cornea is not vascularized, meaning less rejection. There still is, of course, but the outcomes as usually good. Keratoprosthesis are today indicated when previous grafts where rejected, when the other structures of the eye are healthy, and when the vision is extremely low. This allows to gain a few years of very low vision before, usually, losing the eye due to infection or high ocular pressure.The technology presented has the potential:
- to replace current keratoprosthesis and lower the threshold to decide to perform the procedure : yes, almost sure if the device is well-tolerated
- to replace perforating keratoplasty (full corneal replacement, unfrequent today) where the cornea is damaged in its entirety: maybe, highly uncertain for the moment. That would be an incredible step forward, a revolution in our practice.
- to replace anterior lamellar keratoplasty, where the anterior wall of the cornea is replaced : highly unlikely
- to replace posterior lamellar keratoplasty, where the cornea lacks transparency because of inner layer cellular dysfunction: almost impossible.I would also like to raise awareness on the topic of eye rubbing. The eye surgeon community progressively discovers the highly harmful consequences of vigorous and daily eye rubbing. A few teams (mine, notably) even think that it is the single trigger for keratoconus. You will find a nice illustrations of what a rubbed eye looks like in MRI I by googling &#34;don&#39;t rub your eye&#34; (this is me in the MRI ;-) and more explanations here : https://defeatkeratoconus.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a recipient of a dual cornea transplant because of a condition called:   Fuch&#39;s Cornea Dystrophy.In 5-20 years I&#39;ll need it again.I&#39;m not in as bad of shape as the person in TFA.  I&#39;m damn lucky, but to be honest, I&#39;m miserable.  I remember what it was like to have lazer-sharp vision.  Now I can&#39;t work with electronics anymore.  My soldering iron is gathering dust.  I can&#39;t do 30% of my job.  Hell I have to assemble PC&#39;s by feel.  I can&#39;t see the writing on jumper connections, and spend a lot of time taking a picture of a thing and then magnifying the image just trying to figure out what goes where.It&#39;s a shame I am not a mechanic, bolts are much bigger then jumpers.  Working by feel is a fucking bitch."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Keratoconus sufferer here. This looks really cool. I&#39;m probably not going to need a corneal transplant at this point (since my condition appears to have stabilized with age) but I&#39;m definitely going to follow this. Even with correction the acuity in one of my eyes is very bad (like, can&#39;t read 16 point font at arm&#39;s length bad). Since this method takes the tissue rejection concern out of the equation I wonder if an &#34;elective&#34; corneal transplant might be an option down the road."</p>

The article The world’s oldest story?, originally published in TheConversation [2], states:&gt; The star Pleione... was a bit further away from Atlas in 100,000 BC, making it much easier to see.These two stars now appear as one to the naked eye which the author proposes is the source of the hidden sister. This dates the story to 100 kya.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pleiades[2] https://theconversation.com/the-worlds-oldest-story-astronom..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This reminded me of a theory came up with as a teenager, that the Vaanaraas of Ramayana (a group to which the famous &#34;monkey god&#34; Hanuman belongs) may actually be an early hominid that had ape-like features, that lived in parallel with humans in different territory. They were intelligent enough to help the human princes in their quest, which got them a place in their story - a story which went on to become an oral tradition, and got embellished with time to become the Ramayana. If, as proposed here, stories can be orally passed down for tens of thousands of years, that makes it slightly more likely that this outlandish theory actually has some merit to it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When you finally learn to master and config Emacs, you run circles around all other editors. Emacs is so much more than just an editor. But even if you only use it for coding: Magit is the best git client I have used in years (coming from PyCharm + Git Tower App, which is nice), then there‘s Ztree-Diff (excellent folder diff tool; previously using Kaleidoscope app), then Eshell for interacting with the server from within Emacs (programmatically if you like), Tramp for remote editing, excellent integration of ripgrep and silversearcher (ag) into Emacs for code navigation, yasnippet as an excellent templates/snippet manager, and many more packages.What makes Emacs exceptional is you can link all these packages together, create your own workflows by scripting Emacs in Lisp. And I write the docu in Emacs in org-mode, with org-babel I can run shell-scripts / python-scripts and other code in my org-file and see the output underneath it (like Jupyter notebooks), link to code fragments in my org files etcI manage several projects with it and switch contexts with one key-combination: Vagrant box is started, project folder is changed, necessary files opened, ready to hack, build, deploy, do server restarts with a single key stroke.I think VS Code is a nice coding environment with good defaults and many things done right (compare installing packages in VS Code to Sublime! What an improvement) but nowhere near the capabilities and the productivity of Emacs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It also shines in areas where Emacs doesn’t: if you’re a programmer working on typical contemporary projects, mostly just wanting to get stuff done, things usually… just work. You install VSCode, open a source code file, get asked to install the extension for that particular language, and that’s it. You get smart completion, static analysis, linting, advanced debugging, refactoring tools, deep integration with git, and on top of that, great performance and a cohesive user experience.These days I mostly use VSCode due to great language server integration (Pylance, gopls, rust-analyzer, etc.), but I still rely on Emacs with Magit for almost all my git interactions. This is not helped by VSCode&#39;s shitty commit message box, which after five years is still this ~250x20px by default input field with some after-the-fact validation tossed in. The great thing about Emacs is that everything is a buffer, you get the full editing power afforded by a buffer, not some second-class input field, especially for something as important as commit messages."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On the discussion of values, I&#39;d also like to submit &#34;(expected) longevity&#34; for consideration, which I think is distinct from &#34;stability&#34;.I made the switch from Vim to Neovim as soon as I felt confident that (1) the project was going to be around for a while, and (2) it was on track to &#34;overtake&#34; Vim (you may choose to disagree with me on this, I found built-in LSP to be a compelling selling point, but the specifics aren&#39;t really related to the point I&#39;m trying to make). That it was almost completely a drop-in replacement, down to the init file, certainly didn&#39;t hurt.Under the author&#39;s framework, Neovim apparently prefers &#34;progressiveness&#34; while Vim prefers &#34;stability&#34;, and those two sound dimetrically at odds based on their descriptions; but both have large, active communities that aren&#39;t going anywhere. I&#39;m not sure I can say the same about Kakoune, for example, which is a certainly a promising project but hasn&#39;t yet convinced me to jump the fence.[edit for Emacs thoughts]: Now that I think about it, &#34;text centrism&#34; in my mind is also closely related to longevity. I don&#39;t care as much about the properties of plain text as I do about the fact that I&#39;ll be able to open/view/edit them _even if the application ecosystem dies_. I find Emacs attractive here with org-mode and, to a lesser extent, org-roam (the comparison here would be between e.g. SaaS productivity offerings like Notion)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The nice thing about my 2015 Macbook Pro is that it&#39;s useful without any accessories. I can just throw it in a bag and walk out the door.It&#39;s got enough battery life that I usually don&#39;t need to bring a charger. It has all the ports that I ever need. I can hook it up to a projector with the built in HDMI port, I can put in the SD card from my camera, or I can quickly copy files from someones thumb drive. I don&#39;t need to think about bringing the right kind of cables for what I&#39;m planning to do.Sure, the new Macs are a lot faster, but every Mac released after 2015 would be a downgrade for me."</p>

I realize this is blasphemous to say and I did think I would hate the touchbar for all the reasons, but I actually ended up liking it.I had imagined myself tapping virtual function buttons and the whole thing seemed silly and useless and worse than having physical keys, but VS Code and other dev tools actually have good integration, and when I open an app like Adobe Illustrator which I don&#39;t use frequently enough to memorize all the hotkeys it&#39;s quite handy to have the commands listed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The article&#39;s criticism of the 12-inch MacBook are preposterous. The 2 lb Macbook is the best laptop I&#39;ve ever owned, by far. Maybe I&#39;m too sensitive about weight, but I feel an incredible difference between 3 lb and 2 lb laptops, especially if its sitting on your lap for extended periods of time. The keyboard and charger have never once been a hindrance to my workflow, as the article makes it out be. I really wish Apple would come out with 2 lb laptops again. Latest line of Macbooks (the &#34;Air&#34;) weigh in at 2.8 lb minimum."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These groups are awesome, but they&#39;re also fragile.Our little English town had an amazing Freecycle group running for a while that got us through the &#34;baby clothes&#34; issues that people are discussing here.  But the next town over had a &#34;Sell &amp; Seek&#34; group that was essentially the same, but for small cash payments instead of goodwill.One woman saw the arbitrage opportunity and started accepting pretty much everything that came up on the Freecycle, only to re-list it on the Sell &amp; Seek.  My wife gave away a big basket of washable diaper stuff and watched as it all popped back up, one item at a time, for $5-$10 each on that Sell &amp; Seek.  Think about the emotional ride that puts you on, from thinking you&#39;d single handedly sorted some new young mom, to realizing you&#39;d been suckered by this... well, not nice person.  Then multiply it by every member of that group that gave anything away in good faith.The Freecycle just sort of went away inside of a month, and now all that&#39;s left is that paid version from the next town over.All it takes for one person to do this and your community dies.  Notice that she didn&#39;t ever do anything illegal or even &#34;wrong&#34; from her viewpoint.  Just the same sort of &#34;disrupting&#34; and arbitrage that we see praised here all the time.But it completely ruined a nice thing."</p>

Not bartering, not first-come-first-serve.  When something is posted, the person offering is supposed to wait a while, then decide who to give it to.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The unintuitive thing here (for the general population at least, possibly not the HN crowd) is that almost certainly nobody at Facebook saw, and approved (much less designed) this marketing strategy. It naturally emerged from the goals the system has been given. That doesn&#39;t excuse it: in fact, it indicts automated targeted-advertisement as a category.This software is working exactly as it was designed to. I&#39;m sure somebody could (and probably will, now that it&#39;s made the news) add a rule that makes an exception in this case. But this is going to keep happening, and keep happening, and keep happening, as long as we continue allowing systems to automate our content-feeds, optimized for getting us to spend money."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll pile on an anecdote. I still have a facebook account but its not something I use very often except the past week given the situation in the USA.My facebook account is very old, when i was more of an active user I did all the usual posts/photos that a lot of liberal urban types contribute.Anyway, after posting some anti-insurrection posts I start noticing all sort of &#34;tacti-cool&#34; gear ads or targeted T-shirt s with some very macho-man hyper masculinity phrases on them.This is very much _not_ me. Now I keep facebook on a tight leash (FB container, privacy settings turned to max) so my guess is that someone out there is spending a lot of money on a huge ad target or somehow facebook thinks anyone who is posting about a US insurrection would like to participate with some neat military cosplay kit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Yes. That&#39;s what Go is for. Go is for doing the things that Google does on servers, which mostly means web apps of one kind of another. It has all the parts for that, and they&#39;re well-exercised because they&#39;re doing billions of operations per second on Google&#39;s own work. It&#39;s hard-compiled, so you don&#39;t have all the extra overhead of the interpreted languages. Also, Go has a better async story than most web-oriented systems. Goroutines, or &#34;green threads&#34;, do both the job
of threads and &#34;async&#34;. In async land, if anything blocks or uses much CPU time, you&#39;re stalled. Not so in Go. A goroutine can block without stalling other goroutines.Right now, I&#39;m writing a client for a virtual world in Rust. There&#39;s a big need for concurrency, but, unlike web stuff, it&#39;s all tightly interrelated. There&#39;s a GPU to keep busy. There&#39;s network traffic of several different kinds. There are compute-bound tasks which need to be kept out of the frame refresh loop.Rust is good for this. The existing C++ client is too much of a mess to make concurrent; people looked at it and gave up. In Rust, it&#39;s coming along nicely.Use the right tool for the job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m the maintainer of Juniper. Juniper is a library, not a framework. As such it is agnostic to how you want to solve N+1. You get a lookahead and can do what you want...dataloader (like Facebook), eager loading all data up front (like Rails), generating efficient SQL on the fly (like prisma).There are projects and examples to do all three but we don&#39;t want to assume one solution is right for all domains.We take this to the extreme...Juniper doesn&#39;t even require a web server and isn&#39;t tied to a particular serialization format! Of course, we provide optional integrations with popular web frameworks using json but the key is they are optional."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; But Rust’s memory rules aren’t more secure than Node.js’s or Python’s. Your web application written in Rust isn’t going to be systematically more or less secure than an application in Python or Ruby.Just want to call out that I&#39;ve heard a horror story of a very bad security bug due to implicit shared mutability in Python.(vague to protect the innocent)&gt; Heck, if you ask some people, Rust is less secure than a GC’ed language for web apps if you use any crates that have unsafe code - which includes Actix, the most popular web framework, because unsafe code allows things like deferencing raw pointers.You can write unsafe code in Python (and some of the web frameworks use this) and nothing helps you with auditing it, unlike unsafe blocks in Rust."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is actually funny, because I was involved with the creation of this list, way back in 2004.  The whole thing started as a way to stop phishing.I was working at eBay/PayPal at the time, and we were finding a bunch of new phishing sites every day.  We would keep a list and try to track down the owners of the (almost always hacked) sites and ask them to take it down.  But sometimes it would take weeks or months for the site to get removed, so we looked for a better solution.  We got together with the other big companies that were being phished (mostly banks) and formed a working group.One of the things we did was approach the browser vendors and ask them if we could provide them a blacklist of phishing sites, which we already had, would they block those sites at the browser level.For years, they said no, because they were worried about the liability of accidentally blocking something that wasn&#39;t a phishing site.  So we all agreed to promise that no site would ever be put on the list without human verification and the lawyers did some lawyer magic to shift liability to the company that put a site on the list.And thus, the built in blacklist was born.  And it worked well for a while.  We would find a site, put it on the list, and then all the browsers would block it.But since then it seems that they have forgotten their fear of liability, as well as their promise that all sites on the list will be reviewed by a human.  Now that the feature exists, they have found other uses for it.And that is your slippery slope lesson for today! :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After years of seeing developments like this, getting worse and worse, it fills me with rage to think about how clearly nobody in power at Google cares.I naively used to think, &#34;they probably don&#39;t realize what&#39;s happening and will fix it.&#34;  I always try to give benefit of the doubt, especially having been on the other side so many times and seeing how 9 times out of 10 it&#39;s not malice, just incompetence, apathy, or hard priority choices based on economic constraints (the latter not likely a problem Google has though).At this point however, I still don&#39;t think it&#39;s outright malice, but the doubling down on these horrific practices (algorithmically and opaquely destroying people) is so egregious that it doesn&#39;t really matter.  As far as I&#39;m concerned, Google is to be considered a hostile actor.  It&#39;s not possible to do business on the internet in any way without running into them, so &#34;de-Googling&#34; isn&#39;t an option.  Instead, I am going to personally (and advise my clients as well) to:Consider Google as a malicious actor/threat in the InfoSec threat modeling that you do.  Actively have a mitigation strategy in place to minimize damage to your company should you become the target of their attack.As with most security planning/analyzing/mitigation, you have to balance the concerns of the CIA Triad.  You can&#39;t just refuse Google altogether these days, but do NOT treat them as a friend or ally of your business, because they are most assuredly NOT.I&#39;m also considering AWS and Digital Ocean more in the same vein, although that&#39;s off topic on this thread.  (I use Linode now as their support is great and they don&#39;t just drop ban hammers and leave you scrambling to figure out what happened).Edit:  Just to clarify (based on confusion in comments below), I am not saying Google is acting with malice (I don&#39;t believe they are personally).  I am just suggesting you treat it as such for purposes of threat modeling your business/application."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a relatively long article - but it does not answer one simple question, which is quite important when discussing this: were there any malicious files hosted on that semi-random Cloudfront URL? I realise that Google did not provide help identifying it - but that does not mean one should simply recomission the server under a new domain and continue as if nothing has happened!From TFA:&gt; We quickly realized an Amazon Cloudfront CDN URL that we used to serve static assets (CSS, Javascript and other media) had been flagged and this was causing our entire application to fail for the customer instances that were using that particular CDN&gt; Around an hour later, and before we had finished moving customers out of that CDN, our site was cleared from the GSB database. I received an automated email confirming that the review had been successful around 2 hours after that fact. No clarification was given about what caused the problem in the first place.Yes, yes, Google Safe Browsing can use its power to wipe you off the internet, and when it encounters a positive hit (false or true!) it does so quite broadly, but that is also exactly what is expected for a solution like that to work - and it will do it again if the same files are hosted under a new URL as soon as detects the problem again."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Patterns on the most effective teams I’ve worked on:- high degree of trust and emotional safety between team members. The team can safely share feedback and risk sharing our crazy ideas- high degree of care for the craft. We hold each other accountable to quality- ships, regularly, to real customers- little status seeking - goes with emotional safety - few individuals on the team need to be “in charge” or hold arbitrary titles.- the individuals are more than fairly compensated and the company shows their love for the team in big and small ways- the team talks to their customer and has a lot of empathy for their problems. They want to be accountable to them- the team has a lot of empathy for new team members and works hard to make on boarding easier- some willingness to “get in trouble” with the broader org because you know what you’re doing is right ultimately for the customer- high self starters: instead of complaining, people feel empowered to solve problems or prototype ideas without a permission structure- not too much catering to “super stars”. 1-2 heros does not a team make, the senior people make it their job to lift everyone up. The team doesn’t obsess over their high performers.There’s a lot more emphasis on emotional intelligence and  empathy in an effective team than on any specific process."</p>

I say this as someone that&#39;s worked in large companies and saw how lengthy not only process feedback loops were (especially developer ↔ product team), but also engineering feedback loops (testing, deployment, dev environment setup, etc.)And I also say this as someone that works on side-projects by myself.

Setting up fast engineering feedback loops (multi-tiered deployment, test, dev, local, prod, etc. environments, heck even hot reloading or debugging) is needlessly difficult, or janky, or simply impossible. This goes for just about any language/framework out there: from Java, to Javascript, to Go.It&#39;s not surprising that FAANG often designs their own internal systems that handle this sort of thing (from DevOps, to automated testing, to A/B testing, to deployment). I&#39;m a believer that this is also a space that&#39;s ripe for disruption. I want environments to just work. I want code to just compile. I want containers to just run. Without me having to start digging through documentation, looking at thirteen Stack Overflow threads, and cobbling a solution that will inevitably break 3 months from now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I run a honeypot software company, with our customers being mid-large enterprises. While the case presented here is certainly interesting, it&#39;s actually fairly uncommon for companies to run internet-facing honeypots, mostly due to it being a huge resource sink, and it&#39;s fairly difficult to learn anything truely useful from observing attacks coming from (mostly) bots.The more interesting use case for most is planting these in your network internals, which gives an added benefit of early, high-fidelity threat detection in addition to the &#34;threat intelligence&#34; bonuses. It&#39;s not completely trivial to set up, but can be a reasonably quick way to build good detection capability into even very disparate environments.A vast majority of organizations still lack good situational awareness of their infrastructures and this is one way of improving on that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is interesting, but like most honeypot discussion kinda melodramatic.  They got scanned by a bunch of known internet scanners, and a few mysteries including a &#34;store that sells weaponry&#34; (which turns out to just be scopes and red dots -_-).  It&#39;s always good to people reporting that they discovered nothing, but it is a bit boring."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It seems obvious not to connect a power plant to the internet but there have also been of attacks against &#34;air gapped&#34; systems: https://www.reuters.com/article/cybersecurity-powerplants-id...Edit. There is also a more in depth Scientific American article. Search for &#34;Hacking the Lights Out&#34;."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve felt a lot of &#34;false&#34; positivity espoused by project managers, especially those in charge of agile ceremonies.Examples: &#34;I&#39;m really {proud,impressed} of all of you for your output this sprint&#34;, &#34;You guys are {killing,crushing,owning} it&#34;, &#34;You all should be very proud of what you guys did&#34;, etc.These aren&#39;t given after periods of crunch time, they&#39;re literally every week to the point where it feels so contrived and artificial. They&#39;re given when we&#39;re just doing normal, expected work.I&#39;ve mentioned this to colleagues and friends and there seems to be two camps of people: those who want constant positive reenforcement and those who it completely has the opposite effect, an annoyance. I guess I fall into the latter."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I vastly prefer honest negativity over dishonest positivity. An example of this is the behavior of service personnel in the US compared to my native country, every time I go there I almost want to tell them to tone down the niceness, but of course there&#39;s no point because I realize I&#39;m the odd one out.Of course I appreciate the effort of being &#34;nice&#34; but when you&#39;re not doing it out of genuine care for someone I&#39;d much rather just be treated in a neutral way, like you&#39;d treat any human being you encountered that you knew nothing about. I don&#39;t much enjoy being treated as an old friend by someone who wouldn&#39;t lend me five bucks, and I don&#39;t enjoy being asked polite questions that require elaborate answers when you really don&#39;t want to listen to the answer and your eyes glaze over within the first seconds.Adults have left their insecurities behind them and should understand they&#39;re not, at least initially, the friend of every human being and shouldn&#39;t have a problem with being treated in a professionally reserved way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think Toxic Positivity is a bit of a misnomer, I&#39;d probably call it &#34;False Positivity&#34;.It&#39;s not some subset of real positivity that is toxic, it&#39;s just... not actual positivity. It&#39;s an act."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe the first attempts at doing something like this were back in July of 2020. https://github.com/below/HelloSilicon : Someone with an early Developer Transition Kit (pre-M1 release) worked to convert the code from &#34;Programming with 64-Bit ARM Assembly Language&#34; to the M1&#39;s syntax.Porting additional  textbooks to M1&#39;s (ARMv8) syntax could help a lot in terms of making assembly accessible to more people. I believe there&#39;s a lot of value in learning it on a particularly popular real-world platform like x86 or M1 - where it may directly translate to reverse engineering userspace applications without having to then learn another assembler language as you might if you started with, say, RISC-V.Truthfully I think someone should really add the M1 syntax to the new version of VisUAL: https://github.com/scc416/Visual2 . I&#39;ve been intending to work on that to go along with porting Bob Plantz&#39; &#34;Introduction to Computer Organization: ARM Assembly Language Using the Raspberry Pi&#34; to ARMv8 for the same educational purpose but haven&#39;t quite found the time to really dive in. A tool like VisUAL2 could help a lot of people learn this even if they don&#39;t own an M1 themselves.Very tangentially to all of this, I&#39;d like to showcase https://github.com/cornell-brg/pydgin , which is a flexible toolkit for simulating ISA&#39;s in Python, and was used to help validate the first version of VisUAL during its own development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting choice of technology, but you didn&#39;t completely convince me to why this is better than just using SQLite or PostgreSQL with a lagging replica. (You could probably start with either one and easily migrate to the other one if needed.)In particular you&#39;ve designed a very complicated system: Operationally you need an etcd cluster and a tailetc cluster. Code-wise you now have to maintain your own transaction-aware caching layer on top of etcd (https://github.com/tailscale/tailetc/blob/main/tailetc.go). That&#39;s quite a brave task considering how many databases fail at Jepsen. Have you tried running Jepsen tests on tailetc yourself? You also mentioned a secondary index system which I assume is built on top of tailetc again? How does that interact with tailetc?Considering that high-availability was not a requirement and that the main problem with the previous solution was performance (&#34;writes went from nearly a second (sometimes worse!) to milliseconds&#34;) it looks like a simple server with SQLite + some indexes could have gotten you quite far.We don&#39;t really get the full overview from a short blog post like this though so maybe it turns out to be a great solution for you. The code quality itself looks great and it seems that you have thought about all of the hard problems."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This post illustrates the difference between persistence and a database.If you are expecting to simply persist one instance of one application&#39;s state across different runs and failures, a database can be frustrating.But if you want to manage your data across different versions of an app, different apps accessing the same data, or concurrent access, then a database will save you a lot of headaches.The trick is knowing which one you want. Persistence is tempting, so a lot of people fool themselves into going that direction, and it can be pretty painful.I like to say that rollback is the killer feature of SQL. A single request fails (e.g. unique violation), and the overall app keeps going, handling other requests. You application code can be pretty bad, and you can still have a good service. That&#39;s why PHP was awesome despite being bad -- SQL made it good (except for all the security pitfalls of PHP, which the DB couldn&#39;t help with)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;  (Attempts to avoid this with ORMs usually replace an annoying amount of typing with an annoying amount of magic and loss of efficiency.)Loss of efficiency? Come on, you were using a file before! :-)Article makes me glad I&#39;m using Django. Just set up a managed Postgres instance in AWS and be done with it. Sqlite for testing locally. Just works and very little engineering time spent on persistent storage.Note: I do realize Brad is a very, very good engineer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If you are the kind of person that want to read an article titled &#34;explained as easily as possible&#34;, I think you should just avoid saying the phrase &#34;big oh&#34; but instead talk about algorithm runtime more informally, like &#34;quicksort has a worst case quadratic but average case n log n runtime&#34;.The risk is otherwise you will shoot yourself in the foot, maybe during an interview or other situation, as Big O is just one out of many members in a family of notations that has a very specific mathematical definition, other common ones being small-o and big-theta.Analysis of algorithms is more difficult than it appears. If you implement an algorithm in a high level language like Python you may get much worse runtime than you thought because some inner loop does arithmetic with bignum-style performance instead of hardware integer performance, for example. In such case you could talk of big-omega (your analysis is bounded-below instead of bounded-above, asymptotically)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A bad programmer solves their problems inefficiently and a really bad programmer doesn&#39;t even know why their solution is inefficientTo any beginners reading this: Solving problems inefficiently does not make you a bad programmer. Most of the time, an &#34;inefficient&#34; solution will be good enough, and optimising for performance comes at a cost.So sit back, relax, and enjoy the journey."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Every one of these &#34;Big-O explainers&#34; says pretty much the same thing: count (or bound) the number of steps, then take the most significant term, and drop the constant associated with it.  None of them explain why you take the most significant term or drop constant factors.I get why that is.  You need the mathematical definition to demonstrate why that is, and most &#34;Big-O explainers&#34; don&#39;t want to assume any significant amount of mathematical background.  But, that definition isn&#39;t that hard.  It&#39;s simply:f(x) is O(g(x)) iff there exists a positive number M and an x_0 such that for all x &gt; x_0, |f(x)| &lt;= Mg(x).And, if you&#39;re in an analysis of algorithms context, it&#39;s even easier, because you typically don&#39;t have to worry about this absolute value business.Well, that M is essentially the reason you get to drop constant multiples of f(x).  And, you drop the least significant terms of f(x) because g(x) dominates them, i.e. lim_{x -&gt; \infty} g(x)/f(x) = 0.  (No need to prove this, because this is what makes the &#34;less significant&#34; terms less significant.)I would also like to add that the equals sign in f(x) = O(g(x)) is one of the most useful abuses of notation that I know of, but it can be misleading.  It doesn&#39;t behave at all like a real equality because it&#39;s not symmetric, but it is transitive and reflexive.  It actually acts more like set membership than equality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Along with the unionization at Google, I think it&#39;s a good trend to see them happening at big tech companies. As it says in the article: &#34;Unions are a prominent presence at Amazon in Europe, but the company for years successfully fought off labor organizing efforts in the U.S.&#34;It&#39;s sad that Amazon, along with FB and Google, etc. have managed to squash unions so completely here in the US. There&#39;s a lot of propaganda around unions that helps prevent them from every gaining much power. Obviously Amazon warehouse employees desperately need unionization much more than software devs, but I think both are needed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unions were proponents for worker safety, fair wages, anti-discrimination. They are the reason why such thing as OSHA exists today. They are the reason some laws were passed to protect workers in the US.But once these mandates became law, corporations used the arguments of &#34;why do we need unions if the law already protects workers?&#34; This and following Reagan&#39;s firing of the air traffic controllers changed the image of unions. They were now corrupt middlemen that charged you a fee to be part of the club.And it worked. Trying to form a union is now news instead of being the natural course of things. I wager that most people in the tech side of Amazon have a hard time grasping why their coworkers are trying to unionize. (we get paid well, what&#39;s the fuss all about?)I hope they vote in their interest, but I&#39;m doubtful it will pass (I hope I&#39;m wrong). These laws that are supposed to protect workers are enforced by the company&#39;s HR department[1]. The problem is that HR will side with the company before siding with any employee.I think we need to start looking into reforming HR and making it a public service.[1]: https://idiallo.com/blog/unions-are-not-coming-back"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder what percentage of otherwise very liberal Amazon devs read sentences like &#34;The company for years successfully fought off labor organizing efforts in the U.S.&#34; and come away thinking &#34;we&#39;re definitely the good guys.&#34;"</p>
