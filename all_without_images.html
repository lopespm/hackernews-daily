								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At a high level, I really like this. Some UX concerns are all that stop it from being amazing:- The mouse should be a pointer, not a hand. Not only is that the expectation when an element is interactive, but it helps with precision clicking.- The map almost made me sick when it starting moving. It needs to be slower and smoother. You already let people speed it up, but start slower.- Dragging the map should be possible. I wanted to scroll back to something that had moved off-screen, and the map dragged a few pixels, then snapped back. If it is supposed to be draggable, let it drag. If not, don&#39;t let a drag start  and then snap it back.But really, those concerns aside, this is a nice tool."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think about this whenever someone posts about yet another new immediate mode UI library, or a custom layout engine they’ve built on top of HTML canvas. Generally all these kind of approaches make your app invisible to screen readers.The amount of work Apple, Google and others have put into making all this work is staggering, and life changing for people who are blind. Please don’t throw all that work away in your apps just because you think some UI toolkit is shiny."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Having several friends on the Apple a11y team, they really do work tirelessly to make the accessibility experience amazing. A lot of the engineers on that team have visual, audiotory, or other physical impairment as well, which is really cool to see and as a result they’re all really invested in making the product accessibility awesome.Personal favorite “Easter egg” in their accessibility utilities is the baroque voiceover descriptions for the built-in wallpapers. A current colleague of mine shared it last week as part of Global Accessibility Awareness Day - https://twitter.com/mattt/status/1395439320652148736?s=21"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There will come a day when Apple will lean in heavily on Accessibility just like they&#39;ve recently amped up Privacy in ads lately.I, for one, absolutely love this about Apple! Accessibility is a beautiful core value to strive for (Privacy and others too). But I particularly appreciate Accessibility.Good designs/affordances such as gestural trackpads or mouse cursor support on iPads are all accessibility features, except they cover a major swath of humanity rather than those traditionally considered &#34;less-abled&#34;.Disclaimer: I work at Apple so I&#39;m biased. More likely, my heroes at Apple such as Sue Booker are accessibility experts  -- so I&#39;m always fan-boying over these features!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few years ago, I ordered the cheapest six-axis robotic arm from ebay for about $100 that came with basically no software or motor-driver boards, so I did it all from scratch with a PCA9685 board, a basic kernel driver and some very hacky scripts from user space.One day I had some friends over for a glass of wine, and wanted to show off my creation. I invited them into my &#34;lab&#34; and placed my wine glass down on the desk so I could type a few commands with both hands.My rudimentary software had some motion smoothing once it was up and running, but upon initialization, if the arm was significantly displaced from where it had been when it was turned off, the PWM board would instruct the motor to immediately &#34;be&#34; in a position that required the arm to travel clear across the desk in effectively as little time as possible.In this case, where it had been previously happened to be where my wine glass was now, and the flimsy aluminum at high speed was enough to shear the stem from the glass and explode the bulb. Luckily the wine didn&#39;t get in any sensitive electronics, but I learned a valuable lesson about the difference between messing around with hardware vs software."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wrote a layoff database for Nortel Networks from ~1998 to 2001.The way I got my notice of termination was while I was running some tests on the production database and needed a &#34;negative&#34; so I searched for a userid that was not present in the database: my own.When I saw my name in the list I called my manager and asked him what was going on.He said &#34;Alex, why don&#39;t you head on home for the day and I&#39;ll call you there&#34;I wouldn&#39;t say &#34;hurt&#34; though. Nortel went bankrupt and I got a great severance package."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"About seven years ago I got a bright idea to build a quadcopter. I had experience with little $25-50 drones that bumped around the house with their fragile one-inch propellers, which obviously qualified me to build and pilot something significantly bigger.Off to Aliexpress and Banggood I went. I ordered a carbon-fiber chassis, big strong motors, ESCs, 3-inch propellers, a FrSky receiver, a Devention transmitter, an STM32-based controller, giant li-poly batteries, and all the cables and fasteners I needed. Over the coming weeks the parts trickled in. Finally once the whole kit had arrived, I assembled everything, connected the TTL serial, built the firmware, downloaded it to the controller, and like the brilliant software engineer I am, plugged in the batteries on my bench at home.Nothing happened. Those of you who have blown off fingers wondering why the firecracker under the Coke can hasn&#39;t exploded yet can guess what I did next.I examined the chassis closely and began fiddling with the cables and connectors. Again, like the brilliant software NOT HARDWARE engineer that I am.Evidently, I fixed the problem. Which caused four gigantic propellers to begin whirling around my hands and face. And four brushless electric motors to emit their usual high-pitched whine, which today I instinctively hear as them saying to me &#34;You god damned idiot. You are so ours.&#34;I was not injured. But that evening, I came close to slicing at least a couple things off my body. I hadn&#39;t appreciated the scale of the thing I was building, or the inherent risk in debugging it once I&#39;d slapped it all together. I shelved the project for years, eventually giving it to someone at work who claimed to know his stuff when it came to drones. I hear he&#39;s doing fine.Disclaimer: this story isn&#39;t about code or my own code. But I think it fits here because I approached dangerous hardware with the &#34;build, run, see what happens&#34; mindset of a software developer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A few random thoughts here:* some better tools for searching, tagging, tracking my history, etc to allow me to better use and self organize their docs on &#39;mdn plus&#39; would be a useful service.  it may also give them some more insight on how people are using it and what areas are of bigger utilization.* tools to allow me to ask private questions in areas of their docs, with some prioritization for answers/responses.* IDE plugins - I think there&#39;s one for IntelliJ Ultimate, but not specifically from MDN.  Having more direct access to MDN info while inside my IDEs would be something probably worth paying for.  I suspect they may get some useful data on when/where people are having trouble.  I wouldn&#39;t even mind contributing some of my source code snippets back from within the IDE if it would help give more examples to MDN.* a couple years back, a friend started a podcast experiment of just reading MDN docs for javascript.  It was... a bit different, but trying out some other formats for their docs.  perhaps a Q&amp;A podcast where mdn folks answer some of the answers (taken from the paid-Q&amp;A bullet point above).  (but yeah, they fired a bunch of people last year, no?)$2-$3/month, if there were/are nicer tools to help me track what I&#39;ve seen, perhaps letting me add private annotations so when I come back I can jog my own memory... I would try that, at least for a while (I think I&#39;d get use out of that).  $10/month - for just some &#39;premium&#39; content?  Probably not.  $50/year would, for me, probably be an upper bound (unless/until I see more potential benefits).EDIT: had not seen &#39;down below&#39; - they have &#39;Bookmark and annotate free and paid content for reference across devices.&#39; as a feature - possibly along the lines of what I was thinking above.  Signed up for waitlist."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wish they’d clarify if the money is used to support MDN or not. I wouldn’t be opposed to supporting MDN patreon style, and if it comes with “perks” like articles, sure, why not. But I would do this to support MDNs core documentation, not because I’m dying for technical deep dives.That said $10/mo is a bit steep for me. And in any event, if they don’t make explicit that the money goes to support MDN upkeep and development then it’s a nonstarter. I’m not giving Mozilla money to fritter away on another rebrand or whatever else they want to use it for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Obviously it would be nice if everything everywhere was always free, but docs and opensource suffer a lot from lack of sustainability when based on voluntary donations. Companies simply have no incentives to pay for anything.There are surely tens of thousands of companies worldwide, whose employees rely on MDN on a daily basis. There are poor startups among them, but many of those companies have pretty deep pockets. If just a small percentage of those employees ask their bosses for this $5/mo. sub, this can improve things considerably. For now everything is free, so no one has an incentive, or a way, to pay.As developers, we are collectively guilty for never asking our employees for anything which costs $$$. Many of us (me including) assume that asking for a few bucks sub is almost a crime. Or we don&#39;t want to deal with stupid bureaucracy and an arcane process to set up the sub.Personally I hope the experiment will work. Let&#39;s see in a few months.I think the best model would be something like: subscribers get the premium content immediately, other people with a few weeks/months delay. This would keep a healthy balance and keep the incentives in place for people to pay."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Kinda off topic but I&#39;m curious, what&#39;s the proper strategy to adopt as a company when someone copies your product and distribute it legally for free? Do nothing (individuals &amp; small companies that are going to self host the product were never your market anyway)? Offer a self-hosted plan too? Obviously it depends for each company. I wonder if there are companies who famously changed their offer following the release of a free/self-hosted/open-source competing product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This looks more featured than Seatable I was looking into.
A few questions on features and plans:1. Are all the views mobile friendly,2. Any plan for a map view,3. Multiple views in a page? (aka dashboard)4. How does AGPL affect getting payed to create a solution based on this? I&#39;m not talking about offering it as a service as is  as happens with elastic, redis and the cloud providers.5. How do we create plugins?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At a large site I used to work for circa 2011, before everyone had gone fully HTTPS, we received similar panicked reports from users: &#34;I&#39;m logged in as someone else!&#34;  Turns out an ISP in the Philippines decided to just ignore `cache-control` and `vary` headers and forcibly started caching logged-in responses along with auth cookies. Bad times. Made it clear to me why the whole web would have to go HTTPS."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Klarna is no stranger to criminally lax attitude towards data privacy and security. In Finland, they implemented a checkout flow based only on your SSN (personal ID number). By simply entering someone else&#39;s SSN (which is not hard to guess/pry) you can reveal anyone&#39;s official home address.Further, they enable a &#34;pay later by invoice&#34; checkout flow, again by just knowing someone&#39;s SSN. Scammers use this to order items from web stores to automated pick-up lockers with someone&#39;s else&#39;s SSN for payment info. The victim usually only becomes aware about this activity when they start getting debt collection notices for unpaid invoices from multiple stores for thousands and thousands of euros. The debt collection process in Finland is famously unfair and harsh towards the supposed &#34;debtor&#34; (here: victim of fraud).Unless the &#34;debtor&#34; (victim) actively opposes each and every individual collection, the cases will eventually end up in court with summary judgement. This will ruin the victim&#39;s credit rating, which has devastating results for just about all aspects of life. People are known to have collapsed under the burden of all this and ended up taking their own life.Klarna&#39;s response to all this is that they want convenient checkout experience and some fraud is unavoidable. Although there are excellent technical means available to strongly identify users in Finland, they add a minor layer of inconvenience compared to just typing in your SSN. This is OK for Klarna since they give exactly zero fucks about security as long as they can make a little buck from it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked in a project over 10 years ago where something very similar happened!We had built and authentication service that, among other things, was used by a SyncML service that was used back in the day of feature phones to syncs contacts etc. You can imagine that getting someone else&#39;s contacts on your phone isn&#39;t exactly ideal. This was how we came to know about the problem, from customers getting other customers data!The error was caused by a CDN switch. Our instructions to the the CDN team responsible for the switch was &#34;Make sure the CDN honors our cache headers, if our HTTP responses say something can be cached do so, if they say that the response should not be cached then don&#39;t&#34;. We were in at least three meetings where we repeated this mantra.I believe that the CDN team thought that they had setup the CDN correctly but they had missed an edge case. The CDN was in fact setup to cache even uncacheable responses, and served those, _only_ when it could not reach our servers.So if there was a traffic spike and the CDN determined that our authentication servers were unreachable it would fall back to serving data that should never have been cached in the first place! Happily returning tokens to random users that had authenticated just before the traffic spike..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not to downplay the cultural importance of The Very Hungry Caterpillar – but can I suggest another one of Eric Carle&#39;s books?It&#39;s called &#34;Pancakes, Pancakes!&#34; In it, the protagonist wants to eat some pancakes – but he discovers that in order to do so, he needs to harvest and mill some wheat, milk a cow and churn some butter, and so forth.I read this to my kids when they were little, and it struck me as actually a pretty good lesson about how much work goes on outside of our house, in order to make Saturday Pancakes possible. But it&#39;s not presented in a preachy way at all – more of an excited way, like &#34;isn&#39;t it interesting how much background work goes into Saturday Pancakes?&#34;.I credit that book with getting my kids interested in food/cooking and much more than that as well – the seed of thinking about what has to happen for an Amazon box to show up at your door with a particular gizmo.So I&#39;ll pour out some pancake batter for Eric Carle on Saturday morning."</p>

One cable can do Thunderbolt, the other cannot. One cable transmits 4K video signal, the others doesn&#39;t transmit anything.

It really had lived up to its hype for me so far.My USB-C devices are: a wireless charger, two MacBooks (one intel, one m1), a Pixelbook, Nintendo Switch, Oculus Quest and Quest 2, iPad Pro, and the charging case of some earphones… I think that’s everything. Oh, and my partner’s phone and headphones too.Anyway - I’ve cables and chargers dotted around the house, plus some A-C ones for use with power bricks - and never had any grief powering/charging any device from any of them.

Is that from going all flash?Heading to https://oxide.computer/product for more details, lists:- 2048 cores- 30 TB of memory- 1024 TB of flash (1 PiB)Given how much of the rack is storage, I&#39;m not sure which Milan was chosen (and so whether that&#39;s 2048 threads or 4196 [edit: real cores, 4196 threads]), but it seems like visually 4U is compute? [edit: nope] Is that a mistake on my part, because dual-socket Milan at 128 threads per socket is 256 threads per server, so you need at least 8 servers to hit 2048 &#34;somethings&#34;, or do the storage nodes also 
 have Milans [would make sense] and their compute is included [also fine!] -- and so similarly that&#39;s how you get a funky 30 TiB of memory?[Top-level edit from below: the green stuff are the nodes, including the compute.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m most excited for the treesitter integration and its potential to amplify Vim&#39;s &#34;killer feature&#34;: text editing as a language.Vim&#39;s editing language feels most powerful when I&#39;m using its text objects: &#34;ciw&#34; means &#34;change in word&#34;, &#34;cis&#34; means &#34;change in sentence&#34;, and so on. But Vim&#39;s built-in text objects are not always a perfect match for the code you&#39;re editing. Suppose you want to change the first argument of a function, for example; there&#39;s no built-in &#34;first-argument&#34; text object. But Treesitter integration makes it easy to create text objects that understand the AST. Without much effort, users will be able to make mappings like `cia1` to &#34;change in argument 1&#34;, and these mappings will work across all languages with Treesitter support."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I use nvim in the terminal and gvim/macvim on the desktop. I don&#39;t like how the nvim community seems to be throwing themselves wholeheartedly into lua and lua-only plugins (vimscript plugins are better because they work with both vim and neovim). Switching to init.lua also means losing all compatibility with vim, and I cannot fathom why people would want to do that considering that there is nothing that init.vim cannot already do.I also don&#39;t like how there looks to be an upcoming split in the plugin community when Vimscript 9 releases and the neovim community will ignore it while plugin authors in the vim camp (e.g tpope) may start moving their plugins over to it.That said, the built-in LSP for nvim is very good thing and I plan to migrate away from the node-dependent coc.nvim once nvim 0.5 releases."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Actually, it&#39;s somewhat worse than the headline mentions. It seems that the script targets channels that merely mention Libera in the topic. The topic of an affected channel I was in said: &#34;See also #foo on irc.libera.chat&#34; (as we hadn&#39;t decided whether or not to move). And everyone in the channel was banned from both the #foo and the ##foo channels on Freenode.Needless to say, Freenode kindly decided for us whether or not we should move to Libera for good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very good to watch a “Hard Sci-Fi” show like the expanse. Not many of these out there.Not just the UI, but The tech is realistic and possible and usually backed up by basic scientific principles.The social scenarios are also quite likely in the future.Even the language makes sense - a kind of hodge-Podge universal accent.And it tangentially originates from Larry Niven’s belter stories just before mankind sent the ram robots to distant stars.The Expanse is everything to like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One of the most unrealistic things about depictions of futuristic computer systems and UI design is that they almost always do exactly what the character wants with a minimum of hassle. No, technology in the future is going to cause as many problems and as much frustration as it does today. And those problems will be more keenly felt, because in space, your life depends on the technology working properly. There should be episodes where, for example, the main challenge and risk doesn&#39;t come from aliens or hostile humans, but from the fact that the OS running the ship&#39;s engines crashes and needs to be restarted every 5 minutes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I remember a comment by Adam Savge on one of his YouTube videos where he visited the sets. He also had a brief cameo in one episode (as a ceew member of the Arboghast, I believe), sitting at a terminal. He remarks that the terminal screen wasn&#39;t just showing a random animation, but had a fledged out menu system that changed screens on touch input. So he could actually &#34;use&#34; the station while acting instead of just making stuff up.As far as I know, a lot of films had only blank screens on set and the computer display was added in post, trying to match whatever &#34;interaction&#34; the actors came up with on the set."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a bit surprising, but hardly the biggest problem. I’ve posted before about it, but academic has to get away from the infantilism of using KPIs to judge creative intellectual work.Part of the problem is that people seem to want an objective evaluation of a piece of research, and measure the value for taxpayer money. Well, you can’t get an objective evaluation. It’s all subjective. And “impact” as a quantifiable entity in general is nonsense, for one thing the timescales prohibit its measurement at the point where it may be useful.The solution is to use management. Lots of people object here and say “but nepotism, favouritism” and yep that’s a problem, but it is less of a problem that the decline of western universities. You can circumvent it somewhat by rotation, by involving external figures, by a hierarchy that ensures people are not colluding, but ultimately you just have to trust people and accept some wastage.People aren’t in academia for the money. It’s a vocation. You’re not going to have many people milking the system. Things went pretty well before the metric culture invaded the academy. They can go well again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One way forward could be to lower the bar for publications.Once it&#39;s no longer about being in the esteemed and scarce &#34;10%&#34;, they won&#39;t bother because they don&#39;t need to. Imagine a process where the only criteria are technical soundness and novelty, and as long as minimal standards are met, it&#39;s a &#34;go&#34;. Call it the &#34;ArXiv + quality check&#34; model.Neither formal acceptance to publish nor citation numbers truly mark scientific excellence; perhaps, winning a &#34;test of time award&#34; does, or appearing in a text book 10 years later.I&#39;ve been reviewing occasionally since ~1995, regularly since ~2004, and I&#39;ve never heard of collusion rings happening in my sub-area of CS (ML, IR, NLP). I have caught people submitting to multiple conferences without disclosing it. Ignoring past work that is relevant is common, more often our of blissful ignorance, and occasionally likely with full intent. I&#39;m not saying I doubt the report, but I suspect the bigger problem that CS has is a large percentage of poor-quality work that couldn&#39;t be replicated.BTW, the most blantant thing I&#39;ve heard of (from a contact complaining about it on LinkedIn) is someone had their very own core paper from their PhD thesis plagiarised - submitted to another conference (again) but with different author names on it... and they even cited the real author&#39;s PhD thesis!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It has long seemed like there was soft collusion in academics anyway. There is plenty of complaining and suspicion about how bad and rigged reviews can sometimes seem to be. There are plenty of rumors of PIs who influence what gets published through back-channel alleys. But even in the absence of outright nefarious activity, there&#39;s a reinforcement cycle where bigger labs influence what papers get in, receive more grant money, and get better about influencing what papers get in. Even gently guiding what topics are acceptable, in the long term shuts out newcomers. Just about any graduate student by the time they graduate has reviewed papers in a &#34;double blind&#34; system where they could reliably identify the authors, there are always tell-tale markers and styles. It&#39;s really hard to find true anonymity.I&#39;ve been thinking on an off about review system that might improve on things. I&#39;m imagining perhaps: reviewers and authors both get to see who they are, and conflicts of interest can be called out by other people after review and before publication; reviewers are chosen at random, not allowed to bid; reviewers are sent a series of pairs of papers, and asked to choose which one they&#39;d rather see, scores and ultimately publication can be decided by rank choice vote rather than reviewer assignment; comments on paper improvement would be completely optional. Would this be better or worse than what we have? Would it deter explicit collusion?"</p>

The employe retaliated by using their moderately large social media presence to disparage my friend and her company.Strangely enough, other people with zero experience in the matter were piling on to support the claims.

If you are worried about having to jump through multiple files to understand what some code is doing, you should consider that your naming conventions are the problem, not the fact that code is hidden behind functional boundaries.Coding at scale is about managing complexity. The best code is code you don&#39;t have to read because of well named functional boundaries. Without these functional boundaries, you have to understand how every line of a function works, and then mentally model the entire graph of interactions at once, because of the potential for interactions between lines within a functional boundary. The complexity (sum total of possible interactions) grows as the number of lines within a functional boundary grows. The cognitive load to understand code grows as the number of possible interactions grow. Keeping methods short and hiding behavior behind well named functional boundaries is how you manage complexity in code.The idea of code telling a story is that a unit of work should explain what it does through its use of well named variables, function/object names, and how data flows between function/objects. If you have to dig into the details of a function to understand what it does, you have failed to sufficiently explain what the function does through its naming and set of arguments."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Finally! I&#39;m glad to hear I&#39;m not the only one.  I&#39;ve gone against &#39;Clean Code&#39; zealots that end up writing painfully warped abstractions in the effort to adhere to what is in this book.  It&#39;s OK to duplicate code in places where the abstractions are far enough apart that the alternative is worse.  I&#39;ve had developers use the &#39;partial&#39; feature in C# to meet Martin&#39;s length restrictions to the point where I have to look through 10-15 files to see the full class. 
 The examples in this post are excellent examples of the flaws in Martin&#39;s absolutism."</p>

People expected to be able to change colors and layout with CSS, for example. The native APIs put heavy limitations on what you could do with a native context menu and it was just not compatible with the expectations of people building against the rendering engine at the time.There was some discussion of switching back and forth between native and non-native menus based on styling, but that got complicated quickly and it wasn&#39;t thought to be worthwhile.It sounds like perceived needs have changed, and maybe the native APIs allow for bit more flexibility now.

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27277819">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi HN! We’re Matt and Brendan, co-founders of Fig (https://fig.io/hn). Fig adds VSCode-style autocomplete to your existing terminal.We built Fig because of our own struggles in the terminal: we were tired of context switching between man pages, Stack Overflow posts, and Medium tutorials anytime we got stuck. We wanted our CLI tools to be more discoverable.The terminal is powerful, but unforgiving. It emulates the constraints of hardware (like teletype printers and video terminals) that became obsolete a generation ago. There are no built-in affordances. No hints about the &#39;right way&#39; of using a tool or even finding the right tool for the job. Beginners are thrown in the deep end. And even seasoned developers can screw up their system with a few unfortunate keystrokes.To solve this, we add a UI overlay that is linked with the interactive shell. As you type, Fig pops up subcommands, options, and contextually relevant arguments in your existing terminal. For example, you can type `npm run` and Fig will show you the scripts available in your package.json. You could also type `cd` when SSH&#39;d into a remote machine and Fig will list the folders within your current directory on the remote machine.We use the Accessibility API on Mac to insert text on your behalf and read what you&#39;ve typed. We also integrate with the shell to determine the current process and working directory. We are built natively for macOS in swift. We built our UI using web technologies so we can ultimately go cross platform. We render it using a WKWebView (not Electron).Fig is free for individuals and always will be. All completion specs - the templates used for generating CLI suggestions - are open source and anyone can contribute [0]. We plan to monetize by supporting autocomplete for companies&#39; custom scripts and internal CLI tools. Ultimately, we want to bring other process documentation (like SRE runbooks or deployment workflows) closer to the environment where it&#39;s used. You can see an early iteration of Fig in this HN thread from last July. [1]Fig is designed to be private. All processing happens locally on your device. None of your keystrokes are ever transmitted or stored by Fig.We&#39;d love to hear your feedback on what we’ve built! We&#39;re still in private beta (so things may break!!), but we are letting HN users skip our waitlist today and tomorrow using the link above! :)----Edit----We really appreciate all of this feedback! Brendan and I want to address some of the most common concerns below:Telemetry:
Fig has basic telemetry in order to help us make product decisions. We currently give the you option to opt out of all non-essential telemetry by running `fig settings app.disableTelemetry true`. This removes everything except for one daily ping. We use this ping to help us understand how many people were using Fig.Adding this ping was a mistake. We have already removed it and will be pushing this change in our next build (v1.0.43).Business Model:
Under the hood, we&#39;ve built an API layer on top of the terminal. This API lets you create visual apps. Autocomplete is the first app we&#39;ve built using this API. We have many more planned for things like interactive runbooks for SREs and automating deployment workflows. You can see some early prototypes here. [2] We plan to monetize these team-based apps by charging per-seat.Autocomplete will always be free for individuals. We will never sell your data.[0] https://github.com/withfig/autocomplete[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=23766980[2] https://withfig.com/videos/old-sizzle-reel.mp4"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I detest that it has become normalized to grant tech companies access to personal data with only limp promises that it won&#39;t be misused.If you give Fig permissions to look at what you are typing into the terminal, you should be prepared for them to look at what you are typing into the terminal and use it how it best serves them. They&#39;re asking for more permissions than that of course.Imagine giving FedEx a copy of your house keys &#34;just so they can guarantee safe delivery&#34; without any legal recourse if the delivery people decided to help themselves to the contents of your fridge, or make photocopies of your documents."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I am a software developer in the US with a Vietnamese origin, so I am no historian and my views are probably skewed.I am among the minority Northern Vietnamese people in the US, most Vietnamese people in the Bay Area are (refugees) from the South. People can tell where one comes from with one&#39;s accent. It was undeniable that much suffering and injustice was done for Southern people, especially after the war ended. So many still have a lot of resentments against the Hanoi government in particular and people from the North in general. Some still secretly view Northen international students in the US as red princes and princesses. The truth is far from that, they are just ordinary people looking for a better life. Many of the Northern people also have resentments with the current government as much as anyone else. However, I have to say much of the suffering and conflict is fading. I am so glad that in the last three years I was in the Bay Area, I have made many new Vietnamese friends, and have gone to many Vietnamese-owned shops buying groceries. I have not once had bad experiences with anyone in here. We spoke to each other and caring about each other despite of the differences.When I was a student in the US, I borrowed as many books and DVDs about the Vietnam war I could from the library and began watching to understand where I came from, and what to make of the war. I am still searching for the answer. One thing I began to understand is the reason that the North won the war. The people from the North did have a charismatic leader and more importantly, they had a sense of righteousness and revenge when they participated in the war. I still remember vividly, one day I watched an (American) documentary about a farmer after the 1972 bombing operation. The bomb killed all of his family members and all the pigs he raised and left him with nothing. He cried and vowed to fight till he dies. The guy had lost everything, he had nothing left to lose. That was the moment I realized it was inevitable that the North would inevitably win.I see that pattern a lot in places that talked about the war, for example in the article:&gt;She was only 24 years old but had been widowed twice. Both her husbands were soldiers. I saw her as the embodiment of the ideal guerrilla woman, who’d made great sacrifices for her country.I do not have as much exposure (or at least as much as I wished) to the literature, arts, and music of the South, but I can say that the sense of righteousness while fighting wasn&#39;t as strong in places that I have looked into.My (personal and flawed) conclusion is that it wasn&#39;t the policy, the brainwashing, or the political power of communism, or the help of Russia that made the North win. They won despite despite being poor as hell, they won despite being communist, and they won despite having lost more troops. They won because they took part in the war with a sense of righteousness.By chance, I just revisited the Vietnam war and the scar it left a couple of days ago, how much it matters in my everyday life, and wrote an essay about it on my blog. Here is the blog I wrote a couple of days ago about the war, btw, if you&#39;re so interested: http://www.tnhh.net/posts/lullaby-of-the-artillery.html"</p>

This odd behavior is also present in the (downstream) TCPDF library, which appears to have close to the same code.Complain as I may, I didn&#39;t have to buy Adobe Illustrator."</p>

IAM is a rabbit hole, now later VPC restrictions on top and couple that with terribly organized document it makes no fun at all.I get the need for all those layers of security but without well organized document everyone has to go through the ordeal.

There were no hijackers claiming to have a bomb? Just ATC telling them they have a bomb on board? And instead of landing at the nearest airport of Vilnius they turned to take a longer, more indirect route to a further away airport of Minsk?This would seem obviously suspicious to me. If you have a bomb on board, wouldn’t you want to go to the nearest airport, not the one further away? Wouldn’t you ask why you are being redirected further away? Then wouldn’t the response when you point out you’re closer to Vilnius and for safety want to land there make it clear to you something fishy was up?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think what the CountThings app is doing is great. There are too many industries where tasks are being performed inefficiently due to a lack of applying readily available technology. They had the foresight to develop a product for a very common problem and make a business out of it.I’m a bit surprised that this is making the rounds of HN though. OpenCV and other computer vision libraries have trivialized such counting applications for decades now. ML isn’t really necessary.The watershed algorithm for example, comes built-in and allows segmentation which can then be followed up with blob counting: http://www.cmm.mines-paristech.fr/~beucher/wtshed.htmlI don’t want to diminish OP’s work since the product seems to be well-developed and respond to a real need. I guess the challenge must have been making the app robust enough to support different workloads, lighting conditions, etc. I suppose the novelty factor is seeing to what extent the technology that we as developers and engineers work on every day is often disconnected from practical application."</p>

I suppose a lot could go wrong, but only a few games seemed to have especially strong reliance on floating point behaviors to begin with, and I sort of expect the behavior of JITs to be influenced by the interpreter a bit due to the way things are laid out in dolphin.I tried porting a much simpler JIT to M1 and ran into the problem that Rosetta 2 was simply better at translating an AMD64 JIT than my attempt at a JIT. It could’ve been related to W^X performance, but I actually suspect the real answer is that Rosetta’s optimization passes were doing things the JIT did not do natively. I don’t know how to debug that, though, because from the debugger’s PoV, emulated processes look just like native Intel processes."</p>

A minigame with extremely vague description that you have to react to quickly to pass.Thinking about it some more it fails the primary criteria for a CAPCHA: it needs to be harder to write the bot that cracks it than each test case, by at least a couple orders of magnitude.  Otherwise bot makers will just create custom bots for each contingency.  They have more time and funding than you do."</p>

The most likely explanation is that the Institute&#39;s fingerprints are all over this thing.The second most compelling evidence is that to date the reservoir species has not been found."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The author&#39;s definition of what makes a &#34;decentralized application&#34; is too strong and I don&#39;t agree that email isn&#39;t an example of a decentralized application. She argues that it&#39;s not because it&#39;s really hard to run your own mail server.To me, &#34;decentralized&#34; doesn&#39;t mean every user has to run their own node. It means it&#39;s an open network, anyone can join, and there&#39;s no centralized control / censorship. You can buy a domain and use Proton, Fastmail, or any other provider to have your own email. If you become unhappy with them, it&#39;s easy to move. We have open specs that allow every service to interoperate, so you don&#39;t need to know or care what provider your recipient is using."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The decentralized applications don&#39;t need to &#34;win&#34; (in market share) to be successful. They just need to be viable alternatives for a non-insignificant number of principled people willing to use them. This is enough to ensure that big players are kept in check. It&#39;s a basic application of Taleb&#39;s &#34;Minority Rule&#34; [0]I don&#39;t care that gmail has the majority of the market. I care that Google can not simply break compatibility with SMTP/IMAP and force everyone into their version of it. And no, &#34;it&#39;s hard to self-host&#34; is not enough of an argument. There are plenty of smaller professional hosting companies and as long as there is an option this is enough to stop Google from monopolizing the market.Likewise, I don&#39;t care that Matrix still doesn&#39;t have a perfectly polished client. As long as it lets me talk and have video calls with my family and friends without being forced into WhatsApp or iMessage or whatever closed solution is popular, I&#39;m willing to deal with its inconveniences and shortcomings. Bugs can be fixed, privacy violations can&#39;t.Crypto as well. For all the talk about &#34;investment opportunities&#34; in crypto and the &#34;get rich quick&#34; schemes, there are still a good number of people working on it that understand that the important thing is to have an alternative to the existing financial system.The worst part of the article though is not that it presents a problem that does not exist, it&#39;s the proposed solution: political intervention and regulation always works out in favor of the status quo.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"All I can really say in response to this article is that I expect it to age poorly.2021 is just a bad time to make confident pronouncements about decentralization. The vast majority of the population is living in Facebook/WhatsApp/Discord/Visa&amp;Mastercard land, sure.But I&#39;m a heavy Matrix user, it works great. I torrent all the time: it works great. I&#39;m also on urbit, and it works great. I don&#39;t use Mastodon personally but I hear few complaints from people who do. Podcasts are fine, other applications of RSS are pretty crippled by bad defaults of only including a little bit of the blog post, but Substack at least doesn&#39;t do it that way, which has me using an RSS reader again. It&#39;s nice!The big elephant is the cybercoins, and it&#39;s just a weird time to declare them a failure. It&#39;s like no one remembers 2017, this has practically been a carbon copy, just with more institutional buy-in and bigger numbers.No one knows if cryptocurrency is going to fulfill the promise of becoming a global store of value, let alone if it will be Bitcoin or Ethereum or some dark horse: but it pretty much has to go from worth nothing to worth everything, and the middle stages of that are going to be weird.The one I&#39;m really betting on is Matrix, though. They have reliable income from the French and German governments, and plenty of motive to make a really good platform. I fully expect them to be as slick and featureful as Slack and Discord within a couple of years, and start to eat those company&#39;s lunch.&#34;Redecentralization&#34; is harder than the first phase of building a green-field decentralized Internet, because there are entrenched powers with a head start. But there are some compelling advantages to decentralized technology, with means, motive, and opportunity, to build them out.Yeah. Don&#39;t think it will age well.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Vitalik is consistently one of the most interesting people to follow in the blockchain space. Even his (5+ year) old writing is quite interesting, if nothing else to see how Ethereum&#39;s research thinking has evolved over time.A few questions re: why &#34;Ethereum is not going further than quadratic [sharding].&#34;The first reason given: there&#39;s a minimum number of nodes required for shard for safety guarantees. So, a couple hundred shards, each with 1000 users seems like a limit. But I wonder: 10 years from now, if the blockchain (maybe pipe?) dreams succeed, then why do we expect 1000 * 500 = 5M nodes? This seems like it&#39;s quite small.Especially if running a node on a phone ever becomes reasonable, or at least participating in the data availability process is possible here, then why would we not go further?The second reason for non-super-quadratic sharding is data permanence. But here, couldn&#39;t we design different shards with different appetites for data permanence. Sure, NFTs currently are forever, but I can think of many applications where users do not give a damn about data permanence, and even some applications where users would prefer if data was just forgotten about.In which case, what&#39;s stopping us from saying &#34;these shards, we save. The other ones, who cares about.&#34; We would want users to opt into such guarantees, of course, but it seems reasonably possible.Of course, let&#39;s get a good sharded blockchain before we optimize for more.I&#39;m excited to see how sharding research continues to involve and drives the cost per TX (economic and environmental) down. Consider me a cheerleader rooting for you all!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has some really questionable assumptions.
Like the part about permanence.&#34;An important property of a blockchain that users really value is permanence. A digital asset stored on a server will stop existing in 10 years when the company goes bankrupt or loses interest in maintaining that ecosystem. An NFT on Ethereum, on the other hand, is forever.&#34;This is wrong 2 times.First, there is no general requirement of permanent storage. Its not important at all. It solely depend on the use case. Thats why it is very much inefficient to use a DLT with that property to move value (btc/eth etc.). I dont care how my coins was moved 10 years ago. The only storage that is relevant for me, now, for value transfer is the current undisputed state (aka the balances). Sure the Tx history has use cases and people who need them should store them but making that a technical requirement is only going to degrade performance and drive up Tx cost.BTW cash does not have a recorded Tx history who thought &#34;p2p cash&#34; should?
Its only because of the way BTC works (chain of all Tx) that this &#34;believe&#34; became common. Its technically not needed at all. There is absolutely no reason to recreate the whole chain to come to the current state. You either use the current state or you cant participate. If you would find an error in the chain whatcha gonna do about? Nothing. The current majority accepted state is all that matters. The &#34;validation&#34; is placebo it does nothing. And by running the exact same software as anyone else your validation would simply do the same error if there would be one.Second, the &#34;forever&#34; is a blatant lie. There is no way to know. Its will exist for however long at least someone is willing to store it. Exactly the same is true if storing is optional. But without the downside of crippling the performance and impose cost on the people running the DLT.
The cost for storage should be paid by the user of the storage.
If I can impose cost on all participants of a decentral system for all eternity with a one time payment then the system is deeply flawed. The possibility for abuse can be limited by simply making it expensive at any given time. But this obviously reduces the usefulness of the whole system especially for value transfer. The idea of an internet of value is to make value move like data, dirt cheap and decentral so no one takes a cut."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The really obvious weakness in any blockchain setup is the software. Whoever controls the software upgrade channel will always have potential control of the blockchain, whether that&#39;s the official entity in charge, or some intermediary.If you want really widespread distribution of full nodes, you need to make a consumer-friendly distribution of the node software, and package it and keep it updated in a way that regular users can run it and forget it. This same convenience introduces a centralization problem that obviates the whole point of running a distributed ledger.This is a point so obvious I hesitate to make it, but I&#39;ve learned that in blockchain territory there is no flaw too obvious to point out."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even if you&#39;re a &#34;computer person&#34; who is comfortable messing with the internals of a PC, be very careful with the power supply. Opening it up should really be left to professionals. Capacitors can remain charged for a long time after disconnecting the power cord. If despite all the warnings, you open it up to fiddle with internals because you think you understand the components and can pay attention not to touch things, at the very least, use only one hand at a time to avoid creating a circuit through your heart.In most other parts of the computer the worst that can happen in most cases is that you damage the computer, the power supply is different, there you also have a good chance of getting shocked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I had some contact with PSU designers at a name brand server company and learned some things:1. Electrolytic capacitors: Only Japanese brands can be trusted (this sounds racist or something, but it&#39;s an actual requirement).  They all should be de-rated for reliability (have 2x the voltage rating).  Only exception is the main bulk filter capacitors, where your only reasonable choice is 450V, but these should be 105C.  Tantalum capacitors: not allowed.2. Main switch MOSFETs: only Infineon can be trusted.  Single active clamp / single switch topology is a no-no due to bad experience.  (I think the one in the article uses a diode clamp, so should be OK).3. Standby supply needs its own fuse.  The problem is that the main fuse is too big for the standby supply.  If there is a standby supply fault, you will fill the machine room with smoke and your brand will be mentioned in the news when machine room is shut down.  This destroys shareholder value.The current limit for any exposed 12V rail is only 20A or something line that (240VA UL limit), so you must not have exposed 12V when the server cover is open.There was basically a 100 page requirements document all along these lines."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some components, mostly capacitors, have the wrong hole spacing for their pins, and leads were bent to fit. That suggests part substitutions during assembly. Many of the through-hole components were not pushed all the way down into the board. That suggests overworked assemblers. This was obviously hand-assembled.The author makes a point that there&#39;s a clear division between the AC line side and the DC side. That&#39;s required for UL approval, but power supplies do show up without it. The power transformer that crosses the boundary should also have a split bobbin, so the AC line side coil and the output side coil are separated by a barrier, not wound on the same bobbin.There are worse power supplies.[1][1] https://linustechtips.com/topic/515473-teardown-and-review-o..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m adamantly pro dry-run and like OP I&#39;ve found that you really need to design for it. From my experience, OP&#39;s two main ideas are spot on: librarification and pushing dry-run logic deeper into library code.Here are two other things I&#39;ve found:1. Regardless of where you push your run/dry-run dispatch to, the underlying &#34;do it&#34; logic really needs to be factored properly for individual side effects (think functional). Otherwise, you inevitably end up with loads of &#34;if dry-run / else&#34; soup or worse, bugs _caused_ by your dry-run support.2. You still need safety nets for when someone is doing dangerous operations without dry-run. Pointing and calling [0] is a great trick for this. For example, say your tool is about to delete X, Y, and Z. Instead of a simple &#34;Yes&#34; confirmation which the user would quickly end up doing on auto-pilot, you could have a more involved confirmation like &#34;Enter the number of resources listed above to proceed&#34; and then only proceed to delete if the user enters &#34;3&#34;.Very curious to hear about design idioms folks have come up with![0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointing_and_calling"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At my work I&#39;ve gone through and setup a variety of &#34;replacement&#34; commands for commands that may have dire impact on production systems. All of these replacement commands dry run by default (or fake dry run/try to create a dry run the best they can) and require a &#34;--do-it&#34; (think emperor palpatine voice) flag to do the intended operation. I&#39;ve had multiple coworkers thank me for this setup as it&#39;s saved people from silly typos and mistakes, one such being the different handling of programs in the use of and ending &#34;/&#34; in folders. ex. &#34;/etc&#34; is different than &#34;/etc/&#34; sometimes for certain operations.I&#39;d like to one day see a global flag on operating systems to dry run nearly all commands that changed anything."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Their example of pushing it into the type system is nice but requires a language with a fairly powerful type system. Once simple way to do this in basically any statically typed language is just requiring a &#34;Run Token&#34; for any bit of code that does something &#34;for real&#34;. This method works well if you want the output to be similar or identical for dry run and actual run.    struct RunToken;

    fn do_the_thing(_: RunToken, ...);

The general approach works for just about any statically typed languages (although null is the enemy).You can make it a bit more tedious to generate that RunToken so that a `do_the_think(RunToken, ...)` looks more natural. But the idea is simply that if the only place you create a RunToken is when parsing the --no-dry-run flag you can&#39;t accidentally do_the_thing when you move the code out of the `if is_dry_run` block without noticing.Of course this is a simple way to get fairly reliable dry run. I do agree that having seperate plan and apply steps is approach is the best when you can do it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Living in Shenzhen, it’s shocking how easy it is to go out and repair stuff. Living in Palo Alto, it’s frustrating how hard it is.I’m thinking maybe, just maybe, introducing repairability laws won’t solve the problem.I am perfectly happy upgrading the memory on my MacBook Air with a reflow air station rather than swapping out some dims if it means my laptop is half as thick and twice as rugged. I’m also just as happy dropping my phone off at a corner shop to replace the glass (while preserving the same electronics) using an industrial laminating machine.My problem today is not that repairability laws impede my progress here (they certainly don’t exist in China either).My problem is I can only get the chips and schematics I need to effect the repair on the Chinese Internet (WeChat/Taobao) or find someone to do the repair for me for $40 on the Chinese street markets (Huaqiangnan in Shenzhen). When I go to a corner store in the US the “solution” to swap the whole sub-assembly (glass+electronics) not just glass in case of a screen repair for $100+"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Apple&#39;s fight against right to repair while pushing materials to the public that state they are trying to reduce their carbon footprint is the absolute peak of hypocrisy. I understand the closed off design of their products is a result of the Steve Jobs era, but why can&#39;t the current leadership make a change?Why can&#39;t Apple make their products easily repairable while making them aesthetically pleasing? The typical &#34;private companies must satisfy the shareholders&#34; answer is just a scapegoat. Truly innovative companies (and companies of Apple&#39;s size and worth) should be able to solve these problems. Doing anything else is just fucking laziness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I genuinely do not want repairability anywhere near the top of the list of performance and design trade offs.Ruggedness, longevity, sure.  Avoiding need to repair, definitely.  Repairability?  Other concerns, things that change the day-to-day use of the device, should weigh more.Spent too many years as a full service PC network support small business to ever again want to deal with parts that aren’t actually attached to each other.  Connection issues (especially on heating and cooling, so intermittent) were essentially all the problems except a vanishingly small proportion that were components.The thing is, the repair shops get what’s left after the design is iterated until other problems are gone.  So maybe only these component failures are left.  Reverting to the old methods of replaceable components would likely re-introduce a massive class of problems that have by and large been eliminated.Only the remaining problems have a voice, who is advocating on behalf of all the problems that the last 20 years of more solid design eliminated?// Apologies for the HN trope, but see also Chesterson’s Fence, a tech version of “get off my lawn”."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Noted elsewhere:The Belarus plane hijack is a small reminder why it&#39;s generally not a good idea to let governments know who is going to where. I&#39;m not sure why governments that like to think of themselves as democratic don&#39;t see the risks.-- Alexander Bochmann https://mastodon.infra.de/@galaxis/106285985254850170I&#39;d made a similar point following the assassination of Kim Jung-nam in 2017:Travel and hospitality databases are widely accessible and shared amongst a tremendous number of organisations. State intelligence organisations might readily have access through their own state-run airline, or through private operations or plants within same. Similarly for terrorist, narco-criminal, money-laundering, or other organisations. Financial, banking, and payment-processing systems, only slightly less so. A P.I. license or position on a fraud or abuse desk at a major online retailer, or any skip-tracing agency, can have access to such information.https://old.reddit.com/r/dredmorbius/comments/5ud243/data_ar...What is your threat model?Note that your own threat model may not include possibilities which put others at risk.(In fairness, it appear that Protasevich was followed onto the plane itself, suggesting that in-flight availability of manifests played little role.  The question of what pre-flight intelligence methods were employed remains open.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just a story from the history. Plane of Bolivian president was forced to land in Viena in July 2013 in order to search for Snowden after France and Portugal forbid it flying through their air space. I strongly belive that Russian propaganda will use that incident as a leverage.To be clear, I highly despise the Belarusian regime and I&#39;m in full support of opposition. I could only hope that EU will do something in return but it looks like it&#39;s a standard way of handling the people politically considered to be terrorists. It&#39;s not the way it should be done neither by Belarus nor especially by US/NATO if they want to hold the peacekeepers flag. Otherwise it&#39;s just double standards and politics."</p>

Because he&#39;s facing torture, and the fact his girlfriend was arrested with him will make things worse. I don&#39;t know what to do"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I definitely identify with the author. A big mistake I made in the past was to assume that other software engineers are equally enthusiastic about these kind of projects, or the least bit impressed by them. I was asked for a job interview to prepare presentations on two projects I was particularly proud of. I chose a hobby Operating System kernel I&#39;d developed from the ground up, and a fully-functional MIPS assembler I had written. The interviewers (senior developers within the company) really just did not get it. Responding with questions such as: &#34;Is this going to make you any money?&#34;, and &#34;When do you expect this to be complete?&#34;. They really couldn&#39;t understand my motivations. I did these projects for no other reason than that I love programming, and I have never stopped loving learning about it. I have never needed to consider, or justify to myself why I did these things. I do them because I enjoy what I do.I ended up pivoting to discuss some comparatively banal professional project migrating a mid-sized financial product to a new tech-stack, which managed to captivate their attention. I found this experience extremely disheartening, however important a lesson it was to learn. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s changed my outlook in any way though, admittedly. I still work on the same kinds of projects, and I still think the best developers are the ones who do work on toy projects for their own enjoyment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Since a little less than two years, I live from a website I built, and I have a lot more control over my schedule.Since then, I built a lot more useless stuff. I&#39;m the only user. I can hardcode things, introduce breaking changes, manually migrate data and so on. I can cut corners, or over-engineer everything. Other people can use it, but I don&#39;t care about what they think of my variable names, or which features they want.The turning point for me was the concept of apps as home-cooked meals [0]. If a gardener can grow flowers only he will see, I can write code only I will run.[0] https://www.robinsloan.com/notes/home-cooked-app/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some the comments here are disheartening. So much crass dismissal of anything not monetized. A lot of what we use on regular basis got started with simple ideas for things with limited usefulness at the time. I remember when there was much more creative energy in this industry. Obviously, tech is a major economic force now. But, that pretense of creativity and exploration is still being exploited. That&#39;s why we are funneling entire generations into coding classes, maker spaces, and youth empowering tech initiatives. They are being told, &#34;learn to love coding. explore your dreams&#34;. Very quickly they get redirected into conformist production paths so they become tools. What a shame.Long live creativity and self-determination."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi all! I&#39;m David, CEO @ Retool. I&#39;m looking in to this right now and will update my comment here with a response in the next two hours.Edit: just did a bit of digging.It looks like we have a Retool template that has some fake data in it (https://retool.com/api-generator/). This is an app built in Retool, and has a few thousand rows of hard-coded data.Most of this fake data is self-generated, but we used the faker.js library (https://github.com/marak/Faker.js/) to generate three datatypes: IP address, avatar, and industry. This MIT licensed library, when used, creates data that links directly to fakercloud (https://cdn.fakercloud.com/avatars/). Here is the code itself: https://github.com/Marak/faker.js/blob/master/lib/internet.j..., and here is a demo that shows the library generating those links: https://rawgit.com/Marak/faker.js/master/examples/browser/in....I just spoke to the engineers who worked on this project, and we are sorry for including links to fakercloud. This wasn’t intentional, and we just pushed a commit removing all avatars from the template. This is already deployed. I hope you all can understand why we trusted the data generated by the MIT licensed project, and didn’t think it would link to anything proprietary.I myself am an engineer (and avid HN reader, as evinced by how I found this while reading HN on a Sat night), understand Marak’s frustration, and agree that monetizing OSS is hard. While we’ve already contributed around $10k to various libraries we use (https://opencollective.com/retool), including faker.js, Babel, ESLint, and JSON Schema, I’m going to see if there is more we can do. We’ll be writing a blog post about it this week and I will follow up with more next steps. I wonder whether there is a better way of sponsoring OSS, other than just donating dollars every month?  (Maybe we could commit one engineering-day per month for contributing back to OSS libraries we use heavily?) In the meantime, we&#39;ll certainly continue sponsoring all the libraries we’re sponsoring already, including faker.js.(Also: I’m sorry to Marak for not responding to his email re. acquiring Faker. More in this child thread: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27252420)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I hate to be that guy, but idealism in software needs to die.Don&#39;t use a license that&#39;s more permissive than you&#39;re willing to tolerate.It&#39;s absurd to me for a project to publish something with a 100% open source license and then complain when somebody tries to profit off of it.Doesn&#39;t really matter how egregious or large the perpetrator is. If you want exceptions, write it into the license. People want the goodwill that comes with open source, without accepting the consequences.That being said, I do empathize with the plight of the author. Perhaps they were naive to this possibility."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Random bits of semi-related advice:1. If you wanted Retool to stop using your service, you should have said it up front instead of beating around the bush. From what I can gather from your emails, you sent their CEO a random sales pitch and he ignored it. Hard to fault him for that.2. I love faker.js. I have used it in the past, and I&#39;m sure several teams in my company use it today. I would, however, never ever pay for your cloud service, simply because taking a dependency on a third party hosted website to run unit tests is madness. The old school corporate software licensing model might be losing favor, but that does not mean it isn&#39;t apt for any use case. If faker.js was still downloadable but needed a license key to run I&#39;m sure people would pay for it. It would probably be the easiest thing in the world to bypass, but the same Fortune 500 companies you mention would gladly break our their checkbooks rather than risk getting sued."</p>

And I can accept that they would prohibit installation/sales of software any other way. But I should be allowed to mark up the price by 30% and then call it out as a line item.The fact that Apple can control what prices I set on other platforms and prohibit me from disclosing what’s happening to my users...That is the part of this that strikes me as dystopian, and that’s the area where I think antitrust and free speech laws perhaps ought to step in."</p>

If Epic thinks Fortnite is worth $30, and Epic charges Android users $30 for the binary to sideload onto their Android devices, and because Apple charges a 30% surcharge, Epic sells the same app on iOS for $42.86, and Apple says, &#34;no, you&#39;re not allowed to do that, you have to charge $30 just like you do on Android&#34; -- no.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I will never forget the day a postdoc in my lab told me not to continue wasting time trying (and failing) to reproduce [Top Institution]’s “Best Paper Award” results from the year prior. He had been there when the work was done and said they manipulated the dataset until they got the numbers they wanted. The primary author is now a hot shot professor.My whole perception of academia and peer review changed that day.Edit to elaborate: like many of our institutions, peer review is an effective system in many ways but was designed assuming good faith. Reviewers accept the author’s results on faith and largely just check to make sure you didn’t forget any obvious angles to cover and that the import of the work is worth flagging for the whole community to read. Since there’s no actual verification of results, it’s vulnerable to attack by dishonesty."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue is that the authors of bad papers still participate in the peer-review process. If they are the only expert reviewers and you do not pay proper respect to their work, they will squash your submission. To avoid this, papers can propagate mistakes for a long time.Personally, I&#39;m always very careful to cite and praise work by &#34;competing&#34; researchers even when that work has well-known errors, because I know that those researchers will review my paper and if there aren&#39;t other experts on the review committee the paper won&#39;t make it. I wish I didn&#39;t have to, but my supervisor wants to get tenured and I want to finish grad school, and for that we need to publish papers.Lots of science is completely inaccessible for non-experts as a result of this sort of politics. There is no guarantee that the work you hear praised/cited in papers is actually any good; it may have been inserted just to appease someone.I thought that this was something specific to my field, but apparently not. Leaves me very jaded about the scientific community."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"More specifically, this paper is focused on the social sciences. That&#39;s not to say that this isn&#39;t present in the basic sciences either.But one other thing to note here is that these headlines about a &#34;replication crisis&#34; seems to imply that this is a new phenomenon. Let&#39;s not forget the history of the electron charge. As Feynman said:&#34;We have learned a lot from experience about how to handle some of the ways we fool ourselves. One example: Millikan measured the charge on an electron by an experiment with falling oil drops, and got an answer which we now know not to be quite right. It&#39;s a little bit off because he had the incorrect value for the viscosity of air. It&#39;s interesting to look at the history of measurements of the charge of an electron, after Millikan. If you plot them as a function of time, you find that one is a little bit bigger than Millikan&#39;s, and the next one&#39;s a little bit bigger than that, and the next one&#39;s a little bit bigger than that, until finally they settle down to a number which is higher.
Why didn&#39;t they discover the new number was higher right away? It&#39;s a thing that scientists are ashamed of—this history—because it&#39;s apparent that people did things like this: When they got a number that was too high above Millikan&#39;s, they thought something must be wrong—and they would look for and find a reason why something might be wrong. When they got a number close to Millikan&#39;s value they didn&#39;t look so hard. And so they eliminated the numbers that were too far off, and did other things like that ...&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oil_drop_experiment#Millikan.2..."</p>

From that perspective, FAANG is the obvious choice 99% of the time.The more and apt comparison would be if you should work at a startup vs. a corporate job at a HP or Qualcomm.  At those type of companies, compensation is not competitive (they often off-shore), benefits are tight, and the work is not interesting.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"What is success? The article assumes for the most part that success is mainly monetary, and further it makes the classic mistake of comparing success monetarily to companies like Facebook. Success is different depending on many factors.  For example, if a person needs or likes guidance and structure, a startup is likely not a good fit, especially when they are inexperienced. There are some good points about the strong community in startups and how it can be used to encourage excessive work hours and lower pay. However, that same community feeling and sense of purpose is what I remember fondest from working at startups. In addition, startups give you access to other capable and driven people that you might create a startup of your own with … much less likely at a large company full of risk-averse employees who work on a small piece of the company’s “mission”.What personality type are you? The author likely comes from a structured, religious background and prefers the “certainty” of a corporate environment.  Some of us were raised by hippies with little or no religion and high structure. People like that are miserable in highly structured environments in which gaining a sense of the “mission” is impossible.The main point here is that career decisions are highly personal and one person’s hell is another person’s heaven."</p>

				<div class="story__comments">
					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=27244004">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;d like to highlight the Introduction of nmcp.pdf which explains in a very compressed form how it works which encompass all the magic.&#34;The lossless data compressor employs the traditional predictive approach:  at each time t, the encoder uses the neural network model to compute the probability vector p of the next symbol values t knowing all the preceding symbols s0 up to st−1. The  actual  symbol  value st is  encoded  using  an  arithmetic encoder  with approximately −log2 ( pst ) bits. Then the model is updated knowing the symbol st. The decoder works symmetrically so there is no need to transmit the model parameters. It implies both encoder and decoder update their model identically.When  no  preprocessing  is  done, st represents  the  byte  at  position t. Hence there are Ns= 256 different symbol values from 0 to Ns−1.&#34;For those usually familiar with Huffman coding this is using an Arithmetic coding https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arithmetic_codingIt allows adaptive coding (i.e. changing the probabilities of symbols dynamically). Here these probabilities are modelled dynamically using a neural network.The magic is that the neural network parameters are defined implicitly : You don&#39;t need to transmit the neural network parameters, therefore you can use as big as you want neural network.During the decoding the from scratch network is continuously trained using the freshly decoded data, in the same way that it was during the encoding. The more data you compress, the more you train the internal neural network parameters, and the better the prediction for next character gets.You decode 20 bytes, you update the model with this new data, you decode 20 new bytes with the new model, you update the model,... , every 1000000 bytes you can even update your model multiple times using all currently available data to make the network converge faster.Of course this only works if everything is exactly deterministic, which Fabrice Bellard took great effort in guaranteeing, which is no small engineering feat."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Compression speed is around 2 KB/sec.The figure is given in nncp_v2.1.pdf. This is 1000x slower than xz, which in turn is 1000x slower than gzip.I have always wondered if a compression service could be a viable commercial offering and with NNCP rates and its compression speed, it looks like it could! That&#39;s for cases when you need to really compress the heck out of something, e.g. prior to distributing a large static piece of data to a very large number of recipients. I think there was a service like this, used by AAA game developers for distributing patches, but it didn&#39;t take because it had a very slow decompression... and, now reading further through the paper, it looks like an issue with NNCP too -    The NNCP v2 decompression speed is similar to its compression speed.

So it&#39;s a no-go for my brilliant and lazy startup idea, but fascinating stuff nonetheless."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Fabrice Bellard is proof that 10x programmers exist. Or even more than 10x; he single-handled wrote a software 4G LTE base station (https://bellard.org/lte/), something that would normally take a team of hundreds to develop due to the complexity of the specification."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Brilliant work.  And it makes me think - we produce tools, that are part of two phase spaces - the idea and the knowledge of how to create it.  Firstly I simply would not have thought of it, &#34;like button inflation&#34; is a pretty off the wall concept.  On top of which I don&#39;t know where to get an HN data feed or how to make a chrome extension etc.
Yesterday I was on a call with a collegue and the conversation turned to a useful feature we did not have (internal use) - and 30 minutes after the idea we had coded it up - because we had the knowledge but only lacked the idea till that moment.Without that knowledge even the best idea moves the process from &#34;yeah let&#39;s do it&#34; to &#34;I should schedule some time and make a project plan and ...&#34;The difference is important somehow.  And most of our working lives would be better if we stopped with the project plans and just built useful stuff.Edit: To try and clarify - exploring a new and uncharted phase space is exploration - it cannot be planned in advance, or driven in a particular direction.  Sun-Tzu teaches that Climate, Landscape and doctrine all affect our success as much or more than mission and leadership - so we should stop trying to control and actually find the flow.I think we search for product-market fit, we do not decide product market fit.One tool I realise i have been trying to build on and off is a post-hoc reporting tool that makes it look like my exploratory development style was actually planned (it&#39;s always something like, I am going to explore this inferring hill over there, and just make sure the roadmap, docs and timesheets are up to date.)  This way I don&#39;t get people bothering me so much.  It works better than grumpy."</p>

I don&#39;t think the answer is a return to 20th century &#34;no politics at work,&#34; but at the FAANG I worked at, politics was impossible to avoid. Even the desire to be apolitical is itself criticized at worst and not respected at best. Work doesn&#39;t afford the use of the &#34;block user&#34; button.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Boards should have more apprehension about their companies being exploited as political platforms by employees.It&#39;s as though there is a bargain where in exchange for boards tolerating staff radicalization, these employee groups cheerfully overlook the dystopian, totalitarian surveillance infrastructure, environmental devastation, and political corruption machines they seem to have zero problem building and managing on their behalf, and decieving users into depending on them. One doesn&#39;t even need to take a side to recognize the bitterness and contempt in tech toward red state denizens. I&#39;ve sat through numerous meetings where all the shibboleths were trotted out to make sure we were all on the same political page before senior executives engaged in what would be considered hate speech against working class people in any other context. If calling people &#34;trash&#34; isn&#39;t hate speech, I really don&#39;t know what is.There still exists a group (perhaps even a majority) in society who are good and charitable people with an immense amount of tolerance for this stuff because they believe tolerance is the price of principles, and they&#39;re only principles when they are hard to keep.Radicalized platform company employees do not have a single moral leg to stand on in this regard. Bringing your whole self to work to build defacto social credit systems and partisan social engineering and surveillance tools is just moral licensing. Maybe that&#39;s how they sleep at night. While they found a new way to take a few more minutes of peoples time to show them outrage and advertisements, at least they mouthed the right party lines in favor of distant oppressed people they don&#39;t know personally?I know a number of people in tech who sincerely believe they do not need to be good men or women by any standard because they are self justified by being engaged not in discourse, but ideological warfare. I used to think they were misguided idealists and I thought their passion could be used for good, but I&#39;ve come to realize they are just dispicable.All I can recommend is, don&#39;t let yourself be bullied."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"For people involved with technology I think this is a perfect response to &#34;how hard can it be&#34; - no matter if they&#39;re discussing how to keep toilet paper stocked or why cURL can be replaced with five lines of shell script - it emphatically shows how complicated something apparently simple can be once you start diving into it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Jonathan Blow, in a talk about how software is getting worse, points to the example of Ken Thompson&#39;s text editor, which Ken built in a single week.This kind of sentiment drives me crazy. Yes, internationalization makes things harder and more complex than they were in the old days. But, back then, only people who lived in one small part of the world were able to usefully use computers in their language. (Simply supporting the Unicode character set is not enough.)  Nostalgia for the simplicity of the past ends up having ugly cultural implications. It&#39;s easy to say &#34;let&#39;s go back to the time when things were simple&#34;; it&#39;s a lot harder to say &#34;folks in (e.g.) Israel shouldn&#39;t be able to type in their native language&#34;."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regarding the vertical cursor movement, back in the day there was an alternative behavior. You can see this in QuickBASIC/QBasic[1]. Here, Microsoft treated the entire screen as a grid. I always thought that was a great UI. It hides the fact that there are line endings (\n on Unix or \r\n for DOS). And why shouldn&#39;t it? That&#39;s an implementation detail. And as evident by DOS using CR+LF it goes back to the days where you had an actual physical carriage on a typewriter. Nearly every modern text editor you have to type out the spaces/tabs you want to reach the area you what to add text. In QBasic, you just move the cursor wherever you want on the screen with arrow keys and start typing. Because, unlike a typewriter, a computer screen is 2D. Vim has block mode but, AFAIK, can only work on selections. Of course, this is not universal and only works with monospace fonts in certain languages. But back in the day it made it easy to create ASCII/ANSI diagrams and art.Modern text editing is a multilayered mess. Rendering, input methods, variable width fonts, and the special codes (markdown, etc.). On some sites it&#39;s not even self-consistent. Take Jira. Last I checked, they have one editor for creating a ticket and an entirely different editor for editing that same ticket[2] (one of these editors sucks more than the other, but I can never remember which... but neither one is remotely what I would consider a &#34;good&#34; interface). How they got there is truly the 8th Wonder of the World.[1] https://archive.org/details/msdos_qbasic_megapack[2] https://community.atlassian.com/t5/Jira-Software-questions/H..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s such a pleasant surprise to me how effectively and quickly people have become concerned about this issue. The recent WWF report came out less than 2 years ago [1]. Microplastics were obviously known for a long time, but that&#39;s when conversations about microplastics re-ignited. And now we can see an entire country declaring plastics toxic and restricting them. If you&#39;d asked me an hour ago, I&#39;d have predicted it&#39;d take at least another decade before concern about this would spread widely enough to prompt a national policy shift. Great to see that raising public awareness can actually do something![1] https://wwf.panda.org/?348371/Could-you-be-eating-a-credit-c..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There is a lot of misleading and false statements in this article.They claim plastic recycling doesn&#39;t work. It&#39;s true that most plastic isn&#39;t recycled, but that&#39;s because of lackluster government involvement, not some technological barrier.British Columbia has the most sophisticated recycling equipment in North America. Two plants there first use lasers to identify different types of plastic (PP, HDPE, PET, etc) in the incoming stream and then use air blasts to categorize it.These streams are then separated by color. The material then goes to a plastics reclamation facility where the material is shredded, washed, dried, melted and forced through a filter, and turned to pellet.The result is that 74% of plastic beverage containers in BC are recycled. Why isn&#39;t this done elsewhere? It&#39;s because BC has a tax on plastic packaging, and this tax money is then used to subsidize the loss from converting recyclables into new plastic pellet (the cost is higher than the revenue). And other governments don&#39;t want to do it, partly due to lobbying from plastics packaging manufacturers.Plastic recycling does work when society wants it to. But instead we turn to paper. Paper produces double the CO2 emissions of plastic, and it requires vastly more energy: a European study showed that switching to paper in Europe would consume 57% more energy and 61% more greenhouse gases from packaging than are produced today. In a world where human existence is threatened most likely from runaway climate change, this seems like a bad idea.And while we&#39;re so focused on transitioning plastic packaging to paper, we ignore the real problem with plastic in the oceans: plastic netting dumped from illegal fishing. Plastic netting wraps around animals and drowns or suffocates them. It can also drag along a seabed, killing the seabed life.But this is considered a difficult problem to solve (international waters, policing is difficult, etc) so we ignore it.The idea policy would be:1. Tax plastic packaging. Use the tax money to pay for recycling that works, which has been proven to work.2. Develop international treaties and enforcement mechanisms to prevent illegal fishing and find ways to reduce fish consumption.3. Implement carbon taxes that reflect the cost to human survival imposed by any kind of packaging, or other activity, in accordance with the degree of GHG emission."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If there are restrictions, I hope they target major microplastic sources like tires and textiles, rather than easily scapegoated but very minor sources, like plastic bags and drinking straws. Based on precedent, I am not holding my breath, but I hope so."</p>

Each time I get a little more interested.The concern that I have is that there&#39;s going to be a learning curve to picking this up.  Normally, that&#39;s fine, but this is my browser.  I live in the thing and there&#39;s no other piece of software outside of my IDEs that affects my productivity more.  When I took the time to learn VIM a few years ago, retrospectively, I could have about spent half as much time learning it as I did and skipped a handful of things I don&#39;t use.  The tone isn&#39;t meant to be negative -- that 50% is tremendously useful and it&#39;s rare that I don&#39;t over-learn something (I enjoy it).I&#39;m hoping someone who uses Nyxt as their &#34;primary browser&#34;[0] might be able to provide their thoughts on any of my questions --I use VIM/VIM plug-ins, but Firefox; what&#39;s the experience of becoming proficient with Nyxt?Is there any tool/first-timer/quick-start that works better/worse for acquiring the muscle-memory?Outside of &#34;keyboard&#34; ...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is a cool project that I have tried a few times in the past. To me, the big draw is that it is written in Common Lisp. I was a patron contributor for a while, but when I had problems building from source, I stopped. Interfacing Common Lisp to things like WebKit, GTK, or Qt to build Nyxt was probably the reason I failed building from source, IIRC.This is probably a bad analogy, but forty years ago Lisp Machine subsumed the operating system. In modern times, in some sense the web browser is like an operating system layer, or at least a portable application platform. So, my bad analogy is that Nyxt is like a Lisp Machine.If I have time, I will try to build from source today. I just reread the dev source install instructions, and it does look straight forward. Hopefully being on a M1 MacBook won’t affect the build process."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Nyxt is web engine agnostic. We utilize a minimal API to interface to any web engine. This makes us flexible and resilient to changes in the web landscape. Currently, we support WebKit and WebEngine (Blink)."</p>

Separating HTML from visual styles was made easier when CSS was widely adopted by browsers in the late &#39;90s.&#34; etc. etc.This history lesson is not really relevant for newbies. It is basically a &#34;you kids have it easy, when I was your age...&#34;, something which every generating find really tedious to listen to, since it is irrelevant for their current situation.Knowing history is fine when it is relevant (e.g encountering legacy code), but it shouldn&#39;t be the first thing in a tutorial.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hot take: this, as some like Ars Technica have observed, stands a decent chance of being a real game changer.Everything about this vehicle launch appears masterful, from its technology to its branding to the obvious care taken to ensure that in almost every respect it is so superior, and offers so many no-brainers, as to make anyone who can (both individuals and especially, fleet managers), buy these as fast they can.This thing has more than one killer app.The biggest by far IMO is its ability to power high voltage high draw tools at the jobsite.If you have never worked on a jobsite, this is a BFD.This is itself a game changer, it offers the ability to &#34;disrupt&#34; in a material way a whole class of project. Logistics just got 20% simpler and projects 30% cheaper.Sure, it can go super fast; yes, you can lock your stuff in the truck...But the other killer feature for fleet owners is that these are remotely manageable.Your fleet now has detailed telemetry and its only going to get better.And this is on launch.We just got a RAV4 Prime and if I didn&#39;t live in SF proper, I might be seriously regretting not waiting for this thing. (I don&#39;t, and don&#39;t think this makes sense in the city.)If we move to e.g. Sonoma and work remote? This would be that no brainer.Hallelujah. Now, to invest in Ford..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ironically, the frunk on electric trucks is a game-changer. Complementing the bed with an enclosed, waterproof, secure place to carry things (and no mucking around with insecure bed covers) is a killer feature. No more springing for a crew cab just to carry groceries in the rear seats. In terms of practical carrying capacity this dominates an SUV."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A competitive market would enable me to sort by salary and benefits and apply for the best job.However companies don&#39;t want to compete on salary, and potentialy drive them up - they want maximum leverage. They get more leverage if process is obscure, so that you only agree salary late in the process and for the applicant, pulling out is risky.The market is not really free - its being manipulated by one side.Similarly with healthcare you don&#39;t know how much you will be charged upfront, so there is no competition on price.With housing (in UK) there is no competition on quality because the seller doesn&#39;t have to disclose any problems with the house. If it falls of a cliff the minute you sign on the dotted line, it&#39;s your problem.You have to pay for the surveyor to find out any issues the house might have, and that means you can only view a few houses before you&#39;ve paid the house price in survey fees."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think one reason why this is difficult for companies that are hiring software engineers, is that they can hire at multiple levels of experience. They just need good developers! A company that needs, say, a Golang developer, or Scala, or React, might be willing to hire a junior, mid-level or senior developer- they&#39;ll take whatever experience level they can get. Remember, saying that you don&#39;t want to hire someone too experienced is pushing the envelope on age discrimination laws....So if they&#39;re willing to hire someone with 2-20 years of experience, the salary range may be so broad as to be meaningless. $80-180k doesn&#39;t really tell anyone anything, and I&#39;d imagine regulators can&#39;t do much if that&#39;s what companies put down as their range. I find that a lot of people imagine an open job &amp; job description to be Very Rigid Categories, whereas in practice companies hiring in high-demand fields have to be flexible to find people. From the employer&#39;s point of view, that&#39;s why we find demands for the salary range to be frustrating- lots of companies really don&#39;t have a specific range in mind!If you mandate that companies use a tight salary band, they&#39;ll simply say OK, our Software Developer 1 pays $70-90k, Software Developer 2 pays $90-11k, etc. However- we haven&#39;t decided which level of software developer we&#39;re going to hire you for. Tough for regulators to beat that approach too"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Coloradan another thing that&#39;s happening is companies are listing their jobs as Remote, only advertising in CO, and just mentioning it&#39;s a CO only job verbally. They do the thing where they sit in the gray area due to pandemic &#34;Oh, it&#39;s remote, FOR NOW, but it&#39;s a CO job&#34; Or listing the job as Denver and a few other cities, but it&#39;s really just Denver/Boulder (Twitter currently doing this).Another pattern is listing the range as 40-250k so the disclosure is effectively nothing. Consulting companies Accenture, PwC, Deloitte are doing that one.A few companies are completely rejecting this whole law too. I&#39;ve spoken with a few that still won&#39;t disclose (usually &#34;We aren&#39;t CO based and it doesn&#39;t apply&#34;) or they just straight up aren&#39;t doing it with no comment.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Although I ~never used Apple products, a good ten-fifteen years ago I ran through a quite expensive &#34;Apple Human Interface Design&#34;[1] book. After that, whenever another &#34;book&#34; / blog series / etc came out about &#34;UI&#34;, I was discarding them saying &#34;and now what, that&#39;s just common sense&#34;.It. Is. Not.The more companies and people I had been working with, the more I started to see that most of the UI design (or for that matter, displaying information on a UI / document / advertisement) what I thought had become &#34;common sense&#34;, hadn&#39;t. Most of my colleagues cannot properly position / color a button. Cannot structure a document (headers, tables, bulletpoints) to be easily comprehensible, consumable. Struggle to summarize information in an email.This 50 UI tips is great! Thanks for this. I will share as a baseline with my team.[1]: I can&#39;t find which one.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I liked the points you raised, I think they serve as a good checklist for the finer details of designing UI.One critique I had when I was reading through is the use of he/him when referring to a hypothetical user. This is likely region-dependent, but it sounds awkward to me to assign gender to an unknown user.Some authors prefer they/them and some (more rarely) prefer an equal number of masculine and feminine pronouns.Great work, nonetheless."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Whilst we sympathise with the government’s desire to show action in this space and to do something about children’s safety (everyone’s safety really), we cannot possibly agree with the methods.Respectfully, stop sympathising with authoritarians who want to take away your freedom. They are not good people. Good people aren&#39;t nosey. Good people don&#39;t deprive others of liberty. Neither do they class a whole group (Internet users and entrepreneurs) as responsible for the actions of a minority. Guilt by association and collective punishment are antithetical to any lover of freedom and life.Their reasons of &#39;child safety&#39; and &#39;online harms&#39; (whatever on earth that means) are simply pretexts. They don&#39;t give a shit about children&#39;s safety. This bill will do nothing, nothing to improve the safety of children. The perpetrators will simply go after children in other ways. They won&#39;t change.If you, Mr. MP, care about children then ask why are they drawn to bad online content? What&#39;s going wrong with families and upbringing? Start with questions that might actually address the problem rather than implicate everyone who uses the Internet!The trajectory is to increase their power and control over your life. Again, they are NOT good people. They know EXACTLY what they are doing. They love dominating you. It&#39;s understandable why some imagine the government as simply well-meaning but misguided, for it makes our helpless subjection easier to accept.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked on a J2ME app that needed to access location on phones without GPS, I was in touch with the operator and got a list of cell ids with lat, lon.With that I created a daemon in Symbian that would query the cell id and open up a socket server to give it to the J2ME app.With that we developed an app to request a taxi service, but none of the taxi companies wanted it. Some of the complaints were:1. GPRS data plans were too expensive for end users
2. No one would put an expensive Sony Ericsson touch phone on a windshield, the windshield would be broken by thieves to steal it.
3. Looking at a screen on the windshield while driving was never going to be approved by authorities."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh man, do I have fond memories of developing on feature phones!Started wayyy back in 2007, and was a cofounder of a startup that made popular J2ME games available for free to people by wrapping it in our proprietary ad serving software. We launched more or less the same time that AbMob did, invented more or less the same stack (ad delivery to mobile phones), but we focussed on the product (games) whereas they focussed on the platform (ad delivery). A few years later AdMob was acquired for mega $$$ by Google, whereas we just kind of limped along and died a slow, natural death! Many years later I discovered that my cofounder just let our 4 letter domain expire (www.hovr.com) and I think it&#39;s up for sale now :(Also remember developing games on the BREW platform by Qualcomm, circa 2005. Whereas I was in India which mostly had GSM J2ME phones, BREW was much more popular on North American CDMA handsets. I, along with a friend, developed one of the first real-time multiplayer games called Blingster Battle, which was on top of Verizon&#39;s charts for a brief period of time! Truly groundbreaking stuff at that time..The most amazing bit, though, was when we made some BREW apps around 2013. By then iOS and Android had firmly taken over the smartphone market, and all the cool kids were downloading apps/games on them. However there was a very significant portion of the market - primarily composed of the elderly - who were still hanging on to their old CDMA feature phones and were still interested in buying new apps. We made a couple of quiz types games, that actually generated a couple of thousand dollars in revenue every month till last year, until Qualcomm finally pulled the plug on BREW!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a startup, Javaground [1], where we ported and developed games for J2ME phones.  We had a room full of dressers full of all the different mobile phones of the day.Each phone had different implementation quirks, such as variable audio delay when playing a file, audio/image formats that were faster/slower, odd button events (some used press, some used ondown, some had no ondown, etc).  A lot of our work was learning all of these quirks and implementing them into the automated porting platform.Then the iPhone came out and started to build momentum.I still have my old flip phone, the one with the least quirks, with some of our games on it.1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javaground"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"The new auto-complete is really impressive.I&#39;ve always been a big fan of using snippets and auto-completing based on open buffers in a project instead of using LSPs.I haven&#39;t used ST in a while but decided to install ST4 to try it out.I opened a Flask application that uses SQLAlchemy. I opened a Python file and typed User. and then it showed me a list of fields and methods on my User model without having the User model open in a buffer.I did the same thing in an Elixir project and after installing the Elixir package it worked for project specific &#34;things&#34; in my app. Like after typing UserView. it showed me only functions available in that view. Likewise it did the same thing with context modules, it picked up all functions inside of a specific module.In both cases as I started typing &#34;User&#34; it showed me options to pick from. In both cases it also listed out the number of definitions for a specific &#34;thing&#34; and lets you quickly jump to a specific one. If you mouse over a function it brings up the list to pick a definition / reference. There&#39;s also key binds to bring up a CTRL+p&#39;ish feeling menu to see and preview the file where something is being used.It&#39;s not as good as a LSP but it&#39;s definitely a few notches above what I&#39;ve seen in other editors and the best part about it is not needing to configure multiple LSPs and it&#39;s lightning fast."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel bad using VSCode after years of supporting Sublime (by purchasing a license). However the one case where I do use sublime repeatedly? When I need to open an editor QUICKLY. It boots faster than VSCode, and frankly, it finally broke me of my constant habit of VIMming now that I have it on my mac, win and linux boxes. I am eager to try V4, but I&#39;m so deep in VSCode now, I don&#39;t know if I can find my way out! I can even cross compile C and debug in VSCode!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s very odd, I use to use Instagram and it would make me depressed. IDK how to explain, I don&#39;t even have any friends on there I follow. Just something about seeing everyone at their best 100% of the time, doing amazing things 100% of the time, never facing adversity 100% of the time.I know it&#39;s not realistic but it still gets to your head.I uninstalled it from my phone I feel better about myself after a few weeks.I&#39;m guessing most of, if not all, social media is the same. I&#39;m slowly trying to ween myself off but it is so meticulously addictive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Note that Facebook does not have the choice to agree. To do so would be to open Facebook to unimaginable legal liability. So Facebook&#39;s opinion in the matter is moot. There are practically no inputs to this function that will change its behavior."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; &#34;The correlational evidence showing that there is a link between social media use and depression is pretty definitive at this point,&#34; said Jean Twenge, a psychology professor at San Diego State University. &#34;The largest and most well-conducted studies that we have all show that teens who spend more time on social media are more likely to be depressed or unhappy.&#34;&gt; Correlation is not causation, and one area of further study is whether greater social media usage leads to poor mental health outcomes or whether those who are depressed and unhappy are drawn to spend more time on social media.These are correlational studies. They aren&#39;t saying that they have evidence that Facebook causes depression. They&#39;re saying that increased social media usage is correlated with depression.Stepping back, it appears that screen time is correlated with depressive symptoms, with or without social media. One such study: Association between screen time and depression among US adults https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5574844/ This includes watching TV or simply using a computer for leisure of any sort.I know Facebook is a popular villain, but we shouldn&#39;t be jumping to conclusions that this data means Facebook causes depression or that Facebook is uniquely worse than other forms of screen time in its correlation with depression."</p>

Don&#39;t waste your money on noise-cancelling headphones, I have $200 ones and they don&#39;t compare to simple ear plugs. If you live in a moderately noisy area and you want peace and quiet, get them. They basically just make everything quiet. 24 from CVS = $10.OpenMove by Aftershokz - Bone-conduction headphones. Perfect for running and just good for listening to music. They work, they&#39;re way easier to wear and more comfortable than earpods, I haven&#39;t had any issues since I got them about 8-months ago. Plus, you can wear them with earplugs for music + noise cancellation. $99Cast iron skillet. This is more of a personal preference. I hate getting new kitchenware and then worrying about breaking it or getting it all stained. But these are super easy to clean and AFAIK practically never wear out. Also very cheap (iirc $15).Software:JetBrains tools. Basically the only software I can imagine spending $250 a year on, and it actually being worth it.Patreon and Github sponsors. Not much (I think $15 a month total). It&#39;s sad how few sponsors a lot of these projects have. I&#39;m not rich, but I can afford donating $5/month here and there. I really think the world would be a better place if more people donate to open source and content creators they like."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unlikely to get upvoted here but a used Porsche Panamera with an extended bumper-to-bumper manufacturer warranty.  As Doug Demuro says it&#39;s cheap, really cheap.There&#39;s not a single brand new car costing, say, 75 K EUR or less that I&#39;d have rather than that because the quality simply ain&#39;t there.The ride comfort, soundsystem, sound insulation, interior quality, how it drives superbly (and can yet be used for some spirited drive if you fancy that), etc.Best car I ever had. Next one is going to be another used Panamera, probably the plug-in hybrid. I tried the Porsche Taycan (their 100% EV) and it&#39;s amazing but I&#39;ll wait a bit until you can find used ones at bargain prices.I&#39;m a big fan of Tesla but, to me, the build quality simply ain&#39;t anywhere close: as in... It&#39;s not even remotely comparable. They are worlds apart. And as I don&#39;t rice at the greenlight, I don&#39;t care about the 0-60 perfs.There&#39;s nothing better to cruise at 110 mph on the autobahn or to go pick up the kid at school.It&#39;s high-end luxury with quality materials for less than the price of a new Camry.https://youtu.be/EAezax2ugQUBy very far my favorite purchase of the last two years+."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Airpods Pro.Not traditionally an apple guy so didn&#39;t expect to like them, but the guy talked us into them while we were upgrading my wife&#39;s phone.Wow. These things are just way better than any other earbuds and so much more convenient and comfortable than headphones. The Bluetooth just works even when switching between my Android and MacBook. The noise cancelling is great as well, way better than my Sennheisers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My company is moving away from it. We built a few services but after a few years some of the original people that introduced it left the company and it became very difficult to hire for. New hires were either people wanting to learn (so we had to spend a good bunch of resources into teaching + end up with a system built by noobs to the language) or very expensive developers with a lot of experience in erlang and elixir.We also found many times missing libraries, or found libraries which are incomplete, or unmaintained or just not well documented. Just compare the total amount of libraries in Hex, vs the total amount of libraries in rubygems. Somebody will say &#34;but Elixir libraries are higher quality so we need less, etc,etc&#34; as if there were not good developers in the ruby world and every elixir developer were a rockstar.Tooling is just terrible. The VSCode plugin is crap, kills the CPU unless you disable features. There is no IDE from jetbrains. There is a plugin but last time I tried it, it was even worse than the VSCode plugin.Also, I&#39;ve read some comments where people mention &#34;we don&#39;t need redis&#34;, &#34;we don&#39;t need workers&#34; everything is so much easier. That was our thinking at first. But then you realize on deployments you will lose your cache, or your background jobs, etc. So you have to persist them either in mnesia or in the database. At that point you&#39;re just reinventing your crappy undocumented and untested version of delayed_job.Most of what you get from elixir in terms of redundancy, high availability, etc you can have that anyway from kubernetes, heroku or any PaaS.... you will need more than 1 server anyway, so...Liveview sounds amazing until you try to use it in the real world. The most minimum latency kills the experience.In the end, we are back to Rails and much happier. Specially now we are using all the hotwire stuff. Not fancy, and not fashionable though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m at a relatively early stage VC-backed startup and from day 1 it&#39;s been written in Elixir. It was a fantastic choice, for many reasons, with some being:- Elixir is good for just getting stuff done. I came from a previous startup that used Go and Elm.- The community isn&#39;t as small as people make it out to be, or, it&#39;s quality over quantity. ;)- There&#39;s a lot of good modules out there, and if you need to write your own, it&#39;s easy and there&#39;s well-defined patterns. E.g. I recently improved our internal Zendesk client and it was a breeze.- https://dashbit.co/ for paid support/advice is amazing.- The console for experimentation, debugging, inspection, etc. is fantastic.- The let it crash, and other Elixir/Erlang philosophies, have been very helpful.- There&#39;s a solid amount of batteries-included, but not in an overbearing/restrictive way.- It&#39;s such a pleasant day-to-day dev experience.I didn&#39;t know Elixir before joining this startup. For myself, and workmates who also didn&#39;t have prior experience, it&#39;s been a breeze to get up to speed in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s not argument &#34;against&#34; selecting it (it&#39;s a free world, and mileage vary), but a couple of scar-earned advice:- Be careful about libraries. If you know that your system has to interact with X, don&#39;t assume that there is a running, idiomatic, maintained libary for X on `hex.pm`.
Do a bit of due diligence. 
We had experience ranging from `meeh` (oauth2, graphql, http) to `pretty bad` (mqtt, swagger.)But as other say, if you&#39;re doing vanilla Phoenix/Plug/Ecto with exactly the right kind of DB, you&#39;ll should be ok.- Give a little though about how you&#39;ll be deploying and operating. `releases` and `configuration` haved changed in pretty big ways in the past (https://elixir-lang.org/blog/2019/06/24/elixir-v1-9-0-releas...), the ecosystem is constantly in flux (`config.exs` vs `Application.get_env` vs ENV_VAR vs..) . Plus, the erlang virtual machine (BEAM) has knobs that are not always easy to play with. And if you hide it behind, say, docker containers, you&#39;ll have other troubles. Don&#39;t expect an `heroku do-some-magic` experience.- Unless you&#39;re familiar with the Actor Model already, and your application is very simple, expect a learning curve made of:  1. A period where you&#39;re afraid of GenServer and fail to do anything because you don&#39;t want to create a supervision tree
  2. A period where you think you&#39;ve understood GenServers and you create GenServers like crazy
  3. A sobering period where you don&#39;t understand anything about your application
  4. A couple of refactorings where you move the pendulum until you reach something that&#39;s acceptable

- Finally, you&#39;re coming from RoR, so you&#39;re probably fine with not having static types anyway ; may St Isidore help you ;)  There is a thing called `dialyxir`. It might help a bit ; It will disappoint a lot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Everyday sounds can be distracting, discomforting, or overwhelming, and in support of neurodiversity, Apple is introducing new background sounds to help minimize distractions and help users focus, stay calm, or rest. Balanced, bright, or dark noise, as well as ocean, rain, or stream sounds continuously play in the background to mask unwanted environmental or external noise, and the sounds mix into or duck under other audio and system sounds.Wow, I never thought of background sounds as something connected to neurodiversity, but TIL.I definitely never expected Apple to get into the business of white noise apps, but here they are.I wonder what the quality of these sounds will be, how long they&#39;ll loop for? And if all the background noise apps that already exist will continue to operate as they do now, or if they&#39;ll be able to integrate with this in order to take advantage of the new mixing/ducking features."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My money doesn&#39;t seem to fit in any of the slots on my computer...Apple just keeps knocking it out of the park and into a completely new sports metaphor assistive technology provision, they really do. Any measure, I&#39;m a massive nerd/geek/hacker and I really have looked into alternatives both in the open source and proprietary basis and nobody at all is assistive technology as well as at all right now.It really is as simple as whenever I have a new iShiny, I pounds on the nearest able-bodied monkey and get them to take total box and connected to Wi-Fi and then it&#39;s all me. From then on I don&#39;t need any more able-bodied assistance whatsoever with setting up the new device, it&#39;s awesome. And whilst it&#39;s been a few months, the last time I looked known of the other major players were able to come anywhere close to this level of frictionless setup for quadriplegics like me.ALSO! ALSO! Let&#39;s not forget that this isn&#39;t some crappy subset of functions that quadriplegics have to settle for whilst everybody else gets the full fat version of the software. Nope, with very few exceptions pretty much anything an able-bodied person can do with their iShiny I&#39;ll be able to do as well. Just a little slower.Apple, and specifically their approach to accessibility is only one of many reasons I&#39;m able to work, see my family and generally engage with society as well as I currently do.Also, I quite like the term cripple, differently abled or on a good day Stuart. WTF cares what label you give me, I am much more interested in whether this laptop enables me to do the shopping independently and see my Nieces without having to check with an able-bodied person first."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Several versions ago Jose talked about how Elixir is basically &#34;done&#34;, which is so refreshing these days!But since then, the developer experience has improved by leaps and bounds through all these improvements other than the core language. As a professional Elixir developer for the last 4 years, I&#39;m loving it. A few improvements in the last few versions off the top of my head that have been really nice:* Robust, timezone handling DateTime support in the standard library. I don&#39;t need Timex anymore!* Finally a good approach for configuring applications ar run time (e.g. with ENV vars), that works for dev, test, prod and releases, via config/runtime.exs.* Better compiler warnings verging on a little &#34;light&#34; type checking* Mix.install in this release finally makes Elixir work well for one-off little scripts, since you can just throw a Mix.install([:jason, :mojito]) on top.* LiveView is amazing, and I now keep open a LiveBook notebook for doodling in code, exploring an API, CSV, etc* Not really Elixir, but I&#39;m jazzed about Erlang/OTP 24 JIT support for better performance.Basically, if you took a look at Elixir a few years ago and thought it wasn&#39;t ready, might be worth another peek now."</p>

The only thing that determines BTC price is demand. And over the past 13 years, we&#39;ve seen reflexivity at work: The price has gone up, so more people want it, so the price goes up further, and on and on.There&#39;s no reason this can&#39;t happen in reverse. As in previous crashes, once the price starts going down, more people want to sell.Really just an interestingly pure experiment in group psychology."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I love stories like this. I have one of my own, actually.When I was first getting into IT I started sending out CVs. Mine was terrible. I had been working in call centres for years at this point and all my &#34;experience&#34; was basically self-taught, so not really experience at all. As a result my CV was void of any actual content a hiring manager in IT would want to read, thus it was binned a lot.I applied for a job at a nearby network hardware repair place. They needed someone to look after their Cisco kit and about 30 Debian Linux systems. I was attracted to the mix of responsibilities so I applied, sending in me not-so-good CV. I was eventually asked to come in to have a chat after waiting about a week to hear back from the place.At the end of the interview, Bob (let&#39;s call him), said I was more knowledgeable than the RHCEs that were coming through his door. This was nice to hear, but then he said something that really made me smile...Apparently my CV was worse than I thought. It was so bad, that Bob literally put it in the bin under his desk. About four days later, Bob was reading through a local Linux User Group (LUG) mailing list and he saw a name he recognised: mine. So he opens the email and reads the thread in which I helped another LUG member compile a sound driver for their kernel. The instructions I gave worked.Bob was impressed but he couldn&#39;t quite remember where he had seen the name. At this point the business owner, John (heh...), was standing besides Bob&#39;s desk and noticed my CV in the bin. He pulls it out and reads my name across the top. The penny drops for Bob and I get the call to come in and have a chat.I got the job."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It was 1992 and I was a high school senior.  My teacher got me a job at the local DPW in the electical department.  I was to work in the warehouse under a guy named Al who was an old timer and lost his hand in a forklift accident 30 years prior.  My job was to clean the warehouse, and when I was done Al told me to &#39;go hide somewhere&#39; which I did, at the top of the shelves 20&#39; in the air, which I had also cleaned.  
This got boring and so I wandered into the main office where people were huddled over a computer.  They were doing a mail-merge with quick basic to inform customers that their power would be out, and it wasn&#39;t working.
I looked over their shoulders and it was exactly what I had been doing to send out mailings to companies for free stuff as I had read in Radio-Electonics magazine.
I fix the problem, and the Chief Engineer said &#39;come with me&#39; and takes me to the (air conditioned!) sub-station and into an even colder computer room where they had just setup the SCADA system to control the towns breakers and monitor the power.  
Nobody knew how to program it, so he pointed to a 3&#39; pile of manuals and said this was my new job.  By the end of the summer we saved the town millions by siphoning power from the local college at peak power demand.  I still hung out with Al, and helped him in the mornings.  The linesmen still made fun of me, even more so when I accidentally turned off half the towns power for 15 minutes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a kind of similar story when I started studying in the late 2000s years. There was a company that had a specialized and really expensive measurement device. But the vendor went out of service. They changed part of their system but kept the measurement device only to find out it could not talk to the new system because the file system of the data was proprietary to the measurement device.I got a student job at that company and one of my first tasks (and that of several students before me) was to open measurement results on the device and type them into excel spreadsheets. I did this for an hour or so until I became totally bored so I started to tinker around. The measurement device had it&#39;s own PC that booted Windows (I think it was 95 or 98) and autostarted their software in full screen/some sort of . This was easy to bypass via the task manager and running explorer.exe. I found out that the proprietary file format was simplay an MS Access file with a different extension. I tried to open it, but the file was password protected.   
At this time I had little to none experience with programming or anything else that was &#34;low level&#34; computer stuff, but I occasionally stumbled about writeups about hacks and exploits and skimmed over them. So I was pretty sure that there had to be a hardcoded password somewhere. I started to open every file I could in a text editor with no luck. Then I got a hex editor and opened the binaries and finally, in a dll there was a password. 
The next few days at this job I spent teaching myself enough Python to read the Access files and write the contents into an Excel file.This worked and I used the free time to study/eat/sleep while getting paid for it but then one of my supervisors found out that I wasn&#39;t doing anything but still got results and wondered how I did it. He immediately put me onto another problem they had, thus starting my career as a software engineer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many of the comments on this article are so cold. I can’t believe it. When I read the original article I was imagining all the constructive ways HN readers would interpret it and hold a mirror up to their own behaviour. Some commenters are doing this. But it surprises and depresses me how many people are commenting saying “no, this list isn’t what it says it is, it’s a list showing the author has a negative mindset / is not from the Valley bubble, and that problem can be fixed by just getting over it.”. We can do better than that.As someone who has sat at some interesting class and race intersections during my career in tech, including my time at some very prestigious institutions like the University of Cambridge and FAANG, and has exhibited and noticed many of the listed behaviours and the lack there of, I can say this article had the undeniable ring of truth and made me feel sick to my stomach. Guilty for when I’ve been on the rich side and angry for the times I’ve been on the poor side.The psychology of growing up with financial uncertainty - and a risk of racial exclusion - is hard to shake and can be passed from parent to child. My life has mostly been financially blessed but you can’t buy your way out of the mindset, or snap your fingers / empty the cache / cycle the power the way the average HN commenter seems to think you can."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Three paychecks is a month and a half of income (rent and two car payments by my fevered calculations, which never stop)&#34;Pay attention to those last three words. This is very important. I&#39;ve been on both sides too, and to me those words are like a slap in the face: stark reality.If you&#39;re poor enough (relative to the costs of your life) you are at a constant exhausting deficit because you CANNOT stop calculating and recalculating the mechanisms of your basic survival. Even if you&#39;re not juggling bills and having to gauge what will blow up worst, you&#39;re projecting worst-case scenarios and trying to plan against adverse situations, which will come up more often for you (example: old car problems)&#34;which never stop&#34;Consider those words seriously. You can improve the quality and performance of a person a great deal by allowing them to function as they &#39;normally&#39; would, rather than in constant emergency mode."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m from a &#34;poorish&#34; family, but from Europe. Some stuff is relatable some is not:- People ordering lunch always felt weird for me, in my mind I think &#34;why should I pay 10€ for a bowl of salad, when I can go to the grocery store below the office and have the same for 1€&#34;, or even better pay 70 cents for the raw vegetables, wash them and chop them in the office and they will last 3 days- Student debt doesn&#39;t apply, the good thing of being &#34;poor&#34; in Italy is that the country pays you to go to university and not the opposite- When I got my first tech job I was like &#34;wow, I got a MacBook just for joining the company, this costs like 1 year of salary of my previous job&#34;- The part of stealing I don&#39;t find relatable, even when my bank account was empty I would never resort to stealing, must be some honour system I grew up with- The gym part is also not relatable, when I was fat and I did go to the gym everyone was very supportive, and every little progress was celebrated by everyone making you want to go more and more.A thing I notice, is that the mentality stays with you no matter your salary, I always try to avoid spending more than necessary, with a comparison with my colleagues my monthly expenses are less than 1/3 compared to them."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to me that the draft was censored and mentioned a buyer, while this one only talks about control. For me, it paints the situation worse.Still sad to see FreeNode fall. This will lead to a lot of split communities and dead links.EDIT: Fuchs finds some harsher words[0]:&gt; In the past few weeks, this has changed[2], and the existance of a legal threat
to freenode has become apparent. We cannot know the substance of this legal
threat as it contains some kind of gag order
preventing its broader discussion within staff.
The democratically elected heads of their respective teams, 
development, infrastructure, projects and communities
were removed by force[3] and have been informed that they are not 
entitled to act in their respective capacity.&gt; [...] A contract in which christel, former head of staff, allegedly sold freenode, surfaced.
And while I personally think that this would have neither included any servers
or code or user data, since that did not belong to christel to sell, I am not a lawyer
and apparently some of our volunteers got pressured very hard and their personal life
could have been ruined easily should we have fought against this apparent contract.This makes it look far more hostile than the linked note. Sad to see.[0] https://fuchsnet.ch/freenode-resign-letter.txt"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If this leads to a mass exodus from Freenode, it&#39;ll probably significantly reduce overall IRC usage.Communities will fracture, people will set up random splinter networks that will die off in a few months, and lots of open-source projects that already want to be using something Javascripty like Slack or Discord are going to use this as the motivating thing to make the switch.Personally I&#39;m staying put on Freenode because I don&#39;t see a lot of user-facing impact potential here, and IRC was already essentially untrusted/public (yes, even your private messages - you don&#39;t really know who is relaying them and how trustworthy they are)."</p>

Apparently there is no way at all except via the court system.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hard to take this seriously with all the straw men and broad generalizations.Reality check: there has never been a hotter seller&#39;s market for software engineering talent.  The fact that you have not landed a job does not mean that supply is not short in general.  Rather than blowing your stack at some recruiter who you heard on a podcast interview, you might want to reflect on yourself and how you might be coming off in job interviews.As far as low pay goes, yeah, welcome to the labor market.  It&#39;s easy to write a blog post about how companies need to pay more, but hard to reconcile the reality that if they don&#39;t have FAANG cash flows, &#34;market rate&#34; for developers may not be viable, regardless of management&#39;s good intentions or lack thereof.And with regard to bad interviews, remember interviewers are individuals, with skillsets all over the map.  Once you get more senior it gets even more frustrating to be judged by someone who has a fraction of your experience.  Trust me when I say there is no value in dwelling on this or getting your undies in a bunch.  Suck it up and figure out how to play the game (read CtCI, practice on interviewing.io, ask for feedback) and land the job, then do the best work you can every day.  Angry screeds will not change anything about the industry and will not help you."</p>

That&#39;s it, aside from non-programming jobs before their bootcamp.The whole thing reads like inventing scenarios that didn&#39;t happen or embellishing them.&gt; A bad interview is when you ask them the definition of some specific thing in some specific framework like “Tell me what a closure in javascript is.” then treat them like they’re stupid if they don’t know.Not that believable, but okay.&gt; I once had an interviewer ask me if I was a wizard with GO, C++, Rust, and C over the phone. Then when I said I had some experience with rust, he immediately cursed at me and hung up.Didn&#39;t happen.&gt; Nobody in their right mind is going to move to San Francisco, California to be a “Lead developer” for only 70k with zero equity.Are any companies actually trying to recruit like this? And is it successful beyond just throwing up a hiring post and not getting anything? I put in a limit buy of $3000 for 1 BRK/A on a whim once."</p>

I&#39;ve done a fair bit of interviewing on both sides of the table, and can say with complete honesty I&#39;ve never heard a curse said in anger in any of them.

I think a lot of this was more &#34;find the difference&#34; than it was &#34;tell me what version is better&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a big fan of 1Password. I&#39;ve been paying for it for years. A few years ago I got my partner setup in a few minutes and now they have strong passwords everywhere.  Its got great features for sharing vaults with other people so I&#39;ve got password managers setup for the kids too. My partner and I both have personal vaults, we have a shared vault for financial stuff, and a shared vault for our media accounts (that we share with the kids too)I get that people bristle about SaaS subscriptions in their personal life but the $60/year it costs is well worth it. The research shows that strong passwords and limiting re-use is extremely effective at preventing account compromises and 1Password makes this dead simple.The thing that finally made it an incredible app was when Apple finally allowed 3rd party password management in iOS.Yes there might be better password managers out there and they might have better security. However show me an alternative with a UX that is simple enough for my 6 year old to use, that works on iOS, Android, MacOS, and now Linux."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"PSA: Note that AgileBits intentionally hides the standalone license option and pushes subscription as the only visible scheme to get the application. This is a long standing dark pattern, and though the support staff will admit on their forums or here that the standalone license does exist, you wouldn&#39;t be able to find it without some special incantations on the forums. They will keep reiterating that it&#39;s for your own good so that you don&#39;t get confused.The application UX may be great. The sync may be great. The security of the closed source application may be great (because of audits). But this single dark pattern and the condescending attitude of their team members whenever the topic of standalone license comes up are enough to avoid this company. If you can get to the standalone license purchase option within three or four clicks from the main site, do let me know.I switched out of 1Password to Bitwarden long ago. I will admit that Bitwarden is not fantastic (I find it somewhat slow and also lacking some features). But it doesn&#39;t use dark patterns like AgileBits does."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting:&gt; 1Password for Linux also debuts with several features that are coming soon to 1Password for Mac, Windows, iOS, and AndroidThat should be encouraging for Linux users. It suggests that the Linux version is not just a port that will forever at best follow the other platforms. It can get pretty annoying when you have something that is available on multiple platforms, and your platform tends to always lag the others."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A good friend of mine at Google is the technical lead of this project (he has a Phd Princeton, and was a professor before joining Google).I&#39;ve tried it in person and it was truly amazing.  They used some very fancy tech when I saw the demo, so I&#39;m thrilled it is finally being announced and possibly shared with a larger audience.Explanation of why it is amazing:  It totally fools your perception. No glasses or goggles--but rather an 8k display with special glass that allows your different eyes to see different pixels (a light field).They also optimize the sound, and the rest, so as all the testimonials point out, you actually feel like the person is in front of you.It also works for the &#34;cube&#34; around them, so if they hold up some object, it also feels like that is in front of you.Amazing..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"On a related note, I wanted to share my amazing experience with a similar but lo-fi tech.My mom and dad for the past 2-3 years have mostly lived in two separate countries (due to work reasons) and I could tell they miss each other quite a bit.I got both of them an Echo Show 10&#34; device each and set it up for them. I don&#39;t think I can explain how our lives have changed for the better, just based on this simple piece of tech.The Echo Show is now pretty much constantly on video call for 14-16 hours a day in the living room of both houses and it has become an extension of the one another; a window into the other house. The audio and mics are good enough that at times you genuinely forget the other person is not in the same room. This has truly helped them, especially during Covid times.It&#39;s actually good enough that my parents have their morning tea together practically almost the same way they used to when they were physically together. They&#39;ve told me multiple times &#34;I don&#39;t know how we could&#39;ve lived without this Alexa thing&#34;.If Google can eventually get the prices down to reasonable levels, I really think people would be shocked at how fast this thing becomes part of our daily lives."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is cool as hell, but I have to say I feel like we&#39;re solving top-level problems when most consumers don&#39;t even seem to be getting solutions to the most basic pain-points.For me, the problem with video-calling isn&#39;t the image-quality.  It&#39;s all the much more mundane technological problems - high latency, lag-spikes caused by bad ISPs, failed noise-cancellation for people who don&#39;t use headsets for audio, bad wifi routers cutting out, etc.First thing I did when I realized we were going to be WFH long-term was buy myself a $100 gaming headset.  Next thing I did was get all my home computer stations wired with Cat 6.That stuff is far more fundamental and far less interesting than 3D telepresence, but it&#39;s the real unsexy problem that so many people are suffering through this pandemic.Even simple things like latency make simple, natural reactions agonizing.  Talkcover and crosstalk is incessent and I&#39;ve developed a filthy habit of just talking over people because otherwise it&#39;s a solid 20 seconds of &#34;you go no you go&#34; caused by awful latency.  I&#39;ve had to defuse angry reactions by co-workers who feel they&#39;re being interrupted by other co-workers and explain to them that the latency makes interruptions feel worse than they are.I&#39;ve tried to push friends to join me on my private Mumble server where the latency is near-nil and the call-quality is excellent, but there&#39;s always one person who doesn&#39;t have a working headset and wants to just use a laptop or tablet mic with no feedback-cancelling that destroys the conversation through echos (plus Mumble&#39;s auth system is needlessly bewildering).Then with video, problems are similar but less impactful - cheap cameras, poor lighting, compression artifacts, poor sync with the audio, etc.  And it&#39;s infuriating because every person has a wonderfully powerful camera in their pocket right now - and there&#39;s software to connect them but it&#39;s just too tricky for most people.Good on Google for taking an interest in the subject, but I feel like they&#39;re decorating the apex of the technological pyramid while most people are pushing stones around at the bottom."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great point on embedded dependencies - In theory they can be a time saver, but in Rust land, they&#39;re often too.. abstract, and full of missing features and bugs. Easier to open the datasheets, and send a few bytes down the SPI/I2C etc lines. I haven&#39;t been able to use any deps without forking. In Rust, popular abstractions tend to get in the way too, ie if a rust peripheral struct is trying to own a shared bus.Another good point, re HALs. She skipped the official HAL after finding it to be too much trouble. I&#39;ve found that a good peripheral access library generated from SVD files is all you need, and is easier to work with than a HAL that&#39;s not carefully made. Ie an API that provides named register blocks, registers, and fields, and knows how many bits go in each, which you can read from etc. (Is this what the CMSIS lib she mentioned is?)Related to the last point: &#34;I write very small, usually project-specific, abstractions over that&#34; - If you decide a popular or official HAL isn&#39;t helping you, you end up writing your own HAL!&gt; I&#39;ve chosen to avoid using the Node.js ecosystem in favor of just plain JavaScriptAlso a choice I agree with."</p>

We hear a tone of people doing it in the SaaS work, but not so much in hardware - if anybody here knows other similar examples, I&#39;d love to hear about it!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article talks about Core Web Vitals in passing. That&#39;s the major change here. Two posts from May 2020 talk about them more- https://blog.chromium.org/2020/05/introducing-web-vitals-ess... introduces these metrics, what they mean and how to measure them.- https://developers.google.com/search/blog/2020/05/evaluating... talks about how the search engine experience will change&gt; The change for non-AMP content to become eligible to appear in the mobile Top Stories feature in Search will also roll out in May 2021. Any page that meets the Google News content policies will be eligible and we will prioritize pages with great page experience, whether implemented using AMP or any other web technology, as we rank the results.&gt; In addition to the timing updates described above, we plan to test a visual indicator that highlights pages in search results that have great page experience.Seems like a positive change. It will mean extra work as developers improve the performance of their sites. But having clear metrics to improve will make that work tractable. Also, advocating for that work to senior management will be easier when it&#39;s so clearly tied to SEO.The upshot is that ordinary users will experience a more performant web. Not overnight but over a few years, like the shift to HTTPS and supporting mobile web versions. Both of those changes were driven in part by the desire for better ranking on Google."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This won&#39;t really do anything for availability or reducing scalper pricing. Miners are a sizeable proportion of sales but far from the majority. Gamers will be able to buy more of these GPUs but less of the non-LHR or AMD GPU&#39;s. GPU prices won&#39;t actually change.The real reason Nvidia is doing this is that when mining profitability inevitably drops, either because of a crypto price crash or Ethereum moving to Proof of Stake, the miners will flood the used market and ruin Nvidia&#39;s profits for a few quarters. Nvidia is trying to get miners to buy mining-only cards, because those can&#39;t be sold to gamers down the line. They&#39;d rather mining cards become e-waste in a few years than get resold.People think Nvidia is doing this to try to help them get better prices now, but really Nvidia is trying to extract more money from gamers in the long term."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Does this behavior anger anyone else on a deep level? I get that its hard to buy GPUs right now, but this seems like such an attack on general purpose computing.Hardware manufactures already segment features between consumer and busness grade parts that the silicon itself is capable of, such as virtualization, but restricting what algorithms one can run is a whole new level.I am pretty sure my next GPU is going to be AMD due to this behavior by Nvidia."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When OpenAI trained their Dota model to beat people 1v1 mid SF, they had a contest at The International (the big yearly dota tournament, RIP) like &#34;can you beat OpenAI&#39;s new bot?&#34; and had a big bucket of prizes for anyone that could.By the end of the night, the bucket was empty. People learned to cheese the bot by running &#34;out of bounds&#34;, so to speak -- normally in a 1v1, you&#39;re supposed to stay close to your opponent, since they&#39;ll be getting stronger if you leave. But the bot didn&#39;t know how to deal with it when you snuck behind it (normally an insane maneuver, almost guaranteed to cost you the game in normal play) and prevented his army (called &#34;creeps&#34;) from running to the middle lane. (All you have to do is go wave your hand at them, and they mindlessly chase you.)People did that over and over, and your own army would eventually overwhelm the bot and win. :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"An astonishing insert:&gt;A good example of human exploitation of the engine&#39;s failings is GM Hikaru Nakamura&#39;s defeat of Rybka in the following three-minute blitz game from the Internet Chess Club. Nakamura cleverly locks the position so that progress is impossible for Rybka, then he offers two exchange sacrifices to the engine. With the position locked, the engine&#39;s rooks have no value, but the engine thinks it has a winning material advantage. With a draw by the 50-move rule approaching, the engine sacrifices a pawn to avoid a draw, but this proves a huge mistake as Nakamura is then able to win the game, an incredible achievement!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When watching the WC games, I&#39;ve seen it happen that a move wasn&#39;t considered as a top move by the engine, but once played the engine realizes it&#39;s actually crushing. Something about the heuristics used to prune the vast search space can make it miss sacrifices or seemingly sub-optimal moves that temporarily weakens the perceived position but has a huge payoff in the end. But humans find them. Of course, given enough time and depth the engine will eventually circle back and try the move. But it has no intuition.Also, an engine without an endgame tablebase can be pretty stupid. There are certain rules one can deduct when there are few pieces left, but a min/max engine will search forever, not knowing the patterns."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked with a number of brilliant people at Bell Labs through the 1980s/1990s. The most comfortably competent among them, the most productive among them, were also the least abrasive. They were also the most self deprecating.Not just one or two, but the majority of them. To the point that the aggressive geniuses stood out. And I worked for/with two abrasive ones as well, so I know the difference.The same was true for the two startups I worked at after that, and Qualcomm, and now the third startup where I work.The really productive geniuses in each situation were easy to work with, I think largely, because of their confidence in their own grasp of the subject at hand. They had nothing to prove, they knew that, and it showed. The difficult people were never stupid, far from it, but they felt like they needed to defend everything they did, every decision they made, and that made working with them less productive.With the gentle geniuses, if you thought you came up with something that was an improvement on what was being done, they would look at it honestly, and if it was not better, they would calmly explain why, and if it was better, they would acknowledge it right out and discuss how to merge that into the current work.The &#39;less gentle&#39; ones would take pride in pointing out the flaws in your idea if you were wrong, and if you were right, would fight you over whether it had any real value at all, then would stiff arm you as far as getting it accepted as a change."</p>

Sure. But the folks who truly stand out in my mind are a level higher. They&#39;re the ones at the top of their game, who know how to demand &amp; command excellence, without being jerks about it.I&#39;m reminded of this episode of &#34;The Chef Show&#34; where Jon Favreau compliments Roy Choi behind his back. He tells Bill Burr that he had followed Roy around for a full day, going to all his restaurants and food trucks, and not once did Roy raise his voice to his staff. It&#39;s pretty cool to see how much admiration one artist/leader has for the other, not because of their technical skills but because they choose to be kind.I don&#39;t think we need to settle for being &#34;fierce nerds&#34;."</p>

People like him contribute more than other people, it&#39;s alright to to be fierce, can&#39;t speak the &#34;truth,&#34; etc.Whenever there is dichotomous thinking, cognition has moved away from clarity. If it were me, I&#39;d be asking myself, What is being defended? (This kind of question can be a multi-decade inquiry.)Although most of us are easily baited into self-justification or self-promotion, I think going down that path it is ultimately a distraction from doing real work and knowing who you are."</p>

Then, the first time I found myself needing to kill Chrome because it was completely locked up, I found myself staring at a wall of chrome processes in the task list, not knowing which one I needed to kill. At the time, I thought the idea of a separate process for each tab was silly. Though, with Firefox moving towards this model, I guess the engineers at Google were prescient in the correctness of that tradeoff.I do use a lot of tabs, so I fear I&#39;m going to find myself facing the same problem I faced with Chrome: a site misbehaves and locks things up, crap, which process do I kill? A way of tracking which tab maps to which process would be nice, so the next time I trip over a badly-coded page, I don&#39;t have to kill everything just to get my browser to respond again. Lazyweb question to y&#39;all: is there a feature in Chrome or Firefox that can do this (mapping tab/page -&gt; process), or have I just stumbled upon a side-project idea?"</p>
