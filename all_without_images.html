I like for one drawer to be &#34;workout clothes&#34; and have the mix of gym shorts and t-shirts. To me this feels &#34;obviously&#34; right because the use-case requires both items so why pay for two costly &#34;open drawer&#34; IOs?Similarly, she is very organized with her paper files, I just throw mine into a box. In the rare event I need something (eg when doing taxes) I don&#39;t mind scanning through the whole mess.

Any driver installation will absolutely make this a no-go for family members.- Is additional software required for anything non-techies might reasonably want to do with this device, including resetting it, adding an entry or checking which entries are already on the device? The ideal would probably be if the device acts like a USB stick, with entries being shown as .bin/.txt files which can be manipulated in the normal ways.- How easy is it to create a backup? The ideal (for non-techies) would probably be something like plugging a device into a PC and simply copying files across.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Given the rather enormous of time and attention spent on it, not to mention the vast amounts of heated debate it had already spawned, I&#39;d sort of assumed the NYT would either publish a really, really solid article or (more likely) just spike it and try and forget the entire thing had ever happened. After all, given that the NYT was now so much a part of the story, writing anything good would be pretty hard.But no, kudos to them, they found a third way: Just write a poorly written article that alternates between interjecting disconnected ideas and making vague attempts at guilt by association, and carefully ignore anything inconvenient.&gt; He denounced the neoreactionaries, the anti-democratic, often racist movement popularized by Curtis Yarvin. But he also gave them a platform. His “blog roll” — the blogs he endorsed — included the work of Nick Land, a British philosopher whose writings on race, genetics and intelligence have been embraced by white nationalists.So he denounced the works of one person who believes bad things, but he also linked to a second person, who may or may not believe bad things, but is liked by a third group of people who also believe bad things, so...logically...that must mean he actually does...support the first person? Despite denouncing them, because he didn&#39;t link to them, which proves...something...?It feels weird even writing this argument down. If you link to someone who supports X, then you&#39;re actually supporting every other person who has ever supported X? Link to a pro-vegan website, you must support every terrible ideology that has had at least one vegetarian supporter?What a depressing waste of everyone&#39;s time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Such a badly-written, mean-spirited article.

Such as :&gt; In one post, he aligned himself with Charles Murray, who proposed a link between race and I.Q. in “The Bell Curve.” In another, he pointed out that Mr. Murray believes Black people “are genetically less intelligent than white people.”And when you read the linked page[0], what Scott writes concerning Murrary seems perfectly inoffensive. He divides political views into quadrants, Competitive/Collective vs Optimistic/Pessimistic, then says &#34;The only public figure I can think of in the [Collective + Pessimistic quadrant] with me is Charles Murray.&#34; This is what is described as aligning himself with Murray. The paragraph makes Scott sound like a flaming racist. It&#39;s just totally dishonest writing. It&#39;s hard to believe they&#39;re arguing in good faith there, but who knows.The anonymity thing seems to have been well and truly discarded – flung in his face, more like. What did he do to them to deserve such treatment, such contempt?I did get one laugh, out of:&gt; “[Rationalists] are basically just hippies who talk a lot more about Bayes’ theorem than the original hippies,” said Scott Aaronson[0] https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/05/23/three-great-articles-o..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Some types in Rust have specific limitations on what is considered a valid value, which may not cover the entire range of possible memory values. We call any remaining invalid value a niche, and this space may be used for type layout optimizations. For example, in Rust 1.28 we introduced NonZero integer types (like NonZeroU8) where 0 is a niche, and this allowed Option&lt;NonZero&gt; to use 0 to represent None with no extra memory.I didn&#39;t know about this, and it&#39;s super cool.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t know whether SARS-CoV-2 escaped from a lab. But if it did, then not only is it probably not the first lab-origin pandemic, but it&#39;s also not the first time the WHO initially excluded that possibility.The 1977 Russian Flu pandemic was genetically near-identical to a strain from 1950, without the expected mutations that should have appeared after 27 years of undetected circulation among humans or animals. It&#39;s been widely suspected in mainstream literature to have escaped from a research or vaccine manufacturing accident, to the point that the NEJM casually wrote:&gt; The reemergence was probably an accidental release from a laboratory source in the setting of waning population immunity to H1 and N1 antigenshttps://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra0904322But at the time, the WHO said:&gt; Laboratory contamination can be excluded because the laboratories concerned either had never kept H1N1 virus or had not worked with it for a long time.https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2395678/pdf/bul...And it&#39;s absolutely bizarre to me that people are asking why the origin even matters. After thousands of people died in Bhopal, did it matter whether better chemical safety standards could have prevented that? So with millions dead now, how could you possibly not wonder whether our current standards for the sampling and manipulation of poorly-understood pandemic-candidate viruses are adequate?"</p>

The best results was selling &#34;booths&#34; at the conference.  But that had more cost to the sponsor than just the cash we asked for.I have been mulling on Something that makes it less charity - purchasing a &#34;not really support&#34; option.  This might be a annual membership, in return for which you get ... early access to annual roadmap pdf.  Or an online video from the main devs explaining what they are doing for five minutes (#)What if there existed something to Make the above easy and simply to do - a small foundation who&#39;s job is to keep membership rolls and accept payments from companies on behalf of any foss project that signs up (it&#39;s something I imagine patreon could offer). They then ensure that the (minimal contract) is adhered to in some manner.(#) Seriously - you could set up a zoom call with 1-5 devs and just hit record once a year - I promise that 99% will see this as unbearable imposition and then talk for two hours.  And that&#39;s &#34;actionable paid insights into the future of this tool we depend on&#34;So the point being, if your FOSS project gets traction, then sign up to this foss-patreon, tell everyone to click to subscribe and you might might get a sponsor or two."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot of people here are accusing Google of embrace, extend, and extinguish, but you have to realize that the incentives here are different from Big Tech&#39;s point of view. I&#39;d first like to point out Python is a programming language, not an internet standard or file format. It gets its utility merely from the ability to develop in it, even without an established ecosystem or network effect. The barrier to jump in, or fork off and start over is far lower compared to a browser or file format.So what&#39;s in it for Big Tech? Well, in a situation where controlling the technology or suppressing it is difficult due to the low costs of starting over, it is in their best interest to promote the ecosystem rather than control it. When they put in the time, money, and engineers to make it better the return on investment can be massive, because of the help they get from the community to grow, maintain, and keep compatible this core component at less cost than if they did it themselves.The incentives align and benefit everyone, especially if there is a fair governance system mediating between all parties involved. The biggest threat to an open source project is therefore not Big Tech collaboration, but project abandonment and lack of maintenance. I hope this makes everyone a little more optimistic about the direction of open source, especially as companies realize the real value it can have for all involved."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The argument of specialist vs generalist is futile. They simple fit in distinct parts of the journey and evolution of a software product.Generalists are highly valuable for many types of orgs and projects especially nascent projects. But sometimes you need the precise output of a specialist to achieve something.If my business has a product that is highly dependent of let&#39;s say OpenGL, then an OpenGL specialist will generate more specific output that someone who knows a little of OpenGL and a lot of other things.However, there&#39;s always the counterargument that generalists can compensate with their holistic view and understanding of problems throughout the whole stack. I understand this and agree with it, but I think there&#39;s a point in every innovation where the generalist contribution declines sharply. And I&#39;m saying this as a generalist.If you are a generalist and you feel undervalued, you&#39;re likely in the wrong project or too involved in phases of a project where your contribution can&#39;t move the needle significantly anymore."</p>

Broadly put, PM&#39;s are good at figuring out the theta, and Engineers are good at the r.I think that with the perspectives that short fat engineers have, they can play enormous roles as &#34;PM&#34; or &#34;Engineering Manager&#34;, and definitely as ICs during early stages of startups. But they clearly don&#39;t enjoy depth, and this can be counter-productive for that 1% of the time where you really, really want depth.I don&#39;t buy the knowledge vs wisdom thing though, there&#39;s plenty of wisdom to be gained from going deep into a subject.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Early in my career, I worked for a tiny company that exclusively built plug-ins for a specific SAAS platform. I noticed there was a public-facing page where one could search for any customer of this SAAS platform, so I built a scraper that would auto-search names, main URLs, and ticker symbols for every company on the S&amp;P 500 into this search.I demoed it with 5 companies to a member of the sales team, and he politely asked me to remove the script from the company laptop, and seemed to be annoyed at my script kiddie antics. He said it was nearly impossible to build a lead out of that kind of information, and that any shop that would try and use that kind of poisoned fruit would quickly tarnish their reputation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Chick Corea was a god.I learned Spain on the bass in the hopes that one day I could play my meager rendition for him. In a concert at SFJazz he picked people out of the audience to paint their portraits with his piano. How lucky was I to be placed upon such a seat where Chick dismembered me with his eyes, eviscerating my soul upon a platter. He stared at me with the eyes of a musician who had searched heaven and hell for the most tempestuous chordal mixtures. The two minutes I spent in that seat where he painted my portrait with his keystrokes are some of the most treasured moments of my life. I felt like I had been seen, chewed up, devoured, and reincarnated as the everloving Chick Corea sycophant I had always known myself to be.The man was a goddamn monster on the boards and we are all at a loss with his passing. Rest in Power Chick, you&#39;re in my heart forever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The night I turned 18 I was drinking with Chick Corea.
It happened that in 1995 he had a classical music project involving some local orchestra musicians in Modena, Italy, where I was living at the time. One of the musicians was a friend of mine&#39;s brother who invited me to the dress rehearsal in a renaissance villa. Concert was good.After the concert, I got introduced to him and he asked me if I liked it. Shortly after I was drinking with him and others, and I turned 18 right there.:)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a huge fan of Chick Corea; he is my favorite jazz pianist.  I was saddened to hear this news this afternoon.  My very first jazz album outside of smooth jazz was “My Spanish Heart,” which was my introduction to jazz fusion.  I then discovered Return to Forever and the Elektric Band, and I also learned about Chick Corea’s post-bop work.  Chick Corea’s music has been a mainstay in my life for the past 15 years.  I love the playfulness of his piano playing and his compositions, which I feel is missing in a lot of music.  He has helped inspire me to play: I received an electronic wind instrument (EWI) for Christmas that I’ve been practicing.The jazz community lost a legend.  RIP Chick Corea."</p>

During this ongoing process, my father, who’d been receiving chemotherapy treatments passed away.Being the “technical one” it fell to me to manage his various accounts. I logged into his gmail from the same browser I’d used LinkedIn, and started to contact people he knew but was out of touch with.The next day, I started receiving email, from my dead father, from LinkedIn. Claiming he’d just joined the service and wanted to connect to me.I still don’t have the words for this, years later.What exactly is wrong with these folks at LinkedIn? They seem like caricatures of actual humans to me now, and I no longer even bother to visit the site.If anything positive comes from cancel-culture, canceling LinkedIn would be my preference."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s a shame. I had high hopes at the beginning that S4TF - and the investment in Swift from Google - would help Swift break out of the iOS ghetto and cement it as a mainstream language.Swift&#39;s a delightful language to use.  It has a lot of the nice things about Rust&#39;s type system, but is a heck of a lot easier to use at the expense of a bit of performance.  For a lot of use cases, I think this is a great value proposition.  ML/data science is a great example where practitioners could benefit from a more grown-up type system than what Python has on offer, but would still be able to keep low level details at arms length.I think Serverless would be another ideal use-case for Swift, where the productivity, clarity and correctness tools it offers would be a huge benefit.Some very interesting things came out of the S4TF project - like the work on autodiff, and python interop.  It&#39;s a shame the project never really seemed to get legs, it seems like it just languished for years with no clear direction.These days I do most of my work in Rust, and I&#39;m happy to do so because the tooling, community, and ecosystem is really amazing.  But there are a lot of language concepts and features I miss from swift.  I guess it goes to show that the governance and availability of a language have a lot more to do with adoption than the merits of the language itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Back when I was doing a lot of Swift programming, this seemed like such a great idea. Since then I moved on to Julia. And when I looked at the ML code for Swift and compared it to Julia, I was thinking &#34;How on earth could anyone think this was ever a good idea?&#34;Doing machine learning stuff in Julia is simply much more user friendly than doing the same in Swift. Swift is nice for iOS development, but I think in data science and Machine Learning Julia will always be a much better choice.It is a pity Google did not go for Julia. Julia has gotten exceptionally far despite limited resources. With Google style resources, Julia could have been massive.Despite modest investment, the Julia JIT beats almost anything out there. It would have been amazing to see what they could have pulled off if they had put the kind of resources that was put into the JavaScript V8 JIT into the Julia JIT.Julia uses a method JIT, which are quick to implement, but which makes latency gets bad. Meaning if you load a whole new package, running the first function can cause some delay. With a JavaScript style tracer JIT added into the mix one could have probably managed to have both high performance and low latency.Alternatively with more investment they could have had better precompile caching, meaning libraries that had been loaded in the past would JIT really fast. Julia does that today, but it could have worked a lot better than it currently does. It isn&#39;t that it can&#39;t be done, but it just requires resources."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"S4TF lost out, not to Python, but to Python&#39;s AI/ML ecosystem -- people, projects, libraries, frameworks.Despite its many shortcomings, Python has become the lingua franca of AI and ML, to the point that whenever I come across a newly published AI or ML paper that I find interesting, I expect to be able to find code implementing it in Python.For example, yesterday I saw a post on HN about approximating self-attention matrices in transformers, which have O(n²) computational cost, with a seemingly clever approach that has O(n) computational cost: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26105455 . &#34;Huh, that looks interesting,&#34; I thought, &#34;let me see if I can find some code.&#34; Three clicks later, I found myself at https://github.com/mlpen/Nystromformer -- the official implementation... in Python. A few moments later, I was playing with this thingamajiggy. No other language comes close to having this kind of ecosystem in AI and ML.Julia still has a shot at becoming a viable alternative to Python, especially if the Julia developers can shorten the &#34;time to first interactive plot&#34; to make it as fast as Python&#39;s, but they face an uphill battle against such an entrenched ecosystem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These stories usually spur more enthusiasm for buying cryptocurrency, but ironically those buyers aren’t interested in spending cryptocurrency using their MasterCard.They’re hoping other people will buy cryptocurrency from these announcements, driving the price up. Or, more likely, they’re just hoping other people will buy cryptocurrency and not use it in these spending systems.Spending cryptocurrency would result in selling that cryptocurrency, which would drive the price down. That’s not what cryptocurrency investors actually want.Should also note that MasterCard crypto transactions almost certainly won’t be settled on the blockchain. Not with $8 Bitcoin transaction fees.  They’ll just be denominated in cryptocurrency and people can deposit/withdraw in certain cryptocurrencies. MasterCard only needs to buy and sell on the blockchain as needed to provide an FX window. The actual transactions would be stored in traditional database systems (aside from customer deposits/withdrawals, just like Coinbase)Why? Because MasterCard would get to act as an exchange and collect exchange fees. Exchange fees are a great way to charge consumers for spending their own money in 2021, when normal credit cards actually pay people 1-2% to use them. Cryptocurrency’s inefficiency is their financial upside."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The game Paypal currently plays with Crypto is the closest thing to printing money I have ever seen:Their users can &#34;buy and sell Bitcoin&#34; and pay &#34;no fees&#34;. How does Paypal make money? &#34;From the spread&#34;. The difference between bid and ask. And who sets the spread? Drumroll ... Paypal!Since you cannot transfer your bitcoins out, when you sell your bitcoins, Paypal pays you whatever they like.So far, Paypal only offers this in the United States. And do the Americans take this offer? Yes! They buy over a billion dollars worth of Bitcoin per month on Paypal. If this continues, it means that every American from toddler to senior buys $50 worth of Bitcoin per year.Other companies in the finance industry will want the same free lunch. Run on crypto in 3..2..1..This will continue until the first companies will start to offer you to transfer your crypto out. Then slowly the market will normalize. Now everyone has crypto. In their paypal/mastercard/bank/whatever account and/or in their own wallet.Looks like chances for broader crypto adoption are pretty good."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Correction: The Fed&#39;s policies have taken $50T of wealth from the Bottom 90%.When you bail out irresponsibly over-leveraged and nearly bankrupted banks and corporations, and pay for those bailouts with tax-payer money, you steal from the poor and give to the rich.Most importantly, when the Fed decides to print money ad nauseam, they create massive asset inflation, which steals from the poor and gives to the rich. This is because those dollars that are printed go directly into bonds, equities, and assets that only a small amount of the population owns a significant amount of. When money is &#34;printed&#34; the Fed actually injects money into financial markets through buying assets. This asset inflation caused by money printing gives more money to the rich to buy more assets, thus driving up the prices of financial products, real estate, and all other valued assets in society. Thus, cost of living skyrockets, but only the rich are actually increasing their net worth (which is increasing exponentially). All of this happens while minimum wage, and most wages, are stagnant.Wealth inequality and social unrest in America is DIRECTLY related to corrupt and/or incompetent (you choose) Fed policies. It amazes me why most people do not grasp this. I think it is lack of education."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;But poor people have iphones now&#34; when people can&#39;t afford food, healthcare, or any leisure time is the 2021 equivalent of &#34;Let them eat cake&#34;.The balance of wealth is insulting when we have so many basic needs not being met for those at the bottom&#34;Stealing&#34; is a word that gets knee jerk reactions. But the more polite way to phrase it is that the rich benefit from societal structure 1000x more than the poor and are able to acquire wealth at an accelerated pace because of these structures. Asking the wealthy to pay a greater share to improve society is perfectly reasonable. The fallacy in complaining against taxes for the rich that are already higher than their proportional of wealth is ignoring the fact that so much of taxes goes towards systems that just increase the rate of wealth accumulation. The wealthy reap the benefits of power in compounding ways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The framing in the article is ahistorical. The post-WW2 period was a period of exceptionally _low_ inequality. If you look back to just the 1800s there were swings in inequality comparable to the present day. We&#39;re now moving back to the historical baseline.There are some contributing factors to the shift in inequality, a major one being that labor is now oversupplied compared to the post-war period, and the competition is driving wages lower. The U.S. has much higher immigration rates now, which contributes to the oversupply of labor. The late 1800s and early 1900s had similarly high immigration and high inequality. [1]Whether the historical baseline for inequality is the best amount of inequality is a different question though. It&#39;s clear that as redistribution flattens the income curve there is dead-weight loss as highly productive people stop wasting their time doing taxable work. It&#39;s also clear that investing in children who would otherwise be malnourished or lack education or healthcare is a net positive for society. It&#39;s not clear to me that the current level of inequality is the wrong one - we&#39;re admitting a lot of immigrants who are vastly improving their life prospects as a result, the economy is growing, and technology is amazing. Spending more money on health care would have limited benefits [2]. I don&#39;t really have a strong opinion on whether inequality should be higher or lower (it&#39;s hard to find a good-faith analysis in these terms), but the Time article uses an arbitrary timeframe and doesn&#39;t shed any light on the question.[1] See Ages of Discord for a much more detailed dive into this. http://peterturchin.com/ages-of-discord/[2] Robin Hanson gives an argument with lots of evidence here: https://www.cato-unbound.org/2007/09/10/robin-hanson/cut-med..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I still cannot get over this product.  They whole selling point of a dyson fan is the &#39;air multiplier&#39; tech, which creates a low pressure zone that propels air through the ring.  According to dyson, this tech can move 15x more air than the fan in the base of the unit.  Why in the world would you build an air filter around a system that does not directly interact with 93% of the air it moves?https://www.jameco.com/Jameco/workshop/Howitworks/dysonairmu..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve spent many hours navigating the air purifier market and it is one of the most opaque and customer-unfriendly ones I have ever seen. Beyond the advice given in the article, it&#39;s also important to check what the filter exactly is. Some filters are washable, but it often means that they are not as thorough as HEPA filters, which is a big deal if your goal is to avoid the dreaded PM2.5 that are as far as I can tell the main threat to health and the pursuit of happiness.A more general problem is that there is a conceptual contradiction between low noise and high filtering. It will be difficult for a silent filter to be quick at filtering your room.The good news is that even a relatively crappy, low CADR setup can still filter a bedroom over time so long as it remains closed. You will however be paying for replacements more often and it might not be worth it if you have to ventilate daily and the filter takes many hours to give you a clean environment.I like the work that Smart Air China is doing. I am not affiliated with them, but they have essentially done and made available the same sort of research as the one highlighted in the article and have long promoted the no bullshit use of a simple box fan with filter combo for lower income and highly polluted regions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I bought an expensive Dyson air purifier for a couple of reasons. It has a remote so I can turn it on from bed. It looks attractive. The sound profile is much different than a box fan for sleeping at night. It can analyze the temperature, humidity, and air quality in real time and turn on if it notices air quality is getting bad. It also oscillates.That said yes it was expensive, but it replaced needing a fan for cooling and an air purifier, and if I needed a heater it could have done triple duty."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Personally I&#39;ve been really happy with my split 60% keyboard from UltimateHackingKeyboard [0]. It also has open source electronics files and firmwareI backed them on CrowdSupply some years ago and although it took a while to be delivered have used it extensively since and even purchased a second one for at home &amp; the office. A huge positive while waiting for it was the regular, informative status emails from the founder.Now they are on to v2 [1] with backlighting and better keycaps.The &#34;Agent&#34; firmware is also regularly updated and makes customising the keyboard a breeze. I won&#39;t go extensively into the functionality here but it&#39;s worth checking out.I am in no-way affiliated with UHK but if anybody is looking for a split, open source, customisable keyboard I would highly recommend.[0] https://uhk.io/[1] https://ultimatehackingkeyboard.com/blog/2020/11/05/introduc..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Over twenty years I&#39;ve spent too much money trying to get a keyboard that really worked for me... and I finally gave up and I now use the cheapest disposable crap from hole-in-the-wall electrical / electronics shop that I can walk to.Nearly all the DIY keyboards I&#39;ve seen are ruthlessly minimalistic and I really would prefer a larger keyboard with more keys, so I don&#39;t have to remember lots of meta-key combination short-cuts.  I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve memorised all the keyboard short cuts in a given piece of software in a decade... I just don&#39;t really use one particular thing enough to make it worthwhile.That keyboard with the active LED keycaps came out in what... 2006?  I expected a regular keyboard with small set of active keycaps for macro keys would have existed by now. Come to think of it, I never used an Apple laptop with that active TouchBar thing either but that doesn&#39;t seem to have achieved enduring popularity.  but I guess there&#39;s no real market for that either."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice. Using it for pavers makes sense, too. It will have some elasticity, which is fine for pavers but bad for structures.There are a few variants on this idea already. One is just to compress trash plastics into blocks, with no sand.[1] Another is a process more like brick making, where the material is melted.[2] That process is 20% recycled plastic, 80% sand etc.There are problems. UV deterioration. Cracking at low temperatures (probably not a problem in Kenya). Flammability. Poor adhesion to mortar. In the end, it&#39;s still polyethylene.[1] https://www.byfusion.com/[2] https://www.irjet.net/archives/V6/i4/IRJET-V6I4238.pdf"</p>

Since the bricks contain plastic they are prone to flaking and the formation of microplastic particles, which can last for thousands of years and get into the digestive systems of animals and humans. Also, the plastic might crack from constant UV radiation under the Kenyan sun. Could somebody explain what the rationale might be for putting 1000 plastic bricks/day into the environment or if there&#39;s something I&#39;m missing?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Regarding SQLite&#39;s performance, some things I&#39;ve found very useful:Use WAL mode (writers don&#39;t block readers):  PRAGMA journal_mode = &#39;WAL&#39;

Use memory as temporary storage:  PRAGMA temp_store = 2

Faster synchronization that still keeps the data safe:  PRAGMA synchronous = 1

Increase cache size (in this case to 64MB), the default is 2MB  PRAGMA cache_size = -64000

Lastly, use a modern version of SQLite. Many default installations come with versions from a few years ago. In Python for example, you can use pysqlite3[0] to get the latest SQLite without worrying about compiling it (and it also comes with excellent compilation defaults).[0] https://github.com/coleifer/pysqlite3"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “But nobody writes production applications with SQLite, right?&#34;We&#39;ve been doing it for 5 years now. Basic tricks we employ are:Use PRAGMA user_version for purposes of managing automatic migrations, a. la. Entity Framework. This means you can actually do one better than Microsoft&#39;s approach, because you don&#39;t need a special unicorn table to store migration info. A simple integer compared with your latest integer and executing SQL in the range is all it takes.Use PRAGMA synchronous=NORMAL alongside PRAGMA journal_mode=WAL for maximum throughput while supporting most reasonable IT recovery concerns. If you are running your SQLite application on a VM somewhere and have RTO which is satisfied by periodic hot snapshots (which WAL is quite friendly to), this is a more than ideal way to manage recovery of all business data while also giving good throughput to writers. If you are more paranoid than we are, then you can do FULL synchronous for a moderate performance penalty. This would be more for situations where your RTO requires the exact state of the system be recoverable the moment it lost power. We can afford to lose the last few minutes of work without anyone getting yelled at. Some modern virtualization technologies do help a lot in this regard. Running bare metal you need to be a little more careful.For development &amp; troubleshooting, being able to copy a .db file (even while its in use) is tremendously powerful. I can easily patch up a QA database I mangled with a bad migrator in 5 minutes by stopping the service, pulling the .db local, editing, and pushing it back up. We can also ask our customers to zip up their entire db folder so we can troubleshoot the entire system state.Being able to use SQLite as our exclusive data store also meant that our software delivery process could be trivialized. We use zero external hosts, even localhost, for our application to be installed or started. We don&#39;t even require a runtime exist on the base operating system. Unzip our latest release build to a blank Win2019 server, sc.exe the binary path, net start the service, and it just works. Anyone can deploy our software because it&#39;s literally that simple. We didn&#39;t even bother to write a script because its a bigger pain in the ass to set powershell execution mode.So, its not just about the core data storage, but also about the higher-order implications of choosing to use a database solution that can be wholly embedded within your application. Because of decisions like these, we don&#39;t have to screw around with things like Docker or Kubernetes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Solutions such as Kubernetes tout the benefits of zero-downtime deployments but ignore that their inherent complexity causes availability issues.&#34;This is completely accurate. I&#39;ve seen several teams do kubernetes, only to both spend 50% of their dev time on ops, AND cause outages due to kubernetes complexity. They do this all while boasting about zero downtime deployments. It&#39;s comical really."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I don&#39;t have any specific knowledge of this event but I did work for a smart cities company for a while and can explain some of what hypothetically leads to messes like this.Most municipal infrastructure automation is run by SCADA systems. SCADA systems are designed to be closed ecosystems by default, which means they don&#39;t have access to the internet. Cables are run and point to point connections are made to transport these signals. If you&#39;ve seen a big shiny aluminum box on the side of the road, that&#39;s a SCADA system.Consumer demand has changed a lot since SCADA was first thought up. These days people want to be able to log into a portal and see their billed water usage by the day. Cities want to be able to turn off a meter remotely at the click of a button rather than rolling a truck. They want pressure loss, contaminate, and fault detection. They&#39;d like to balance pressure in the water system dynamically. They want to perform detailed reports on total water loss, which means instrumenting pumps, retrieving telemetry data, auditing that data against every home usage, identifying faults, and producing a report out of it. All of these things don&#39;t work very well with closed ecosystems as they generally require a certain amount of external information. In response, cities have either crafted their own devices because they don&#39;t have the money to hire an integrator to design and produce them a device that will survive extreme weather conditions, be fault tolerant, make minimal use of power, and employ standard security measures or they hire an integrator. Even certain integrators can do shotty work.The takeaway from this isn&#39;t that SCADA is bad or the infrastructure version of &#34;the sky is falling!&#34;. It&#39;s that we desperately need to be thinking about how different generations of systems can be modularized and be built upon to minimize cost while maximizing security, capability growth, and reliability.For the folks talking about &#34;who tests what&#34;, I don&#39;t know what I can talk about in regards to specific programs but I feel confident that I can say that the FBI tracks this vigorously and works with companies that work in public infrastructure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My wife is a sewer commissioner for a tiny sewer district up in the mountains. It is a state of the art facility from a water treatment perspective since the treated water exits into a mountain stream. However, they recently needed to update their control systems because they all currently run on Windows98 and can no longer get spare parts from their vendors etc..At her request I sat in on a meeting with their vendor to ask some stupid questions (but less stupid than what the commissioners would have asked) about their proposal for updating the control systems.Some crazy things discovered:* it&#39;s all windows, all the time. I don&#39;t know why but I find this disturbing, but apparently all the drivers for these systems only work on windows. I guess Linux is only just starting to penetrate this market.* yes, remote access is a thing (even in the old system), especially in this case where the plant it under 20 feet of snow half the year. They claim the system can only monitor things, not control things, but I wonder how locked down that really is. Security is via a VPN.* the vendor at play here seems to be a tiny shop of a few people that basically serve a few dozen sewer treatment plants in the area. They deal with replacing the hardware and programming these interfaces in.. kind of a crazy local cottage industry I just wasn&#39;t really aware of.Having a background in web services / unix left me pretty unprepared to really do much more than ask some stupid questions around security / obsolescence, but the vendor had reasonable answers to my concerns. Just a very different world than what we think about every day."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is negligence on behalf of the water authority.10+ years ago I used to do demonstrations of this specific attack for govt and other critical infrastructure owners. 
In our demo, we had a two small vats of coloured &#34;chemicals,&#34; with pumps controlled by a bank of PLCs, an HMI and a network of a bunch of vulnerable VMs. We would walk people through how to exploit trivial web vulnerabilities that would get them to the HMI and cause the pumps to reverse and cause a chemical spill from the vats. The look on their faces when they caused a vat to overflow themselves with very little skill, was their &#34;scared-straight&#34; moment.It was 90&#39;s, even 80&#39;s level hacking. There is no way the managers didn&#39;t know this was possible and likely. They&#39;re only acting surprised. What this really looks like to me is a test run for something more coordinated and worse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great write up.  Think I&#39;ll get the kids, sorry technicians to walk through this.  Actually, I think I&#39;ll learn just as much but I have to keep a little bit aloof as MD!Networks are tricky to run and networking is proper hard to do.  TCP/UDP int al are pretty bloody good at shuffling data from A to B.  I find it quite amusing when 20 years is considered old for a bug.The Millenium bridge in London is a classic example of forgetting the basics - in this case resonance and being too clever for your own good.  It&#39;s a rather cool design for a bridge - a sort of a suspension bridge but flatter and some funky longitudinal stuff.  I&#39;m a Civ Eng grad.  It looked too flat to me from day one.When people walk across a bridge and it starts to sway, they start to lock step and then resonance, where each step reinforces the last kicks in and more and more energy causes sway, shear and what have you forces.  It gets worse and worse and then failure.  Tacoma Narrows is another classic example of resonance but due to wind - that informed designs that don&#39;t fly!Civ Eng is way, way older than IT and we are still learning.  24 years is nothing for a bug.  However, IT is capable of looking inward and monitoring itself (unit tests, ping etc) in a way that Civ Eng can&#39;t (OK we have strain gauges and a few other tools).The real difference between physical stuff and IT is that the Milli bridge rather obviously came close to failure visually and in a way that our other senses can perceive - it shook.  The fix was to put hydraulic dampers along its length.In IT, we often try to fix things by using magic or papering over flaws with &#34;just so&#34; stories.  Sometimes we get the tools out and do the job properly and these boys and girls did just that: the job properly."</p>

That seems silly! Surely we can do better than that?This article from Agoric is extremely relevant here, from a previous such incident (re: the event-stream package on npm): https://medium.com/agoric/pola-would-have-prevented-the-even...Put simply: in many cases, the dependencies you install don&#39;t need nearly as much authority as we give them right now. Maybe some of these packages need network access (I see a few named &#34;logger&#34; which might be shipping logs remotely) but do they need unrestricted filesystem access? Probably not! (They don&#39;t necessarily even need unrestricted network access either; what they&#39;re communicating with is likely pretty well-known.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This doesn&#39;t surprise me. Horrify.. yes.I&#39;ve noticed more dev teams succumbing to the temptation of easiness that many modern package managers provide (NPM, Cargo, Ivy, etc.) - especially as someone who has to work with offline systems on a regular basis.Because of that ease there are fewer tools and tutorials out there to support offline package management.  There are more for using caches, though these are often along the lines of either &#39;the package manager will do this for you and it just works (but in case it doesn&#39;t, delete node_modules or cargo clean and re-try)&#39;, or stand up a dependency server on your own machine with these proxy settings (which has it&#39;s own security issues and is frequently disallowed by IT cybersecurity policies).As an example, many blog articles I found a while back suggest using yumdownloader from the yum-utils package. This is unfortunately not reliable, as there are some packages that get skipped.I have found I need to script reading a list of dependencies from a file; then for each dependency: create a directory for it, use repotrack to download its RPM and it&#39;s transitive dependency RPMs in the dependency&#39;s directory; then the script aggregates all the RPMs into one directory, removes the OS installed RPMs, uses createrepo to turn that directory into a RPM repository, and then makes an USF ISO image out of the directory for transfer onto offline system and installation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nic Carter&#39;s rebuttal to a Bloomberg comparison between Bitcoin/Visa, including assessments of total and per/transaction energy usage:&#34;First of all, Bitcoin and Visa are fundamentally different systems. Bitcoin is a complete, self-contained monetary settlement system; Visa transactions are non-final credit transactions that rely on external underlying settlement rails. Visa relies on ACH, Fedwire, SWIFT, the global correspondent banking system, the Federal Reserve and, of course, the military and diplomatic strength of the U.S. government to ensure all of the above are working smoothly.Any energy comparison must take the above into account – including the externalities from the extraction of oil, which implicitly backs the dollar. As those who make this comparison inevitably fail to mention, the dollar’s ubiquity is partly due to a covert arrangement whereby the U.S. provides military support to countries like Saudi Arabia that agree to sell oil exclusively for dollars. It’s worth noting that the grossly oversized U.S. military, whose presence worldwide is necessary to backstop the international dollar system, is the largest single consumer of oil worldwide.&#34;https://www.coindesk.com/what-bloomberg-gets-wrong-about-bit..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"At that rate and assuming 4tx per second a single Bitcoin transaction consumes 165kWh. A Tesla battery is bit over 50kWh. So let&#39;s round that to 3 full charges of Tesla battery.That&#39;s 350km/220 miles of range per charge. In total 1050km or 660 miles of driving.So basically if you want to transfer money and the recipient is closer than 660 miles from you it&#39;s more efficient to just get a bunch of bills, drive there with a Tesla rather than send a Bitcoin transaction. Or alternatively 330 miles roundtrip. For each single transaction.It is hilariously inefficient system. It is literally better to drive a full car and give things physically than use Bitcoin.A small addenum: Visa apparently uses 146kWh for 100000 transactions. Coming at 1.46wH per transaction. That can drive a Tesla for 9 meters (0.4 seconds of driving at 80km/h) or alternatively keep a nice led lamp lit for an hour. And that includes everything the company does, not just the actual transaction but the upkeep of their offices etc divided by the amount of transactions they perform per year.EDIT:Apparently on 2020 it was 741kWh per transaction in practice and/or I made a tiny error in my calculation. Either way it&#39;s even better!https://www.statista.com/statistics/881541/bitcoin-energy-co...That simply increases the ranges so that it becomes a 3600 mile trip. Or 1800 mile roundtrip."</p>

Is it automated? I ask because every CS193p video starts with the same opening scene/music and the caption describing the music is different on every single one. Is this an auto-caption algorithm just getting it wrong? Or is there a person having fun behind the scenes waiting for someone like me to notice and spend an irrational amount of time wondering what happened? I feel like it has to be a person, right? YouTube&#39;s captioning wouldn&#39;t give 12 different results.Edit- For anyone curious, here&#39;s how the music is described in the captions at the beginning of each lecture:1. regal music2. mellow ambient music3. light music4. gentle music5. air whooshing6. gentle music (turns out there is one repeat)7. peaceful music8.

It&#39;s also clear that he enjoys teaching the course, which makes a big difference.I watched an earlier iteration of the course, and it&#39;s the reason I know iOS development today. I don&#39;t often write reviews (and certainly not on HN), but I absolutely have to recommended this course for anyone interested in learning mobile development."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Similar thing happened to me. I built an online Japanese - English dictionary and used AdSense to monetize it. One day I got an email saying that my domain has been permabanned because my website appears to be promoting rape and pedophilia. As an example of one of the many offending pages on my domain they sent me urls to the definition and translation of words &#34;pedophilia&#34; and &#34;rape&#34; in Japanese.Of course none of my competitors using the exact same data set had any such problems.I tried for YEARS to appeal it. There are simply no humans working at Google and nobody reads your emails.Edit: Actually, I did get a response a couple times but it was obviously automated. They just said to remove the ads from the pages where such words are displayed. So I added a simple rule and a column in the database to hide ads for those keywords. That just triggered the bot to move down the list of their &#34;obscene&#34; language. Next it was the names of various sexual positions, acts and fetishes (Japanese does have a very rich vocabulary in that topic), then manga slang, even silly sounding onomatopoeias that when explained in plain English are &#34;vulgar&#34;, etc.. It seems once your website is flagged there is simply no way get clean."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think what we&#39;re learning from many debacles on YouTube, Amazon, and Google is this:Algorithms are not even close to substituting for human customer service, human moderation, and human judgment.Maybe this means web-scale sites like Amazon&#39;s marketplace aren&#39;t viable. I&#39;m fine with that implication. Stores like Target and Walmart seem to have the same prices with human-curated inventories, and I don&#39;t really miss the millions of extra products Amazon has."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nowadays when I want to buy anything on Amazon it takes so much effort to go through which listing is the Sponsored/ad-based listing vs organic in search. Once that hurdle is crossed, it comes to going through the reviews to see which reviews can be trusted and which can not be. And even after that hurdle, once I place order, I am not sure the item I received is counterfeit or genuine. Too much work and definitely not customer-focused experience!I guess going to Target is much easier to get the necessary shopping done."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Another reason not to use EST/EDT is that they are overspecifying the time zone in most cases. If you ask for output in EDT, but the date is in December (which is not part of daylight savings time) then should the date output be UTC-4 or UTC-5?  Technically you asked for EDT.Using EST as a shortcut isn’t a good idea, either - most software will “know what you mean” and use EST or EDT appropriately... except, both The USA and Canada have been toying with the idea of dropping daylight savings time, so it’s very possible at some point in the future that 6:00pm on July 1st will be EDT in America/New York, but EST in America/Montreal (or vice versa). This is already true for CST - Saskatchewan doesn’t use DST.  And there have been times where one country or another changes the start date or end date of DST too, so there’s no reason to assume those will always be the same between Canada and the US."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only situation where our datetime instances deal with timezones is on a one way trip to a user&#39;s display, document or email. If you are playing around with parsing timezone strings, you are probably making a huge mistake unless you are parsing someone else&#39;s trash data.I feel the standard interchange format for datetimes really should be 64 bit Unix timestamps. These are trivial to store in any database as a native type, can be compared using the fastest arithmetic instructions possible, and are a locale agnostic representation suitable for direct business logic comparisons.Trying to carry timezone information around is a mistake. This is state that should be terminated and normalized at both ends, not passed through the system.The only thing I would store pertaining to timezone is for user profile or server environment configuration. These would be settings in the application that are used to produce locale-specific UI and reports.There are probably some other use cases I am not thinking of, but that is the extent of how we do it and we have a really complex app that has to serve customers who operate in multiple timezones at once."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#39;There is no good reason to use short timezone codes like EST, CST, PST — doing so will only bring you pain. Either use the tzdb name like America/New_York, or use an offset from UTC, depending on what you want.&#39;All you need to read/remember is this, this applies everywhere not just with date."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to work as a scholar of Britain (specifically executions in Early Modern England, but you pick up a lot along the way) and I&#39;ve tried to explain to a lot of people the amount of influence and control that the monarch actually holds.  I&#39;m not sure that this is such a bad thing.  The Queen can&#39;t create legislation, she can restrain it.  She is purely a moderating influence in this sense.  She could, in theory, name new people to the House of Lords, but the Lords is no longer a hereditary body and there is a mechanism for the House of Commons to override the Lords.Parliament does have power over the monarch in some senses, of course, in that there is precedent for Parliament changing the order of succession or introducing a regency.  This happened without the monarch&#39;s assent, though admittedly over a hundred years ago.  But the British constitution is one that replies on precedence, not a formal document.I&#39;ve characterized the Queen&#39;s powers as &#34;reserve powers&#34; inasmuch as, if everything goes wrong and Parliament dies from a meteor strike, the government still legally operate provided there is a monarch (even if you have to reach deep into the line of succession to find that person).  By law she has to call elections within a certain amount of time.  Obviously there&#39;s nothing to force her to follow the laws, but that&#39;s true of any country.  She (or her heirs) are the leaders of last resort."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The most obvious difference between the American and British legislative systems is the presence of a foundational document like the Constitution.The British system is strictly about convention and precedent, whereas Americans have a little more explicit guidance from the Constitution.I think what we&#39;ve learned as Americans in the last few years is that it isn&#39;t enough to have a foundational document.  Convention and precedent indeed play a large role in the function of how the well government works.  Congress is now terminally defective, largely because of the loss of the norms and violations of precedent, starting roughly in the mid 90&#39;s.Perhaps the idea that convention and precedent is the only thing holding the British system together makes it stronger."</p>

Some of my first hand experiences:- French GR-20 routes. Google maps are laughably empty, while OSM has you covered with almost the same information as the hiking maps you can buy on the trail.- Anapurna - similar to GR-20 situation. This route gets changed often due to landslides, but there is always some person doing a great job updating information not too late after.- Volcanoes - OSM maps often contain camping grounds, water sources, etc. This is something I actively contribute too. The level of detail is amazing. Some guides in fact lose potential clients because of this.OSM is a wonderful feat by all its contributors, and isn&#39;t appreciated as much as it deserves."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been looking to replace Google Maps with OSM on my smartphone.  OSM itself is great, but I&#39;ve been having a harder time finding a good app to use it with.  Is anyone familiar with a good option?  I mostly use a maps app for location searches and real-time GPS navigation, but offline maps and location sharing are nice-to-have features.I&#39;ve been using OsmAnd and it&#39;s okay.  The interface is pretty good.  It supports offline maps, but not location sharing.  Map tiles are kind of slow to load compared to Google Maps, which is odd since the tiles have to be downloaded to local storage.  The location search often includes redundant results and whatever database they use to store place data is sparse on details like pictures, hours, or reviews.  I&#39;ll keep using it to stay de-platformed from Google as much as possible, but I&#39;d be willing to pay a bit for something more responsive and polished."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Not proving solutions to textbooks seems to be a common theme in mathematics and theoretical computer science. It makes it difficult for those outside of the traditional classroom to learn the material. Instead textbook writers seem to have this adversarial approach against readers, thinking they’ll “cheat themselves” if they look up solutions or attempt to verify their work. Experts make mistakes, beginners would presumably make even more mistakes. Without a feedback mechanism beginners can’t truly know whether their logic is impeccable or if they have a subtle error that they themselves cannot detect. They could easily fool themselves that they have correct understanding.Due to that I will not recommend this current book to any colleagues.If you want an example of a fellow hacker news member that did things right, check out

I&#39;ve found that when solutions are available, my own students are much more likely to rely on them, rather than trying to figure out the problems themselves, which means they get both less practice and less honest feedback, which means they do worse on exams and in the course overall.Interesting. I was asked multiple times for solutions to my self-pub ebooks that I relented. I didn&#39;t add them initially as I wanted readers to solve by themselves or ask for help if needed (and I did get a few mails, saw one of them asked on stackoverflow as well).See also https://github.com/tayllan/awesome-algorithms for more learning resources, practice problems, visualizations, etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Core dev Larry Hastings [0] puts it well. The cost-benefit case for this complicated language feature is limited.&#34;I dislike the syntax and semantics expressed in PEP 634. I see the match statement as a DSL contrived to look like Python, and to be used inside of Python, but with very different semantics. When you enter a PEP 634 match statement, the rules of the language change completely, and code that looks like existing Python code does something surprisingly very different. It also adds unprecedented new rules to Python, e.g. you can replace one expression with another in the exact same spot in your code, and if one has dots and the other doesn’t, the semantics of what the statement expresses changes completely. And it changes to yet a third set of semantics if you replace the expression with a single _.I think the bar for adding new syntax to Python at this point in its life should be set very high. The language is already conceptually pretty large, and every new feature means new concepts one must learn if one is to read an arbitrary blob of someone else’s Python code. The bigger the new syntax, the higher the bar should become, and so the bigger payoff the new syntax has to provide. To me, pattern matching doesn’t seem like it’s anywhere near big enough a win to be worth its enormous new conceptual load.&#34;This while we have elephants in the room such as packaging. Researching best practices to move away from setup.py right now takes you down a rabbit hole of (excellent) blog posts, and yet you still need a setup.py shim to use editable installs, because the new model simply doesn&#39;t yet support this fundamental feature.I can&#39;t afford to spend days immersing myself in packaging to the point of writing a PEP, but would help pay someone to do it well. I can see no way to fund packaging efforts directly on the PSF donations page (edit: see comment). It&#39;s great to see Pip improving but there is still not even a coherent guide that I can find for packaging using up-to-date best practices. This appears to be because the best practices are currently slightly broken.[0] https://discuss.python.org/t/gauging-sentiment-on-pattern-ma..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly I&#39;m not sure what all the fuss is about.  I just skimmed over PEP 634 and PEP 636 (the accompanying tutorial) and I&#39;m actually kind of excited to use this.  I&#39;ve missed this feature after using langs like Rust, Haskell, and Scala.  People have pointed out some surprising edge cases such as this:    NOT_FOUND = 404
    match get_status():
        case NOT_FOUND:
            # this actually assigns to the global NOT_FOUND
            # and is effectively the default case
        case _:
            # this never gets triggered

Yeah, I agree that&#39;s a bit ugly.  But you can apparently do this:    class Status(Enum):
        NOT_FOUND = 404

    match get_status():
        case Status.NOT_FOUND:
            # works as expected
        ...

And really how is any of that more ugly than this?    def func_with_default(foo={}):
        if &#34;bar&#34; not in foo:
            # &#34;bar&#34; is set in the module-level dict that
            # was initialized when the func def was parsed,
            # not in a dict that is created per call
            foo[&#34;bar&#34;] = ...
        ...

And we&#39;ve been living with that one for years.  These are just the things that you have to learn when you start using Python, just like any other language.I, for one, am excited to start using this syntax."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt;the Times’ tech team quickly donned their hall-monitor goggles and Stasi notebooks to warn that the Bad People had migrated to Signal and Telegram. This week they asked: “Are Private Messaging Apps the Next Misinformation Hot Spot?” One reporter “confess[ed] that I am worried about Telegram. Other than private messaging, people love to use Telegram for group chats — up to 200,000 people can meet inside a Telegram chat room. That seems problematic.”I&#39;m already hearing this in local debates. It seems to seriously scare some folks that there are places where they cannot deplatform whoever they want for anything.(PS: Open groups and channels are not encrypted on Telegram servers and can be reported. It is just that Telegram doesn&#39;t have a history of letting other abuse it.)Edit: I&#39;ve been planning to subscribe for a while. I do now.Do it if $5 is pocket money for you.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some thoughts on the bigger picture-1: Really?  Do you have to write &#34;r-word&#34; instead of &#34;retard&#34; when you&#39;re writing about someone saying something?  What if Marc literally said &#34;r-word&#34; and I&#39;m vastly underestimating how woke this reporter is?  Wait, I have a solution. Use the actual word that a person said when quoting them.  Just write the exact sentence where you think Marc said the word retard.  Nobody should prosecute you for quoting someone without endorsing their opinion.  Obfuscating your reporting to avoid a word is bad writing style.1.5: Otherwise, the above seems to limit us to 26 taboo slurs in the English language.  A-word, b-word, c-word, ... There are other rude words, but there can only be a single r-word so bad that I mustn&#39;t spell it.  To prevent confusion, I have to completely spell/say the rest of the r-words.  What I&#39;m getting at is whole thing of not saying a word is silly.  Everyone knows that the c-word means cunt (at least in the USA).  If this wasn&#39;t common knowledge then you couldn&#39;t say c-word and have everyone know what you meant.  (Who decided that cunt was a worse word than chink anyway?  That&#39;s marginalizing Chinese people and totally not-woke. /s)2.  There are people that exaggerate and sensationalize something to get more views.  Some people are even fine trying to ruin someone&#39;s reputation.  But we are getting wise to these sorts of things.  If it&#39;s an isolated event these things kind of go away.  Even if Marc is on record once saying &#34;retard&#34; he&#39;s probably not a bad guy. Just from growing up in the 90&#39;s I&#39;ve easily said it a thousand times.  If I start to hear several other instances accusing Marc of using a slur and saying it in a hurtful manner then I&#39;ll revisit the issue."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"He&#39;s right. When I started writing in the 90&#39;s, there was an idea of journalism as telling stories in the principled defence of minority interests and as a public check on institutional power, but it has mutated into the unhinged and corrupt prosecution of deviance from official narrative lines. Social media is just a way for neighbours to denounce one another in a new snitch culture that rivals any 20th century system. I&#39;m usually a couple of years ahead of the curve on trends, and I even dropped Slack last year because it&#39;s not a place for real discourse."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s disheartening to explain this over and over again, but these frameworks are a-ok because user&#39;s expectations for the web have grown astronomically. The complicated web is here because users insist on interaction, and if any web page has more than around 10 interactions on it, the resultant complexity is best handled by a framework. I recently got to do a jQuery job for a client-- it wasn&#39;t a pleasant blast from the past but a kludgey swamp to slog through.The build pipeline complaint also strikes me as hollow. Create React App outputs folder you can drag and drop onto a  server and serve, same for Angular and I would assume Vue. Yes, it is a lot of JS from a ton of NPM libraries, but that&#39;s the trade-off when you get an entire ecosystem of code for free. If your application is security critical then consider either writing your own libraries or hosting security vetted copies of the libraries.The real reason to leave this industry is that it&#39;s all the same work at the end of the day. Despite what application you build, whether it&#39;s a social network, a security application or collaborative tool like Figma or Trello, it all runs together as a mish-mash of views, data and DOM elements. Unless you&#39;re really invested in the product, it becomes hard to maintain enthusiasm. You can only roll a CSS library, or auth scheme or API library so many times before you&#39;re ready to start some new adventures in coding."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a bit of hyperbole in the article, but it strikes a nerve.I originally came from Java and was so fed up with the hulking class lib and the arcane build systems sprinkled with Ant snippets and XML galore, so JS felt like a fresh breeze.AngularJS was a bit convoluted and the syntax was not nice. But OK, data binding was nice. Bit like dependency injection on the Java side made the code much harder to reason about but helped build certain classes of applications.Angular 4 was just WTF. Somewhat cleaner module system but now with a clunky OOP language instead of the elegant functional expressions that JS had and Java finally adopted. For which reason exactly?And I tried Vue which is a much lighter framework but like Angular, the build system is just retarded. Instead of many dozens of JARs with dozens of sub-dependencies, modern JS goes for the kill and literally imports several hundred of npm package with thousands of dependencies.And in the end, I end up having to use &#34;browserify&#34; to have JS running in a browser. It&#39;s a clowns world in IT, but modern JS really takes the cake. I&#39;m back in backend, solving real problems instead of wrangling my build chain."</p>

The cynic in me sees Stadia as yet another internal promotion scheme, masquerading as a product.I doubt this will ever change. The internal momentum of the company culture will make it so. What does it mean for investors? Google has enough money they can just buy their way into markets indefinitely. It will probably keep them going, but I don&#39;t expect huge growth.

Someone just has to approach you with your 10+ million users barcode scanner app and offer you +50,000$ in order to install some automated ad clicker for them.Don’t be naive, the majority will accept the money and gladly.I believe that particularly makeshift applications such as e.g. barcode scanners are susceptible to this kind of overtake. Apps that offer what should have been offered by the OS vendor in the first place. Why should the app developer refuse the money if what their app offers will be incorporated in a next OS update by anyways? Why defend your mini-adapter-app in an ocean of mini-adapter-apps, with yours becoming so large just because of a random seed and path dependency?This can have a big impact for end users. Imagine an authenticator app ending service to all their users in such a scheme and how you will be cut out from all your accounts by this. How many authenticator apps do you have to use in parallel to mitigate this risk of a single point of failure?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only reason this was detected was very overt behavior - opening AD popups. So I guesstimate for each one of these we have 10 that go undetected. 
This means the whole ecosystem is broken, as there is no reason this will happen only for updates and not for new apps as well. Apple&#39;s ecosystem is somewhat better, but I can&#39;t imagine they go through every line of code in each package, so most of their review is probably done with some combination of automatic static and dynamic analysis, and these can be fooled. The problem with both platforms is that they don&#39;t provide run of the mill users the option of installing an effective firewall and security solutions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The decision making power within the Rust project is uniquely delegated and distributed; with the core team holding little more privilege than other more specialized teams. [...] And the potential of such a system has bore fruit: It is not a mistake that such a promising technology has emerged from such a progressive conception of collaboration.These are values and thoughts describing an approach that the KDE community (and its foundation; hello from another board!) holds equally dearly and has inscribed in its Manifesto (https://manifesto.kde.org/, cf. Common Ownership).While maybe not unique, I&#39;m excited to see another organization adopt this idea set (a support body not interfering with technical agenda, low barriers to participation, not entrenching maintainers, working succession mechanisms, etc.) as a core message. We&#39;ve seen it work very well to sustain a productive community for 25 years and I think this bodes well for Rust!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m really happy to see this happen. I&#39;m also really thrilled to see Lars Bergstrom on the board, and am excited about taking Rust farther both at Google and across the industry. Rust is evolving from being centered at Mozilla to being a true community and collaboration between many different groups, including big companies, so I think a well-supported foundation is key. I&#39;m very hopeful for the future."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Bitcoin is a mystery to me. Somehow it&#39;s hailed as revolutionising the economy, by replacing currency with a worse kind of currency.It feels like this is where all the &#34;how to get rich quick&#34; book writers and other hustle bros went and created one giant financial pyramid, which works in quite simple way:
- buy bitcoin
- tell everyone around how revolutionary it is, so they buy it and what you holding increases in value, then tell them to do the same.Keep repeating the above two steps through different layers of abstraction, so it&#39;s not so obvious anymore.The other thing that comes into play and makes it grow even bigger is when people see others who made money on this bunch of bollocks, and think that the fact they are rich somehow makes them smart. Then they buy into all of the cryptocurrency platitudes wholesale without stopping for a moment to critically evaluate it.I think I&#39;m a bit sour, because this whole crypto-crap infested the idea space of decentralisation, which is imho very important step that we should try to take take as a society. Now it&#39;s just forever tainted with bitcoin and all the greed fuelled people there, while the decentralisation should be quite the opposite in nature.You know what would be revolutionary? Getting rid of currency altogether."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Oh noes, if this starts a trend, becomes widespread, and businesses start hoarding crypto tokens instead of investing in building stuff, it could cause a great depression pretty much the same way gold hoarding caused the economy to collapse in 1929.When people, businesses and banks start hording tokens instead of investing in building and maintaining the production capacity of consumables, the ratio of value of tokens meant to buy consumables vs the actual production of consumables gets out of wack.When the music stops, people realize that others are sitting on tons of seemingly valuable tokens but stuff to buy with them is getting scarce because capacity is not being maintained, they reverse their trade, prices of stuff go up, volatility ensues in an incredibly destructive cycle.Too much savings being tied to tokens instead of assets that create real value is an economy wide coordination failure, a terrible Nash equilibrium. It can be hard to solve because it&#39;s a prisoner&#39;s dilemma where the first people to invest in real production are disadvantaged so everyone hoards tokens instead.This is what central banks are designed to prevent. We don&#39;t want cryptocoins to cause another great depression like gold tied currencies did almost a hundred years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This comment is unlikely to win me many friends here, but it is worth considering that while Bitcoin is, nominally at least, decentralized and free from government control, internet access is not.A simple glance at the trend of governments to partially or to fully shut down internet services to certain areas in times of unrest or mass protest means, in the case of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies requiring collective transaction verification via online communications, that a loss of internet constitutes an inability to conduct financial transactions for those thus affected.While I applaud the efforts of so many to free the world from government control of &#34;money&#34;, the full implementation of this effort should be preceded by freeing internet communications from the control of those same governments, otherwise what appears to be a new financial &#34;power&#34; is actually a new financial &#34;weakness&#34;.Think over this carefully."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anecdata: Trello and Jira both have free plans that I used that caused me to recommend them for paid usage at multiple companies I’ve worked with. Those free plans resulted in $xx-$xxxx monthly subscriptions.Asana has a paid plan with a 5-user minimum limit. I never bothered to even try it since I wouldn’t have the extended time to play with it. As a result it never even got mentioned to companies I’ve worked with.So, it’s important to have a free plan (or at least very cheap paid plan as the article recommended) for “influencers” to get heavily involved with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really aggressively oversimplifying a complicated problem that exists across a huge number of different types of software. In some cases, sure, a free plan is going to cost more in effort than it pays in users who convert to paid. That said, the objection that free users are going to take up too much time is pretty easily solved... look at Google, which has zero customer support and an enormous number of free users. As long as you set expectations up front, you can offer minimal customer service to free users (which also means you can sell it as part of paid plans).But even beyond that, there are just so many generalizations here that may not apply to you. Deciding whether to have a free plan or not should depend on what the actual percent of your users that convert from free to paid is - you shouldn&#39;t just go with no free plan because someone says, &#34;Many users will never ever pay, regardless of how good your product is and how much of a problem it solves.&#34;There&#39;s some reasonable thoughts in here, but the absolutism of it shows that the author hasn&#39;t really considered the breadth of possible scenarios here - likely they&#39;ve gone through this analysis with a product or two and come to the right conclusion, but that doesn&#39;t mean that conclusion is anywhere close to 100% applicable."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It is sad but true that users that pay less, or zero, are more demanding on customer support and make unreasonable demands via social. Had a guy this week using our free product that has 90% of the paid products features berating us on Twitter for not being 100% free and demanding we convert and rely on donations to support our 40 person team. Makes me regret having a free offering. In my 20 years doing software startups I’ve seen this over and over. Simply raising your prices, which we’ve raised to over 5x, dramatically reduces load on the  CS team per dollar earned."</p>

Good luck!------------That said, maybe the HN community can answer something I&#39;ve wondered about... Why isn&#39;t there an Open Source, standardized, self-hosted, version of this kind of service? Or, why hasn&#39;t one, or two, options emerged that everyone uses and I would have heard of by now?User management, authentication, and authorization, are all problems that have been solved in many apps, and there are plenty of best practices. So, just like you shouldn&#39;t roll your own hashing algorithm, I&#39;d think we&#39;d want to do the same with this. It would make sense for one of the open source companies or organizations like Canonical, RedHat, Apache or Mozilla to have at least tried to do this.The closest I can think of to an attempt is Persona...Anyway, just been wondering about this for a while, and thought I&#39;d take the opportunity to ask."</p>

The Next.js integration story is already really quite good[1] and the Clerk team has really good ideas on how to make it even better and more seamless.It&#39;s great to see a service focus on taking away all the pain related to user management, not just login.[1] https://frontend-docs.clerk.dev/react/quick-starts/next.js"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was surprised and happy to see this also being open sourced. As a developer of OpenLieroX (http://www.openlierox.net/), we also took inspiration of Soldat. The main difference is mainly the way you control the game, i.e. with mouse aim cursor in Soldat, and purely with keyboard in Liero. And also the ninja rope.Once we added mouse aim support to OpenLieroX as well, but the Liero community didn&#39;t liked it, and basically it became another game. Network play between both versions would be unfair. It would really need a different name.Teeworlds (https://www.teeworlds.com/) is also a more recent very similar game, also with mouse aim, and ninja rope.Interesting also that Soldat is implemented in Free Pascal / Lazarus."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What a surprise to see Soldat on hackernews :)I maintained Soldat back from version 1.5+ to 1.7 before someone else took over for a few years.The current version on Steam is Soldat 1.7 while the open source version is an unfinished Soldat 1.8 and needs some love before it can be released (gui is missing, new netcode, switch to lazarus/fpc, macOS and GNU/Linux support, new config file format to name a few.)So don&#39;t expect everything to work out of the box if you compile it.Any help is welcome btw ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks super fun, I&#39;ll give it a try!Something like 10 years ago I had a similar idea - a 2D shooter with the feel and gameplay of a FPS, only that in my case I thought of making it top-down, and the plan was that visibility would be a huge thing - your 2D character would only see things from their point of view that weren&#39;t blocked by the level geometry or other players.I never completed that game, for various reasons. But in the course of making that prototype, I did a lot of research about the networking model. I read every article I could find about client-side prediction, server reconciliation, and entity interpolation. I didn&#39;t want all this effort to go to waste, so I wrote what I had learned in article form, and put it on my website.That&#39;s the never-told-before origin story of my multiplayer networking articles :)https://gabrielgambetta.com/client-server-game-architecture...."</p>

It&#39;s a documented issue but it&#39;s difficult to fix for a variety of reasons:1. Difficult to identify the owner: a lot of the devices are on mobile networks that don&#39;t point to an obvious owner.2. Unknown criticality: is it a demo system or something used in production?3. Security budget: lots of smaller utilities don&#39;t have a budget for buying cyber security products.4. Uneducated vendor: sometimes the vendors of the device give very bad advice (https://blog.shodan.io/why-control-systems-are-on-the-intern...)That being said, based on the numbers in Shodan the situation has improved over the past decade.

    far the bigger issue here."</p>

You can jump on, and pull down everything you need from the existing SSH connection, rather than using the machine to make requests out to the internet directly.This is also good if the source machine is a web server or something on a secured network which can SSH out, but not much else, and the destination is your command and control server on the internet. Then it opens up a socks port on the C&amp;C machine that gives full access to the internal network, impersonating the source machine.Every other -R is a point to point TCP connection, but setting up a SOCKS proxy with -R is magic. More analogous to a reverse -D than a reverse -L. Super useful."</p>

The company’s 2014-15 plan included manufacturing “3rd-party grass roots” support. “Buy ads for op-eds/editorials/stories in African American and Latino media,” one internal PowerPoint slide states.I&#39;m always stunned and disappointed at how easy it is to game the American political system. I say that with great respect for this country and the freedoms it affords me, but those freedoms mean little if skullduggery like this goes on.[0]: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483065-Intuit-board...[1]: https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6483061-Intuit-Turbo..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve always been under the IRS Free File income threshold (I&#39;ve worked as a high school teacher and am now in grad school), but last year after reading this article was the first time I actually filed for free. That was after 5 years of paying for deluxe TurboTax.I had heard the government required TurboTax to have a free edition. But back in 2019 (and before), if you Googled &#34;TurboTax free&#34; you&#39;d be taken to a decoy free edition; the real one was called their &#34;freedom edition,&#34; and was hidden from Google&#39;s listings. If your tax situation is &#39;too complicated,&#39; the free edition tries to upsell you to the &#34;deluxe edition,&#34; even if the &#34;freedom edition&#34; could have handled the situation just fine.Thankfully now you can find the actual free version on Google, but it&#39;s still very confusing that the &#34;free edition&#34; is less free than the (still somewhat hidden) IRS Free File (&#34;freedom&#34;) version. And the faux Free Edition is still being heavily advertised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Intuit is truly a scummy company with the way they behave here and elsewhere.  A simple example of one of these behaviors is that you cannot export data as CSV from Quickbooks Online, instead if only exports as a PDF or as an Excel XLSX file.  But the XLSX is carefully crafted so it reads out zeroes (0s) in all value fields if opened with LibreOffice or any conversion tools to get a CSV.Why do I know this?  I don&#39;t have any Windows computers, I mostly work on a Mac, and Intuit doesn&#39;t make TurboTax Business for Mac, only for Windows.  TaxAct has an online service for filing 1120S/K-1 for LLCs which can import data via CSV that works on any OS, so Intuit responded by no longer offering CSV exports and ensuring they&#39;re broken using F/OSS tools.  Really is making it a challenge to comply with the law this year for my LLC without me having to have Windows + Office 365 licenses."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Teletypes in Switzerland were ITU V.21 with three modifications:- 110 baud instead of 300 baud- not full duplex- carrier toneI experimented with a Java application and FFT to try to write a soft modem, so I still know the exact specification by heart. Bit 1 was 960 Hz, Bit 0 was 1160 Hz, the carrier tone 1060 Hz, and there were 2 stop bits. This means, the teletype could transmit 11 letters a second.The carrier tone is special: if someone stopped typing, the teletype switched to the carrier tone and kept it on for about 3 seconds then stopped.Being not full-duplex Deaf users used a convention so they know when they can type. The called party begins typing and ends with two stars, like this **. Then the caller knows he can type and also indicates the end with two stars. When a party is ready to hang up the phone he writes four stars.This is what my model (Telescrit) looked like: https://db1.rehadat.de/rehadat/bilder/TC058000/tc058773.jpg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Working in IT, the vast majority of engineers and IT adjacent people have little care or desire to learn about phone or communications systems. Especially nowadays when Teams and Zoom take care of your VoIP woes on the backend, and AWS or Azure are always doing something way cooler than a PBX can.I was lucky to work alongside an enterprise PBX architect and not only learn about phone systems, but come to appreciate the history of them as well. One of the more interesting things to me has always been the amount of accessibility that gets designed into phone systems. TTY, translation services, different languages, etc. It&#39;s something that always reminds me we&#39;re designing and dealing with a wide variety of humans that I don&#39;t get when designing a network."</p>

Because of nerve damage to his ear from the fever, he became completely Deaf at age 11. He learned how to lip read on his own and graduated high school when usually people like him would typically be excluded. Nothing stopped him. He even fished the fertile Pacific Ocean waters for Alaskan Salmon for a living, which was obviously extremely dangerous for anyone.Some of my best memories of my grandmother and her brother (my great uncle) as a kid were at my grandmother’s house, whenever she had a phone call from her brother. Her talking to her brother via a physical TTY terminal with the phone handset in the terminal receiver was just so fascinating, captivating and interesting to see in the 90s as a kid."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As an (European) outsider: Manufacturing consent is a key feature of societies. If societies are not just an accidental aggregation, but do have some actual cohesion, a core body (canon) of shared believes and opinions is absolutely necessary. If a society fails to manufacture consent as a common point of reference in this core domain, we may even speak of a failed society.A certain amount of mis- and disinformation, manipulation, falsely raised expectations (e.g., if masks do not stop CV19 dead in the track, it&#39;s also not a viable tool of mitigation), etc, is to be expected. A certain amount of dissent is vital to a thriving society, as opposed to a slow descent into dogmatism. A certain amount of dysfunctionality is actually functional to societies. However, if we are losing a common point of reference and the discussion turns from an ever varying problem space towards questioning and problematizing consent per se, society itself is at stake, as partitioning and claims to rightful dominance by one side or the other are inevitable. Dealing with this is not a matter of free speech, even, if suppression of free speech may be empirically observed as an – mostly failed – attempt to address this. It&#39;s actually more connected to the question, what speaking freely actually means: Is it to enter into or to contribute to a discussion, or is it a means of claiming dominance? In other words, does the address include those who do not share the specific set of believes and points of reference of the speaker, or does it exclude and/or ignore them, by this turning into an hermetic or even radical argument, meant only to augment the position of the speaker? Is it still pervasive, or has this turned into a hegemonial discourse? If it&#39;s the latter, it&#39;s not about manufacturing consent anymore, but about establishing a new, biased one, probably by force."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I find it hilarious that so much disinformation went into this article itself. The mischaracterizations of Fauci and the reckless, the poor sources that themselves are spin machines, all highlight a lot of the issues: a spectrum of people hell bent on manufacturing distrust in various institutions for their own gains, now co-adopted as an identity by the GOP.We need to find a way to fundamentally change the incentives in media, change the public’s expectation of separating opinion versus news, and remove the cancer(s) of “think tanks” that only serve to undermine and destroy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While it is true that we should be having a discussion about what really constitutes disinformation in a way that treats the concept as more than just a political tactic, this article reads as though it is doing almost the same thing. The bit about disinformation functions like a subterfuge to really assert what seem like the author&#39;s political views: covid skepticism, russiagate, ... If there is anything worse than throwing around the term disinformation to summarily dismiss ideas one disagrees with, it is having a discussion about this practice to underhandedly characterize ones own ideas as being &#34;actually&#34; true; as though these ideas are merely examples of real &#34;fact-based&#34; discourse. It is frustrating to see someone broach an important topic, then author between the lines of the discussion more of the very same problem."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Transparent Wood Composites [1] &#34;are novel wood materials which have up to 90% transparency and higher mechanical properties than wood itself&#34;. This latest paper Solar-assisted fabrication of large-scale, patternable transparent wood [2] describes a technique that brings this material one step closer to production scale:&gt; Here, we report a method to produce optically transparent wood by modifying the wood’s lignin structure using a solar-assisted chemical brushing approach. This method preserves most of the lignin to act as a binder, providing a robust wood scaffold for polymer infiltration while greatly reducing the chemical and energy consumption as well as processing time. The obtained transparent wood (~1 mm in thickness) demonstrates a high transmittance (&gt;90%), high haze (&gt;60%), and excellent light-guiding effect over visible wavelength. Furthermore, we can achieve diverse patterns directly on wood surfaces using this approach, which endows transparent wood with excellent patternability. Combining its efficient, patternable, and scalable production, this transparent wood is a promising candidate for applications in energy-efficient buildings.This same group has previously described A Clear, Strong, and Thermally Insulated Transparent Wood for Energy Efficient Windows [3].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transparent_wood_composites[2] https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/5/eabd7342[3] https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/adfm.2019075..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Because it&#39;s hidden in one of the captions:The volume fraction of wood in the resulting product appears to be around 33%.

My project didn&#39;t get cancelled in the reorg; in fact, it&#39;s actually come to more prominence due to synergy in the projects we work on. Essentially my new teammates are working on applications which have 2-4 years of catching up to reach the same level of maturity as my existing work.It&#39;s taken me the better part of a year to communicate the whys, whats, and hows of the systems we&#39;ve built. I&#39;ve given multiple talks, explained in 1:1s, written docs, and it&#39;s just taken a really long time to get across these ideas.

But I think the article does make a good point about the value to others. Unless you have a dev team whose head is in that code, and a business team built around that software workflow, just having the code won&#39;t be of much value to you. The value of software is inextricably linked to the team that has shaped it. So while it isn&#39;t worthless, it is certainly of much lower value without that team."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Ah, we actually have one of these at Caddy: https://caddyserver.com/docs/architecture(The filename on disk is literally &#34;architecture.md&#34; -- it is a Markdown file rendered by Caddy&#39;s template handler: https://github.com/caddyserver/website/blob/master/src/docs/...)It could use some improvement, but it&#39;s been really great for helping people learn how Caddy 2 works at a high level. Beyond our docs, I always encourage new contributors to thoroughly explore the godoc and code: it&#39;s very well-commented and organized, especially once you know how it all comes together. A single document will never be sufficient. But it can help you map between concepts and code.Code search is also invaluable for this; I recommend Sourcegraph: https://sourcegraph.com/github.com/caddyserver/caddyEdit: One other valuable piece is explaining why the architecture is the way it is. Our architecture.md doc links to a video that explains how I arrived at Caddy 2&#39;s architecture (and why it&#39;s not arbitrary): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EhJO8giOqQs"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have a similar advice, but I will go one step further: add README.md to other folders as well. It is dope to have a map of your whole system in an Architecture.md (or a README if it&#39;s not too long), but it&#39;s even more dope to be able to click through it and have submaps of how other components are structured.Displaying the folder/file structure and explaining what is what is a must. An example from Diem[1]:  consensus
  ├── src
  │   ├── block_storage          # In-memory storage of blocks and related data structures
  │   ├── consensusdb            # Database interaction to persist consensus data for safety and liveness
  │   ├── liveness               # RoundState, proposer, and other liveness related code
  │   └── test_utils             # Mock implementations that are used for testing only
  └── consensus-types            # Consensus data types (i.e. quorum certificates)
  └── safety-rules               # Safety (voting) rules


I recently digged into dependabot&#39;s code, and I found it extremely well structured. For example you have an Architecture section in the first README[2] with a diagram (how awesome is that!) and with links to the README of all the sub components, which themselves live in the subfolders[3].What I dread the most is going through a new codebase and not seeing any documentation in internal packages. Like how the fuck am I supposed to understand anything in there? By reading all the code?[1]: https://github.com/diem/diem/tree/master/consensus#how-is-th...[2]: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core#architecture[3]: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/blob/main/comm..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve seen many possible explanations mentioned. Most common seems to be that raising daughters is more stressful than raising sons (for various reasons) leading to more arguments etc. Most intriguing might be that sons conceived into tenuous marriages don&#39;t even make it out of the womb. I&#39;ll add one more: mother/daughter friction. I can&#39;t even count the number of families I&#39;ve seen in which a mother feels betrayed when her daughter doesn&#39;t follow her example in everything, and lets those feelings show. I&#39;ve seen the same with father/son, though less so perhaps because mothers tend to be more active parents. It would also be foolish to ignore the issue of daughters growing into their adult bodies and becoming sexually active right when many mothers are feeling insecure about their own attractiveness. We can argue about causes, but the effect is real.When mothers and daughters fight, it always puts fathers in a difficult position. A dad who consistently sides the mother might get credit for being a good co-parent (usually not) but be alienated from their own child. A dad who consistently sides with the daughter is likely to lose all contact with either due to divorce. All this, regardless of who&#39;s right or wrong between the two. Again, a bit of this happens when fathers and sons are in conflict, but it doesn&#39;t seem quite as severe and has different potential outcomes because of how &#34;family&#34; court works.That&#39;s just one possible factor, affecting some cases, but it seems worth mentioning along with all the others."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; parents of teenage daughters argue more about parenting than do the parents of sonsFrom my own experience. When my daughter hit 12 it was a fucking nightmare. The hormones hit girls hard and they can become incredibly difficult. That said, now she’s 13 things are much easier and look to be getting easier by the week. Although my wife and I both have to be very understanding and on the same team to deal with difficult behaviour — we have a lot of strategy meetings.Lacking empathy, and wanting independence without responsibility are part of being a teenager. But 12-year old girls can sometimes be super charged griefers.On the flip side, teenagers are actually awesome to hang out with and total joys full of creativity and fun — if you work through the refusal to clean their room, general lack of hygiene and the drama."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2014/12/why-women-s-bodies-a...Male fetuses are more likely to die in the womb if the mother is stressed. Marriages are more likely to end if the marriage is stressful. Therefore, marriages with first born daughters are more likely to end with divorce, by no fault of the daughter.Disclosure: I was once a first-born teenage daughter. Yes, my parents divorced."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One thing I haven&#39;t seen mentioned here is that Homebrew forced people use Ruby to write formulas (ie packages), whereas MacPorts forced people to use Tcl. This one decision, plus hosting formulas on Github, was a major contributor to their present success.As much as I sympathize (deeply) with all the criticism of Homebrew here on this thread -- I used to use MacPorts religiously and love it -- I don&#39;t think Homebrew took the field purely through sneaky marketing or n00b decisions alone. They leveraged the momentum of a lot of new devs coming to OS X and provided an easier path for people wanting to help out.I hate to say it, but if this was a race (?), Homebrew won. Thankfully we all still have the choice to use MacPorts if we want, but there&#39;s no point in being mean about Homebrew at this point either."</p>

I also had previous experience with the BSD&#39;s port systems, which helped push me towards macports.But I&#39;m open to being convinced about homebrew, although I&#39;ve never needed something that it had that macports didnt."</p>

But you realize in this small story, that the whole keynote could have been torpedoed, could have gone sideways and been ridiculed, if those mechanical risers had failed.  The big moment for this product that could (and did) save the company, might have been a laughable sad trombone even though Steve had warned Wayne that it was a problem that needed to be fixed.The work of hundreds of people, and hundreds of millions of dollars, were pitted against shitty mechanical hand-cranks -- that&#39;s why small details matter, and why Steve was pissed."</p>

The most famous example of this is the way everyone started to use “we did x y and z and you’re going to love it!” which was thrown around like peanuts on a domestic flight.Richard Feynman’s quote on cargo culting comes to mind."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"If there is one thing I certainly wouldn&#39;t just play around with it&#39;s the immune system. It&#39;s incredibly dangerous and easily capable of causing all kinds of harm to yourself up to killing you outright.A vaccine is designed to produce an immune response of the right magnitude. Too low and it doesn&#39;t work, too high and it&#39;ll cause damage. At least one of the vaccine candidates in development was put back to the drawing board because the immune response wasn&#39;t strong enough. So this is not an area that is entirely predictable, you have to carefully test this to know if it works.I&#39;d also be very careful about the inhalation route. Inhalable insulin is a well-known failure, in part because of side effects due to the inhalation. And that is a protein that isn&#39;t designed to activate your immune system.I also hope the synthesized peptides were carefully purified, you really don&#39;t want to inhale e.g. residual trifluoracetic acid."</p>

Underneath this post is the assumption that the author is so much smarter than everybody else because they are Rational with a capital R and can therefore harness the power of science to make a vaccine[^1]. Again, that&#39;s an incredible amount of hubris. If there&#39;s one universal truth about science, it&#39;s that it is extremely specialized. Just because someone knows a lot about chemistry doesn&#39;t mean they&#39;re qualified to talk about biology. There is no magic Rationality that can have amateurs making vaccines a good idea. Unless you are an expert in vaccines a priori, you cannot suddenly become one in a few weeks.Heck, I&#39;m skeptical of doctors who are not infectious disease experts giving advice. I still hear a lot of  &#34;well my sister&#39;s neighbor&#39;s brother is a pediatrician and he said XYZ&#34;. Doctors are certainly more educated than the average person, and if this was a minor medical problem I&#39;d certainly take a random doctor&#39;s advice. But this is a pandemic with a novel disease. Listen to the infectious disease experts.[1]: Quite honestly this feels like a plotline from Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality"</p>

People who need FMT are very sick, desperate, and willing to pay thousands of dollars to get it done. Recently, I have spent $2000 to order poop from the internet.Finding a high quality doctor is extremely difficult for a normal person. You have to find someone who is young, athletic, very healthy, never taken antibiotics, and then do some medical tests on them (pretty much everything that&#39;s wrong with a person can be transferred through FMT). Finding such person, bringing up the subject with them, and getting them agree to help is very hard.A company who could find and screen high quality FMT donors could make thousands of dollars just selling poop. Hundreds, if you&#39;re willing to drop prices to help people.All you have to do is find a healthy person who matches the criteria, and spend $2000-$3000 doing a number of blood/stool tests (and retest them every few months). Also figure out how to freeze/package/ship the transplants in a way that does the least harm to the microbes.If you are a healthy person who fits the description (or know someone who is), and are willing to help - please send me an email - fmthelp@protonmail.com"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; We believe privacy is paramount and free speech essential, especially on social media.this, from their &#34;technical difficulties&#34; notice, should have been enough for him to be fired on its own.  requiring some users to provide government identification, building such weak security that anyone can read and archive private messages, and not stripping out damaging meta-data from media posts are three ways to not provide privacy.if this was truly their mission, then their platform was already doomed, and a full housecleaning of most of the leadership should probably be done, not just the CEO.I don&#39;t care what side of a political spectrum you come from, or whether you support the site&#39;s mission or what it became, these failures should be unacceptable in any company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Odd dynamic there as unfortunately, standing on principle means getting martyred, and the quote from the former CEO of, “Over the past few months, I’ve met constant resistance to my product vision, my strong belief in free speech and my view of how the Parler site should be managed” is not CEO level strategic.His investors and board hired him to win, not to pick a principled hill to die on. Martyrs are cheap and nobody making investments can afford cheap things. The irony is Parler positioned itself as less radical than Gab, and it was that very position of bargaining with its platforms is what killed it. How can 4chan, Gab, and the even darker parts of the internet manage to persist online with hardly any money, but someone with Mercer level backing can&#39;t keep a site online? The lesson is an example of things we already know, which is that anyone who needs platform permission do to a disruptive startup is already dead.We absolutely need alternative platforms, and our societies need tools that can survive popular histrionics. Getting owned by some sanctimonious prick at Amazon is not pro level play."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Parler was poor quality because it was a product of extreme political grift. People who work in politics unfortunately don&#39;t understand the mindset of actually high quality products or services. What they&#39;re interested in is quick and loud splashes to attract a huge amount of attention, pull in a bunch of capital/resources, and then underdeliver in the extreme in the hopes that the attention of the crowd will move on and ignore the failures.This is of course a bipartisan trend, but as far as I can tell affects Republicans more.It was absurdly poorly run--literally on Wordpress with very little security and obviously no bug bounty program. They probably have never even heard of the concept of a bug bounty.All around disappointing. The next iteration, if it is to work at all, will require a complete mindset switch."</p>

Amazon executives chose not to alter the practice, instead viewing drivers’ complaints as a “PR risk,” which they sought to contain through deception. ...&gt; Today’s order provides substantial redress to the families victimized by Amazon’s anticompetitive deception.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hi, from Iran with love!First of all, thank you moxie and signal team for this proxy.Until 2018, many Iranians used telegram but Iran&#39;s regime after Russia blocked this messenger. telegram released mtproxy and this proxy was helpful. Russia lifted the ban on telegram but this app is still blocked on my country. but with VPNs, many iranians still use this app. after 2018, second most popular messaging app in iran was whatsapp, until facebook&#39;s new privacy policy, like all of you, many iranians switch from whatsapp to signal. mullah&#39;s regime removed signal app from the iranian app stores and started blocking all signal traffic in the country, but they don&#39;t block whatsapp. I&#39;m not a paranoid but it is difficult to understand for me why they didn&#39;t block whatsapp after 2018? can they break whatsapp encryption?I have a suggestion for signal team: please put tor in the signal, tor is better than any proxys or vpns."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a big fan of the idea of independently-run proxy servers.Caddy has a secure forward proxy plugin born out of a research project at Google that does something similar, but works with any clients that let you configure HTTP proxies, and doesn&#39;t terminate TLS: instead it tunnels it over TLS. The proxy server itself can also be probe-resistant, i.e. difficult to detect that a website is acting as a proxy.I&#39;m hoping more people can help test the patch to support Caddy v2: https://github.com/caddyserver/forwardproxy/pull/74(Edit: Disclaimer - Don&#39;t use this in situations where your personal safety or freedom could be at risk... not yet. Not until more people with more experience can vet its implementation for bugs, and a very clear threat profile can drawn up. If you have experience with this, we&#39;d love your help.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s an irony how American companies try circumvents another country&#39;s law (regardless of whether you call it censorship or not, it is still a law) and boast about it.Yet, in the US these companies help the mainstream narrative to enforce censorship by banning (Google and Apple App market) or simply not offering other point of views basic hosting services (AWS).I am an Iranian and don&#39;t agree with all of our government actions but I can clearly see a tech neo-colonialism/neo-imperialism here. I am sure Signal&#39;s intention and people wanting to help is genuinely good but this does not change this double-standard.I would like to see your supportive reaction if an Iranian company offers hosting to Parler. I imagine you would call it foreign intervention!"</p>

I never bother with what is going on in Constantinople; I only worry about sending the fruits of the garden which I cultivate off to be sold there.’ Having said these words, he invited the strangers into his house; his two sons and two daughters presented them with several sorts of sherbet, which they had made themselves, with kaimak enriched with the candied-peel of citrons, with oranges, lemons, pine-apples, pistachio-nuts, and Mocha coffee… – after which the two daughters of the honest Muslim perfumed the strangers’ beards. ‘You must have a vast and magnificent estate,’ said Candide to the turk. ‘I have only twenty acres,’ replied the old man; ‘I and my children cultivate them; and our labour preserves us from three great evils: weariness, vice, and want.’ Candide, on his way home, reflected deeply on what the old man had said. ‘This honest Turk,’ he said to Pangloss and Martin, ‘seems to be in a far better place than kings….

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is far too low. A fine large enough to destroy the company (as was effectively done to Purdue) would have been the only palatable outcome. And even more importantly, legal repercussions for all their employees who were personally responsible for this.All this settlement achieves is &#39;a cost of doing business&#39;, as they say. It&#39;s not punishment or deterrence. McKinsey and other companies like them will do similar in the future, and simply pay it off, again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I know someone who worked for McKinsey for a few years, and some of the projects he described were straight up slimy. The one I recall right now was helping a big payday lender (read: large scale loan shark) figure out how to get their money back from people who were behind on their payments. The problem was that they can only attempt to withdraw so many times from someone&#39;s bank before they&#39;re banned, so the agreed solution was to estimate the best time of the month when the client had received their paycheck, but before they had used it to pay rent and other expenses.This person is no longer working there, and I&#39;m not surprised."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The absolutely most fascinating part of this is learning how McKinsey has long argued that making recommendations that businesses may or may not act on does not create legal liability (until this).I’m trying to see that argument applied in any other instance and it becomes totally ridiculous.“You see, your honor, I merely suggested to my client that he kill his neighbor in order to take his land, I didn’t think he’d actually DO it!”"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I hope no one is saying Privacy Sandbox is worse than third party cookies, or is trusting this article to form an opinion about it. Web advertising was a $319 billion dollar industry in 2019. Does anyone wonder who may be lobbying their government to scrutinize Google and offer themselves for interviews for articles like this? Does anyone think the result of beating up Project Sandbox will be more radical privacy protection?No, I don&#39;t think this article has anything really to do with a better privacy outcome and everything to do with watering down Google&#39;s stance to something more status quo for the advertising industry.There are no actual critiques of Privacy Sandbox&#39;s APIs here. There&#39;s no mention of what critics stand to lose if Privacy Sandbox becomes the standard. There&#39;s merely hand wringing of &#34;but do you trust Google?&#34; Everyone who&#39;s made themselves available for quoting in this article is a web advertising professional, including the ones who come off as not[1][2]. None of them care about you.[1] James Rosewell is cited as director of &#34;Marketers for an Open Web.&#34; He&#39;s also the CEO of a company that specializes in device detection. His LinkedIn headline reads &#34;THE  Fastest and Most Accurate  Device Detection = more  profitable websites&#34;[2] Alan Chapell is sarcastic about Google attempting to do this openly through the w3c. He&#39;s cited as running a privacy law firm. Their web site says they represent tech companies navigating privacy issues. They aren&#39;t actual privacy advocates. https://chapellassociates.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Google&#39;s way of leveraging their browser dominance to use 3rd party cookies as a way to gain competitive advantage:Step 1: Implement a whole new browser functionality where Google alone can track people.Step 2: Eliminate 3rd party cookies so Google&#39;s competitors have to create increasingly unethical and invasive fingerprinting techniques to remain competitive.Step 3: Increase advertising rates since they are the only company able to effectively target adverts on the web. (Profit)Did I miss anything?Google in their enthusiasm to prevent Microsoft from dominating the web has become worse than Microsoft was in its heyday."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"So if I understand this correctly, then killing off 3rd party cookies is anti-competitive, leaving them in is anti-privacy, and putting out a privacy-enhancing alternative is also anti-competitive.  Is there anything that can be done that would satisfy all regulations?Also, this reminds me of a story I heard years ago, that a California oil change location needed to store oil above ground due to EPA regulations, but needed it stored underground to satisfy the fire department regulations.  So they were constantly getting fined from one or the other, and had to just include those fines as a cost of doing business."</p>

Western Europe has to find a backbone and soon, and stand up to totalitarian regimes and dictators. If Europe fails to be a bulwark against this scourge then it will consume Europe also.EDIT: Just to be clear, I don&#39;t suggest the west should  invade china or it&#39;s proxies, or start wars, or start proxy wars. But is not making deals with a genocidal state that much to ask? Is maybe sanctions too much to ask for?
