								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Like many people may have, my first though was why would you buy a smart oven. He explains in a follow up that it was the only one offered by his home builder. And this is an important and overlooked point.A lot of garbage that no reasonable person would ever buy ends up being weaseled in to new home sales because of deals the companies cut with the builders, knowing nobody buys a house based on whether they could have a user-scamming smart appliance as the default. This kind of thing is insidious- I have no idea what the solution is.Though as a afterthought, it reminds me a bit of the microsoft antitrust stuff from 20+ years ago where they bundled IE as part of destroying Netscape (im sure there is more subtlety than that, that&#39;s the gist of what I remember)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ha! I have a fun one.We recently had our first child. I finally opened a thermometer we were gifted from a shower and low and behold, the thing can not take a temperature without downloading an app. It has a digital screen and everything, but you when you first power it on you are greeted with it displaying &#34;APP&#34; and you HAVE to download the app &amp; set it up before it will work.When we finally took the temperature, the damn thing still didn&#39;t even display it on the screen, it sent the reading to the app. I don&#39;t even know what the point of the screen is.This thing also wants to &#34;anonymously&#34; share your temp readings and location with the community stating it will help and let you know if there are diseases spreading locally.It went against my dignity to download it and use the thing, but it was 10:00PM and checking our baby&#39;s temp at the time was more important.Still it was the most asinine smart-device experience I have had to date."</p>

What a waste.[0] https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41085118-unauthorized-br...On a side note, I&#39;m convinced Doctorow is the greatest cyberpunk writer there is, but I&#39;m also sure the reason for this is because earlier writers had to imagine a dystopian future. Doctorow, like the rest of us, is living that future (which is much more boring that fiction made out) and he&#39;s simply documenting what he sees."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From my perspective, the really exciting thing about this that it works equally well in mobile web browsers as well as desktop web - clicking on a link on Mobile Safari should Do The Right Thing without having to install anything.Moreover, because it&#39;s built on Matrix, MSC3401 (https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-doc/blob/matthew/group-...) means that we&#39;ll finally have decentralised cascading video/voice conferences once the SFU (selective forwarding unit) component is added into the mix.  So, for instance, users on the same homeserver will get their video feeds relayed locally with minimal latency... and then users on another remote homeserver will also get mixed locally with minimal latency, trunking the two together.  If the link dies or one homeserver dies, the conference will keep going - i.e. precisely the same semantics as normal Matrix."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; And, the big one drum roll, please... we will be integrating this into Element so you can have voice and video rooms, and hold group video calls inside the Element app natively over Matrix.I&#39;d love to replace my teamspeak server with this. Discord is tempting, but I&#39;d rather host it myself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is really cool. I really feel like this ecosystem is hitting its stride.The list of upcoming features is long and sometimes I don&#39;t understand how they can have so many things going on at once.Features tend to take a few years to mature, but that is not a bad thing.I will be setting up my own server shortly, something that I have been thinking about for a while and maybe try to develop something.Congrats to the team.Question:The OpenID part, would it not be cool if Matrx would offer something like a federated SSO experience? So that on other webpages you could use your matrix login instead of Github/Google and co. Hosting that server yourself would be fantastic.There are of course some issues with Attribute retrieval if user can host these servers themselves."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Hello! Original author (original tweeter?) here.This particular design is from the iPhone 7 (or, more precisely, my guess is that it&#39;s from the iPhone 7 due to both the date of the patent [1] and due to the elements matching up with marketing images of the iPhone 7), which is 6 years old now, but I think it&#39;s broadly still representative of modern smartphone lenses. In the past 5 years or so, advancements in phone cameras have come mostly in better sensors, far better image processing, and adding more cameras, but the basic principles of the compact ultra-aspherical lens design seem to still be in place.As an example, here [2] is an exploded view of the iPhone 6&#39;s lens setup, and here [3] is an exploded view of the more recent iPhone 12&#39;s lens setup. The iPhone 12 gained an extra element, but they both use similarly weird ripply elements and you can see the clear lineage between the two phones.Also, as mentioned in the tweet thread and elsewhere in the comments here, Kats Ikeda has an excellent, incredibly detailed and thorough explainer on mobile phone lens design [4]. I don&#39;t actually know a whole lot about the optics field; I&#39;m just dabbling as a hobbyist from a computer graphics perspective. Kats Ikeda&#39;s site is a much better resource than my Twitter posts for learning about this stuff.[1] https://patentimages.storage.googleapis.com/7e/4e/3f/4e88d65...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Complicated, but simply an incremental evolution of a very old solution.  These complicated lens arrangements to counteract chromatic aberration got started in the 18th century.  The game is all about getting three distinct wavelengths to focus despite each reacting differently at each lens.  The lens in the iPhone looks complex but it isn&#39;t any more complicated than others.  The most complex I&#39;ve ever read about was for a satellite which had to maintain focus despite temperature changes.  Iirc that employed a stack of over a dozen lenses.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achromatic_lenshttps://www.dpreview.com/forums/post/61074908

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I managed to escape the country yesterday, had to flight to Egypt of all places, because ALL (even business) tickets were sold out.
The recent news is that starting March 6 all international flights are suspended, the trap has closed.The disheartening thing is that even if you never supported Putin, other countries treat you as enemy.I am at Georgia now and banks refuse to open bank accounts to Russians, and I need one to continue working as a remote dev for US companies. Older generation (who are pro-Russian) suggested being careful around young people as they may be hostile to Russians, even those who are running away from Putin.A lot of my IT friends have fled the country, almost everyone who could. My heart is bleeding thinking of friends who wanted to leave on March 9, not sure what they can do now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"No one thinks that a regular Ivan from some russian city (on his own) is responsible for the war and should suffer. And I see how you could (and probably should, at some level) feel sorry for russians fleeing the country.But this is the only way to tell them that they -- collective Ivans, Russian society as a whole -- should stand up and act: they should articulate their content, they should protest against putin&#39;s policy, and they should stop the war (an alternative would be to accept Ukraine to NATO and finish this war is a day, but that won&#39;t happen).While they&#39;re suffering economically, the suffering of Ukrainians is just on another level -- it&#39;s not about restrictions (e.g. no ikea or facebook or apple products) or money (inflation), it&#39;s about flattened cities and destroyed lives.I woke up as I heard bombs falling on my city, and I definitely haven&#39;t felt any sympathy for russians since then.If they feel they don&#39;t support their country&#39;s aggression towards Ukraine, they should go protest and stop it -- even at risk of being fined or imprisoned. Otherwise they should just embrace all sanctions and become North Korea imho."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"We are actively trying to help Russian IT specialists to flee. We had over 300 resumes submitted by different people in our Telegram community in just two days. Most of these are senior people, many with experience in Yandex, local branches of Google and other international companies.I wrote about the situation here: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30552091If anyone can help us get these people out — please step forward, all information is in the post. 30+ recruiters are already working with us, but that is not enough."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I left Apple after years of lack of any flexibility on the remote work process. They wouldn&#39;t allow transferring to any alternative office for most teams. From what I understood, VPs could protect a small minority of some of their employees if a senior leader made a case to them.Unfortunately, this just seemed to lead to the most politically connected folks going remote and directors friends and favorite hires getting the perk.At three trillion market cap, I guess they just realized it doesn&#39;t really matter if attrition shoots up and they&#39;ll always have enough people to fill the trenches. Lots and lots of people left around the same time.Having left, I forgot what it was like to be able to focus on something other than Apple. Incredibly toxic atmosphere on the inside. I work at a fast-paced startup and still work on average 10/hours a week less than at Apple."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I suspect we are going to see some turmoil in the tech hiring space with stock prices taking a beating in recent months. Large companies have gotten away with paying under market price for talent because employees have seen massive gains from stock appreciation over the last decade. If total comp starts going down year over year, suddenly the more traditional, no-frills system at places like Apple, Microsoft and Amazon isn&#39;t going to look nearly as attractive, especially compared to companies one tier below that are already offering higher comp and more flexible work options."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Looks nice in principle, but being suitable for the actual daily use (for coding) will depend on how it renders in a specific IDE at a specific size on a specific OS. There&#39;s LOTS of mono fonts that look great in larger sizes or on Macs, but that all but unbearable to look at in smaller sizes on Windows.There&#39;s no mention of this font having a manually hinted TTF version, which is pretty much required for rendering under these conditions. This gives me a very big pause. As others have said - at $75 a pop this font absolutely needs a downloadable, installable and usable trial. How it looks in PDF and rendered to a bitmap may showcase its design well, but not its real-world usage. That&#39;s assuming that the author means to position it also as a coding font (which seems to be the case judging by the samples)."</p>

Specifically, I suppose some good goals would be:1. Receive instructions from any functioning local or state government. This would require that the local government know which type of radio the populace is likely to be listening on, which gives an advantage to FM or weather radios.2. Communicate with other regional survivors.3. Global news, for which shortwave would be indispensable.Maybe multiple radios that can receive on different frequencies would be best?

Then for the next few minutes, it kept getting bigger and bigger. Then I saw it had 6 engines. And a tail wing that seemed as large as a normal plane’s wingspan. I was lucky that it crossed right in front of me as I was near the airport (about 2.5 miles from the runway). It looked so low, so slow, and just massive. I went home and figured out what it was by googling it. That time it was transporting part of an oil rig.
I tried to find it to go see again ever since, but I could never get a clear schedule and it didn’t line up with where I was in the world. I was telling my wife the other week that this was something I’d like to seek out.

It&#39;s especially easier given the lack of threat to the mainland that can be manufactured.But what about against a neighboring oligarchy like Russia?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Protracted wars (i.e. long slow wars via hit-and-run and guerilla warfare) have been very successful in past to topal the mighty powers by far weaker forces. However, in recent times, I feel they are becoming much less effective. The electronic surveylence and automated targetting makes such warfare much difficult. This is especially the case because, (1) the ruling power will eventually control all communication and remove any free speech, (2) they will constantly find and kill leaders through electronic means which are now amazingly effective.A much better defensive route is probably mandatory militery training of all able citizens. Eventually, most professional armies are in the size of million at most and only 100,000 or so get deployed. If you have a million citizens with militery training, you are way harder to beat."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A bit off-topic, but the fact that criminals asked for help mining, instead of money or crypto-money, just gave me an epiphany:The whole internet is showing the first signs of a digital Resource Curse [1] brought by crypto mining. Crypto mining changed the economics of the digital world in such a drastic way that it is poisoning all kinds of internet interactions. It is not just about disrupting how money used to work, it is disrupting every kind of interaction, even those that had nothing to do with money. Things that were completely economically neutral before, so people did them just for fun, can now be exploited to extract value, so naturally some people do it and the previous innocent/neutral status quo is lost. For example: most free unix shell providers, a fun tradition from nerds from the 90s, had to shut down because now there is such a big economic incentive to abuse such free service.And while writing above I realized that crypto is probably the second internet curse, with Google&#39;s algorithm being the first. When Google became the near-monopoly in the early 2000s, linking to a website ceased to be an economic neutral activity, people realized they could extract value from linking, so link spam became a big problem and forever changed the web.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resource_curse"</p>

Either: Officially make current and all future drivers for all cards open source, while keeping the Verilog and chipset trade secrets... well, secret OR Not make the drivers open source, making us release the entire silicon chip files so that everyone not only knows your driver&#39;s secrets, but also your most closely-guarded trade secrets for graphics and computer chipsets too!Interesting. Someone got really fed up with them. I don&#39;t think their binary blob ever made them any friends."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There are two scenarios where carrying out their threat plausibly helps the open source community:1) A source drop demonstrates that Nvidia incorporated GPLed code into their drivers. This is, honestly, unlikely - Nvidia has sufficiently competent lawyers to ensure that everyone they employ is extremely aware of what the consequences of that would be2) The source drop includes the private keys used to sign Nvidia GPU firmware blobs. Nouveau is currently entirely hamstrung on the last few generations of Nvidia cards because they run extremely slowly unless appropriate signed firmware is loaded, and Nvidia refuse permission to distribute that firmware. I&#39;m not aware of any case law around whether private keys are copyrightable (I&#39;d assume not, given that they&#39;re supposed to be randomly generated), and whether it&#39;s a DMCA violation to make use of leaked keys if you don&#39;t violate any other technical protection mechanisms. This would potentially (given a lot of work) allow Nouveau to implement equivalent firmware and sign it, but this would presumably still just result in Nvidia switching to different keys for the next architecture.Obviously the calculation differs if Nvidia choose under duress to release the drivers under an open source license, but that doesn&#39;t seem likely - this still very much reads as an attempt to extort Nvidia into removing restrictions on crypto mining rather than an earnest attempt to improve open source support for their hardware."</p>

Youtube and the others are just getting ahead of curve. They have known what&#39;s coming since they were invited into No. 10 to discuss these issues with Theresa May and Amber Rudd in 2017.The legislation is based on the principle that everyone has the right to say what they want to say, but they have no right to be heard by others. This phraseology was used by several during the recent committee hearings, including by Facebook employees for example. So it will effectively enshrine in law: shadow banning, delisting from Google search etc.Also enshrined in the legislation is the principle of banning content which is &#39;legal but harmful to adults&#39;. &#39;Harmful&#39;, amongst many other terms, is not defined.Also enshrined in law will be the principle that certain types of &#39;journalistic&#39; content will be protected from this censorship if it meets criteria to be decided upon by the new regulator, Ofcom.This will be an enabling act. It is full, from front to back, of opportunity for scope creep through secondary legislation.As I said, the UK is leading the charge with this, but the EU has been keeping pace [1].

Microsoft launched Loop as an entirely new app while Google is incorporating these blocks as smart chips in Google Docs itself. Both strategies have their own pros and cons.My bet is on Google Docs style, because this means a group that&#39;s already invested in traditional document making skills (legal professionals, academic professionals, etc) will be able to incrementally step up their game without their workflow being completely destroyed. Sure, this will slow down the pace with which Google Docs can innovate and evolve - but overall it helps the older generation to smoothly transition over to the new age document editing, which is great."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have been building a Canvas diagramming library since 2010 (https://gojs.net), if anyone has any questions about 2D Canvas use in the real-world I&#39;d be happy to answer them.roundRect is great. Though you don&#39;t need 4 arcTo in order to make a rounded rect, you can use bezier instead (we do). Their example is also 1% amusing because they set the `fillStyle` but then call `stroke` (and not `fill`). I&#39;ll have to do some performance comparisons, since that&#39;s the operative thing for my use case (and any library author).text modifiers are very welcome. It&#39;s crazy how annoying measuring still is, especially if you want thinks to look perfectly consistent across browsers. Though the chrome dominance is making things easier in one way, I guess.context.reset is kinda funny. Most high-performance canvas apps will never want to use it. For that matter you want to set all properties as little as possible, especially setting things like context.font, which are slow even if you&#39;re setting it to the same value. (Or it was, I haven&#39;t tested that in several years).I&#39;m sure most users know this by now, but generally for performance the fewer calls you make to the canvas and the context, the beter. This is even true of transforms: It&#39;s faster to make your own Matrix class, do all your own matrix translation, rotation, multiplication, etc, and then make a single call to `context.setTransform`, than it is to call the other context methods.One of the greatest things to happen to 2D canvas in all these years was hardware acceleration. It used to be significantly slower. (You could switch to WebGL canvas, but at a cost of complexity and all kinds of annoyances rendering text, and if you had a lot of text it often wasn&#39;t worth it.) Thinking back, I&#39;m also a little disappointed that after the death of Flash, it felt like Canvas never really took its place. The playful web that came before it in some ways simply closed up."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll add some of my thoughts about this article&#39;s take on latest Canvas2D developments.1. ctx.roundRect() - is a nice addition to the 2D stable of shapes, fitting alongside other recent additions like ctx.ellipse(). I was a little disappointed that the example of how to achieve this using existing functionality relied on a set of .moveTo, .lineTo and .arcTo instructions; the article misses a trick by not mentioning that we can also use an SVG path.d string to define a Path2D object and use that to fill/stroke the shape. Note: I can&#39;t find mention of .roundRect() in the MDN documentation.2. Canvas Conic gradients have been supported in both Firefox and Safari for a while now. Good to see it arriving in Chrome. To complete the set of gradients, it would also be nice to see support for ports of the CSS repeating-linear-gradient() and repeating-radial-gradient() into the Canvas API.3. Text modifiers - text has always been an over-simplistic mess in the Canvas2D API. In theory a user should be able to use ctx.font to load a valid CSS font string (including all the supported font size lengths, etc) and have the text rendered as expected; sadly the implementations between various browsers are all over the place. In my dreams I hope that one day we will be able to set a width/justification and have the text string broken into lines while respecting those requirements. Browsers do it already for DOM/CSS layout and rendering - I wonder how difficult it would be to tap into that functionality rather than having to reinvent it for 2D canvases?4. context.reset() - nice!5. Filters - SVG filters are massively powerful, yet also difficult to master. We can already build some really complex filters in SVG and reference them in the Canvas2D context; I also like the way we can add CSS filter strings to the context (eg for a nice, easy-to-understand and performant blur effect). The article mentions a `ctx.filter = new CanvasFilter([])` construction, but I can&#39;t find CanvasFilter in the MDN documentation."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I feel like this post was intended to inflame or shock the reader with the writers stance on password policy. But anyone who has been in security for more than 1 month knows that regular password rotation has not been a recommendation for over 5 years. Both NIST, and MS have been trying to get the world to move to long, never rotated password, so long as those passwords are dictionary checked.Every company (all 3 of them) I have worked at within the last 10 years, the IAM team has already implimented, or was working on implimenting a system that removed regular rotation, special chars and number requirements, and relied on three things: Length, a dictionary check at the time of pass creation, and routine dictionary attacks against the credential store. This started 10 years ago, for someone to make the same claims now, is not a shock.Please note that if you are unable to impliment such an IAM system, especially the inability to dictionary check the credentials against known lists (seclists&#39; github is great for this), then length plus regular rotation is still the recommendation"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One missed point, the advice is even slightly better than they argue, since they only argue that it&#39;s not necessary to change it, which is just an argument of convenience.But updating a password is itself an attack surface. More so than merely using it to log in.It&#39;s one of the times where an attacker may be tricking you into giving it to them, either by a fake page or app dialog, or in concert with maybe they have a way to receive the verification email or text.Also it&#39;s a less frequent operation, meaning it&#39;s easier to fake. You are more likely to notice any tiny discrepency and detect a fake in the way your normal login screen looks than some account management screen.Basically updating a password is a riskier action than the normal daily use of the same password.And that alone is it&#39;s own even stronger argument for avoiding doing it unnecessarily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the USA, the latest government guidance from Jan 2022 is that &#34;Password policies MUST NOT require use of special characters or regular rotation&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My dad owns a successful chain of bicycle stores in Texas.  He’s been in business for almost 51 years and he’s one of the largest bike dealers by volume in the country.  He has nearly a hundred employees and a bookkeeper.  Despite having a proverbial dozen balls in the air at any time and despite having people on the payroll to do bookkeeping, he sits down at his computer every night at home, logs into the ERP system, and reviews sales and receipts.  He catches all kinds of crazy things.  Credit card fraud (before the chargeback even comes), internal theft, mis-priced items, mistakes, you name it.  He has great employees but even the best make mistakes and he’s learned this habit over the decades the hard way.  I remember sitting next to him as a kid, watching him pour over cash register journal tapes that were yards long, looking for problems.My point: if you let this kind of fuck-up go undetected for over three months, you have to at least assume some of the blame and acknowledge that you probably could have caught it if you scrutinized transactions.  Every good business owner does it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I actually thought Stripe did decently here, there were periods of silence which sucks. It&#39;s odd that you feel they are obligated to explain their internal processes with you?Things they did right:
1. Immediately acknowledge the issue and raise it to a Specialist.
2. Give you a work-around, so that you don&#39;t need to be blocked.
3. Engage the lead PM, to speak to you, to address your concerns.
4. Fix the documentation first, so others know how to fix this and understand the cases.
5. Take feedback that they need to improve the API.
6. Find which customers had an issue and pro-actively reach out to them. (Isn&#39;t this what you wanted in the 1st place?)Things that didn&#39;t go well:
1. Long periods of silence between mails.
2. Lack of a bug bounty, sounds like a pretty big miss on their part and a bug bounty would be nice."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I also had issues with stripe&#39;s automatic tax. We use stripe&#39;s subscriptions with free trials but don&#39;t collect credit card details up front, preferring to make sign up simple and low friction. Automatic tax is charged at 0.5% of each transaction, and apparently a trial ending is considered a transaction even if the user has no payment method, so we were hit with automatic tax fees for every trial end even if we received no money for them.Overall my experience with stripe has been pretty negative and the large gap between my perception of the quality of their products, and the reality I discovered in actually using them has made me realize how much effort they put in to marketing to developers."</p>

A couple of notes of people who are confused by it:1) The &#39;ns&#39; next to the box is a graph legend not a data label (normally that would be in a box labeled legend to distinguish it from graph data)2) The weird box and rectangle thing on the top is a slider, I didn&#39;t notice that until I was looking at the code and said &#34;what slider?&#34;3) The only changes from 2005 to present are storage and networking speeds.What item #3 tells you is that any performance gains in the last decade and a half you&#39;ve experienced have been driven by multi-core, not faster processors. And that means Amdahl&#39;s Law is more important than Moore&#39;s Law these days."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"An instructive thing here is that a lot of stuff has not improved since ~2004 or so, and working around those things that have not improved (memory latency from ram all the way down to l1 cache really) requires fine control of memory layout and minimizing cache pollution, which is difficult to do with all of our popular garbage collected languages, even harder with languages that don&#39;t offer memory layout controls, and jits and interpreters add further difficulty.To get the most out of modern hardware you need to:* minimize memory usage/hopping to fully leverage the CPU caches* control data layout in memory to leverage the good throughput you can get when you access data sequentially* be able to fully utilize multiple cores without too much overhead and with minimal risk of errorFor programs to run faster on new hardware, you need to be able to do at least some of those things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The article is close, but doesn&#39;t quite get there. The problem is not the image itself or how it&#39;s taken, but rather how it&#39;s displayed. When you look at the world through your eyeballs, your brain recreates the scene so that it wraps around an imaginary point in mental space, so to speak. Things that are to your right &#34;appear to your right&#34; in your mind. When you&#39;re looking at a photograph, regardless of how much field of view it was taken with, it&#39;s displayed in a very small portion of your entire field of vision, even if you&#39;re looking at it on a computer monitor; it&#39;s even worse if you&#39;re looking at it on a phone. You&#39;re basically always looking at it zoomed out. It would be possible to recreate the scene exactly as it would have appeared if your eye was where the camera was when the photo was taken, but you&#39;d need to blow it up on a huge screen, like a movie theater screen, and stand fairly close to it. Then you&#39;d be able to see that actually most lenses other than fisheyes have fairly narrow field of views."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Perspective is a huge challenge in photography, in some respects a central challenge.Here&#39;s [1] an image, made with a rectilinear lens, which manages to convey oodles of depth and structure.  It is difficult to overstate how challenging it can be to express that level of depth in a flat image.When people talk about how a focal-length &#34;compresses&#34; or &#34;exaggerates&#34; an image, what they&#39;re really talking about is perspective. Each field of view carries with it its own perspective.Variable focal-length (&#34;zoom&#34;) lenses encourage us to select our subject and composition first, then choose a perspective to match. Frequently, it is more important to begin with our desired subject and the perspective with which we wish the viewer to see it (focal-length), then figure out how to build a composition to match.   A 24-70 mm lens isn&#39;t really a lens, it is at least six lenses with significantly-different perspectives: 24, 28, 35, 40, 50, and 70mm, each of which can take a lifetime to master.One can deliver the perception that Hertzmann is after with a rectilinear lens, but it isn&#39;t easy.  Composition, lighting, and dodging/burning are all tools to that end.Think about your memory of the Tank Man in Tiananmen Square, now look at the image [2].  I bet he&#39;s a much smaller part of the frame than you recall, yet he utterly dominates your perception of the image, even when you look at the actual rectilinear image.[1] https://www.phillips.com/detail/HENRI-CARTIER-BRESSON/NY0405...[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tank_Man"</p>

South Korea does not allow exporting vector maps, so Google Maps rendering is vector based everywhere except in a region surrounding South Korea [1]. China applies a (not so) secret pseudorandom offset to all geographic coordinates in online maps, frequently resulting in mismatches between systems that apply corrections and those that don&#39;t. It seems silly during peacetime but when there&#39;s an actual war, you can see why people might want that kind of thing.And militaries all over the globe do use Google Maps extensively, if not by policy then just by soldiers doing their own thing. Wrong borders in Google Maps have nearly led to international incidents when soldiers ended up on the wrong side of a border. And then there are the disputed borders that Google is forced to display differently in different countries. There is no globally accepted map and as a result the map Google shows you changes depending on where you&#39;re located.[1] Actually I am out of date, it looks like the South Korea maps are vector based now. Maybe the law changed. It definitely used to be the case."</p>

He would &#34;show me it&#39;s working&#34; by tapping on the exterior of the sensors to get it to display a spike.Conceptually these systems &#34;make sense&#34; to me, ie. the brain uses electromagnetism to function so one should be able to sense/manipulate those vectors, but an FMRI is MASSIVE and requires a 1-3 Tesla electromagnet to get its fidelity, and even then is only measuring blood flow and correlating that to brain activity.So what&#39;s the hope that a tiny sensor resting on your skin will actually correspond to anything happening inside the brain?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I learned a similar lesson in a simpler form when waiting tables.Some people will run you ragged, asking for more napkins, then when you return with them, more ketchup, then when you return with that, there’s an issue with the food, then so on and so on.If you don’t check yourself, you will actually leave your other tables without any of their basics, or their food will get cold waiting in the window, because you’ve developed tunnel vision to please this one needy table.Sometimes things really do stack up, but there are strategies to avoid or deal with that. These strategies will fail with the Truly Needy table. And then they won’t tip well, or at all.I learned it’s better to deprioritize that table and pay the normal amount of attention to everyone else. Better for those all to tip at a standard rate and give them a good experience than to let one group drag down the whole floor.That super needy table didn’t need half the things they asked for anyways. Those napkins are sitting there unused when they leave. The glass of water they asked you to fill at halfway is still almost full. Life goes on."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find scary is that if you work in a sufficiently toxic environment/culture for long enough, that very behavior that you try to fight against and change begins to seep into your everyday actions. I&#39;ve seen myself go from &#34;positive and helpful&#34; to &#34;apathetic and helpful&#34; to &#34;not caring at all&#34; to &#34;chippy, negative and unhelpful&#34; before. You hope that this is something you can pickup on, but when the culture of a work environment is like that, there isn&#39;t really anyone to give you feedback and catch you from sliding down this slope.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I totally know that feeling. This is why I really cherish my current, by now 3 years old, job because sort of the opposite exists here. In fact, if I forget sometimes or make a mistake, my coworkers are more likely to fix it for me in the wiki or docs than they are to use it to complain or stop me from doing something. Working in a helpful and collaborative environment has had an enormous quality of life improvement for me. It is also the most productive teams I&#39;ve ever worked on. I&#39;m not writing this to gloat or anything but offer up something I didn&#39;t know before working here: Don&#39;t just hire for talent; do not hire jerks no matter how good they are as individuals. Software engineering is an inherently collaborative venture. When building an engineering team, really do build a team instead of a collection of individuals. It&#39;s fine for engineers to be critical but don&#39;t just stop there. Find fault but also offer up a solution to help the project move forward. I can&#39;t work in the type of environment the author described anymore. Now that I know functional, collaborative teams exist I will always want to be on one."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a wonderful little game. The concept and execution is extremely concise but the thing that really sealed the deal for me was noticing the escalating difficulty by making the paddles shrink."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Let me use this thread to tell this somewhat related story of mine.When I was still at university we had a C class and were doing it in a computer lab with partners (back then very few students could afford a laptop). I was always partnering up with the same friend. Since we were a bit bored with the class we started building our own pong in C.
Rendering was done in ASCII in the command line, with paddles being 3 pipes, the ball a capital 0 and the walls &#34;#&#34;. We would spend some time at the beginning of the class building/improving it and at the end playing it. We used keys like &#34;W&#34; and &#34;S&#34; for the left player and &#34;O&#34; and &#34;L&#34; for the right player. Since the initial setup with rendering and &#34;physics&#34; of the game went quite fast, we thought about how to improve it and make it more fun.What made it incredibly fun (at least for us) in the end, was the addition of bonus squares. So, between the two paddles, if the ball that you just touched hit a bonus square, it would activate an effect for you or for the game depending on the bonus. We had:
- &#34;wall&#34;, would create a 3 squares wall at the location of the bonus
- &#34;turn of the lights&#34;, would hide everything but the ball (even the paddles)
- &#34;gun&#34;, would allow you to shoot and destroy walls and bonuses
- &#34;bigger/smaller paddle&#34;, self explanatory
- &#34;net&#34;, would temporarily put a net behind you preventing you from missing the ball
- and some more, like speed up the ball, add an extra ball, etc.It&#39;s been my one and only experience building a game but I think it was the most fun I&#39;ve had programming…
If anybody is up for re-building a pong with bonuses I&#39;d be definitely up for that ;)Back on the topic: love the implementation OP, pretty addictive. And, as can be read above, it brought back some nice memories."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I think anyone who&#39;s claiming that remote work has been &#34;proven&#34; to be better or worse is wrong. There are some studies but they use estimations and proxies, carrying the same flaws as doing performance reviews based on lines of code.We&#39;ve proven that the big tech companies can go fully remote and not completely crash and burn, that&#39;s about it. Some people love the lack of commute and less semi-forced hanging out, some people hate onboarding on a new company as a remote person and so on and so on.I personally prefer a company where everyone&#39;s on site. I want to be able to quickly resolve any issues in person, not over voice call or slack, and I think that an environment where someone can tap me on the shoulder when they need help leads to overall higher productivity, even if individual productivity suffers temporarily."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have been fully remote my entire career (several decades), in fact in 30+ years have never been on site anywhere for more than 2 weeks total. Wouldn&#39;t have it any other way.But as a counter-point, seeing a whole bunch of people who were never remote before, how little work they are actually doing, it is no surprise to me that a lot of employers are going to start forcing - to the extent possible - employees back into the office.I think a small percentage of people are self-motivated, and more productively at home, but watching this all play out for the last 2 years makes me realize that an awful lot of people are going to try to get away with absolutely anything they can - including working as little as possible - when allowed to be on their own. I have had coworkers literally disappear for days at a time, miss meetings for weeks at a time, constantly miss deadlines etc - and as a manager, that is very hard to manage underperformers with a remote work force.Remote work isn&#39;t for everyone, and unfortunately there is a non-trivial percentage of the workforce that actual does need someone watching over them to make sure they do what they are supposed to be doing each day.Let&#39;s hope they don&#39;t ruin it for the rest of us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked at a startup where everyone being there was essential in how we worked. (We were all pair programming.) It was great. It beats code reviews any day. I learned a lot.But when I was at Google, we would schedule VC meetings with people in a different part of campus just to avoid the walk. Also, I worked on teams that had people worked out in many offices, mostly not Mountain View. I was surrounded by Googlers in an open-plan office, but it was often lonely. I ate alone sometimes. It was often not worth the commute.I think Google having a company-wide policy on this is nuts. Teams vary a lot. They should probably be left to make their own decisions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This feels like a major blow, as someone who just semi recently (probably around pandemic start) started getting into purchasing flac music from indie artists, Bandcamp was a great source of music. I understand nothing will change in the short term, but long term I am very concerned. Especially as streaming becomes more dominant and companies are less willing to provide flac based music and physical discs (where I can rip my own) continue to disappear.This feels like a potential last step of true music ownership and that makes me incredibly sad.That being said if anyone knows of any place to buy flacs of music with great selection would love to know (especially for Japanese music which I generally have to import, thankfully they love CDs)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is absurdly sad to me. I like to own my media (in the most practical sense that current IP laws let me do so). I run a Plex server and use PlexAmp as my primary way of listening to music, and my criteria are always this:* FLAC or similar, I want this to be a lossless preservation of what was on the best-available source.* No DRM. No mandated player. Just let me download a dang file.* &#34;Real&#34; flac: this is technically already covered under the first bullet, but I call it out because I&#39;ve seen it happen before: if I can open the flac in audacity and see it&#39;s obviously just a re-encode of a lossy format that clips the upper and lower frequency ranges off, that&#39;s a smell and I don&#39;t like it. (I know, most people can&#39;t tell etc, but this is less for listening purposes and more for archival purposes).* Supports the artist!Now, I&#39;ll admit, when push comes to shove, I drop the last bullet point first. So previously, my source for music was:1. CD&#39;s (and I would follow What&#39;s guide for making Perfect Flacs)2. WhatBut then what shut down and I lost my main music discovery mechanism. Enter bandcamp! Now I&#39;ve been very happy with:1. Bandcamp (I buy CDs because I like the artwork and they&#39;re cool).2. CD&#39;s (+ Perfect Flac ripping guide still)Now I&#39;m not sure what to do. Epic has really soured me on their brand already, and I already boycott their launcher and any EGS exclusives. I guess I have to find some other way to get stuff now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s been so frustrating watch this play out over the past decade.I keep seeing projects that could have been written as a traditional multi-page application pick an SPA architecture instead, with the result that they take 2-5 times longer to build and produce an end-result that&#39;s far slower to load and much more prone to bugs.Inevitably none of these projects end up taking advantage of the supposed benefits of SPAs: there are no snazzy animations between states, and the &#34;interactivity&#34; mainly consists of form submissions that don&#39;t trigger a full page - which could have been done for a fraction of the cost (in development time and performance) using a 2009-era jQuery plugin!And most of them don&#39;t spend the time to implement HTML5 history properly, so they break the URLs - which means you can&#39;t bookmark or deep link into them and they break the back/forward buttons.I started out thinking &#34;surely there are benefits to this approach that I&#39;ve not understood yet - there&#39;s no way the entire industry would swing in this direction if it didn&#39;t have good reasons to do so&#34;.I&#39;ve run out of patience now. Not only do we not seem to be learning from our mistakes, but we&#39;ve now trained up an entire new generation of web developers who don&#39;t even know HOW to build interactive web products without going the SPA route!My recommendation remains the same: default to not writing an SPA, unless your project has specific, well understood requirements (e.g. you&#39;re building Figma) that make the SPA route a better fit.Don&#39;t default to building an SPA."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think one of the unsolved problems of client-side interactivity on websites is how difficult it is to add it just a little bit of extra client-side functionality to a traditional server rendered website. For example, recently I had to deal with photo uploads on a Rails app, which works fine out of the box at first, until you want to show progress bars and uploaded previews etc. Then you add a couple of client-side Stimulus controllers, maybe a Turbo frame here and there and it works, but then you get to browser navigation and you&#39;re screwed, because none of this works if somebody were to submit the form, then navigate back. Now you have to implement lifecycle handling to account for navigation and once you&#39;re done, you&#39;ve basically implemented a SPA, except it&#39;s broken into a mix of tightly-coupled Javascript, Ruby and ERB templates."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"SPAs are a pattern that&#39;s been applied too broadly IMO, but it&#39;s going a bit far to call them a mistake. The aims of an SPA are pretty noble - the idea of essentially removing the network round trip when a user clicks on something is not a bad one. It means things are faster, they work if your connection is flaky, they can do things like offline support. Those are good features.They might not be actual requirements for a blog or a brochure site but it&#39;s not totally unreasonable for someone to want their website to work that way. The question is not whether or not an SPA is a good or a bad thing, but whether or not the cost (more code, more complexity, potentially a series of background requests after the initial page load) is worth paying in order to get the benefits.When either an SPA or a multi-page site is done well most users can&#39;t tell which sort of site they&#39;re looking at. That should be the goal. Make stuff where the user forgets about the tech. Make a website that just works, that&#39;s fast enough for users not to think &#39;this is a bit slow&#39;, and that&#39;s coded in a way you can maintain and work on for a long time. If you get those things right then no one can reasonably criticise what you&#39;ve made no matter how you&#39;ve made it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s discrimination any way you slice it. You can&#39;t lower the bar for one person without raising it for another so long as the class sizes remain the same. If elite universities are about providing education (a valid point of critical contention), then systematically barring Asians from entry is the same class of injustice litigated in Brown v. Board of Education. It&#39;s not enough to say you can learn calculus just as well at the University of Massachusetts.&#34;Here we find our first indication of the strength of preferences for underrepresented minority students. African-American students have nearly an 80 percent better chance of being admitted than their white counterparts, while the Hispanic advantage is reflected in almost 50 percent higher odds compared to whites. By contrast, Asian applicants and those from other races face lower odds of admission on the order of 17 or 18 percent—in relation to comparable whites.&#34;https://scholar.princeton.edu/sites/default/files/tje/files/..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a confused by the equity claim to justify discriminatory behavior with what seems like heavy emphasis on race. It seems difficult to achieve equity without transparent, and standardized methods emphasizing a holistic assessment covering visible and invisible, immutable and mutable characteristics--each of which impact individual outcomes.I understand that tackling overrepresentation and underrepresentation is important; but, when emphasizing race to the degree that these academic institutions are, isn&#39;t this leading to representation disparities within the racial categories themselves? The racial categories are a very American centric and limited term, and arguably rooted largely as social constructs that loosely define the ethnic populations they cover. For example, and I don&#39;t mean any offense or to call any group out specifically, Koreans are overrepresented compared to Cambodians at the academic institutions listed in the article per their population proportion. This doesn&#39;t seem to be captured and accounted for under the current system. The same underlying disparity potentiality applies to whites, Blacks, Hispanics, Native Americans, etc...The interpretation being, that it&#39;s a sort of half-committed approach to equity that isn&#39;t really leading to equitable outcomes if that makes sense, and may even be exacerbating ethnic marginalization within the racial categories.Another question is, if this isn&#39;t leading to genuine equity of outcomes and instead passing discriminatory behavior onto smaller, marginalized ethnic groups, what do you do then? Do you revisit implementing an improved meritocracy system, or implement an equity based system with greater accuracy and precision to prevent this?This doesn&#39;t even begin to tackle the issues current racial categorization creates with multiracial people and the essence of &#34;purism.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Oh no! This breaks my heart. :(David and Ron Crane hired me for my first job in California right around 2000.  I had no clue who they both were we just met at a trade show and I said I was looking for a job, we had this crazy interview where we just talked about anything and everything, and voila I was working in silicon valley. I think we spent about 2 hours talking about how we could float a balloon beside an AM radio station and how light up a light bulb...Anyways, who fresh out of school doesn&#39;t work for the inventor of ethernet/fast ethernet/a core founder of 3com, etc? I only spent 2 years working with them, and I&#39;ve always been looking to work with similar talent/kindness/etc.  How they put up with a fresh grad I will never know.I remember David and I working on an SDSL project, and we were just having the worst time ever.  We couldn&#39;t get it train and finish setting up the link, it did almost everything but then just failed at the end.  It was meant to be easy....but we just couldn&#39;t figure it out.  We spent a crazy amount of time on it, maybe a month.  Finally Ron got fed up, and asked &#34;have you tried reversing the pairs?&#34; and it worked!  Turns out we had plugged the cable in backwards, and trying to streamline/debug the code had removed the final bits of cleanup code that checked if the pair was reversed.  Ah well.They were amazing mentors and friends.  David invited me over to his home for wine tastings, to meet his cats (Palo and Alto), etc. I unfortunately lost touch with him over the years as I moved, he moved, etc.Thank you David, you welcomed me to California and you&#39;ll be missed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I ran across him years ago at a shooting event (he had a very cool Steyr AUG). He was humble, down to Earth, and just a really neat guy. Amazing to think how his work impacted us all.His one conceit to vanity? The personalized plate on his older Mercedes SL coupe was something like ETHERNT, which is why I initially approached him."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"First commercial Ethernet media (1980) also was a RG-8X coaxial cable using the circa-1940 RF connector called “N” (as opposed to the F or the unthreaded RCA phono connector).You could then do “simple” vampire tap into such Ethernet RF cable to expand your network.Because the then-10Base-5 signal is a guided RF-based wire, it was originally made to allow communication in one-direction only … at a time (half-duplex). Each end of the wire had to wait their turn (just like telegraph operators did by beaconing their intent to send info by pre-sending some well-known code).Both IBM and Xerox Parc diverged into Token Bus and Star network configuration to deal with this “half-duplex” issues using the same collision backoff algorithm.I think David unknowingly cemented the IEEE 802.3 standard as a winner when he prototyped the N-backoff algorithm for upcoming 802.3 for the 802 IEEE Working Group.This half-duplex constraint of 802.3 (and 10Base-5) technology was losing out to the IBM token bus (IEEE 802.5) methodology in maximum bandwidth utilization.Of course, without this N-Backoff algorithm, 802.3 wouldn’t have made the next step of leveraging a twisted pair (precursor to 802.3 10Base-T) possible to achieve this full-duplex and modern Ethernet we know to this day. Token bus and token ring both had effectively lost out in the Ethernet “Duplex War”.While Bob Metcalf may have made it possible the 10Base-5 communications, he also got a lot of hardware help so David Bogg actually did the thinking of backoff algorithm … at hardware level. And the PARC performance team refined the backoff algorithm to near perfection.Any error are mine and mine alone.  I was close enough to that circle, others may be closer."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I experienced this in the extreme recently. I&#39;m a very experienced dev in a very in-demand field. Money is not a huge priority for me in my career. Flexibility is. I have a proven track record of success in part-time roles after converting to part time at my previous company (after 2 years of full-time, of course). I spent 3+ months trying to get part-time engagements, and was willing to consider both consulting and W-2 arrangements. I got interviewed and then ghosted by two companies, was offered a laughably low rate by a third, and a fourth showed interest but then basically told me that I&#39;d need to work a 40-hour week. I know that a vocal minority has success in part-time consulting, but it&#39;s quite difficult to accomplish if you live outside of a tech hub (I&#39;m based in Central Oregon) and don&#39;t have SV connections.Contrast that with when I gave up and decided to make myself available for full-time (remote) work. In the span of about 5 weeks, I got over 200 recruiter emails, interviewed at 10 companies, and received 10 offers, mostly in the upper end of the $200k-400k range.I firmly believe that this is a cultural block, rather than one that&#39;s rooted in rational/pragmatic concerns. Tech companies want to feel like they&#39;re getting your full intellectual output, even if that&#39;s demonstrably false in the status quo. There&#39;s also this issue that gets brought up of &#34;if Bob is gone half the time, isn&#39;t that going to breed resentment with his full-time coworkers?&#34; (answer: only if you have a shitty &#34;butts in seats&#34; management culture).I honestly don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to see meaningful change in this area for a while. The 40-hour work week is something that&#39;s heavily ingrained in tech culture, to the point where certain companies&#39; &#34;perks&#34; are heavily tuned towards incentivizing you to stay at the office longer and frequently turn that 40 hours into 60. I think it will take an external disruptive event on the scale of COVID-19 in order to change this aspect of tech culture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m working hourly on a contract where I advised the company I could only work 15-20 hours a week.  It can be a win-win I believe, but with tradeoffs for both sides.I&#39;m able to make the 3-4 hours of work a day be extremely productive.  I always deliver in fewer hours than were budgeted for the work.  As a contractor, there are no extraneous meetings to slow me down.  But I&#39;m still involved in client meetings as needed, understand their needs, and take ownership of the codebase to my immense satisfaction.It&#39;s not very different than working &#34;full time&#34; from home where you might take a walk, run an errand, cook your lunch, etc., but I can flex the schedule even further without any guilt.  The change in mindset from &#34;taking a break from full-time work&#34; for an errand versus &#34;I&#39;m not billing this hour, I&#39;ll do whatever I want&#34; is empowering.The negatives: less pay in total for me (but hourly rate can be negotiated), and features might (but won&#39;t necessarily) get done more slowly in terms of calendar days.BTW a typical day might be:- daycare drop-off 9:30, exercise- 10:30 shower, chores, life tasks- 11:45 cook and eat lunch- 12:30-4:30 work with a break for walking or playing pianoI do some &#34;down time&#34; thinking about problems as I fall asleep at night or on walks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Two big reasons off the top of my head:1. Two people working a 20h week does not mean the same costs as a single person working a 40h week (think payroll, software licensing, pension admin, healthcare, etc).So costs rise as a result.2. A job generally has a base load of admin and toil (communication, on-call, interviewing, PR reviews, etc) and you can&#39;t reduce or distribute the base load well enough to yield productive output from the remaining work time with part-time workers and some of this adds more toil when distributed across more people (i.e. on-call requires more handovers during the week and takes more communication).So productivity is reduced.*For companies to consider doing this they&#39;d need to perform an trial to satisfy themselves that the above can be overcome. But even doing that may not be possible with existing employees and risks instilling discontent amongst those not in the trial. It&#39;s high risk to try.* Unless the entire company is 100% part-time and somehow base load is fundamentally reworked, in which case #1 still applies."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This article hits on something I&#39;ve felt for a long time. The idea that &#34;hooks are superior&#34; to me is ridiculous. If a linter is required to tell me when I&#39;m writing a bug that is not immediately obvious, that is a failing in the framework to round those edges. Lints are not rounded edges!Solid is nice and _seems_ to fix the issues with hooks, but as another comment mentioned, the challenge is with building at scale. It&#39;s unclear to me how this scales and where the sharp edges are.React IMO trades off performance in exchange for ergonomics. These ergonomics bear fruit early on, but you start dealing with this debt very quickly. As &#34;nice&#34; as Redux is, I shouldn&#39;t need it so early. React is designed in a way that results in pretty terrible performance. I once wrote a React app, and discovered perf issues 2 weeks in. Any UI framework I used in the past would have scaled beyond this point without having to have the data layer rewritten. Frameworks of the past also had what seemed like way less &#34;magic&#34;.I totally accept that it&#39;s seriously nice to write, but how many trees has React alone burnt?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"New JS frameworks always make for compelling hello world examples.Can you branch on state or use loops over data in Solid.js? The reason _why_ React has a virtual DOM is to enable more interesting relationships between your data and your presentation. Anyone can make a framework that makes the source code for an incrementing number look pretty!As an example of this point, check out the &#34;Simple Todos&#34; example for Solid.js[1].In React, we render lists by using regular JavaScript idioms like loops, arrays, and array methods like map. However in Solid.js, much like traditional templating languages, we get a construct like &lt;For&gt; that reinvents a concept that&#39;s already in the language.I&#39;ve been writing React and React-alike code for a long time. I think that fine-grained updates avoiding reconciliation are a good idea, especially for performance. At one point, I built a React-like library for Roblox and Lua whose most novel feature ended up being &#34;Bindings&#34;[2], which look sorta like Solid.js state containers. They create little hot-path data dependencies, but the bulk of your components still use normal React-like rendering.  [1]: https://www.solidjs.com/examples/todos
  [2]: https://roblox.github.io/roact/advanced/bindings-and-refs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve used React for ~3 years, primarily with function components and hooks. I think that hooks were a wonderful addition and I think the framework has made smart choices with checking object equality to decided if components re-render.That said, I think that easily the most difficult aspects of react revolve around how re-renders are triggered. Maintaining referential equality to stop unnecessary renders gets tricky when you are passing functions or objects. Suddenly you need to be using `useMemo` and `useCallback` and passing dependency lists that all have to be primitive values unless you want to memoize them as well. It can become such a headache that the official line around it mostly seems to be &#34;make the render fast, don&#39;t worry about unnecessary re-renders&#34; – good advice, until you hit a use-case where you need to worry.Solid takes these problems and just vanishes them. UI state knows what its dependencies are automatically and only updates when they change – even in a sub-component level!To be fair, I&#39;ve never used Solid in anger, and moving to it would be a big ask when there is such a good ecosystem built up around react. That said it is easily one of the most exciting projects on my radar, and the developer Ryan Carniato seems extremely knowledgeable in the area."</p>

I was assured that my experience was unique and not widespread. I am both sad and happy to see this, sad because it exists, happy because it is getting some attention here at HN.I would like to take this opportunity to point out that everyone of us needs to be vigilant about this type of racism. One thing I recommend to my hiring managers is to not allow people from frictioned backgrounds to manage and interview people from the other side. Example problematic pairs for candidates/interviewers (not including the cast situation) include: Indians and Pakistanis, Serbians and Bosnians, Greeks and Turks, Chinese and Japanese.One way I solve this is by introducing an independent observer/participant when situations like this emerge. This is costly but it has really worked to not only address this problem but also created an amazing diversity in my teams because it takes care of some of the implicit bias we all have to some degree."</p>

I know that caste based discrimination is still prevalent in India and not surprised that it continues in here in silicon valley as well amongst Indian community but I&#39;m surprised to read this part in the article. I have never heard of someone doing a scan for sacred thread. Also, it&#39;s worth noting that most non-dalit people also do not wear this sacred thread so whoever is doing this scan isn&#39;t familiar with India or probably this part is made up in the article.That said, I know that it&#39;s much harder for a dalit person to progress in India as the society still tries to pull them behind. Indian govt has reservations in colleges and jobs for dalit community, which I believe has helped the community a lot in last 50 years or so, helping many to bring their families out of poverty. But, still there&#39;s a long way to go. Also, a long way to go for non-dalit community to abolish this discrimination.My heart goes with our dalit brothers &amp; sisters and glad to hear that their issues are being discussed in silicon valley as well now."</p>

The checkbox hack is decent in a few places (though I’d say &lt;details&gt; is normally a better choice now, and the checkbox hack should be accompanied by certain ARIA properties and augmented with some JavaScript to twiddle properties as it’s used), but dark mode is not one of them. The checkbox hack is only suitable for transient state that you actively don’t want to persist over page loads. Probably the most popular historical application of it is hamburger menus (but &lt;details&gt; or `:hover, :focus-within` are better for that now). I think a more reasonable solution for dark mode is the media query (prefers-color-scheme: dark), following the browser preference by default and augmented by JavaScript to allow overriding that. https://chrismorgan.info/blog/dark-theme-implementation/ describes my own implementation, which is the most comprehensive and efficient client-side-only implementation that I know of, as perfect as it’s possible to be while being client-side-only and without getting into service workers."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"F-droid gets many things right (e.g. verifiable builds), but it&#39;s just not usable in practice.Installing applications is a rare event, updating them is frequent, and needs to disrupt the user as little as possible. Android used to not allow alternative app stores to update apps without user interaction, but now supports this through UPDATE_PACKAGES_WITHOUT_USER_ACTION, which doesn&#39;t seem to be supported by F-droid. So it&#39;s manual clicking for each update.F-droid also somehow gets the regular update flow wrong and often (always?) shows an error when you try to install the update from the notification. That has remained unfixed for years. So you have to manually open it, initiate the update, then click through the dialogs.Additionally, the official repos update so slowly that they&#39;re useless for fast-moving stuff like NewPipe.Together with Android bugs like https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/204233247 (resetting all &#34;open with&#34; URIs on update), this makes using packages installed through F-Droid a nightmare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"App developer&#39;s perspective.  I have a few apps on all major places, including F-Droid.  The &#39;no user accounts&#39; thing makes developing and distributing on F-Droid a freeing experience, as compared to the G/A &#39;jails&#39;.  There is no pressure to meet arbitrary undocumented restrictions, you are not subject to the whims of dehumanizing AI routines, there are no ratings and reviews (the feedback is direct). The build and deployment process is not really my problem, as part of their Reproducible Builds, even that aspect is taken care of. https://f-droid.org/en/docs/Reproducible_Builds/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I tried something like this once and it worked surprisingly well, even for a UGC site.Years back we were doing something that included users documenting TV shows. We had a big meeting where people put every feature they wanted on index cards. We laid the cards out a founder&#39;s dining room table. The host got their change jar and each person got a certain number of pennies to mark features they thought were vital for first launch.After the first round of token-voting, the &#34;user accounts&#34; card had no votes. At first it seemed impossible. But after some discussion, we realized that viewing users didn&#39;t need accounts for launch. For people who wanted to edit, we let them type in a name to take credit for their contributions if they wanted, but with no verification. At worst, we figured we could add something more robust if the need were stronger.It turned out fine. The launch got out earlier and we got to test a number of key product hypotheses without having to build any sort of user account system. Months later it did eventually become the highest priority. But not having accounts worked way longer than I expected."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I follow some of the writings of Nassim Taleb. I came to the conclusion that RISC-V will &#34;succeed&#34; because there&#39;s no way for it to fail. It&#39;s like Linux.I don&#39;t think licensing fees to ARM are a problem per se, it&#39;s the &#34;frictional costs&#34; that it introduces. My understanding is that the Raspberry Pi developed their RP2040 because ARM had a reasonable package available for its low-end Cortex-M processors, which doesn&#39;t apply to their higher-end Cortex ones.RISC-V doesn&#39;t even have these restrictions. Even extremely small outfits can play around with RISC-V designs. Most of them won&#39;t go very far, but with enough lottery tickets, one of them is bound to draw the winning numbers.Sure there are considerable obstacles. I toy with microcontrollers. For hobbyists like me, ARM processors are still the most sensible choice. I&#39;m not expecting any shift from that for at least five years. But who knows after that? Anything can happen."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The real reason RISC-V is succeeding, relative to ARM:If you make your own CPU- With ARM, You have to pay ARM for ISA license (after a several months long negotiation), and you cannot license your CPU design to anyone, as ARM has the exclusive right to do that with their designs.- With RISC-V, you get a free ISA license, and you can license your CPU design to others.If you do not make your own CPU- With ARM, you can (after a several months long negotiation) license one of the few designs ARM has available. There&#39;s no other vendors that can offer you ARM CPU designs.- With RISC-V, right now, you can license any among hundreds of options available, from tens of vendors. The licensing process is usually very short and straightforward. Alternatively, there are some open hardware designs. You can get commercial support for some of them.Frankly, unless ARM does radically change their business model, I do not expect them to survive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work with RISC-V these days.many AI chips are using RISC-V.A non-technical perspective about RISC-V: China is leading to some extent in RISC-V land(Sifive works with Hifive in China, Alibaba released its RISC-V,etc). China could not license x86, could not acquire MIPS, tried to get part of ARM now(the China ARM company is fighting with ARM), but the big land needs to &#34;own&#34; a CPU core at will desperately, RISC-V fits perfectly well."</p>

Vocal Unix proponents tend to believe that anything Unix does is automatically better than Windows, sometimes without even knowing what the Windows analogue is. Programming in both is necessary to have an informed opinion on this subject.The one thing I miss most on Unix: the unified model of HANDLEs that enables you to WaitOnMultipleObjects() with almost any system primitive you could want, such as an event with a socket (blocking I/O + a shutdown notification) in one call. On Unix, a flavor of select() tends to be the base primitive for waiting on things to happen, which means you end up writing adapter code for file descriptors to other resources, or need something like eventfd.Things I don&#39;t miss from Windows at all: wchar_t everywhere. :)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good, this should be standard.I don&#39;t  understand how you can have a labor market where only one side has information on what the salaries are for an industry through a team that does market research. It depresses wages, mostly for internal employees who aren&#39;t paying attention bc they&#39;re content with their jobs.Price transparency leads to more efficient markets, no reason the labor market is any different. A company hiring an employee under market rate, because the employee doesn&#39;t know what market rate is, is a failure.EDIT: Wanted to add that this hits closer to home for me b/c I&#39;ve personally experienced this.Went out and jumped companies and got a 300% raise b/c I was underpaid at the prev, only know that thanks to levels.fyi. New hires at my level were making almost double what I was.When other engineers at my current company talk about salary, or total comp more generally, they vastly underestimate the state of the market."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a candidate, I hate applying to jobs only to get a lowball offer at the end. So I appreciate bills like this.As a hiring manager, I see that this is actually not so simple. You give someone a range, say $100-150k. I ASSURE you that they are thinking they are closer to 150k than 100. So good luck giving an offer for $100k, even though that might be what that particular candidate is worth to you.It&#39;s never gonna happen, but what i&#39;d rather see is an option to instead give current median total comp on the team i&#39;m interviewing for, plus maybe the 25-75 percentile range. That gives me a sense of what I should expect, plus what the salary growth path might be."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"this is one of those ostensibly good ideas that has some downsides which are often not discussed - the main one of which, is salary depression.Forcing employers to publish salaries on job ads will inevitably lead to wide salary bands (lets see how absurd they get) with a low ceiling on the upper tier. Employers know that if they publish a high number, job candidates are naturally going to want to shoot for it, and would be disappointed if they got significantly less than the maximum advertised, compromising offer acceptance rates. Hence employers will set a lower &#39;maximum&#39; salary than they might actually pay if the salary was hidden.See UK public sector for evidence of this; salaries must be published, maximum is always significantly lower than equivalent job in private sector."</p>

The guys are focussing on staying safe, warm, and well stocked right now.&#34; (with a small side of incredulity.)I&#39;ve brought it up with leadership and they are going to parachute in some agencies from other places and I can&#39;t help but feel we are just abandoning my team members. The people I have, on average, spent 5x8hr days working with for the past few years. My comrades. My friends. Just so expendable in the eyes of my employer."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am American, moved to Kyiv almost four years ago.  My startup engineering team is 100% in Ukraine. As the warning signs mounted I urged my people to consider leaving but no one, myself included, thought it would come to this.  Of course no one left.I finally agreed to take a couple of weeks out of Kyiv to calm my cofounder’s nerves, sure that I’d be back and we’d have a laugh at how it all came to nothing. So I am in Tbilisi and my team are all stuck in Ukraine.We’re doing all we can to help   We can’t get the men out because the Ukrainian borders guards won’t let any men leave, and most of the women won’t leave their husbands behind. A few have joined the territorial defense forces and are defending Kyiv now. Many others are taking shelter in basements while the Russians shell their cities.Today, 66% of my 45 person team were online and working. It’s astonishing the grit and commitment the Ukrainians are showing. We’re resolved not to abandon them and to do all we can for them but the shitty reality is that’s just not a whole lot right now.If anyone can fight their way to victory in this war it’s them. I wish the west had done more when there was still time to make a difference, but now it’s up to Ukrainians to save themselves and make the Russian invaders pay for every meter they take."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As if the pointless prodding of “any updates? :)” is ever called for. If there were any updates, there would be fucking updates posted. I frequently get comments like this in projects they I maintain, sometimes less than a day after the issue was opened, and it does nothing but annoy me and make me not want to resolve their issue. Why is there an expectation that maintainers have infinite amounts of time to fix whatever problem you’re having? Extremely frustrating and makes me hate working in open source."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"DIY Perks [1] has a good tutorial on how to make a super bright LED panel from LED strips. Quite easily, actually.Been using one of those in my office for the last eight years or so. I use a server PSU for power.I was surprised to see how bright it is when I once went outside while it was on. Not only was my window the brightest in the entire street by far. But it actually illuminated the trees around my window.If I was to build it again - and especially for a place like living room - , I would build it so as to also simulate sunset. That is to say, that it will automatically lower the brightness and shift to a warmer spectrum in the evening. Otherwise, this thing messes with your biorhythm and gets you out of sync with normal daylight hours very quickly.[1] https://youtu.be/jLia59KfkSw"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I lived in Seattle, my solution was a 2’ square fluorescent panel I got from a gardening supply place called “The Indoor Sun Shop”. I grew up in the South and got real bad seasonal depression up there; it probably saved my life. I paid all of $300 for it. Plus like twenty bucks for a mechanical timer, because I discovered that there were a lot of mornings where I was too depressed and mopey to turn it on myself. I kept it in the home office I worked in and it did a lot to shut up that little voice that suggested killing myself as the solution to every problem."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m from India. Lighting in my middle class house, since forever, has been poor. I never consciously felt it when I was still studying. Just that the rooms were dark and I would prefer to play/study outside, or in the front room, where the door was always open, allowing a lot of sunlight.I realized the lighting factor a few years back. Now, My own home has two lights in every room and whenever I am studying/reading/cooking, I always have them both on.The difference is stark. Perhaps I am clutching my pearls when I say this, but I feel my quality of life has improved with better lighting.I also got my walls painted with very light colors, and the ambient light is just amazing.Good lighting is a blessing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is cool! As someone who&#39;s into fine dining, a few thoughts/tips for people starting out:1. Don&#39;t go into a michelin level restaurant expecting &#34;well it&#39;s expensive so it should be what I normally eat but better&#34;, think of it as its own category of food, that happens to have a really high buy-in price. Lots more crazy flavors, presentation, exotic ingredients, etc. It&#39;s not that it has to be &#39;better&#39; than the best $12 bbq joint you&#39;ve ever been to, just different.2. Many very high end restaurants have great lunch deals, which can really cut the price to try them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m so glad this was a positive story, and I&#39;m so happy for the author! I went into it expecting this restaurant to be mocked, since articles like this are usually played as a joke.No, not everyone can afford to try a Michelin Star restaurant. A lot of Michelin restaurants suck. And you don&#39;t have to pay a ton for a good meal; some of the best food I&#39;ve ever had has cost $10.However, food is right up there with music as something that connects people. A taste or smell can unlock a memory you thought you lost forever, or create new ones you&#39;ll never forget. There&#39;s a reason meals are so prominent in movies and literature. Not everyone is lucky enough to have a good relationship with food (in fact, for many, the connotations can be quite negative), and I&#39;m so happy for this person that she loved it.When done right, nice restaurants are an experience. From start to finish, from the food to the drink to the decor to the people, it&#39;s closer to going to a Broadway play or art museum than it is a normal meal.For people who can afford it readily, the experience is almost lost. It can become a status symbol, where the Instagram story is more important than enjoying it. It was so charming to see this through the eyes of someone who had no pretentious goals going into it, and had a wonderful time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was in Italy with my brother back in 2019, we mostly ate at cheap local spots to keep costs down. But towards the end of the trip, I said lets go get some amazing food, regardless of cost.We walked into this little Italian restaurant, ordered an expensive Merlot and a tomahawk steak to share. First the wine, &#34;holy shit&#34; was the exact words I used when I first tasted it, super smooth, to the point where you couldn&#39;t feel even the smallest bit of sting from the alcohol.Then the steak, the tenderest steak I&#39;ve ever had. You cut of pieces of fat and as soon as you put it in your mouth the thing just melts away.In the end dinner set us back 250 euros, and much like this lady, I walked away going &#34;that was worth every penny&#34;. Food like that isn&#39;t just about the experience, it&#39;s also the memory. That dinner I had is now almost 4 years ago but I still remember the wine and the slightly salted steak kisses fingers like an italian"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I do see a point in it working like it does, though. I&#39;m one of the lead developers on a free software project with over 20 years of history. Even though the project has used multiple version control systems (and hosting providers) over time, we have imported our entire project&#39;s history going back to the very  first commit into git and GitHub.Not every contributor has kept their email address for over 20 years. Some don&#39;t have access to the old addresses they once used for commits. Still they want the commits to be associated with their current GitHub account; even if it&#39;s just for statistics and &#34;bragging rights&#34;.If GitHub required email address verification, how would this be done?EDIT: To be clear: With &#34;working like it does&#34; I&#39;m referring to the possibility to add unverified email addresses to your account and have commits attributed to you."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In spite of GitHub&#39;s claims that nothing wrong, something is wrong and fixable.GitHub should be showing the identity pulled from the e-mail address, and not replacing it with the name of an associated GitHub account. Just like it does when there is no associated GH account.A reasonable compromise would be to show that name, but turn it into a link to the account if there is one. Then only someone curious clicking on &#34;Linus Torvalds&#34; would see: hey, how come this leads to some VanTudor account?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"GitHub’s response is pretty surprising. How can anyone think this is expected? Having to follow Git’s commit message emails makes sense and indeed anybody can use any email they want to make a commit. But then for GitHub to make the connection between (unverified) commit emails and (unverified) GitHub.com accounts is the issue for me. Since they can’t verify the commit email belongs to a GitHub account, why show that as though it were true?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There is an interesting fork of LFS that uses Musl instead of glibc.https://github.com/dslm4515/Musl-LFSI played with it for a while as the base OS for my KVM hypervisor servers.A couple of years ago, I tried to find all the source archives for the old LFS releases. I ended up using the Debian and kernel.org archives to find most of the old package versions. Packages from before 2004 started disappearing like as86 and the PowerPC patches. I was never able to find the PowerPC patches because they were never mirrored on anything but FTP sites. The Internet Archive did not pick up any of those mirrors.
https://archive.org/details/linuxfromscratch-releasesI eventually replaced the Musl-LFS build and replaced it with a buildroot set of configs and scripts when I had issues replicating my work with later package versions. Buildroot allowed me to more rapidly test and deploy my hypervisor config.  I wanted a simple /etc/rc init like what was in SunOS 4, no GRUB, and QEMU with VDE networking.I ended up with SYSLINUX for BIOS MBR and gummiboot(before it was converted into systemd-boot) for EFI because my EFI machine (Dell R810) did not allow for direct booting of EFI binaries."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Appreciate the effort the article author put in, but I&#39;ll be contrarian here (in the hopes of saving people time) and say that I think this is the wrong approach to take to getting hired (the effort:hire ratio is terrible).I don&#39;t know why, whether it&#39;s to be fair or avoid litigation, but in most companies I&#39;ve worked for or interviewed with, the senior engineers, hiring managers, HR, etc. don&#39;t have as much influence over the hiring process as you think. You&#39;ll probably still need to go through 5 stages of interviews, including a white-boarding or a take home test. Otherwise you wouldn&#39;t have all these &#34;rockstar&#34; programmers on Twitter complaining about the interview process. The best that these &#34;influencers&#34; can do for you, is to tip you off to an opening and maybe help towards the end of the interview process.The other issue is, how do you know you&#39;re betting on the right horse? e.g. is the person that you&#39;re getting cozy with really going to help you career? You only have so much time and &#34;connections&#34; to invest.My advice: instead of going to meet ups, take more interviews and improve your interviewing skills. Instead of spending 2-5 hours/week going to meet ups, take 1 interview instead. Even with no preperation, you&#39;ll start to see the pattern in the types of questions people ask. Improve on your answers. Interview again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is probably good general advice for getting comfortable in a crowd and starting conversations, but I doubt such &#34;networking&#34; has as much to do with getting a tech job as people like to think.In my 2+ decades of experience on both sides of tech recruiting, getting your foot in the door is always the easiest part of the process. Apply online at the company&#39;s careers site. Get an existing employee to refer you (literally anyone will be more than happy to do so for the bonus). Message a recruiter on LinkedIn. All of these will get you at least a screening call. From then on 100% of your hiring chances are dependent on your resume and interview performance."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It’s clear to me that the author is introverted as in shy, not introverted as in neurodivergent; there are so many “why don’t you just ____?” and maybe there’s an audience who hasn’t tried that and would adjust well to the advice, but I’m definitely not in that audience.My advice to anyone who feels the same way: let yourself shine, make the social connections that feel comfortable for you, and… hopefully you’ll have the same privilege I have in being able to stand out just by being your awesome self. The job market is competing for you, not the other way around."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once was part of a now-defunct reading forum in my teens.On the forum, people would package three related books into quests. A boring example would be a dystopian quest pack with three books about three very different dystopian scenarios.But the quests people put together were usually more interesting. I remember a &#34;Weird Magic&#34; quest had books with really unconventional magic systems. I found Motherless Brooklyn (detective with Tourette&#39;s) in a quest pack of &#34;heroes with issues&#34;. Other quest ideas would be evil protagonists, alien first-contact with the wrong guy, and stuff like that. You can often find three books for even the goofiest of quests.It was a cool way to find new books. And whenever you didn&#39;t know what to read next, you&#39;d look at what quests you were still working on and choose among them. Once finished, your completed quest count would increase.Long append-only lists of genre-related books were never as interesting to me. Quests only having three books made them a fun thing to collect. Maybe there&#39;s something fun there that new goodreads competitors can experiment with."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great but I&#39;m not going to sign up just to see what the site looks like. There&#39;s no reason for a large part of the functionality (book info, ratings, reviews) to be behind a login wall. As it stands right now Goodreads is a lot more open."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very interesting... some feedback.So I search for &#34;Proust&#34;, and the top 8 results are not Proust. Since Proust has one extremely famous book, I thought it would show up, rather than a bunch of different commentary on Proust.So I finally find the page for In Search Of Lost Time. However, it says none of my friends have read it. Well, of course not - I don&#39;t have any Booqsi friends yet. So, there&#39;s just nothing I can do on this page.Next I looked for The Power And The Glory. At least this page has a summary of the book. But, also none of my friends read it, and there&#39;s nothing I can do here.Next, Consilience. Same thing. Basically I search for a book, I get maybe nothing, maybe a summary, and then there&#39;s nothing else I can do on that page.So, I want to like this site, but I&#39;m just finding nothing I can do here.Personally, I love books but I hate Goodreads. I just don&#39;t care that a hundred thousand random people prefer The Twilight Saga Complete Collection to The Death of Ivan Ilych.I would be really interested to read a well-written paragraph that said, hey, if you like Nabokov and Borges, then you might like this other author. That sort of recommendation is what I occasionally get from reading blogs or tweets from people with a similar literary taste to mine, and it&#39;s very useful, I find most books through some sort of recommendation.Goodreads has this mistaken idea that I care about the average person&#39;s opinion of a book. A book is not a can opener. Everyone wants to open a can, everyone opens cans in the same way, everyone appreciates a can opener that successfully opens cans.Anyway, I hope you do succeed in building a Goodreads alternative, because I would love to spend more time reading about books, reading good books, discussing books, and Goodreads is just not providing that experience."</p>

Or change all color definitions in the terminal to print the same color?&gt; The terminal is capable of color and should be able to print color when instructed. NO_COLOR is a hint to the software running in the terminal to suppress addition of color, not to the terminal to prevent any color from being shown.I have to admit I don&#39;t really get this. I personally like colorized output, and I can&#39;t even think of situations where the colors chosen by a developer were so bad I wanted to disable them completely.I respect others like no color (and there&#39;s already a solution per that, above), but I don&#39;t quite get the desire to have just some color (prompts but not applications). Can someone with this opinion explain their rationale?Normally I wouldn&#39;t care,
 -- individual preferences are like opinions and everyone is entitled to their own -- but this imposes work on every developer/application.  There&#39;s certainly ways to implement this that minimize impact, but it&#39;s still a non-zero up-front and ongoing maintenance/testing cost."</p>

The book helped me build a strong foundation in systems; Processes, memory, filesystems, networks, concurrency, synchronization and more. After reading OSTEP, it felt like an epiphany, and I charted a path for the rest of 2 years of college around distributed systems, systems research, and virtualization.And the best part is that all this knowledge is free!

								<p class="story__comment_others">"SICP for CS and programming. That book (and its exercises) really instilled in me the thought patterns that drastically improved my programming skills and made me realize how important fundamental CS knowledge is to being a good programmer. What I learned from that book was: becoming comfortable with recursion, realizing the importance of abstractions, functional programming concepts and it gave me insights into how interpreters and the machine work.I studied math in university and the book that really improved me mathematically was baby rudin. I really struggled with this the first time I worked through it and had to also fall back on Abott&#39;s analysis book, but after my first analysis course I worked through Rudin again and it just clicked. The exercises are really well chosen and the text is just so on point. Every sentence in the book is extremely carefully chosen and of fundamental importance to what Rudin wants to teach you.It&#39;s really rare that you find textbooks that almost kind of have a certain magic to them, like you are directly taught by one of the greatest minds in that field. These two books definitely meet that criteria."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Code, by Charles Petzold. It came to me at exactly the right time, and broke through the biggest conceptual barrier I’d had until that point; how do you actually go from logic gates to general purpose computing? Having Petzold walk you up the ladder of abstraction, never missing a link, really got me over the hump of treating all that complexity as a black box. On a meta level it gave me confidence to go approach apparently impossible things with an open mind and dig deep enough that you see how the “magic” works."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As much as I enjoy reading this news. It is feels heavily sensationalized.&#34;Smashes&#34; the energy record.We&#39;re talking about a fusion generator here, that after 25 years of work, now manages to output &#39;double&#39; the energy, to 59 MJ in 5s -like 20 MW- while requiring 180 MJ input power.Somewhere hidden in the article is the news that this could mean a input/output ratio of 10 in a full scale reactor, but that&#39;s also something we&#39;ve been waiting on for decades.I find it easy to be enthusiastic about fusion, but the news and research surrounding it makes me sad."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Excellent news, we need this so badly, especially now in Europe with Germany shutting down its nuclear (fission) plants and NS2 being cancelled. It&#39;s astonishing to me that the world isn&#39;t pulling out all the stops on fusion development, something like the space race or Manhattan project.Unfortunately, last I heard ITER building has halted: http://news.newenergytimes.net/2022/02/21/french-regulator-h..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Project Oberon is awesome!I found the Project Oberon book in SFSU library and read it cover to cover.  Such a tight, elegant system.  Pretty much complete: Oberon OS includes compiler for Oberon language!Language was self-hosted (compiler written in itself) and Prof. Wirth had a heuristic: no feature could be added to the lang/compiler if it made compiling the compiler slower.There are several emulators, in C, JS, Java, and Python, and there&#39;s Verilog so you can burn to FPGA and make a real workstation.  People have.The system has two kinds of OOP.  There is the C++/Java/Python/etc. kind where you basically add methods to a record type, and there is the old school Smalltalk message-passing kind, where elements of the OS communicate through an extendable message bus.The GUI system, especially with the &#34;Gadgets&#34; subsystem, is mind-blowing.  It would take too long to go over it at the moment, but there are features there that still haven&#39;t made it into mainstream GUI systems.  If I get a minute later today I&#39;ll come back and add a note detailing some of the awesome if someone else hasn&#39;t already filled in the picture."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Oberon channel has several videos of Oberon in action,https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=The+Oberon+Chan...While Oberon was quite cool, people should also learn about its Xerox influence,&#34;Eric Bier Demonstrates Cedar&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_dt7NG38V4Also dive into what happened afterwards, Oberon-2, Active Oberon, Zonnon,...Active Oberon could be considered quite modern, also makes the distinction between safe and unsafe pointers, which improves the experience for low level coding.https://github.com/metacore/A2OSOne of the best things about these systems is proving what systems programming with automatic memory management were capable of.Given Oberon-2&#39;s influence on Go, maybe improving Fyne (https://fyne.io/fynedesk/) with something like gRPC for the dynamic experience, could be a possible sucessor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This project is still a great example of a complete computer design, starting from Niklaus Wirth&#39;s own RISC5 CPU (not a RISC-V) and very simple peripherals over the OS, runtime/garbage collector, compiler, GUI and simple example applications.One problem of the original implementation is that it was based on an old Xilinx Spartan 3 development board. This is not only no longer available, but it is one of the few FPGA boards that used 32 bit wide fast (12 ns IIRC) asynchronous SRAM chips. Wirth&#39;s hardware design relies heavily on this.Some years ago, there was a compatible board, the OberonStation. However, it seems this is no longer manufactured: https://pcper.com/2015/12/meet-the-oberonstation-kid-friendl...However, some modified designs exist that implement a cache in FPGA block RAM and an SDRAM controller. These can be used with more recent FPGA boards:- FleaFPGA &#34;Ohm&#34; board with a Lattice ECP5  FPGA and 32 MB RAM (https://fleasystems.com/fleaFPGA_Ohm.html) - https://github.com/Basman74/Oberon_SDRAM- Radiona ulx3s, another ECP5 in an open source design  (https://github.com/emard/oberon) - https://github.com/emard/oberon- PapilioPro using a Xilinx Spartan 6 LX, another open source PCB design (https://papilio.cc/index.php?n=Papilio.PapilioPro) - https://opencores.org/projects/oberon_sdramShameless plug: my student Rikke&#39;s port of Project Oberon to RV32I (this is a real RISC-V), however, we still need to find some time to build an FPGA-based SoC. Currently, it runs in emulation: https://github.com/solbjorg/oberon-riscv"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Context on what I believe they mean by &#34;fraudulent&#34;.Steam back in the day used to accept 0 confirmation bitcoin spends. This means that the transaction has been gossiped on the bitcoin p2p network but had not yet been mined into a block and thus had minimal finality guarantees. Steam could see that they were going to receive a bitcoin payment (when the transaction was mined into a block) and would credit the users account instantly for a better purchase UX.Turns out anyone with some deeper understanding of bitcoin could construct another transaction spending the same bitcoin back to themselves before their original transaction was ever put in a block. The bitcoin community moved away from accepting &#39;0 conf&#39; transactions pretty much everywhere because of this reason.In fact the high fee era (2016-2018) saw many wallets incorporating this &#34;double spend&#34; feature into their wallets. This is known as RBF, &#34;replace by fee&#34; and is really useful when you need to bump your transaction up the queue. You replace your old transaction, that is waiting to be mined, with a new one that offers a higher fee to incentivize miners to add it to a new block.I think its rather unfortunate that 0 conf transactions were written off so quickly. There are many context where a 0conf tx makes sense, mostly IRL. But, if you are running a business online and you don&#39;t trust you customers you should wait 3-6 blocks after the transaction has been mined before delivering your goods."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately no details were given about what makes 50% of all bitcoin transactions “fraudulent” ?What does that even mean?* did someone try to send something other then bitcoin to a ₿ address?* did a client claim he payed and did the payment seem to fail on his end?* did a client not realise that you as payee also pay for the network fee?Nowadays these kind of problems would be easily prevented by using bitcoin lightning payments, because they work in a fraction of a second and specify the exact amount that has to be payed.
Also they are almost free of transaction costs."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be a basic misunderstanding on the part of the pro-btc ppl here all saying &#34;how is that fraud?&#34; or &#34;how is that steams problem?&#34;If you run a business that can be used in a money laundering scheme, even if you are not a victim, you have a legal responsibility to try to limit/prevent that actually.The crypto crowd may not like that, but it&#39;s not up to them."</p>

Doing it downhole at the end of a long pipe string is going to be much harder than doing it in a factory. So why isn&#39;t this an industrial machining process already, like plasma cutting?GA Drilling was pushing plasma drilling back in 2018.[2] They&#39;re still pushing it, but not making holes.The University of Minnesota was pushing electro-pulse boring in 2015.[3] Again, no deep holes.There&#39;s something called ThermoDrilling, which, despite the name, is more like a water jet cutter.[4]Successful projects are still using mechanical drilling.[5]So there are a lot of deep hole drilling approaches being studied. Anything that works would be used by the oil and gas industry, and if they&#39;re not trying it, one suspects it might not be working.[1] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/270653673_Microwave...[2] https://www.gadrilling.com/[3] https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/electro-pulse-boring...[4] https://www.geodrillinginternational.com/deep-geothermal/new...[5] https://geothermalengineering.co.uk/united-downs/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something I&#39;ve always wondered.Wouldn&#39;t massive scale geothermal end up pumping more heat into the atmosphere that otherwise wouldn&#39;t be there?In contrast, the energy collected by solar and wind generators is from the energy added to Earth by the sun and would be energy in our atmosphere regardless of whether  or not we collect it.But it seems like the heat inside the Earth&#39;s core should be fairly well insulated by the lithosphere, and it only slowly leaks out over time. If we start pulling that energy out at a faster rate to generate electricity, could that have a noticeable net increase on total energy under the atmosphere, or is it such an insignificant amount of energy relative to the sun&#39;s to not even bother worrying about?"</p>

My FB wall is full of people providing their apartments for free, giving jobs etc. There is over 100 cars long queue at a border willing to transport Ukrainians escaping war where they want. They can travel by train for free in Poland.Now not so good tidbit. Just few months ago we had a lot of people lured into Belarus by Lukashenko trying to come to Europe. Poland treated them really really poorly. Catching them after crossing border and pushing them back. The society was split among pro-refugees and anti.

Lots of people from all over eastern Europe live here, lots of companies here outsource all over eastern Europe, lots of people that I know either come from or have friends/family from the Ukraine. Also, about 200k people of Russian origin live here that chose to move here after the wall fell. And I assume quite a few Ukranians.I remember meeting refugees from the former Yugoslavia in the nineties. I think 25 years later, a lot of those people did pretty well. I actually visited Bosnia for work last summer and met a guy that went to school in Munich. Likewise a lot of Syrian refugees that ended up in Germany seem to be doing OK. Quite a few ended up here in Berlin. In times of war, people are generally grateful if you accommodate them; even if it isn&#39;t always with open arms.It&#39;s usually the smart, free thinkers that need to flee. Incidentally those are also people likely to find a way to make it in life; start businesses; or otherwise be generally successful.The US is full of such people that emigrated there after various wars in the last century.

It would also help China court any country with uneasy relations with America looking for alternatives.I would imagine there are additional politics in play with disabling SWIFT. I dont how many countries will need to agree before shutting down SWIFT access, if it is at the will of US it would be more like a semi-nuclear option.Although I am already surprised by CIPS, one eighth of transaction volume of SWIFT is not &#34;well behind&#34;. From many POV this already seems like a battle the west are clearly losing."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Why the West is reluctant to deny Russian banks access to SWIFT&#34;Because Europe is dependent on Russian gas (thanks to an ill thought out denuclearization drive), and both Europe and US governments prefer their economic and electoral interests over Ukraine or the international order. The rest of the article are really silly excuses (Russia is a relatively small economy and can&#39;t meaningfully hurt the dollar etc.)."</p>

That&#39;s what happened in East Aleppo (with the help of the Russian airforce), that&#39;s what happened in Jobar, too. Not sure if the flattening of Kyiv would be the best thing for the Ukranian people going forward.[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x9ZXPhmR7lQ"</p>

I guess it&#39;s self-evident, but not having thought about the topic, the utility of rubble and repurposing semi-destroyed structures, as well as how important snipers are, were new to me. Maybe the importance of snipers makes civilians being handed out guns in Kyiv now seem less futile.Would be interested to read a basic explainer along these lines on &#34;How to Rebuild a City&#34; -- I guess one divergence from urban planning/development literature would be on how to reuse rubble? Given the many destroyed cities through history including this century which have been at least partially reubilt (perhaps Grozny was first of this century?) I guess there must be plenty written on this topic."</p>

						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=30467597">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of discussion on this last time it came up:https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=22341983"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Author here, didn’t expect to see this here again after two years!I guess I’ll give a quick update on how things have been since this article was written. I haven’t used or studied French much since then, and have gotten quite rusty, though I’ve had a few conversations fully in French in the last few months and can still maintain a conversation. I have been thinking of picking up French again soon, as traveling to a French speaking country becomes more of an option.I also did roughly the same thing with my Spanish in the following year, with similar results, though I’d say I probably reached a solid B1.5 or weak B2 after a year (due to COVID I was unable to take the proficiency test and lost some motivation to continue studying to a high level as a result.)My recommendations are still largely the same, though I haven’t used these resources (e.g. Duolingo) since I stopped studying a while back. And as others have noted, for other languages, particularly those that are less closely related to English (e.g. Japanese), you’ll have to follow a different path to achieve the same proficiency. However, language learning resources are getting better constantly, so you can certainly still learn quite a lot without total, in-person immersion, as I did!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I learned Spanish, too, in about 12 months to dogfood my new app for learning vocabulary (which I just recently launched) [0]Even though I made an app that helped me along the way to learn words, I don&#39;t believe in a single app/book/approach for learning a language. You need to expose yourself to A LOT of different language materials.I was learning for about 2h a day, 6 times a week. I would read articles, books, websites in Spanish. I would watch YouTube videos [1]. I would read news, initially for beginners [2] and later regular [3]. And most importantly, I would have 4-5h a week itakly conversations.After 6 months I understood quite a lot, but couldn&#39;t speak almost at all. Then magic happens and 6 months later, I was having a normal conversation (though still with some errors) about any range of topics: politics, global warming, travel, engineering etc.I believe the key for me was to read a lot of books which were interesting to me. For example I read Bill Gate&#39;s book &#34;How To Avoid A Climate Disaster&#34; in Spanish, as well as about ~8 others in the first 12 months.[0] https://www.obstino.com[1] https://www.youtube.com/c/DreamingSpanish[2] www.newsinslowspanish.com[3] https://elpais.com"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I often wonder how money is stored.It can&#39;t be just a number on a computer in a bank, right? Otherwise some Russian bank could just increase that number to whatever they like. And say &#34;Look, we own 100 Trillion USD. Now let&#39;s go shopping.&#34;.So I guess USD needs to be recognized by the US somehow?Could the US simply &#34;void&#34; all USD that are owned by Russia?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;Russia has also been building an in-house system since 2014—the last time SWIFT cutoff was threatened—which may mean they are able to temper some of the impact a cutoff would have on its economy.If they&#39;re building a replacement, doesn&#39;t that also mean we should use &#34;cut off SWIFT&#34; now, rather than later when it&#39;ll be ineffective?"</p>

On French keyboards, typing a number requires the use of the SHIFT key. So I regularly need to change my keyboard layout just to type a couple numbers in a form field because someone thought they&#39;d be smart..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree with the author that custom components don’t capture all the interaction details. Many times they are not accessible or cannot implement cross-platform input well.However, I disagree with:&gt; The browser’s built-in controls are quite sufficient.The problem is that browser components are good for simple forms but insufficient for other types of interaction.A good example is select. Using the select tag is the best way to have a dropdown list that’s accessible and supports mobile. But, select doesn’t cover most of the cases that you need for a complex app.Many of the WAI ARIA authoring examples  (including the combobox patterns) are not covered by built in components. Interaction patterns like pop ups, dialogs, or lookup lists are quite common for an app… but hard to do in an accessible/cross-platform way.Web browsers need to do something different to support accessible/usable apps. The idea of leaving all those things to WebComponents makes sense, but the result is reinventing the broken wheel on each app."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a huge AMD fan but this is bonkers.Yes, Intel has floundered for a number of years, but at the same time they are a foundry themselves, second only to TSMC (for now), have incredible manufacturing capacity, and seem poised to start pushing interesting CPU designs as well as having their foundry half finally start executing correctly. Also their growth potential for their GPU business is huuuuuuge.As someone who enjoys AMD for the competition they bring, I am worried what the next few years might look like for them for the following reasons:1. AMD GPUs were actually very competitive with their RDNA2 architecture, but at the same time AMD enjoyed a huge silicon advantage as they were on TSMC while NVIDIA was on Samsung (for consumer). The next generation of NVIDIA consumer GPUs will be made by TSMC and if their professional GPUs (see A100 which are made by TSMC) are any indication we can see potentially up to 1.5x to 2x efficiency bump for NVIDIA.2. Intel seems to be cleaning up shop and their latest generation of CPUs feel like a 1st Gen Ryzen moment. Also, Intel does not have to clearly surpass AMD, they just need to be competitive as they can simply out produce AMD given AMDs relatively small allocation at TSMC.3. Intel GPUs pose a moderate threat on the horizon for AMD for both low end and portables and at the same time they are eating up available capacity at TSMC."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just want to clear things up.The reason why AMD is suddenly catching up to Intel in valuation is because of the confirmation / success acquisition of Xilinx. Which triggered the conversion of 250M Xilinx shares to new AMD shares. Adding roughly $40B to its market cap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Something that has gone unmentioned in these comments: Intel has a lot more debt than AMD (38B vs 661M on 12/31). That does affect their comparative market cap by, you know, roughly 37 billion dollars. (give or take some amount related to their credit rating and the very low cost of money right now, I would think, and if you want something to argue about there&#39;s always the fact that Intel has an even better credit rating than AMD...)Intel has much, much more income than AMD and they&#39;re valued similarly by the market and... that is not a mystery.https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/INTC/financials?p=INTChttps://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMD/financials?p=AMD"</p>

The FCC has also allocated the 3.7GHz-3.98GHz band to 5G. It turns out that the radar altimeters, as manufactured, use spectrum outside their allocated band, down to and including part of the 3.7GHz-3.98GHz 5G band.Am I missing something?If a rancher buys a plot of land from 34.42°N to 34.44°N to graze his cattle on, but in actual fact grazes his cattle all the way from 34.37°N to 34.47°N. Then a farmer buys a plot of land from 34.37°N to 34.398°N to grow wheat on. Does the rancher still get to herd his cattle down to 34.39°N to feed his cattle? The cattle have to eat, after all, and cutting down the grazing land by 30% could cause some cattle to starve to death. And the rancher has a vested financial interest in ensuring his cattle are well fed, and that wheat is good eating. And the rancher has always been grazing his cattle there, what right does the farmer have to till the soil on the racher&#39;s grazing land? And we, the American public, have the right to buy beef. Why should the farmer purchasing 34.37°N to 34.398°N interfere with my ability to buy a steak?Does any of this make any sense to anyone?Unless there&#39;s additional information I&#39;m unaware of, it seems as if the design and/or manufacture of the radar altimeter is not fit for purpose. Using 3.7GHz to 3.98GHz for 5G doesn&#39;t break the radar altimeters; the radar altimeters are already broken and must be fixed or grounded, because the equipment is broken and unsafe.If 5G equipment is emitting outside of its allocated 3.7-3.98GHz spectrum then the FCC needs to drop a brick on that of course."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don’t know much about aviation or electrical engineering, and I’m wondering if anyone could help me understand something.It seems like the telecom and aviation industries (along with the FCC and FAA) disagree on a question of fact: does 5G equipment interfere with radio altimeters?There’s a way that the FAA could convince me, and probably all the politicians. Shoot a video with a radio altimeter and some 5G equipment where the radio altimeter malfunctions. Put it on YouTube. Do a press release.This seems like an obvious step if the underlying issue exists. Any reason they haven’t done this?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, this along with potential interference problems in weather radar [0], it&#39;s obvious the FCC bungled allocating the 5G spectrum.

What happens when 2 captured regulators collide?Edit: added spacing and changed &#34;radio&#34; to &#34;radar&#34; for clarity[0] https://www.npr.org/2019/07/02/737919100/forecasters-caution..."</p>

					<h3><a href="https://www.reuters.com/breakingviews/ukraine-war-flashes-neon-warning-lights-chips-2022-02-24/">Ukraine is a major producer of neon gas, critical for lasers used in chipmaking</a></h3>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve found the reason (I think) 90% of the world&#39;s semiconductor-grade neon production is concentrated in one country. Per this German government whitepaper about the noble gas industry: the USSR massively overinvested in neon capacity in the 1980&#39;s, in order to build space-based excimer laser weapons. Ukraine&#39;s extant plants date (probably) to the 1980&#39;s; they&#39;re responsible for a global oversupply that&#39;s persisted since the Cold War.- &#34;Neon was regarded as a strategic resource in the former Soviet Union, because it was believed to be required for the intended production of laser weapons for missile and satellite defence purposes in the 1980s. Accordingly, all major air separation units in the Soviet Union were equipped with neon, but also krypton and xenon, enrichment facilities or, in some cases, purification plants (cf. Sections  5.4 and 5.5). The domestic Soviet supply of neon was extremely large but demand low.&#34;- &#34;Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, global crude neon production was approximately 500–600  million  l/a  (=  500,000–600,000 m3/a).  It  was dominated by far by large-scale air separation units associated with metallurgical combines in Russia and Ukraine. Simultaneously, demand was estimated at around 300 million l/a (cf. Section 4.2). In the years between 1990 and 2012, therefore,  most crude  neon was not  purified, but  released into the atmosphere, because there was no customer base.&#34;https://www.deutsche-rohstoffagentur.de/DE/Gemeinsames/Produ... (chapter 5.2)For context, this would have overlapped with Energia/Buran&#39;s launch of the Polyus weapon (which was a megawatt CO2 laser).https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyus_(spacecraft)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"How is neon extracted and why does one country have a 90% monopoly (in this specific grade)?edit: Found this C&amp;EN story from 2016 that adds context:- &#34;Chip makers, which account for more than 90% of global neon consumption, are already experiencing high prices and some shortages stemming from the Russian conflict with Ukraine, Shon-Roy says. The war, which started in 2014, interrupted global supplies of the gas, about 70% of which comes from Iceblick, a firm based in the Ukrainian city of Odessa.&#34;- &#34;Iceblick gathers and purifies neon from large cryogenic air separation units that supply oxygen and nitrogen to steelmakers. Most of the air separation units equipped to capture neon, which makes up only 18.2 ppm of the atmosphere by volume, are in Eastern Europe.&#34;https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/cen-09410-notw7This is puzzling to me, because I don&#39;t get why air separation should naturally concentrate in exactly one place. It&#39;s not tied to a rare and localized geologic formation, like helium sort-of is.Also there&#39;s cryogenic air separation plants all over the planet, why don&#39;t they do neon too? (Asking in the spirit of curiosity)edit #2: I&#39;ve just found something that offers a possible explanation and it&#39;s far more interesting than I expected:- &#34;Neon was regarded as a strategic resource in the former Soviet Union, because it was believed to be required for the intended production of laser weapons for missile and satellite defence purposes in the 1980s. Accordingly, all major air separation units in the Soviet Union were equipped with neon, but also krypton and xenon, enrichment facilities or, in some cases, purification plants (cf. Sections  5.4 and 5.5). The domestic Soviet supply of neon was extremely large but demand low.&#34;https://www.deutsche-rohstoffagentur.de/DE/Gemeinsames/Produ...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"We should be talking about grain, not gas.Russia is the biggest exporter of wheat in the world with 18%. Ukraine accounts for 7% of the world&#39;s wheat.https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2022/2/17/infographic-russia-...This conflict will affect 1/4 of the world&#39;s wheat which will affect food prices.In 2010 Russia stopped exporting wheat due to wildfires burning their fields (most likely caused by climate change). This caused a hike in food prices which helped trigger the Arab revolutions in 2011.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Russian_wildfires"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m in downtown Kharkiv, Ukraine right now (SaaS founder born in Canada). Woke up to explosions at 5 AM this morning. At 12PM still some explosions, can feel the ground shaking, but the streets are mostly calm. Went out to buy some groceries, long lines, but everything still works. Police cars are out patrolling in full force, but no signs of unrest. Church bells tolling nonstop. TransferWise is limited to $200 USD transfers but it worked -- Apple Pay worked at the grocery store. Obviously internet and electricity is still up for now, but water pipes have been shut off in many of my friend&#39;s places."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From a philosophical stance, this is history repeating for the same basic reason. 2022 AD and risk of war is still the same as it was in 1022 AD, or 22 AD. That reason is the accumulation of power (or by proxy, wealth) in a small set of individuals, or in this case one person. No realtime access to information changes this; it just makes the story of the horror unfold faster.Persisting with the concentration of power in individuals has shown throughout history to have dire consequence. We continue risking civilization on the mental health of those who already show significant issues with their obsessive clammer for power. The cult of the leader is toxic and, as far as I can see, illogical and lacking evidence for benefit.Where are the voices that seek a structured shift away from personality cult politics? The innovation we all need for the future are those voices."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was during an online rapid tournament. So still very impressive, but Magnus loses games online all the time and I&#39;m not _quite_ sure why this is news.It is interesting which junior players Magnus invited to the tournament, though - besides Praggnanandhaa, there&#39;s also Andrey Esipenko, who _did_ beat Magnus in a classical game once at the prestigious Tata Steel Masters 2021, and also Nodirbek Abdusattorov, who beat Magnus late last year en route to becoming the World Rapid Champion at 17 years old. A fun group! With Vincent Keymer in the mix too, you&#39;re only really missing Nihal Sarin and (of course) Firouzja for many of the future faces of chess.[Edit: the article says that Praggnanandhaa is the youngest player ever to beat Magnus since 2013, which would definitely be newsworthy. I think the article must be leaving out important context, since this tournament is (1) online, (2) speed chess and (3) not FIDE rated, so it typically wouldn&#39;t be included in records, and Magnus has almost certainly lost random online games to younger players before. I&#39;m guessing the article is referencing some other source without providing the relevant criteria, which is why it looked a little weird to me.]"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is noted in another comment, but it should be a top level comment... Magnus actively has COVID and has said that it was affecting his energy levels and ability to calculate during the early rounds of the tournament (during which this game happened).And Pragg wasn&#39;t even the lowest rated player to beat Magnus this tournament! Eric Hansen, aka popular chess streamer &#34;chessbrah&#34;, is even lower rated and also beat Magnus, which again you would not expect if Magnus were playing his usual level.So still a great win and great accomplishment for Pragg, but a little context would have been nice in the article."</p>

Looks like, all people who got to government or state organizations, work on classical totalitarian scheme - &#34;for friends all the best, for all others - severity of the law&#34;.
Mean, system is so much disbalanced, that any government got totalitarian power and does not account on people. And laws are created, to make all people offenders, and with very wide possibilities of interpretation, so state officials and their friends become above law.If you really want to help Ukraine, better to contact volunteers-entrepreneurs, who where on Maidan, and who struggle for economic freedoms, and support Ukrainian army as private persons, without government/state.You could just donate, or you could create some business opportunity, so Ukrainians will make business, export working hours, or export some products to world.Business opportunities much better, because Ukraine now have critically huge dependence on Russian market, close to 50% of all trade, need much-much more export to world.Thank You!"</p>
