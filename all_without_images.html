								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Recently a Chinese media interviewed me and I talked about a few side projects I have done in the past. I talked about the Neuralrad Mammo Screening project and Neuralrad multiple brain mets SRS platform. More awareness on radiation therapy to the general public will greatly help the community and we believe Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) will eventually replace majority of the whole brain radiation therapy (WBRT) in the next five years.Here is the link to the original article:

								<p class="story__comment_others">"In the UK the NHS don&#39;t do screening for breast cancer for under 50s because it&#39;s believed that it would do more harm than good by leading to unnecessary treatment for cancers that would never have actually caused any harm, and even where no treatment is carried out it causes great distress. Though there are arguments that the age cut off is too high, and should be set at 40.The above is with regard to a well-funded and regulated screening program that presumably has much better precision/recall than this website. I wonder what the cut off age is for this website before the diagnoses cause more harm than good? 60? 70?This is getting lots of upvotes because it&#39;s confirmation bias for the large segment of HN readers who believe that problems would easily be solved by a small number of brilliant technologists, if only it weren&#39;t for governments and big organisations with all their rules and regulations."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Very important caveat for all of you who are thinking, “woo hoo, no need to buy that EuRail pass! Or to buy an expensive ICE ticket!”These tickets are good for all “Nah- und Regionalverkehr,” explicitly excluding ICE, IC, EC (international) and long-distance busses (like the one between Munich and Zürich)If the train number begins with RE or RB, you’re good, but of course, those are the slow ones that stop in every village along the way.This is for the benefit of people who live here and are struggling with 2 EUR/liter fuel, not the kind of people who blithely paid 60 EUR to take the ICE. There does not appear to be any residency requirement, but remember, you’re not the target market for this (unless you live here and are struggling with fuel prices…)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I would argue making it free and keeping it free would have been a cool move.
- Less/no expensive accounting
- Less/no personnel for checking tickets
- Less/no personnel for prosecuting people who don&#39;t have tickets
- Less/no ticket vending machines (and all the maintenance that comes with it)
- Less traffic on the roads since you can&#39;t beat &#34;free&#34; and hence less emissions (at least in hamburg trains operate on green energy) and less wear on the roads (might be offset by the wear on trains and busses)
- Fully non-discriminant with respect to incomeI have no idea if that would work for inter-city transport but for inner-city transport the HVV for example (the public transportation network responsible for hamburg and surrounding areas) sells 30 million tickets a year and I wonder how much it truly costs them to do that with all the relevant factors mentioned above."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Some context is given here: https://www.dw.com/en/germany-introduces-9-ticket-to-offset-...The ticket is part of a support package signed off by the German parliament. The will pay approximately €2.5 billion for the ticket offer, as a response to rising energy prices and the resulting high costs of individual mobility."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nice! A welcome addition!Too bad they&#39;re not using KaTeX [0] instead.It renders the maths server-side, so there&#39;s no runtime needed.An additional bonus is that the resulting math is copy-pasteable, which in the case of disply math might not be that useful (since most equations are to complex to be meaningfully copy-pasted with unicode), but it helps from inline math dissappearing when copy pasting texts.But, that being said, I&#39;m sure they had their reasons to do so. For one, MathJax seems more well-known by quite a bit so maybe it&#39;s the safer option.1: https://katex.org/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s really sad that PBS ended their sister series on math, Infinite Series[1]. Those videos were just as deep, informative, and accessible as PBS Spacetime. Some of my favorites are the one on the mathematical &#34;hydra&#34;[2] and the ones on voting systems [3][4][1]: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCs4aHmggTfFrpkPcWSaBN9g[2]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWwUpEY4c8o[3]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HoAnYQZrNrQ[4]: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AhVR7gFMKNg"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A channel worth subscribing. Matt (and team?) manages successfully to walk the fine line between managing the complexity of the topics they discuss (which are sometimes extremely dense), making it consumable for the population that&#39;s interested in science and physics, but doesn&#39;t pursue it on a daily basis. At the same time, they don&#39;t fall for the trap of dumbing it down to the point where the audience develops misconceptions and starts believing in pseudo scientific claims.There are some series they sometimes do, which are entertaining to follow. I also enjoy things like Journal club, where they pick a paper and deep dive into it. The audience also participates, in a way, where they pick the questions/comments from the previous video and answer them.However, it&#39;s not all academic either. There are some running jokes etc, which keep the content entertaining, while being informative, a format that I see common in some of the best Youtube channels."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"A lot hinges on the dating of this site. How was it done?According to this article[1] (which has a nice wide-angle view of t-pillars in context), it was radiocarbon dating[1]. You find bits of stuff at the site and the isotopic composition of the carbon-containing material tells you the age based on known rates of carbon-14 decay.The actual isotopic analysis seems pretty solid.The problem is that this isn&#39;t any ordinary site. The article notes that the site appears to have been deliberately buried. This raises the question of where the samples that were dated actually came from.This critical review suggests major problems with the older-than-everything-else hypothesis for the site.[2] It notes that at least some of the samples were dated from &#34;fill,&#34; or the stuff that was used by someone at some point to bury the site. And that stuff could have itself come from sites much older than Gobeklitepe:&gt; We already discussed the problem with dating “fills” as opposed to dating “structures”. A fill’s date (no matter how confident we may fill about its actual date) in no way dates structures, as it simply can be coming from soil deposits that are either older or younger than the structure itself. You can fill your home with dirt from your yard, which could be from various geologic strata, some containing fossils from the Pleistocene. This will not make your home a Pleistocene Epoch home. Or you can currently fill a 4th century BC Temple with soil from riverbanks containing live exoskeletons; this will not render the Temple a 2000 AD structure.Even if the site wasn&#39;t deliberately buried, everything hinges on where the fill came from. The base assumption of radiocarbon dating is that no foreign material was brought in. The shakier that assumption, the shakier the claim to the ages being quoted.[1] https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14487942[2] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317433791_Dating_Go..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"City noise pollution is a factor in all-cause mortality due to
long-term, barely perceptible stress effects on the cardiovascular
system. Unfortunately, one of the most disturbing and frequency sources
of city noise pollution is from emergency vehicle sirens.I gave a presentation at the Audio Engineering Society titled
&#34;Iatrogenic Sound&#34;, on the tragic irony of how sirens may causally
contribute to the heart attacks and strokes that ambulances are
rushing to treat.We were exploring the acoustics of urban design and the sound-design
of sirens. The sweeping &#34;wailer&#34; siren is in fact one of the worst
possible designs imaginable - all the wrong characteristics for
locatability of source, annoyance versus attention ratio, penetration
of dwellings etc. Add to that the design of modern &#34;luxury&#34; cars which
are soundproofed, fitted with anti-noise and blaring ICE systems to
block the world out.There isn&#39;t an easy solution. Most laws give police, fire and
ambulance crews &#34;discretion&#34; in the use of sirens. In the UK that&#39;s
Article 99. But here, the removal of crown immunity and insurance
pressures mean the crew now always deploy, even at times of night
when it would have previously been illegal under other laws. I expect
the same complex spheres of interest clash in NYC too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have lived in nyc for a long time both in manhattan and Brooklyn. I have never understood how these cars and bikes are allowed to roam the streets like they do openly all day and all night while police used to be so quick to arrest youngsters who jumped turnstiles or smoked weed. The asshole in the article that is quoted even has the courage to say things like they need that sound for safety of themselves and cars and pedestrians. It&#39;s 2022, ban these cars and loud bikes from city streets. Heck ban all the unnecessary cars in city centers and just use electric vehicles. The city belongs to pedestrians, not some &#34;tuff&#34; redneck gang who think they can do whatever they want."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m really excited about this. I live in the NYC area and I think noise pollution from vehicles is an under-appreciated problem. I think the worst impact from street noise is on sleep; even a bit of noise noticeably hurts my sleep quality."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I guess I&#39;ll take the contrarian view here: the developer violated a reasonable Play Store policy, refused to fix the problem, and received an expected outcome.If you read the details of the Play Store complaint, you will see that they say the app was uploading information from the user&#39;s contact list without properly disclosing to the user that this was happening [1]. This is a violation of Play Store policy (a disclosure is required). It&#39;s not an unreasonable policy.You can see in the app&#39;s source code where some of this happens [2]. In short, the contact list is read off the device, email addresses associated with each contact are parsed out, and the app does HTTP requests to remote servers to get the favicon associated with each email contact domain. Note that this is the sending of information off each user&#39;s contact list (the email address domains) to those remote servers. As such, it requires a disclosure to the user.The developer&#39;s response is that he refuses to add a disclosure to the app because he is not uploading &#34;contact info&#34;. [3]. Ok... not a great response. Certainly I would expect apps to disclose whether or not they are using any information on my contact list to reach out to third-party servers, even if only domain names. In any case, it&#39;s Play Store policy.In the end, he finally removed the favicon feature. And Play agreed to allow the app back into the store.

Good faith security research means accessing a computer solely for purposes of good-faith testing, investigation, and/or correction of a security flaw or vulnerability, where such activity is carried out in a manner designed to avoid any harm to individuals or the public, and where the information derived from the activity is used primarily to promote the security or safety of the class of devices, machines, or online services to which the accessed computer belongs, or those who use such devices, machines, or online services.Seems pretty reasonable.  There will be arguments over what exactly qualifies but it provides a clear guideline / reasons where someone at the DOJ can not charge someone with good reason.It hopefully side steps some of the &#34;what even is hacking / a security breach / dude just opened browser dev tools ...&#34; type questions where they can look and say &#34;He notified them of the issue, I don&#39;t think this was in bad faith.&#34;  Now you&#39;re all out of those other weeds.If anything hopefully this provides a good example to trickle down to other law enforcement agencies."</p>

For context I was running NixOS on an old 2014 macbook air, and I work on the glasgow haskell compiler in my day job so I do a lot of CPU heavy tasks.I&#39;ve got to say, as long as these things are being produced I&#39;ll never go back. They are just too good and I cannot recommend them highly enough. One of the things that didn&#39;t occur to me before I bought it was that _because_ of the modular design I can switch the side the power port is on. That may not seem like much but it was a revelation the first time I sat on the couch and thought &#34;huh I really wish this was over on that side....wait a minute!&#34;.I&#39;ve also had absolutely no problems with NixOS on my machine, even my apple earbuds easily connect via bluetooth, something that I never quite got working on my macbook.10/10 This is damn close to my dream laptop and I&#39;m excited a new version is on the way."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I recently received my first framework laptop after being a loyal Thinkpad user for years. I am loving it so far. I run Ubuntu 22.04 daily and have not had any issues with battery life or the lid (but I do typically leave it plugged in during lunch and overnight). The expansion cards are brilliant and the keyboard is comparable to my old t-series. The aspect ratio is great for coding and I&#39;m happy to see upgradeability is being taken seriously as promised. If I can get 5-10 years out of it like my old ThinkPads (all while upgrading piecewise along the way) I will be a fan for life."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Imo, Vangelis brought the synthesizer from an experimental novelty to an instrument for composition. The two sounds I associate with him are the long  brassy triangle with a steep envelope that we know from both Blade Runner and the accompaniment to the piano in the Chariots of Fire theme, and his effective use of chimes.I have tickets for Olafur Arnalds next week, and there is a younger generation of composers like Arnalds, Frahm, Richter, Tiersen, Aphex/James, and even Reznor/Ross, who could not have avoided Vangelis&#39; influence marrying the synth with classical techniques. He was a big part of what inspired me to start making synth music and more than a few of my tracks have homages to his work, and this note triggered a memory of playing the Chariots theme on piano as a really young child and it seemed to be everywhere at the time. A loss, but hard to mourn such an exceptional contribution as well."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I dont like the idea of replacing the time spend compulsively procrastinating with &#34;learning a new language, getting a pet, going to the gym&#34; is the right way.I see the root cause (for me atleast (used to read HN and blogs for 4 hours everyday)) is that i cant stand being with myself.During the last two months ive been trying to not panic when i&#39;m idle. And not take out my phone or read the nearest material i can lay my hands on.Instead i try to accept the necesity of &#34;falde i staver&#34; (danish for &#39;falling out of presence&#39;). When i was a kid i would often just fall into this state and just defocus with my sight and let daydreaming take over.Basically i have a war going against effectiveness. I hold unto my right as a mammal to be inefficient and sit drooling looking at trees.My advice on &#34;doing something&#34; when you have day without plans is the following:
Bike in the forrest, coffee from thermos near the ocean, read newspapers at the library, talk to people at trainstations (the frequent hangouts are always open for conversations)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds like OP isn&#39;t necessarily an addict: they have ADHD.Half the article was them complaining about poor working memory, and the rest about getting stimulation/dopamine from unhealthy sources.Everyone has &#34;a little ADHD&#34;. We all occasionally, forget things, hyperfocus on things we are excited about, etc. ADHD is the disorder of having those struggles so often it&#39;s debilitating. It stems from having an underdeveloped frontal lobe that doesn&#39;t feel dopamine as well as neurotypical brains do, meaning an ADHD brain needs more stimulus to feel healthy.Because of the deficit in stimulus, people with untreated ADHD are statistically much more likely to have a substance abuse disorder (SAD); but in many cases, treating their ADHD (with medication and cognitive behavioral therapy) has the side effect of treating their SAD.Addiction, in the public consciousness/vernacular, is more abstract than SAD: it can mean anything from chemical dependence to unwanted habits. I suspect most people tend to make a false equivalence between the former and the latter. I see all the time people struggling to change a simple habit and immediately labeling themselves &#34;addicts&#34;. I think that&#39;s a unhelpful characterization.I think the point people tend to miss is that in order to change a habit, you don&#39;t just &#34;stop doing it&#34;: you must replace it with an alternative dopamine source. This is especially tricky with untreated ADHD."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This “default alive” advice is repeatedly shared.One thing it obviously does not address is the human element of who you cut and whether they will be “default alive” unemployed in a recession. A huge amount of YC advice in general positions founders as protagonists and employees as NPCs then are shocked people pick Google over their startup offer.Funny thing is I’ve seen this exact advice destroy a company. In March 2020 they did deep layoffs and cited the need to be “default alive.” Then their main market surprisingly quickly grew in the rest of 2020 , they wanted to capitalize on that, but they had laid off too many engineers who knew their infra and had enough outages and slow product development that they lost to their competitors and are now way underwater on their valuation.They decided to be serious and prudent and go “default alive” which ironically killed them. Of course if 2020 had gotten worse maybe they would look smart but the takeaway is there’s no easy answers.I would just like to see the human impact of layoffs at least lightly considered in these conversations which it rarely is. And it’s bad for business to as Im sure many people are hesitant to join companies that will have a gut reaction of doing 70% layoffs. If you even think about doing 70% layoffs you clearly over hired and are not making good leadership decisions leading up to the layoff."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Dagnabit. Here we go again - this is a fantastic, pragmatic amendment to those notes -&gt;https://dalton.substack.com/p/letter-to-myself-in-late-2008?...For a taste:&#34;Doing multiple small layoffs is a form of cascading failure. Do one layoff, but much much deeper than seems correct. Do it decisively. Do it so that you get profitable. In your case that is something like a 70% cut, not a 5-10% cut. Yes you read that right: a 70% cut. Cutting once and cutting hard allows you to reassure the people that are still here that you are truly profitable and won’t need to do it again. Doing a layoff and remaining unprofitable and counting on fundraising to save you is a stupid plan.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bleak.&#34;No one cannot predict how bad the economy will get, but things don&#39;t look good.&#34;Clif notes:- Plan for the worst ... cut costs within 30 days... get to Default Alive[0]- Get money if you need it, and if you can- With or without money you must survive 24 months- VCs are people too, and subject to the same downturn. Adjust your fund raising expectations in the same direction. Expect lower valuations, lower rounds and many fewer deals.- Disproportionate impact on international, asset heavy, low margin, hardtech, high burn, long road to revenue companies- If you get a meeting, don&#39;t take that as a good sign, we still take a lot of meetings.- Future fundraises will be much more difficult than they have been in the last 5 years.- Don&#39;t expect more money until you demonstrate product market fit.- If you planned on raising money in the next 6-12 months, we recommend changing that plan, or you may be tryng to raise at the peak of the downturn- If you survive, and your competitor does not, you may pick up significant market share.[0] http://www.paulgraham.com/aord.html"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; This is a superficial complaint, but I found Rust syntax to be dense, heavy, and difficult to readI&#39;m a huge Rust fan, but sort of agree. First, I dislike C-style syntax in general and find it all very noisy with lots of unnecessary symbols. Second, while I love traits, when you have a trait heavy type all those impl blocks start adding up giving you lots of boilerplate and often not much substance (esp. with all the where clauses on each block). Add in generics and it is often hard to see what is trying to be achieved.That said, I&#39;ve mostly reached the conclusion that much of this is unavoidable. Systems languages need to have lots of detail you just don&#39;t need in higher level languages like Haskell or Python, and trait impls on arbitrary types after the fact is very powerful and not something I would want to give up. I&#39;ve even done some prototyping of what alternative syntaxes might look like and they aren&#39;t much improvement. There is just a lot of data that is needed by the compiler.In summary, Rust syntax is noisy and excessive, but I&#39;m not convinced much could have been done about it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It looks like I&#39;m on the minority here, but I generally like Rust&#39;s syntax and think it&#39;s pretty readable.Of course, when you use generics, lifetimes, closures, etc, all on the same line it can become hard to read. But on my experience on &#34;high level&#34; application code, it isn&#39;t usually like that. The hardest thing to grep at first for me, coming from python, was the :: for navigating namespaces/modules.I also find functional style a lot easier to read than Python, because of chaining (dot notation) and the closure syntax.Python:    array = [1, 0, 2, 3]
    new_array = map(
        lambda x: x * 2,
        filter(
            lambda x: x != 0,
            array
        )
    )

Rust:    let array = [1, 0, 2, 3];
    let new_vec: Vec&lt;_&gt; = array.into_iter()
        .filter(|&amp;x| x != 0)
        .map(|x| x * 2)
        .collect();

I mean, I kind of agree to the criticism, specially when it comes to macros and lifetimes, but I also feel like that&#39;s more applicable for low level code or code that uses lots of features that just aren&#39;t available in e.g. C, Python or Go.Edit: Collected iterator into Vec"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; This is a superficial complaint, but I found Rust syntax to be dense, heavy, and difficult to read.I&#39;m not sure this is a superficial complaint. People say the hard thing about learning Rust is the new concepts, but I haven&#39;t found that to be true at all. The concepts are easy, but the combinatorial explosion of syntax that supports them is untenable."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When I first started programming I was pretty lucky to get a job at a games company. My first lead was a veteran who had shipped a lot of AAA titles and he loved his war stories. He was personally interested in performance and he would often cite hardware timings for specific cpu instructions.One story he told a couple of times was about some grey beard who was before his time. The grey beard was once a legend in the company, often helicoptered into projects at the last minute to help them squeeze out the last bit of performance. His secret was he had a mental library of assembly language tricks applicable to the hardware of his day. But every few years his tricks were less and less relevant as hardware changed and compilers advanced. One day the grey beard was helicoptered into my leads project and everyone expected him to get them some gains. However, this was new hardware and none of his old tricks worked.I think of this story whenever I see jQuery popup on Hacker News. There is always a strong contingent of devs who swear by this library. But to me, they are like the old grey beard who didn&#39;t update his knowledge as the times changed. At one time jQuery allowed them to be the hero and &#34;Get Things Done&#34; faster than their competition. But times have changed.Argue with me if you must but take stories like this one for what they are worth. The writing is on the wall for jQuery. I was writing websites before jQuery existed, during the reign of jQuery and still today. If some candidate mentioned proficiency with jQuery during an interview I would be polite but internally I would note that the person might be out of touch. Not a red flag, but a yellow flag that I would follow up on. Nothing worse than bringing on a guy who claims to be senior/experienced and it turn out his old tricks won&#39;t work because they are no longer appropriate."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tangential, but sometimes I see people say that jQuery is dead/failed. While it&#39;s not as popular anymore, I think that&#39;s actually the perfect evolution for it. jQuery was making up for browser API shortcomings, and now many of those shortcomings have been addressed and been incorporated into browser APIs (not everything, but quite a bit)."</p>

And use it like this:    import { dqsA } from &#39;lib/dqs.js&#39;;

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was working on a billing system for utility company and it was a nightmare but not for the reasons from the article.Dates are no problem, everything is billed at the end of month, quarter or year.Upgrades are downgrades are simplified, customer can legally change tariff only on predefined dates/events.Usage - yes, but exampled in the article do not even scratch the complexity of thisIdempotency is not really needed, the billing process is not continuous, it is a batch job.Cash collection is out of scope of billing software.Taxing was clear. Yes, there were multiple billable items with different tax rates, but not too complex. All customers were local.The nightmare part was:- customers can have multiple consumption locations, location can have multiple meters and customer can request to split the bill on multiple invoices or combine multiple bills to single invoice as they please- meters can be replaced at any time- meter readings are available on dates totally independent from billing cycle. Most of consumption data are mere forecasts.- when the actual consumption data is available, everything must be recalculated AND compensated (on a correction invoice showing the difference)- actual consumption data can be wrong and may be corrected at a later date, even multiple times- consumption points can be added or removed or moved to different customer at any time, but this information is only available after the fact- the prices can change mid-billing cycle for some customers but the consumption data is not available with that granularity- customer legal information (company name, address) can change mid-cycle"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve worked at two companies in their payment systems. This post does a good job of mentioning many of the billing system challenges. I think it understates how difficult and important idempotency is to maintain at scale with multiple teams though.Additionally, it didn&#39;t mention financial regulation changes. India had changes sometime in the last few years which required whole new systems built that were specific to India customers. One example of complexity is this: does the system apply to customers who are in India or does it apply to businesses who are in India (the owners might not be)?He also did not mention fraud, which is basically uncollected spend that results in charge backs typically. If you get too many chargebacks, you&#39;ll get fined. If you get even more chargebacks, you&#39;ll get kicked off the card network and will no longer be able to accept cards within that network.Post pay (customer gets the product and pays afterwards) models are subject to more fraud, uncollected charges, etc.There&#39;s also the fun of dealing with downstream payment processors. I haven&#39;t worked with a processor or bank yet that was very reliable. Sometimes they&#39;d return 500 http codes and then process a payment, requiring manual intervention. Sometimes that happens with files of payments because most banks deal with files for transactions."</p>

Just thrown into the list, as if they have any business being there (oh wait, they do have business: Google’s business).Frankly, if it’s not reliable as a tool, it has no real value and I can’t believe it has come to this.  Imagine if every time you ran `ls` in a shell with a glob pattern, it just decided to sort of “add in” a few other files loosely based on your query (or heck, files that aren’t based on it at all)?  Oh, now imagine if `rm` did that.Sadly this happens with lots of search tools now.  Why the heck is the default state on a new Mac to funnel what you type to everything, e.g. I searched for “Chrome” and hit Return and the FIRST thing it did was throw me into the App Store and call up some not-even-a-web-browser scam app with Chrome in its name, instead of selecting the Chrome already installed on my computer and opening it?  More and more it seems that you have to turn off all kinds of poor defaults to put tools into a useful state, or there is simply no way to get them there at all."</p>

There&#39;s probably some professor out there that does that in an academic context, but there&#39;s probably a lot of things that no professor actually gets paid to write about.

With proper PyTorch support, we&#39;ll actually be able to use this memory for training big models or using big batch sizes.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I can tell you why people still use ncurses: if you’re actually interested in accounting for all the nuanced eldritch madness that is terminal emulation implementation and history it’s a monumental effort, at least imo.Sure, if all you care about is coloring text on recent terminals, I do think just using ansi codes is fine.However, I completely disagree with the assertion that hardcoding ansi codes is somehow “more readable” than using a well-named API call that abstracts such detail away from the user. Maybe I’m alone in this, but I really don’t want to waste brain space memorizing ansi codes. Yeah I can write my own library or little macros to do this but…why? If I’m doing anything more involved than coloring text why wouldn’t I just pull in the lib I need? There’s no way in hell I want to maintain a custom implementation of terminal cursor movement for kicks. I’d much rather reach for a battle tested library that scores of other devs have already used and improved upon, whether it’s ncurses or one of the more modern TUI libs.Also, it’s become cool recently to hate ncurses for some reason. Are there things ncurses should do differently from today’s perspective? Sure. Is it’s api awkward to use in the face of modern programming features and paradigms that we’re now used to? Sure. But on the whole it’s design is really solid and it has plentiful documentation. Whenever I see rants like this I get the impression the author is a person that lacks an appreciation for history and the way technical development proceeds in general and imagines they are our technical savior, come down from the heavens to enlighten all us blindered fools about how terrible X is.If you want to educate people about ansi codes, great. A really inefficient way to do that is to wrap your advice in an obnoxious rant."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I built a cross platform app to print &#39;pretty formatted&#39; source code [1]. I didn&#39;t want to re-invent the wheel on formatting source code, so looked at all the existing libraries. Originally I figured formatting to HTML, and then building a print-friendly HTML render would work. But this proved super challenging. I tried a dozen HTML engines (including Chromium) but none gave me enough control to render just a single page of the original source file.Then I noticed Pygments, a Python-based library for pretty formatting source code, has an option to output an ANSI formatted file. I quickly found a bunch of libraries that could render ANSI formatted text to a print canvas.In the end, I put the original source code file through &#39;pygmentize -16m -o tempfile.an` (`16m` is the 16M color terminal ANSI formatter) and pipe the `tempfile.an` through a print-optimized renderer to actually print the source code.ANSI escapes FTW![1] WinPrint - https://github.com/tig/winprint
[2] https://pygments.org/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The author seems not to be aware of the recent TUI rennaisance[1]. There are libraries like termbox and blessings (python) that are a middle-ground between full ncurses and adding your own ansi codes. There are a lot of modern TUI frameworks like tui-go or tui-rs that bring common GUI conventions back to the TUI (heck there are TUI programming libraries that are designed to be similar to react) - these too tend to be a lot nicer than working with ncurses.Definitely worth checking out the full landscape these days if you&#39;re going to dive into making your console programs prettier.[1] My words, I just coined that name (although I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if others had said it too). I mean that in the last ~decade there has been a lot of TUI work in the background, with lots of new programs and some pretty stunning results. I blame unicode - once the web folks realized they could use something like font-awesome instead of sprite-sheets (or maybe as a pre-build sprite sheet?), and the &#34;icons in a font&#34; movement took hold, terminal programs got a lot prettier too. It makes sense, its the same font/font renderer provided by the system no matter if the app is a browser or terminal emulator."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wowsers. This is a step change in quality compared to SOTA. I suspect that without evaluating samples as a correlated group, distinguishing between the generated samples and those recorded from a human will be little better than a coin toss.And even when evaluating these samples as a group, I may be imagining the distinctions I am drawing from a relatively small selection that might be cherry-picked. Nevertheless:The generated samples are more consistent as a group, and more even in quality, with few instances of emphasis that seem (however slightly) out of place.The recorded human samples vary more between samples (by which I mean the sample as a whole may be emphasized with a bit of extra stress or a small raising or lowering of tone compared to the other samples), and within the sample there is a bit more emphasis on a word or two or slight variance in the length of pauses, mostly appropriate in context (as in, it is similar to what I, a non-professional[0], would have emphasized if I were being asked to record these).In general for a non-dramatic voiceover you want to maintain consistency between passages (especially if they may be heard out of order) without completely flattening the in-passage variation, but tastes vary.Conclusion: For many types of voice work, these generated samples are comparable in quality or slightly superior to recordings of an average professional. For semi-dramatic contexts (eg. audiobooks) the generated samples are firmly in the &#34;more than good enough&#34; zone, more or less comparable to a typical narrator who doesn&#39;t &#34;act&#34; as part of their reading.[0] Decades ago in Los Angeles I tried my hand at voiceover and voice acting work, but gave up when it quickly became clear that being even slightly prone to stuffy noses, tonsillitis and sore throats was going to pose a major obstacle to being considered reliable unless I was willing to regularly use decongestants, expectorants, and the like."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The best solution to getting past the anxiety/fear-avoidance cycle is to take small, manageable actions while accepting the feelings that go along with those actions.Start with the smallest steps possible. Maybe that means opening the assignment and saving it to your computer. Then put it down and walk away. Come back in a little while and take another small step, such as reading over the assignment or making an outline of what you need to do to get it done. Often once you&#39;ve done something you will often start to feel a lot different than if you&#39;ve done nothing.Keep track of how you&#39;re feeling. It&#39;s okay to feel more anxiety at first because you&#39;re doing something instead of nothing. Those feelings tend to subside over time as you take action, but the point is not to reduce your anxiety, the point is that you are making a commitment to do something in your life, to live your life, rather than to remain paralyzed in fear. Your goal is not to get rid of the anxiety but to live the kind of life you want to live.This is the model for Acceptance and Commitment Therapy. A great book on this is &#34;Get Out of Your Mind and into Your Life.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This was a slow process, but:1. Regular written self-reflection, i.e., keeping a journal and2. Re-framing &#34;failures&#34; as learning experiences; forgive yourselfhelped me a lot.The written part was important to me because it forced me to revisit my previous thoughts and reevaluate them in light of what had happened since last time I wrote.(2) also helped me do things with the mind-set that &#34;failure&#34; wasn&#39;t actually failure.  The goal was to try and learn from it.I didn&#39;t get around to doing this until after school, but I wish I had.  In your situation, I&#39;d try to get myself to do the assignment with a quick pass early on leaving notes for things I wasn&#39;t sure about.  Take a break, then revisit and revise.  Afterwards, write in your journal what worked well and what didn&#39;t.  Write about what you want to try next time differently if some things come to mind.Hope you find a solution that works for you.  E-mail is in my profile if you want to talk more about what&#39;s worked for me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been through the same cycle for many years (I can even say decades). My recommendation is to seek help from a psychiatrist. You probably have generalized anxiety disorder and it often goes hand in hand with depression. A psychiatrist will be able to diagnose those and give you medication if you need it. She could also recommend therapy, but you need to be diagnosed first.Unfortunately, it is very difficult to find a good mental health professional. You&#39;ll have to try many before finding a good one. Plus you will procrastinate of course. But you need to persist and make this task your priority. I know the pain you&#39;re going through, and nothing should be more important than ending the suffering right now. Once you get better you&#39;ll wish you had sought help sooner.From my research and my experience, there are two effective treatments for anxiety and depression backed by scientific evidence: antidepressants and Cognitive Behavioral Therapy.The other comments are well intentionned but most of them are basically asking you to change your mindset and just do it. Obviously, if it was that easy you would have done it already. Anxiety and depression don&#39;t allow you to think clearly, that&#39;s why it is extremely difficult to get out of it on your own."</p>

It’s gotten so bad that I’ve resorted to using an iPhone Mini, biding my time and hoping desperately that some Android OEM would step up.But it’s increasingly clear that a small premium phone is not on the roadmap. So I’ve decided to take matters into my own hands. My goal with https://smallandroidphone.com is to rally other fans of small phones together and put pressure on Google/Samsung/Anyone to consider making a small phone.I have a very specific set of skills and industry connections that I have acquired over a long career in the hardware business (my first startup was Pebble). I will put them to use in our shared quest to get the perfect small Android phone. If no one else builds one, and enough people sign up...maybe I will be forced to make it myself.If you want a small premium Android phone, this may be your last chance (ever?) to help bring back the phone category that we love."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi Eric, I&#39;m a hardware startup guy myself (our paths have crossed) with the distinction that my own &#34;very specific set of skills&#34; has been honed at smartphone megacompanies and smartphone startups.  OSOM, Essential, HTC, Samsung, Apple.  I&#39;ve designed and built a lot of phones.  I&#39;m building one now.  I think this is a noble effort, I personally prefer pocketable phones too, but I think there are nigh-insurmountable hurdles in your paths forward.- 1. Supply chain / component R&amp;D -You will be very, very hard pressed to source a pre-existing, high quality, non-exclusive 5.4&#34; display with a hole punch.  If you end up doing this as your own startup then you&#39;re going to start by trying to buy off the shelf parts to keep costs down.  But that display you want is simply not on any of the development roadmaps for the major component manufacturers.  The industry has its own momentum, and the component suppliers have also been looking at the trendlines so they are building bigger and bigger.If you can&#39;t find the screen you want in a catalogue then you have to pay someone to build it.  Convincing BOE et. al that your phone will sell enough to pay off R&amp;D costs is unlikely, so be prepared to pay several million bucks in NRE to make it worth their time (it might still not be) and the wait a year for them to spin up the fabs.  So ~$5M and 9-18 months later you have a display.- 2. Big players are uninterested, not uninformed -Big companies are drowning in market data.  They know some people really, really want small phones. But it&#39;s a long-tail opportunity they&#39;re willfully ignoring, and people who need phones will still buy something even if reluctantly.  I&#39;ve been in the meetings, small phone advocacy goes nowhere.Also I&#39;m a little surprised you&#39;re hoping an online petition will work after your prior experience trying to influence your acquirers.  I presume you saw the inside of Fitbit / Google and how decisions are made..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“matching size and design of iPhone 13 Mini”So, by all accounts, the iPhone mini has been an extremely slow seller.https://www.macrumors.com/2022/04/21/iphone-13-mini-unpopula...Why would that form factor succeed in the Android space?---I see these meme on tech sites all the time: “oh phones are too big I just want something simple”. That is a valid sentiment that I think is shared by basically no average consumer. For a lot of people, phones are their primary computing devices, so a big screen is nice there. Bigger phones allow for more battery capacity. Aging populations like them because you can use screen zoom features to really blow up that text size without making the effective viewport too small.And…people just like big stuff. I know that’s simplistic and a little condescending, but then look at SUV and truck sales."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Amazing, just two days ago I was searching for a polar arrangement tool in Inkscape. FOSS tools are often worse from a UI/UX perspective, sure, but I contend that they usually provide something consumer commercial tools often don&#39;t: respect for users. I&#39;m not necessarily talking about welcoming communities here - respect can take the form of, say, not engaging in hostilities like:
- The sword of Damocles that is renting software. Can&#39;t pay? Can&#39;t access your data. Or worse, it&#39;s gone.
- Developed-country-centric pricing models/heavy focus on newer hardware.
- Locking you out of creative uses of the software - either our way or the highway
- Effectively forced TOS or pricing changes
- Unexplained bans/AI moderation/guilt by association/becoming subject to laws not relevant to your jurisdiction
- Forced upgrades breaking workflows or removing features
- Corporate bankruptcy/&#34;amazing journey&#34;/sales/pivots/mergers/etc ruining your investment
- Misfeatures such as nag screens, dark patterns, engagement boosters (time wasters), unclear data collection...
- Opaque bug submission channels, limited to no access to the engineers building the thing
- Optimizing for revenue, not usefulnessThere is a feature count/learning curve price for this, I will readily admit. Sometimes, untenably so. My claim is simply that FOSS tools are important as a backstop/foundation.I feel that any problem solved exclusively by proprietary software is only solved temporarily and for a tiny percentage of the world population. If the company goes away or the IP otherwise becomes inactive, that&#39;s it. Especially with cloud software. With FOSS, the software never really goes away. The problem mostly stays solved, and anyone can resume the work if they are willing and able. I&#39;d imagine a forked FOSS version of Win2k, VB6, or maybe the late-2000s Google indexer (bit of a stretch) would be quite successful today, for example. Guess I&#39;ll never be sure of that.Just musing after a beer and some Red Vines - I welcome any criticism or kindred spirits."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Great to see the project moving along, but it&#39;s been a persistent feeling of mine that FOSS is starting to get left behind in the dust. The design space has been very rapidly moving towards online, live collaboration tools like Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, etc and FOSS just has no answer for this market. Even a lot of the big name proprietary tools are finding themselves becoming rapidly obsolete in a world where people want to IM a link and just have it reflect the latest version rather than attaching files back and forth.It&#39;s not even clear how FOSS would even work in this market or how it would benefit the user when it would be hosted all on someone else&#39;s server with self hosting diminishing the ease of collaboration."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Inkscape documents can now hold multiple pages , which are managed by the new Page tool&gt; Layers and objects dialog merged&gt; Redesigned Export dialog with preview and ability to select objects/layers/pages and even multiple file formats to export toIs it my birthday?

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Protip: if your goal is to use your smartphone as a webcam, check out this:  https://vdo.ninjaWritten by some guy named Steve, it’s an incredible piece of web software that uses WebRTC to stream phone audio and video as an OBS input. OBS then features a virtual webcam capability to take that stream and make it a webcam. I can then also use OBS to do whatever processing I want, e.g. making my webcam also contain a screen share or whatever else.It’s trivial to then load up multiple instances for multi-angle scenes in OBS, then cut between the two. For example, you could have one ‘face’ camera and one ‘page’ camera showing paper on your desk and make a 2nd scene with the ‘page’ camera as the primary and a small PIP view of your face.It goes much farther than just being an input for OBS, though. For example, it can create video chatrooms of multiple participants with URL parameter configuration and without touching OBS (indeed that’s now one of its primary use cases).I use it to stream applications/webpages with my partner when we’re apart so we can watch a movie together by creating a high res vid/stereo audio input with no noise cancelling as the movie, then have her and I connect as lower quality, mono+noise cancelling participants. Each of us receives the video and audio of the movie, but only the audio of each other.There’s heaps of parameters to control video and audio quality, buffering, etc. - just about anything you need.I stumbled across it when I was trying to get my iPhone to be a webcam early on in the pandemic. There’s multiple apps for that purpose - many paid - but this was so easy and worked so well that it blew them out of the water from a capability perspective.I know I sound like a shill but honestly I’m just a huge fanboy. It’s one of those web apps that does a job really bloody well, with heaps of flexibility and extensibility. I’m genuinely impressed with it and all the hard work Steve’s clearly put in.The docs explain a lot of its capability: https://docs.vdo.ninja/Flick through the how it works and use cases pages, they’ll explain it far better than me.Guides that show sown of the advanced capability: https://docs.vdo.ninja/guides"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I have an alternative approach that I discovered recently while building a microscope with a webcam driven by linux.Nearly all modern cheap webcams are UVC-compatible and they work with linux.  Different models expose different functionalities, but I ended up with this: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07R489K8LIt does 1600x1200 25FPS YUYV (as well as a wide range of other resolutions and FPS) uses the C/CS-mount lens standard (easy to buy a wide range of high quality lenses).  It doesn&#39;t have a microphone but you should be using an independent mike anyway. Has software control of exposure color temp, and gain, which is great for various lighting conditions.You read the data through USB, not HDMI.  The one thing I haven&#39;t managed to do is autofocus, but imho, for webcams you want to set a fixed focus around your head anyway.Works with all video conference programs, and OBS studio (I actually import the video in OBS and then create a virtual camera)."</p>

I know you’ve shared some details about the animation implementation, but I’m curious about how much system stuff you take advantage of. Is your view accessible through VoiceOver? What parts of the Cocoa text system do you use (or, what do you use instead for layout and shaping)? (https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Te...)I think you started working on this around the time I was working on multi-block text selection in Notion. I remember seeing a preview tweet in a Andy Matuschak thread and thinking “great minds!”. When I started working on it, I was so surprised that no outliner I tested had multi-item text selection! It’s a unique fusion. I’m curious about how you handled deletions across different indent levels… Do you know of any other outliners with it besides Bike and Notion?"</p>

The order also finds that NVIDIA failed to maintain adequate disclosure controls and procedures. Without admitting or denying the SEC’s findings, NVIDIA agreed to a cease-and-desist order and to pay a $5.5 million penalty.&#34;"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Okay, I love C so of course I had to take a look. The buzzwords are impressive, with all the testing and CI and so on, really nice, modern and ambitious.I dove into the code, literally looking at the first true part of the implementation in array/sc_array.h.Two observations, from probably less than tree minutes of reading:1. The nomenclature with &#34;sc_array_term()&#34; as the destructor (the opposite of sc_array_init()) was new to me; I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s a real problem but it&#39;s at least adding friction in a way. I would have expected sc_array_free(), but that seems to be internally used as an alias for the standard function free(). Very confusing, since that name (sc_array_free()) then leaks into the source but it has the feeling of being meant for internal use.2. I wonder if this has a bug:    /**
     * Deletes items from the array without deallocating underlying memory
     * @param a array
     */
    #define sc_array_clear(a) \
    do {                                                                   \
      (a)-&gt;cap = 0;                                                  \
      (a)-&gt;size = 0;                                                 \
      (a)-&gt;oom = false;                                              \
    } while (0)

In my experience, when you want to clear a dynamic array but keep the allocated memory, the &#39;capacity&#39; (&#39;cap&#39;, here) field should not be cleared. I think this will leak memory if an array is grown, cleared, and then re-filled since the sc_array_add() function will see a zero capacity, and allocate new storage.Just my inflation-devalued SEK 0.02, and I did not run the code, I just read it very quickly. Corrections welcome."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I got more into C programming, I started looking for data structure libraries. Found a few [0]. Also evaluated sc, but it had too much pre-processor magic for my taste. It also bundles random &#34;stuff&#34; like a URI parser, a thread abstraction, etc.Eventually I rolled my own [1] more focused library.

They are able to systematically discover websites built on certain platforms that allow users to post content containing links, which they can target for link spam.  It is very difficult to fight this on a technical level because there is an entire industry built around blackhat SEO, with all kinds of softwares and services dedicated to thwarting your defensive efforts.  Even Google struggles to keep up with this.However, they are also systematically feeding you their footprint lists.

It won&#39;t stop the bots from trying, and you may have to circle back periodically to add new footprints as they surface.

It&#39;s a great tool for looking past sites with good SEO; all you have to do is fiddle with the value of N.For example, searching for &#34;electronic music box&#34; as /u/ajnin suggested, with the top 100K web sites removed from the results, filters out the following:&gt; These 23 sites were removed from your results:&gt;     alibaba.com (1 result removed)&gt;     aliexpress.com (1 result removed)&gt;     allaboutcircuits.com (1 result removed)&gt;     amazon.com (2 result removed)&gt;     apple.com (1 result removed)&gt;     bestreviews.com (1 result removed)&gt;     ebay.com (1 result removed)&gt;     etsy.com (2 result removed)&gt;     facebook.com (1 result removed)&gt;     instructables.com (2 result removed)&gt;     lightinthebox.com (2 result removed)&gt;     lumberjocks.com (1 result removed)&gt;     mapquest.com (1 result removed)&gt;     reverb.com (1 result removed)&gt;     twitter.com (1 result removed)&gt;     wikipedia.org (1 result removed)&gt;     yelp.com (1 result removed)&gt;     youtube.com (2 result removed)And the top result ends up being https://midiguy.com/."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This made me curious to try that search engine so I typed &#34;electronic music box&#34; (first thing that came to mind). As far as I can tell none or the 10+ pages of results include all those 3 words. I mean, you might not have any relevant sites in your database (likely if there are only 1000 sites or so as another of your blog posts imply), and I understand you want to show some result to the user, but if I want irrelevant links I might as well go to google.com..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So this one is a tough one for me, because Yuri has certainly spent significant time with Julia and I think he&#39;s a very competent programmer, so his criticism is certainly to be taken seriously and I&#39;m sad to hear he ended up with a sour opinion.There&#39;s a lot of different issues mentioned in the post, so I&#39;m not really sure what angle to best go at it from, but let me give it a shot anyway. I think there&#39;s a couple of different threads of complaints here. There&#39;s certainly one category of issues that are &#34;just bugs&#34; (I&#39;m thinking of things like the HTTP, JSON, etc. issues mentioned). I guess the claim is that this happens more in Julia than in other systems. I don&#39;t really know how to judge this. Not that I think that the julia ecosystem has few bugs, just that in my experience, I basically see 2-3 critical issues whenever I try a new piece of software independent of what language it&#39;s written in.I think the other thread is &#34;It&#39;s hard to know what&#39;s expected to work&#34;. I think that&#39;s a fair criticism and I agree with Yuri that there&#39;s some fundamental design decisions that are contributing here. Basically, Julia tries very hard to make composability work, even if the authors of the packages that you&#39;re composing don&#39;t know anything about each other. That&#39;s a critical feature that makes Julia as powerful as it is, but of course you can easily end up with situations where one or the other package is making implicit assumptions that are not documented (because the author didn&#39;t think the assumptions were important in the context of their own package) and you end up with correctness issues. This one is a bit of a tricky design problem. Certainly adding more language support for interfaces and verification thereof could be helpful, but not all implicit assumptions are easily capturable in interfaces. Perhaps there needs to be more explicit documentation around what combinations of packages are &#34;supported&#34;. Usually the best way to tell right now is to see what downstream tests are done on CI and if there are any integration tests for the two packages. If there are, they&#39;re probably supposed to work together.To be honest, I&#39;m a bit pained by the list of issues in the blog post. I think the bugs linked here will get fixed relatively quickly by the broader community (posts like this tend to have that effect), but as I said I do agree with Yuri that we should be thinking about some more fundamental improvements to the language to help out. Unfortunately, I can&#39;t really say that that is high priority at the moment. The way that most Julia development has worked for the two-ish years is that there are a number of &#34;flagship&#34; applications that are really pushing the boundary of what Julia can do, but at the same time also need a disproportionate amount of attention. I think it&#39;s overall a good development, because these applications are justifying many people&#39;s full time attention on improving Julia, but at the same time, the issues that these applications face (e.g. - &#34;LLVM is too slow&#34;, better observability tooling, GC latency issues) are quite different from the issues that your average open source julia developer encounters. Pre 1.0 (i.e. in 2018) there was a good 1-2 year period where all we did was think through and overhaul the generic interfaces in the language. I think we could use another one of those efforts now, but at least that this precise moment, I don&#39;t think we have the bandwidth for it. Hopefully in the future, once things settle down a bit, we&#39;ll be able to do that, which would presumably be what becomes Julia 2.0.Lastly, some nitpicking on the HN editorialization of the title. Only of the issues linked (https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/issues/41096) is actually a bug in the language - the rest are various ecosystem issues. Now, I don&#39;t want to disclaim responsibility there, because a lot of those packages are also co-maintained by core julia developers and we certainly feel responsibility to make those work well, but if you&#39;re gonna call my baby ugly, at least point at the right baby ;)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Everything has correctness issues somewhere. Julia ships an entire patched version of LLVM to fix correctness bugs in numerical methods. It has its own implementations of things like software-side FMA because the FMA implementation of Windows is incorrect: https://github.com/JuliaLang/julia/pull/43530 . Core Julia devs are now the maintainers of things like libuv because of how much had to be fixed there. So from those three points, that clearly points out tons of cases where Python, R, etc. code is all incorrect where Julia isn&#39;t.I think what&#39;s interesting about Julia is that because the code is all Julia, it&#39;s really easy to dig in there and find potential bugs. The standard library functions can be accessed with @edit sum(1:5) and there you go, hack away. The easier it is to look at the code, the easier it is to find issues with it. This is why Julia has such a higher developer to user ratio. That has its pros and cons of course. It democratizes the development process, but it means that people who don&#39;t have a ton of development experience (plus Fortran or C knowledge) are not excluded from contributing. Is that good or bad? Personally I believe it&#39;s good in the long run, but can have its bumps.As an aside, the author highlights &#34;for i in 1:length(A)&#34;. I agree, code should never do that. It should be `eachindex(A)`. In general things should use iterators which are designed for arbitrary indexing based on iterators. This is true in any language, though you&#39;ll always have some newcomers write code (and documentation) with this. Even experienced people who don&#39;t tend to use arrays beyond Array tend to do this. It&#39;s an interesting issue because coding style issues perpetuate themselves: explicitly using 1-base wasn&#39;t an issue before GPUs and OffsetArrays, but then loop code like that trains the next generation, and so more people use it. In the end the people who really know to handle these cases are the people who tend to use these cases, just like how people who write in styles that are ARM-safe tend to be people who use ARM. Someone should just run a bot that opens a PR for every occurrence of this (especially in Base), as that would then change the source that everyone learns from and completely flip the style."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am a long-time member of the Julia community and had a discussion with the author about these issues a long time ago – but did not give feedback on the post. Let me first state that Yuri is a great person and was a valuable member of the community. He pushed the boundaries of the language and produced some very nice packages in his time. His concerns are genuine and should be respected and discussed in that context.Also, let me say that encountering these kinds of bugs is not something I have had experience with. But, I tend to be very conservative with my usage of libraries and fancy composition.If I had more experience with programming language theory and implementation, perhaps I would have a better name to describe the source of the issues described. My attempt is to call it “type anarchy”. The way I see it, there is not a clear way to assign responsibility for correctness. In the case of the array used in the post, is it the fault of the implementer of the `sum` function (without a type signature, as it should be) or implementer of the data structure? I am honestly not sure. But as Julia breaks news ground with its type system and multiple dispatch, this could very much be an open question."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Parag apparently lost his patience with superficial and misleading claims about Twitter spam (like this analysis) and posted about it today.You can see it here (https://twitter.com/paraga/status/1526237578843672576).Noteworthy highlights:* Twitter estimates its &lt;5% number from human analysis of multi-thousand user random samplings of mDAU* Twitter allows that number to remain so high to avoid introducing friction like captcha into real users&#39; experiences* Twitter uses all sorts of internal private data in its analysis* Parag says you cannot get a reliable indication of bot/not bot without this internal private dataHaving just finished building a Twitter analysis tool, I agree with Parag that the Twitter API doesn&#39;t provide sufficient clarity to make decisions about spam. This article&#39;s analysis doesn&#39;t hold up - just because you can name several features you&#39;re going to use to generate a spam confidence score about an account does not mean that spam confidence score will have any precision."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think this post means as much as people are acting like it does.The indicators of being a spambot they have in their post seem VERY iffy to me. &#34;Not tweeting in the past 120 days&#34;, &#34;Location set to a non resolving location&#34;, &#34;Small number of followers&#34;, &#34;default profile image&#34;, &#34;No URL in bio or non-resolving URL in bio&#34;, &#34;Not on many lists&#34;, &#34;tweets in a different language than the person they&#39;re following&#34; - Those all seem like extremely weak signals to me. My profile matches 6 of those, and I&#39;m a human. I would like to see them hand-verify a subset of their results and see if their algorithm matches reality.Also note that they define &#34;active&#34; differently than Twitter. They define &#34;active&#34; as having tweeted recently. Twitter gives spambot numbers as a percent of monetizable daily active users. I wonder if Twitter&#39;s given bot numbers are low because bots don&#39;t typically lurk or load ads. I can believe that the total bot count as a percentage of users or as a percentage of recently-tweeting-users is higher than 5%, but that only 5% of daily visitors seeing ads are bots."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;We undercount active users whose accounts are protected, accounts that view tweets but don’t send any, and accounts that log in and engage in other ways beyond tweeting (like favoriting or adding profiles to lists).&#34;My markup. If I understand correctly, not having a public tweet is a marker for being a spam account. Isn&#39;t that kind of a lot of people? I know from other forums that there&#39;s a large ratio between lurkers and active posters.Given that you need an account to customise your timeline, and, these days, pretty much for just reading a tweet, there may be loads of real reader accounts that never post and never bother customizing their profile."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nothing wrong with p2p. But often it&#39;s simply overkill. Skype started out as a p2p thing. But ultimately, video calls became a commodity where orchestrating them centrally proved to be good enough. I can make video calls with meets, facebook, whatsapp, signal, slack, etc. Not a big deal. I even still have Skype somewhere and it still works even though they ripped out the p2p bits ages ago.I&#39;m not sure what web3 is other than a label that people started slapping on the collective efforts of people vaguely doing anything with or depending on some kind of block chain thingy. IMHO it has very little to do with the web and little or no relevance to end users.From a technical point of view, I don&#39;t see anything wrong with having a distributed store of ownership of stuff. There are all sorts of useful and valid uses for that. The problem is all the hyena&#39;s with dollar signs in their eyes floating around any companies active in this space. It&#39;s hard to see the forest for the trees because of this. Doing anything with a blockchain almost automatically buckets you with the fraudsters, utopians, and other people plaguing this space.Most of the companies in this space are a combination of naive, fraudulent, or misguided. With a few notable exceptions where you might squint and see some potential of some actual economic value. But most of them are obvious duds. I actually briefly used Stellar for some actual applications. Great tech. Mostly works as advertised. Not that expensive to use. Etc."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ll just leave this here [0]I don&#39;t disagree that the concentration of web architecture into the hands of a small number of big corps is a bad thing. I just don&#39;t see the solution being a purely technical one. There are market forces and reasons for that consolidation: efficiency in terms of power; production, acquisition, and deployment of expensive equipment; high-availability of services, operations and staff, etc. I don&#39;t like that a third of the Internet goes down with aws-east-1 like anyone else but the factors that enabled this situation are no conspiracy.We need economic incentives to enable smaller players to build on widely deployed infrastructure, fair competition laws, etc.We could use more edge-computing power with low-power equipment. Make it easy to deploy small-time data-centres on low-power, off-the-shelf hardware. Incentives that align with the economic value they bring so that they&#39;re not fighting on the margins left by large monopolies.Instead we&#39;re supposed to switch over to a &#34;P2P&#34; system built on funny machines evaluating user code. As many chains have tried to formally verify their smart contracts it&#39;s becoming increasing clear that the proofs, when they can be achieved, are so complex that the underlying system probably has more errors in it than we can count. Probably great for departing folks from their money but the folks running this stuff often don&#39;t even understand programming let alone proofs and verification.And then the stuff that actually gets built with it... slow, terrible UX, that it is... is just garbage anyways. Axie? I don&#39;t think anyone in web3 actually plays the game. It looks boring as all hell. And it&#39;s incredibly expensive to get started in it. They literally pay people to play it for them and they just watch spreadsheets for number to go up.And none of this &#34;distributed web&#34; works without the Internet as it exists today anyway. I&#39;m not interested in promises of potential. We don&#39;t drive on potential bridges.Maybe some part of the community is built by idealists but their dreams are poisoned. The world we live in right now is already pretty terrible in some parts. We could be fixing those instead of building another dystopia.[0] https://web3isgoinggreat.com/"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sort of agree. My initial understanding was that web3 was essentially a P2P solution with IPFS, Federated social graphs, decentralized p2p messaging and RTC stuff, and awaiting decentralized DNS. My current understanding or impression is that it&#39;s a coin wallet in my ~browser and I have to mine shit coins via storing and computing stuff on what will certainly be FAANGs behalf."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was reading https://danluu.com/sounds-easy again today, and when reading this article I was reminded of a particular section:&#34;Everything we&#39;ve looked at so far is a technical problem. Compared to organizational problems, technical problems are straightforward. Distributed systems are considered hard because real systems might drop something like 0.1% of messages, corrupt an even smaller percentage of messages, and see latencies in the microsecond to millisecond range. When I talk to higher-ups and compare what they think they&#39;re saying to what my coworkers think they&#39;re saying, I find that the rate of lost messages is well over 50%, every message gets corrupted, and latency can be months or years&#34;Dan goes on to say: &#34;When people imagine how long it should take to build something, they&#39;re often imagining a team that works perfectly and spends 100% of its time coding. But that&#39;s impossible to scale up. The question isn&#39;t whether or not there will inefficiencies, but how much inefficiency. A company that could eliminate organizational inefficiency would be a larger innovation than any tech startup, ever.&#34;Communication scales extremely poorly compared to code and large organizations require a very different skillset than small companies. The author seems like someone who just loves writing code as opposed to wanting to deliver maximum business value (As defined by the company), so it makes sense he dislikes big companies.There are also good and bad big and small companies. A well run big company is still going to have a large amount of communication overhead vs a small company."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"All these meetings, reports, plans and apparently useless things, provide insurance to the different stakeholders of the project. Projects fail in many ways, and you need everyone to feel safe. That&#39;s why you need to document things a lot, in order to say “this was explained in section 3.2.1 of the manual” when the other team doesn&#39;t correctly  use your tools. And this is true for everyone, the finance guys, the product guys, the programmers, the marketers, everyone. Providing insurance to everyone is very expensive, but it makes the large organization stable. If everyone worked like cowboys in an small company, then the large company would disappear in a large fire of infighting.I never worked in a large company, but I work in academia, and we academics are also working on insurance a lot. The funding bodies want us to detail all expenses and justify all the changes in the plan, because they don&#39;t want people to say that the public funds are mismanaged. This is just an example. We also write tons of useless papers, to justify that we are productive with this money. This makes research very difficult. If you really want to do science, you should become rich and do it from home, like Nassim Taleb does, but in Academia we must work on all this insurance stuff, like in corporate world.That&#39;s how things are."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The issue the author is talking about, in my view, is caused by the natural lifespan of corps tending towards bloating middle-management. (Very hard process to fight).At the start the founder group are rutheless productivity-chasers. Then the corp expands to include the its-just-a-job group. Everything ticks along well, and at some point, the rutheless can&#39;t manage the group. So they hire followers to listen to their orders and thereby manage others. In this sense middle management is really &#34;corporate following&#34;.Now you have the its-just-ajobs, rutheless-productives, rutheless-leaders, and leader-followers.When the corp grows too far the balance in these populations is thrown way off (by, often, the shortsightedness of the real leadership in balloning middle-management to cover for them).At this point all the meaningful decisions are still held by the exec, but middle management are now so large they have to &#34;find something useful to do&#34;, which is regulate all the meaningless decisions.At this point most of the ruthelessly-productive leave, and you&#39;re left with the justajobs, leader-followers and the few clueless productives who&#39;ll destroy their mental health trying to grapple with it all."</p>

Jade remains enigmatic and skeptical: that seems to be her nature. But if she is in the mood for a tummy rub, she will respond to &#34;Lie Down&#34;.For me, the great charm of cats is that it is impossible to tell the difference between &#34;No, I don&#39;t understand you.&#34; and &#34;I understand you perfectly well, but I plan to ignore you completely until I feel like responding&#34;."</p>

When I let them outside, if I call them to come in, the younger will find the older and herd her to the door. He then vigorously resists coming inside himself. He&#39;s also very vocal, and his tone of voice will change depending on whether he&#39;s happy to see me and wanting pets or if I&#39;m ruining his stalking and spying or he doesn&#39;t want to come inside (the other just ignores me and does whatever she wants)."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At one point (a very long time ago now) it was declared that Dogwood was the future and as a result Go would be the language of choice at Heroku and Erlang would be no more.Trouble is that Erlang ran all the important Cedar code (it might still today) and the Erlang engineers didn&#39;t particularly like the news that Erlang code was essentially deprecated so they left and nobody knew how to maintain the stack. This definitely wasn&#39;t the only problem we had but it was a big one.What do fellow Herokai think? Was Dogwood a fool&#39;s errand? Or did we just not get enough staff to build it properly?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The only thing I don&#39;t like is their usage-based pricing. On Heroku I could pay $7 a month and know I&#39;d never be charged more than that. I&#39;m sure when you&#39;re scaling a service it&#39;s fine - maybe even better - to do it on a sliding scale. But for a fire-and-forget blog site, I don&#39;t want to have to worry about stuff like that."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"After all the chatter this week, I&#39;ve come to the conclusion that Heroku froze at the perfect time for my 4 person company. All of these so called &#34;features&#34; are exactly what we don&#39;t want or need.1. Multi-region deployment only work if your database is globally distributed too. However, making your database globally distributed creates a set of new problems, most of which take time away from your core business.2. File persistence is fine but not typically necessary. S3 works just fine.It&#39;s easy to forget that most companies are a handful of people or just solo devs. At the same time, most money comes from the enterprise, so products that reach sufficient traction tend to shift their focus to serving the needs of these larger clients.I&#39;m really glad Heroku froze when it did. Markets always demand growth at all costs, and I find it incredibly refreshing that Heroku ended up staying in its lane. IMO it was and remains the best PaaS for indie devs and small teams."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Litestream author here. The motivation for this docs page was two-fold. First, laying out the different options with their trade-offs helps people understand what Litestream is trying to be so it helps keep my focus narrow. For example, if someone is looking for very high durability guarantees then they can see that rqlite might be a better fit and they don&#39;t try to fit Litestream into that mold.Second, Litestream doesn&#39;t interfere with other backup methods so you can run it alongside a cron-based backup. I typically run both because I&#39;m overly paranoid and because it&#39;s cheap."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A service that says &#39;here is an alternative to our service&#39;? Right on their own website? Even though cron backups are basically &#39;competition&#39; to litestream?That&#39;s it. I&#39;m giving fly.io a try next hobby app I start.I&#39;m so impressed with their business decisions right now, I was afraid for litestream but then I read how the creator is just hired to work on it full time. What a splendid development!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Following the announcement of Fly.io acquiring the Litestream project and hiring its creator Ben Johnson I&#39;ve been looking into it (and am very impressed by what I see!)Reading through the docs I was delighted to find this full set of instructions including script commands for setting up a simpler regular snapshot backup using cron - for situations where Litestream is (quote) &#34;overkill&#34; - ie where the database is smaller and your durability requirements are lower.In fact, the docs have a whole alternatives section for different requirements. I think this kind of thing is great, and something more projects should do! Wanted to share it because of this meta thing, but also because it&#39;s just pretty useful per se."</p>

The author sounds like an investor who would be equally happy to hold long instead of short positions in those stocks if their prices were different."</p>

The actual company is a conduit, the revenues still occur but nobody had been asking what happens to the actual money.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I weigh 350 pounds. I&#39;m very obese. I know this.When I was a teenager, I looked at people who weighed 300+ pounds and though, how do you get that way. Don&#39;t you realize that you are gaining weight? Don&#39;t you know that you just have to eat less to lose weight?Anyway, now I realize that I am hungry. It never goes away unless I eat a significant amount of food. My body told me to eat, so I ate.It doesn&#39;t even take that much extra food to gain a lot of weight. One extra piece of cake a week is a few pounds in a year. If you live a few years, it adds up. You gain weight in kilograms and lose weight in grams.Hunger is a sensation that happens inside a person&#39;s body and mind. You cannot compare your hunger to my hunger.So many diets talk about not being hungry while you are on the diet. I&#39;ve been to dieticians and told them I&#39;m hungry, and they suggest eating more protein or more fiber. That does help, but I still feel hungry.There is a very good chance that someone is writing a reply with some suggestion as to how I should eat so that I&#39;m not hungry. Thank you for the thoughts, but realize that you don&#39;t live in my body, you don&#39;t know how I feel, you don&#39;t know what I&#39;ve tried.Hunger sounds like a problem to people. Hunger feels like a problem inside the body. People still tell me I shouldn&#39;t be hungry. Maybe part of the solution is realizing that eating to satisfaction is ... bad for some people. Maybe it&#39;s Ok to be a little hungry.Anyway, these are just some thoughts. I&#39;m down 30 pounds from my max. I think I have a good mentality now, but it took years to get here."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"While correct and useful advice for some people, this advice is useless for many (I suspect most) overweight and obese people.I&#39;m on the border of overweight/obese. I can lose weight if I focus on losing weight. I&#39;ve dropped from 100kg to 74kg and back. I&#39;ve gone back down to 91kg and back. How? Eating less, of course. By counting calories. But here is the problem. Anything below 95kg and my body and mind is hyper annoying, constantly interrupting my thoughts (amygdala?) insisting that I go eat something. It is impossible to program computers when my brain keeps interrupting me. I simply cannot focus on anything other than eating. It&#39;s like a very slow motion breath hold... eventually you will come up for air. I find life so miserable at those weights that I eventually learned to accept my fate and I&#39;ll die early I&#39;m sure, but at least life will feel tolerable until then.Why do some people&#39;s bodies/minds insist so insistently that they eat more when they clearly are already overweight? That&#39;s the question I would love to have answered. People often postulate the answer lies in the kinds of foods you eat, but I&#39;ve proven that hypothesis wrong (for myself) many times. Avoiding sugars and fried foods and eating oatmeal, fish soup, salads, fruit and veg with lean proteins...  does not make any weight difference for me, nor does it make low body weights any more tolerable. Sounds great, I&#39;m sure it&#39;s healthy, but I&#39;ve proven on myself multiple times that this technique does not work. Only counting calories works for weight loss (actually distance running works for me too), and it always leaves me famished and miserable.Going on a zero-carb diet might work. I&#39;ve seen success stories. I haven&#39;t seriously tried it. When I&#39;ve tried in the past I was craving bread so massively that I caved in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone finally wrote this article. So refreshing. It&#39;s obvious when you live with a fat person why they have trouble losing weight, even when they&#39;re on a diet: they&#39;re usually not actually following it. Whether they don&#39;t understand portion sizes for calorie math, or look at calories at all, or eat things that they say &#34;do not count&#34;, there is almost always a failure to understand what and how much they are eating."</p>

They will keep pushing anti-consumer laws through the backdoor of &#34;free trade&#34; agreements, until we stop it by requiring that:Before any international agreement may be ratified, [our country] must pass all the laws needed to comply with that agreement ahead of time, through regular democratic processes."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;Free&#34; trade agreements. &#34;Free trade agreement&#34; is a propaganda term anyway, but applying it to agreements that impose intellectual property monopolies is bizarre.https://cepr.net/trade-agreements-that-increase-protectionis...https://cepr.net/trade-deals-are-about-increasing-protection...&gt; It is also important to point out that the liberalization of trade in goods is largely a done deal. Tariffs are already zero or near zero in the vast majority of cases. The potential gains from further liberalization are limited, especially since goods are a rapidly falling share of total output.&gt; Instead, deals like the TPP are largely about locking in rules on items like intellectual property protections and preserving Mark Zuckerberg’s dominance of the Internet. The TPP, like other recent trade deals, calls for longer and stronger patent and copyright monopolies.&gt; These protections are 180 degrees at odds with free trade. They are about shifting more income from the bulk of the population to people who benefit from rents on patents and copyrights, by making them pay more for drugs, medical equipment, software and a wide variety of other items."</p>

After about 3 weeks of using large doses of the benzos every night, I stopped taking them, but a year later I still feel pangs of withdrawal sometimes when I get stressed.  It took me another 4 months to get off the phenibut and a month or so after that before my sleep returned to normal.  There were months where I maybe got an hour or two of sleep a night.  If I got stressed, I simply wouldn&#39;t sleep at all.  I once went three days without sleep.  The torment of that combined with the withdrawal from the drugs showed me what hell was like.  I tell everyone to never take benzos for any reasons.  I don&#39;t care how safe the doctors say they are; they aren&#39;t.  Period.  There are repercussions - as this study shows - and they will not help the underlying cause of your issues.  Treat the cause, not the symptoms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Caution:  While this is a cool study in Nature Neuroscience, almost all facets of this work are based on a single fully inbred strain of mouse—-C57BL/6J. This strain also happens to have a major mutation in the  GABRA2 gene that reduces expression about 2X relative to almost all other strains of mice.  GABRA2 is one of the most important receptors involved in inhibitory responses in CNS and benzodiazepine responses.This same strain also has a well known splice variant mutation in a key mitochondrial gene, NNT, that modulates both mitochondrial and macrophage function. The microglial mentioned in this paper are a special class of macrophages that reside in the CNS.Given these comments, when the authors refer to “wild type” (WT) mice, remember these are anything but true wild type mice. Fully inbred strains always carry numerous homozygous recessive and dominant mutations (several hundred each) that often affect CNS, immune systems, and mitochondrial functions.The results may well hold up in other strains, but I would not count on it. Do benzodiazepines affect all humans uniformly?Would studies of other strains or types have been practical? Yes. The Thy1-GFP and Thy1-YFP lines can be crossed to make F1 hybrids. This particular transgene is also available on at least one other strain of mouse (DBA/2J).Unfortunately, most reviewers at Nature Neuroscience are not geneticists ;-) They are typically strong molecular neurobiologists who are used to reductionist methods. They are perfectly content with submission to Nature journals that are based entirely on with N=1 mouse genome—almost always the mutant C57BL/6J inbred strain.In my own work I try to avoid this N=1 trap. (But I have also failed ;-)Generality and robustness of results (see quote below) should ideally be established across two or more diverse genomes before making broad claims of relevance to other species, including od course to humans.The quote:“We have demonstrated that microglia in WT mice alter their morphology and functions upon diazepam treatment and cease to do so in Tspo−/− mice.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The world of medecine is degenerate. Sustainable, non addictive and non neurotoxic anxiolytics exists:
the #1 being opipramol the sigmaergic.
emoxypine (which btw cure hangover) and guanfacine are worth mentioning.
Maybe beta blockers to some extent. NMDA antagonists such as memantine have side effects but are not neurotoxic to my knowledge and there are milder ones such as mg-lthreonate.
afobazole is interesting but its pharmacology is too weird to be sure. Etifoxine is revolutionnary, it double axon length growth rate so ironically a great cure to benzo neurodamage. its acts on the mitochondria benzodiazepine receptor. It&#39;s unclear to me wether it is subject to a tolerance effect and if so if it is lower. Also etifoxine can interact badly with other drugs on the liver.
Note that there exists ultra-atypical mechanisms, such as inositol megadose or tofisopam but they are not firstline.So yeah, basically opipramol and guanfacine should be what humans take as first line. Glycine is a nice obvious augmentation (kinda absurd that people forget about the second inhibitor neurotransmitter in the brain, especially since the effect feel nice and doesn&#39;t really lead to tolerance).
if you have benzo neurodamage, take magnesium lthreonate which is a very potent synaptotrophic.also fun fact: the benzo cartel was so strong it was the most prescribed drug in the world, all classes, in the 70s"</p>

I had a good size Onkyo system for watching movies and I configured it meticulously. But it&#39;s hard to explain to others why there is so much ceremony and bulk, especially when watching habits degenerate from immersive movies to binge watching netflix serieses.Part of the experience with hobbies is some kind of sacrifice along with the reward. The drive towards convenience takes away that sacrifice and makes me appreciate something a little less.It&#39;s like takeout and boxed wine, wearing a T-shirt; versus dressing up a bit, making a nice meal, and opening a bottle from a winery you visited. The former is ovjectively good and convenient, and all of the latter ceremony is a hassle that provides little benefit (you probably can&#39;t tell the boxed wine apart in a blind test).But... aren&#39;t we happier with the latter experience?I&#39;m too lazy to &#34;waste&#34; time on that kind of happiness though. That&#39;s the sad part.I think if I&#39;m motivated by others it&#39;s different. For instance, stuff like surfing/snowsports requires a significant hassle, and it&#39;s a lot easier to find people who will put up with that hassle."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel that the AV-receiver market has gone the way of the DSLR market. Compact speaker systems like Sonos (that don&#39;t need a separate AVR) simply got good enough. Thus the need for buying a separate AVR to drive your Dolby / DTS / etc. setup has all but vanished except maybe for the most determined audiophiles (and even most of these would do well to simply get a compact wireless speaker setup instead of some monstrosity that they can hardly ever enjoy...because too small of a listening room, and neighbours).I&#39;m not saying market for Onkyo, Denon, Sony, Yamaha, etc. AVRs is a goner, but I am suggesting it may have peaked and that going forward there will be less and less demand for AVRs, especially in the low/mid range of things."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Something similar that I find both fascinating and heart-breakingly tragic: The &#34;Black Belt&#34; in the U.S. Deep South. The Black Belt is both a geological term used to refer to the rich &amp; dark soil [0] and a geopolitical term to refer to the high percentage of African Americans [1]. During the Cretaceous period, the shore-line at the time ran through the middle of Alabama and Mississippi, depositing rich organic deposits, which in turn allowed for plantations to thrive in those parts of the deep south. Even nearly 160 years after the Emancipation Proclamation, those counties still have some of the highest percentages of African American Populations. Overlaying the population demographic map on a a map of the cretaceous shoreline shows a correlation [2].[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Belt_(geological_formati...

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ironically, the first map with Poland although very popular (it comes up on Reddit on a weekly basis) doesn&#39;t explain much.It&#39;s the part not shown there that matters. The Russian partition (and to a lesser extent Austrian one) was the cause of the area in blue being poor and underdeveloped.There was nothing particularly great in being under Prussian (German) occupation. It&#39;s that Russian occupation was so much worse, hell bent on robbing Poland on everything of any value."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"In the US/Iraq war such contraptions were commonly referred to as EFPs (explosively formed penetrators). My platoon was once hit by a four-array EFP that was hung behind a cement wall (US forces would often line streets with barricades like this) so we couldn&#39;t see it. It went through the concrete wall, the humvee, and took some legs with it. Brutal things they were. We avoided prolonged truck excursions, but I remember we used to always sit with our arms and legs as staggered as possible--The thought being that if an EFP went through, you might get lucky and only lose one arm/leg instead of two. Of course it probably didn&#39;t help... but whatever."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Wikipedia article on shaped charges is fascinating:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaped_chargeThe penetration distance is proportional to the diameter of the charge (counterintuitive; you&#39;d expect the height), and can be up to 7x as large.  So a ~5 inch charge shown in the film can penetrate up to about 3 feet of solid steel.Also, all of our known defenses against shaped charged rely on the assumption that the same spot won&#39;t get hit twice.  Composite armor breaks and deflects the geometry of the jet through its deformation; reactive armor relies on a mini-explosion to defeat the jet.  This has interesting implications in a world of drones and precision-guided munitions, and in fact the Javelin missiles we&#39;ve been shipping to Ukraine have double warheads, the first to destroy the armor and the second to destroy the vehicle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I amuse myself by thinking that Sidney Alford (the expert in the video, who by the way appears to have passed away last year) looked like, and was, the modern Grand Maester, conjuring up magical (but yes, destructive and terrible) explosives for the use by kingdoms against each other.   He should&#39;ve been given a cameo part in Game of Thrones...I got onto the topic years ago when watching the Dambusters.   Related to this, he also has a video showing how putting a simple tube/bag of water behind an explosive charge magnifies its force incredibly.  I believe he started a company that built and sold explosives with such a water-fillable jacket that could be used to knock down doors by police forces.edit: here&#39;s the water filled explosive knocking down a door: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_80gWlDQdHg"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"LUNA is trading at below $0.00001, that is below 1/1000th of a cent right now. For many, getting rid of it may be much harder than just ignoring it. A few weeks ago the price people were willing to pay for it hovered around $100.I say &#34;the price people were willing to pay&#34; instead of &#34;value&#34;, because now that nobody wants to speculate with LUNA, it did fall down to its intrinsic value: Practically zero. Nobody needs it for anything besides buying and selling it from and to other people, which is not happening anymore.Cryptocurrency is gambling, plain and simple. The difficulty that fiat currency faces is inflation, which roughly means diluting the economy that backs it too much. The difficulty with cryptocurrency is that there is nothing of worth backing it. Factor in the horrifying externalities, and its worth is negative.For Bitcoin, the most popular one, on the order of 100.000.000.000.000.000.000 of hashes get calculated to mine a single block, multiple trillion per second. Within ten minutes, only a single one of those 100.000.000.000.000.000.000 hashes is actually used, depending entirely on luck. The rest are thrown away entirely. They do not form part of the final hash or anything else, the energy spent on them is lost."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I prefer Matt Levine from his newsletter today:&#34;Safe assets are much riskier than risky ones. This is I think the deep lesson of the 2008 financial crisis, and crypto loves re-learning the lessons of traditional finance. Systemic risks live in safe assets. Equity-like assets — tech stocks, Luna, Bitcoin — are risky, and everyone knows they’re risky, and everyone accepts the risk. If your stocks or Bitcoin go down by 20% you are sad, but you are not that surprised. And so most people arrange their lives in such a way that, if their stocks or Bitcoin go down by 20%, they are not ruined.&#34;On the other hand safe assets — AAA mortgage securities, bank deposits, stablecoins — are not supposed to be risky, and people rely on them being worth what they say they’re worth, and when people lose even a little bit of confidence in them they crack completely. Bitcoin is valuable at $50,000 and somewhat less valuable at $40,000. A stablecoin is valuable at $1.00 and worthless at $0.98. If it hits $0.98 it might as well go to zero. And now it might!&#34;I have in the past told the story of TerraUSD and Luna by saying: The weakness in TerraUSD is Luna. One UST can be exchanged for $1 of Luna, but that only works if people continue to have confidence in Luna; if Luna goes to zero then TerraUSD will follow. But you could also tell the story by saying: The weakness in Luna is TerraUSD. Luna, as the cryptocurrency of a blockchain ecosystem, would rise or fall with the value of that ecosystem. But Luna, as the thing supporting a stablecoin, could go to zero in a week if that stablecoin needed support. Terra was so unstable because it was trying to be stable.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I interviewed with Terraform Labs less than a year ago. The guy interviewing me was a pretty standard eng manager who&#39;d left Amazon for the excitment of a crypto startup. I tried to prep for the interview by researching their white papers to figure out how the various balancing and investment mechanisms actually functioned on a technical level. But it was difficult to make sense of their white paper, which was fairly general, and different portions of their documentation seemed to contradict one another. When I asked what I&#39;d been misunderstanding, he told me that I hadn&#39;t misunderstood anything: their white paper was not a full spec, and their documentation was out of date. In that case, I asked, how could one actually understand the protocol? &#34;It&#39;s probably not possible at this point,&#34; he told me, &#34;These things are in motion all the time.&#34; I thought his answer was pretty eye-opening.Their interview question was: design a simple app which allows one to query the effect of crypto price changes on the supply &amp; price of LUNA. I gathered that the upshot was, how big a movement would be required to break the $1 peg? I wonder if their models weren&#39;t good, or if their models were good, and they were just accepting a high level of risk?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"God! I hope both WhiteHat Jr. and their parent company Byju&#39;s crash and burn. They are crap companies which make poor and gullible parents enroll their kids in one of their programs for extortionate amount of money. If the parents cannot afford to pay all at once, they give a &#34;loan&#34; to the parents and collect a part of it each month even if the kids aren&#39;t satisfied with the education that is being provided. Note that none of the kids in India use these apps as the only way to study. They attend regular schools and use these apps as an additional source. Byju&#39;s employs 1000s of people whose only job is to go visit as many houses as they can and trick the parents into subscribing for their services by falsely claiming that the only way their kids can succeed is when their education is supplemented by these apps. Many innocent people who want to do all they can to make their kids&#39; lives better fall into the trap and then keep paying the &#34;loan&#34; amount back which could be a substantial part of their monthly income.Meta and Disney invested a lot of money into these companies and they use it to bully anyone who tries to bring these issues up by shutting down their YouTube channels and filing defamation law suits [1,2]. The entire online education industry is unregulated and resort to shitty antics to extort money. I don&#39;t understand why these companies need to exist when we have other free and amazing resources online like Khan Academy which teach all topics to all ages of people.[1] https://thepost.co.in/news/633/whitehat-jr-lawsuit-pradeep-p...[2] https://www.reddit.com/r/india/search?q=pradeep+poonia&amp;restr..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Lots of great additions. I will just highlight two:Column selection:When you have tons of columns these become useful. Clickhouse takes it to the next level and supports APPLY and COLUMN in addition to EXCEPT, REPLACE which DuckDB supports:    - APPLY: apply a function to a set of columns
    - COLUMN: select columns by matching a regular expression (!)

Details here: https://clickhouse.com/docs/en/sql-reference/statements/sele...Allow trailing commas:I can&#39;t count how many times I&#39;ve run into a problem with a trailing comma. There&#39;s a whole convention developed to overcome this: the prefix comma convention where you&#39;d write:    SELECT
      first_column
      ,second_column
      ,third_column

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a bit buried at the bottom, but:&gt; For Linux users, we removed the connection from content processes to the X11 Server, which stops attackers from exploiting the unsecured X11 protocol.It&#39;s hard to overstate how much of a benefit this is in terms of security for those on Linux. Any application with access to the X11 socket effectively has the keys to the kingdom, because it can hijack other applications, including those running at higher privileges, at will. (There have been halfhearted attempts to address this over the years, but nothing that&#39;s been effective or widely adopted.) The only real solution for desktop app security on Linux is to forbid direct access to X11 entirely, and so it&#39;s a huge deal that Firefox is now able to do this.In general, doing this sort of thing is a monumental undertaking for large applications like Firefox. Kudos to my former colleagues for pulling it off."</p>

The easy way out was to switch to arbitrary app-drawn widgets across all platforms (which Firefox did for all basic DOM HTML elements); the &#34;we&#39;ll do one better&#34; alternative is to use app-drawn imitations of the system-native widgets (a la Qt) which Firefox is now doing for the scrollbar. But no one ever gets these widgets right (unnatural scrolling, non-identical behavior when clicking in the gapped region, different scrollable-to-nonscrollable widget ratios, colors not respecting certain subtle theming choices, etc, etc.I wonder if there was an alternative specifically for the scrollbar here - some way of obtaining an outer &#34;shell&#34; (via win32k, but then basically &#34;orphaning&#34; it so that you can&#39;t do anything besides kill it when you&#39;re finished) that just provides the window with an empty scrollable element that is then populated by the restricted process.That ship has really sailed though; I think the days of native widgets are quickly coming to an end."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I strongly feel that the spammers thing is smoke and mirrors.The deal at $54.20 was maybe OK for him a month ago (it was great for Twitter because nobody else was interested at that price). Since then, Twitter reported disappointing numbers for the past quarter, and the entire market took a nose dive, with tech hit especially hard.TWTR stock price was in the mid-30s before Musk&#39;s offer. Without the offer, and with the disappointing numbers, and with the recent market development, one could reasonably assume that the stock would be below 30 today.Musk should just pay the break fee of $1bn, and renegotiate for $42.69 or whatever meme number he fancies. Why pay $42bn total for something when you can get it for $30bn."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt;&gt;Twitter deal temporarily on hold pending details supporting calculation that spam/fake accounts do indeed represent less than 5% of usersHe is asking for proof that spam and fake accounts are less than 5% of total users. He obviously believes the number is much higher[1]. This does not seem to be a deal killer - he is just calling their bluff[2]. Maybe they are right. Maybe not. We will see. Interesting times![1] https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1517215066550116354[2] https://www.reuters.com/technology/twitter-estimates-spam-fa..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a lot of talk about how Elon is weaseling out of this. That may be true but you should know something about acquisitions. Typically there is a termination or breakup fee that one side has to pay for walking away or if the deal falls through. AT&amp;T paid billions for the failed takeover of T-Mobile [1], for example.The Musk Twitter deal has a $1 billion termination fee [2] on both sides. Now it&#39;s unclear on what conditions would trigger this exactly. In Twitter&#39;s case, it at least includes accepting another offer. On Musk&#39;s end, it includes if financing falls through.So here&#39;s the $1 billion question: what happens if (as Musk might argue) Twitter made material misrepresentations about their business, specifically to do with how many users they actually have? This might be an out for Musk or it might not.Personally I&#39;ve long thought there are a huge number of fake Twitter accounts and Twitter is actively disincentivized from ever finding out if that&#39;s true or not. Put another way: they like their big numbers for active accounts, DAU and MAU.But if Twitter is found to be materially misrepresenting those numbers, they have way more serious problems than if the Musk deal falls through. They&#39;ve then opened themselves up to litigation by the SEC and investors that they materially misled investors.Things could actually get really ugly for Twitter here regardless of what happens with the Musk deal.If you think about it, this could be a relatively cheap way of mortally wounding Twitter. Make a buyout offer, get access to the books, prove they&#39;re lying about DAU/MAU, walk away with no termination fee paid, watch the executive team get sued into oblivion and the company tanks.[1]: https://money.cnn.com/2011/11/24/technology/att_t-mobile_bre...[2]: https://techcrunch.com/2022/04/26/elon-musks-twitter-deal-in..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work for non-tech generating 100million+ in revenue. Cushy job, fully remote, good pay and full autonomy with flexible hours working as an IC.I recently talked to a startup, similar pay, culture would be a better fit since it was mostly techies and I&#39;m a nerd by nature.....but things just got awkward as soon as I asked about their revenue....they were bleeding money and I was told they were being acquired by a big corp. Also, the tone worried me, the confidence the CEO presented early in the call disappeared.I also tried digging deeper into their business and what they were selling, as I have interest in that space due to my hobbies. I literally didn&#39;t see a need for their startup to exist. But I&#39;m just an average developer what do I know."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been a long time coming.Back in the day, there was an inherent understanding that a stock price is supposed to reflect &#34;the fundamentals&#34; - present value of the company + future earnings. And of course there was some amount of speculation around future earnings, but for the most part companies at least tried to be profitable.But if you look at the share price of like, Tesla - it&#39;s completely insane. There is no way your slice of the company is worth that much. The stock market has been behaving like a pyramid scheme, where everyone assumed there will be more money entering than leaving any given stock.Tech is a pretty egregious sector because of how many business models basically boil down to &#34;we don&#39;t actually need to make money if we have a desirable stock&#34;. In the long run, I don&#39;t think we&#39;ll be worse off if the next generation of software companies actually focuses on making products people want to buy rather than play games with DAU and user acquisition and etc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"(Former AI researcher / founder here)It always surprises me at the ease at which people jump on a) imminent AGI and b) human extinction in the face of AGI. Would love for someone to correct me / add information here to the contrary. Generalist here just refers to a &#34;multi-faceted agent&#34; vs &#34;General&#34; like AGI.For a) - I see 2 main blockers,1) A way to build second/third order reasoning systems that rely on intuitions that haven&#39;t already been fed into the training sets. The sheer amount of inputs a human baby sees and processes and knows how to apply at the right time is an unsolved problem. We don&#39;t have any ways to do this.2) Deterministic reasoning towards outcomes. Most statistical models rely on &#34;predicting&#34; outputs, but I&#39;ve seen very little work where the &#34;end state&#34; is coded into a model. Eg: a chatbot knowing that the right answer is &#34;ordering a part from amazon&#34; and guiding users towards it, and knowing how well its progressing to generate relevant outputs.For (b) -- I doubt human extinction happens in any way that we can predict or guard against.In my mind, it happens when autonomous systems optimizing reward functions to &#34;stay alive&#34; (by ordering fuel, making payments, investments etc) fail because of problems described above in (a) -- the inability to have deterministic rules baked into them to avoid global fail states in order to achieve local success states. (Eg, autonomous power plant increases output to solve for energy needs -&gt; autonomous dam messes up something structural -&gt; cascade effect into large swathes of arable land and homes destroyed).Edit: These rules can&#39;t possibly all be encoded by humans - they have to be learned through evaluation of the world. And we have not only no way to parse this data at a global scale, but also develop systems that can stick to a guardrail."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I’m not sure how to word my excitement about the progress we see in AI research in the last years. If you haven’t read it, give Tim Urbans classic piece a slice of your attention: https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revol...It’s a very entertaining read from a couple of years ago (I think I’ve read it in 2017), and man, have things happened in the field since then. If feels like things truly start coming together. Transformers and then some incremental progress look like a very, very promising avenue. I deeply wonder in which areas this will shape the future more than we are able to anticipate beforehand."</p>

https://www.metaculus.com/questions/3479/date-weakly-general...(I really like the framing of &#34;weakly general AI&#34; since it puts the emphasis on the generality and not whether it&#39;s a superintelligence)Edit: Probably not today, but mostly because 1.2B parameters isn&#39;t enough to get it the high winograd scores that PaLM etc have. But it seems pretty clear you could scale this architecture up and it will likely pass. The question is when someone will actually train a model that can do it"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I wanted wired Ethernet in my office but didn&#39;t want to punch holes in the wall. Luckily I have an old &#34;central vacuum system&#34; that as far as I can tell has never been even powered on, many years before I bought the house.I tied a ping pong ball to a piece of string and used a vacuum cleaner to suck it through the pipes, then used the string to pull a stronger rope and then the Ethernet cable. So now my Ethernet goes from my office to the wireless router via the vacuum ducting."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Yeah, I&#39;ve never really seen the appeal.  Wires are just so reliable.  I am always in meetings with &#34;sorry, my headphones died, can you repeat that&#34; or people mysteriously vanishing because their laptop can&#39;t charge as fast as Zoom draws power and their computer just dies.  I have a wired mic, headphones, and power, and it just never breaks.Wireless is just temporary, if you have wireless headphones, you have to plug in a wire to charge them.  If your computer has a battery built in, you have to plug it in every day to charge.  So it&#39;s just an extra chore that makes your life worse.  Not that exciting.Maybe everyone fantasizes about being a digital nomad.  I do not.  I have a great desk, chair, keyboard, and 3 monitors.  I couldn&#39;t work without them.  If I want to see the world, I&#39;ll go do that without bringing my computer.  A vacation with your computer is just work.A question I&#39;m asked is &#34;what if there&#39;s a power outage&#34; but we have had about 10 total minutes of power outage here in Brooklyn in the 10 years I&#39;ve lived here (during Hurricane Sandy).  My thought is I just won&#39;t do any work if there isn&#39;t any power.  We waste an hour a day dealing with wireless not working, 10 minutes every 10 years is no big deal.  (&#34;But what if it&#39;s the big one!?&#34;  Then my ISP&#39;s backup batteries will also be drained and I still can&#39;t work.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is one reason why I&#39;m still down on Apple&#39;s decision to remove 1/8&#34; audio jacks from iPhones: they took away a decades old &#34;just works&#34; standard that wasn&#39;t subject to interference or battery or latency issues and replaced it with something that fundamentally is. Their efforts at filing down the sharp edges here with the airpods (and they have done as well as anyone could expect and more) don&#39;t change the fundamentals.&#34;Get a dongle&#34; -- maybe I will when I finally give up my original iPhone SE, but I&#39;m not going to be cheerful about paying an extra $30 for the privilege along with the overhead of keeping track of an additional thing."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is going to be a polemical comment, but I feel compelled to share it:It&#39;s my opinion that a great deal of the blame (if not the outright majority) for this state of affairs can be levied against suburban culture (and, by extension, car culture).The communities that hand-wring the most about predators and risks to children tend to be middle class, suburban, and white. They drive their children everywhere, and thereby are (somewhat) alienated from the idea of a &#34;local community&#34; beyond the immediate neighborhood (which can only be entered or exited by car.) Things like childcare are purchasable services, not kindnesses that you or your neighbor do for each other when the other&#39;s in a pinch. When this is your bubble (or, for the rest of us, the dominant cultural metaphor for responsible parenting), it&#39;s hard not to see the world as a foreign and scary place, with unknown levels of unknown danger."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Friend of mine runs a local eatery.  She told her 9-year old son to walk across the street - literally to the candy shop where she knows the owner, and told the kid to do some homework for an hour.  Police brought her son back and threatened to charge her with endangerment or abandonment or something similar.  This was... 2018 IIRC.They live about 1.5 miles from the eatery.  She would let her 9 year old walk home sometimes in good weather - low crime with actual tree-lined suburban streets.  Police apparently threatened her over that as well - that&#39;s somehow endangering the child too much, and she might be charged with some misdemeanor.I don&#39;t get it.  Really.  As someone who grew up in the 70s/80s... I can&#39;t say &#39;nothing bad ever happened&#39;.  Obviously it did.  But the pendulum has swung far too much the other way now."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Glad to see progress in this space.I couldn&#39;t find anything describing the paradigm used for the JavaScript frontend. From the video, it looks like things are fully server side rendered, i.e. no client side routing as-in SvelteKit or Next.js? Are the Svelte components hydrated+interactive after page load? In my experience so far with SvelteKit and other SSR+SPA frameworks, there are too many tradeoffs with hydrating then opting to CSR for subsequent navigation. I like the browser&#39;s built-in implementation of navigating between pages because it preserves things like mutations to the document and scroll position out of the box, with no additional JavaScript. If you collapse a comment in this thread, navigate back to the home page, then use your browser&#39;s back button, the comment you collapsed should still be collapsed. In my experience with SPA CSR, you&#39;ll need to track and restore the JavaScript state driving that collapse on your own (a combination of the window.history object and CSR hooks), since navigating back to the page is a full client side re-render of the page.I&#39;ve found Svelte+React have good support for TypeScript, especially for guaranteeing the types of props passed to components, are there plans to support this? With controllers in Go and Views in Svelte/React, is there any way to help with correctness of data passed as props to the Svelte components?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nice, with generics, some things that were hard are easier to do when it comes to polymorphism thus code re-use.Go community has been pretty &#34;anti-framework&#34; (AKA &#34;just use net/http&#34; when it clearly doesn&#39;t solve every problems..., &#34;don&#39;t put request scoped variables in context&#34; when it&#39;s the very purpose of that interface...) and there was a lot of drama around some framework creators, unlike any other web language community I have seen by the way (remember Martini and the insane backlash? Iris and the constant drama, was that Iris, I don&#39;t even remember the name...) so it will be pretty interesting to see the reception for that framework.One advice to the author, congrats but don&#39;t call your framework &#34;framework&#34;, it&#39;s like the go community hate that word, just say &#34;a set of useful libraries to help web development&#34;, it seems like euphemisms are easier to swallow for some..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Author here. Working at a tech company as a developer vs working at a non-tech company are very different.These two types of roles were called line vs staff when I took a business school class and I think the differences between these two types of roles have a big impact on what the job is like, even if doing the same type of work. It&#39;s a bit confusing because it overlaps with &#39;staff software engineer&#39; term.I recall hearing stats before that the vast majority of developers work at non-tech companies, but I almost never hear their stories. They are the dark matter of software developers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been both staff and line at various companies.The biggest downside to staff IME is that you are almost constantly reminded that you are a cost and at danger of being cut.OTOH, the biggest upside is the domain knowledge, and in particular, how companies (ie customers of the line engineers) really deploy and run their systems, which IME is often very different from how the line engineers think they run them.Line engineers tend to gloss over the myriad of external influences that affect how easy their systems are to deploy and integrate (eg how many FTEs doe it take to operate your systems, how long is an acceptable maintenance window for applying fixes, how long does it take to roll back if a fix fails, etc).An experienced staff engineer introduced to a line team can be a huge asset, and will ask the right kind of questions, ie those that the customer is often most interested in."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Related to this article: The owner of a company (non-startup, but growing and profitable) I used to work for gave me great career advice. He said to always focus on things that produce revenue. If you aren&#39;t doing things that produce revenue, try to move into those areas if possible.His view was that revenue can soar 100%, 200%, 1,000%, 10,000% or however high. Cost savings, on the other hand, can only go down to a maximum of 100% (but obviously much lower in practice). So in his mind, a business-wide focus on growing revenue is always better than a focus on cutting costs. If you are in the second boat, it means the company is struggling and maybe it&#39;s time to get out.Obviously, a rational CEO would see $1m cost savings the same as a $1m gain in profits, but CEO&#39;s are not rational beings (nor is any human) and understanding that they usually prefer higher revenue to lower costs is fundamental to understanding how they value different parts of the company. It&#39;s not fair, it&#39;s just truth (at least in many companies).There&#39;s something refreshing about some hedge funds where portfolio managers are rewarded exclusively on their own performance. For example, if the fund loses money, but you continue to bring in great revenue, you can bet that any sane hedge fund will pay you a lot to stay around, regardless of how they are doing overall. Unfortunately (or maybe fortunately), profit in most companies isn&#39;t directly attributable in the way it is at hedge funds. But the same truth holds. If you are bringing in good profit, it&#39;s hard to get rid of you (or not pay you well) regardless of how the company is doing overall. Try to be in one of those profit centers, if you can."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"So there&#39;s two options right - the first is that Parag is for some reason making big strategic decisions about the direction of the company despite the fact that we all know he&#39;ll be gone if the deal closes. Or he&#39;s making big strategic changes at the behest of the acquirers before the deal closes.Neither of these things seem particularly kosher moves to make. The question is how to figure out which one it is.It would seem weird for Parag to be following Musk&#39;s orders given how Musk has behaved. It also seems weird for Musk to already have the insight into the company to know specifically who to fire. There&#39;s not much advantage to making these changes now.On the other hand, going rogue and making big strategic decisions about the company really has the potential to burn Parag&#39;s reputation for wherever he would move next.I guess there&#39;s a third option - that Musk has expressed a specific view, Parag has a different view, but that they both think that this move is necessary anyway so just got on and did it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been using Twitter since it&#39;s main novelty was that it was a successful Ruby on Rails app, and honestly I&#39;ve been trying to figure out where the exit is for my personal use of Twitter lately. If the acquisition goes through, Twitter won&#39;t make enough money to service it&#39;s debt, and the things they will do to fix that are pretty much guaranteed to lower the quality of the platform, which frankly has never worked very well for me anyways. The fact that they&#39;re doing a leadership purge right now is not helping my opinion on this.I also think the proposal to have Twitter allow all content that is &#34;legal under US law&#34; is a dangerous idea for the platform being a healthy community that most people actually want to participate in. Content moderation debates have never been so ham-fisted as they are online so I won&#39;t try here, suffice to say there&#39;s some pretty horrible, disgusting things that are &#34;legal under US law&#34; (and as a content moderator, I&#39;ve seen them all). If Twitter allows people to do them, it will make it difficult for Twitter to maintain a healthy community, and the platform could quickly devolve into a scarychan-style sewer that only the craziest people on the internet will want to dwell in. To say nothing about whether advertisers will tolerate some of it, or even Apple&#39;s app store."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There was some discussion on plausible NATO membership of Finland and Sweden. At that point the disucssion was based on guestimates from media.But now it&#39;s official. This is not the NATO membership application, but a statement from the political leadership in Finland that they support and suggest parliament proceeds with the application process with maximum urgency.The President and Prime Minister of Finland have published their position on NATO membership. This more or less seals Finland joining NATO.In Finnish system, the Prime Minister has most political power but president is the head of foreign policy. Their common statement was the required signal for the parliament to proceed with the process.Translation:
During the spring, there has been an important discussion about Finland&#39;s possible NATO membership. Time has been needed for domestic position formation both in Parliament and in society as a whole. Time has been needed for close international contacts with both NATO and its member countries, as well as with Sweden. We have wanted to give the debate the space it needs.Now that the time for decision-making is approaching, we also state our own common positions for the information of parliamentary groups and parties. NATO membership would strengthen Finland&#39;s security. As a member of NATO, Finland would strengthen the entire defense alliance. Finland must apply for NATO membership as a matter of urgency. We hope that the national steps still needed to reach this solution will be taken swiftly in the coming days.Sauli Niinistö

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The thing that I think some people miss about Tether is that it&#39;s not about whether it is backed enough it&#39;s either fully backed or it isn&#39;t. If it&#39;s not, it&#39;s not a question of whether it&#39;s back enough to weather this storm, it&#39;s about whether the people running it think they can weather this storm. If they think they can keep it running they&#39;ll sell whatever backing they have and keep the peg. But if they even think there&#39;s a decent chance they can&#39;t permanently sustain the peg then the best thing for them to do is take the backing and run, not sink it into a stable-coin they now know isn&#39;t going to work. That&#39;s going to happen way before they run out of money.Let&#39;s say for example, Tether is 20% backed and there&#39;s $100Bn  of coins so the backing is $20Bn, and people start flooding out of it. Let&#39;s say $10Bn floods out. So the guys running it have handed out $10Bn. They now have $10Bn left, and money is still flooding out. Do they really continue to hand over the cash or do they say &#34;Well, the whole thing is about to explode anyway, I&#39;d rather keep the $10Bn cash I&#39;ve got left&#34;. At which point the holders of the coin have to play &#34;Find these fuckers and sue them&#34; which will be difficult since they&#39;ve got $10Bn to fight/flee/hide."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The entire concept of a &#34;stablecoin&#34; reminds me a lot of something from SIGBOVIK 2014. Keep in mind, this was written in 2014, before any stablecoins actually existed, and that SIGBOVIK is supposed to be a joke conference where people present extremely silly ideas as if they were real breakthroughs.&gt;  DollarCoin: We propose skipping the middleman and providing direct proof-of-dollar with a blockchain that consists of videos of burning US $1 notes. Each video will be unique as the hash of every block header is required to be written on the dollar bill to be burnt; the block header includes the previous block’s hash, which means that each block is forced to build on every previous block, forming a valid blockchainhttp://sigbovik.org/2014/proceedings.pdfThe fact is, people have convinced themselves that this is somehow a good idea. And then half the time, the person behind it doesn&#39;t actually burn any money and just arbitrarily mints coins. It&#39;s absolute lunacy."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Tether is back up to around $0.98, but volume is high. Somebody is pouring cash into Tether to support the price.Similar over at UST. Price is back up to $0.60, but volume is far above normal.Remember, with a stablecoin, there is no upside to holding. Any indication of risk means it&#39;s time to get out. Even if Tether has enough reserves to get the price back to $1, there will be substantial cashing out.That&#39;s why a stablecoin has only two stable points: 1 and 0."</p>

In my opinion astronomy is jumping the shark with these images by making this a big PR stunt.I&#39;ve looked at their methods for their earlier images and they seem to be hunting for a circle that looks like a black hole in their data. The EHT&#39;s full imaging stack has never been calibrated by looking at a known celestial body to compare images to validate their algorithms. They have calibrated their signals from results of other instruments, but their imaging algorithms change to fit their wanted results. This is my biggest problem with their approach. Anyone can modify algorithms of any arbitrary data to get an image of a glowing circle. A better method that shows a more true image would be to calibrate their imaging algorithms against a known celestial body to make sure their techniques produced comparable results from other instruments. Then they should have taken their calibrated imaging algorithms and gave it data from their target.I&#39;d have more confidence in the EHT if they would not change their imaging algorithms across images and give a side-by-side comparison of a known celestial body that other radio telescopes have imaged to verify their whole imaging stack.To me this a just a big PR stunt and I&#39;m very skeptical of their image."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s scary, because CSAM (child sexual abuse material) is very, very broad, and quite vague in its definition¹. My three year old son stayed with my parents for a week, and he was being taught to swim in their swimming pool. Of course, I get sent pictures and clips of his progress by a proud grandma, and of course, him being a toddler, he felt swimming trunks to be completely optional (and of course, they are at his age in a private pool).That&#39;s not CSAM right? But who knows how the AI will mark those happy pics? Some quirk in its programming and training leading to them being pushed way up whatever ranking is used? It&#39;s a nude child after all, and that is most likely one of the few things such an algorithm can detect quite reliably.The automated filter won&#39;t care about the context though, and if any of the recent failures of algorithms ruining peoples lives are anything to go by (the Dutch Toeslagenaffaire comes to mind), being flagged by the CSAM filter is a high risk event — even if you can clear your name later by human intervention — because now you are on a list.1: People tend to conjure up horrific images of underage children getting raped by adults when they hear &#39;CSAM&#39; or &#39;child pornography&#39;, but when you read up on the legal definitions used it becomes very vague, quite fast. A seventeen year old boy sending a dick pic to his 18 year old lover is producing child pornography and can in many jurisdictions be sentenced as such, and nudism of any minor can be seen as CSAM if the pose they strike can be construed as &#39;erotic&#39; — yet there is no clear definition of what this means, falling squarely into “I&#39;ll know it when I see it” territory."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t think this proposal is quite enough, we can do better to protect the children.The homes of the people who champion this proposal should be thoroughly searched for child abuse materials every week. Naturally, their personal electronic devices should be taken for analysis. I understand this may cause them some inconvenience, but think of the children!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The worst thing is that, while the EU proposes dubious stuff like this, the police doesn&#39;t actually try to remove such content from the internet or are at least really ineffective at doing so. There was a documentary[1] from the german public tv station NDR in which reporters / journalists managed to delete the majority of content from one such CSAM forum, by sending deletion requests to the hosters. The police just... did nothing about it? :/It&#39;s mind boggling. It would be nice if only 50% of the energy put into laws with questionable results like this, would be used to give victims of sexual child abuse more help and support (or, in many cases, some at all) to continue living as much as possible despite the monsters in their own heads that such sexual abuse creates, wouldn&#39;t it? :/[1] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iItLpwkQMUQ

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s less that I&#39;m glad the market is crashing, and more that I&#39;m glad that the insufferable crypto bros are finally getting a punch to the mouth. Seriously, these people are the worst. Your average &#34;crypto investor&#34; has no skills, no mathematical foundations, nothing. Except for pure stupid luck, and the ability to spew inane crypto babble 24/7. And yes, they think they are much smarter than you, because they achieved better financial results than you did while only doing 1/1000 of the work to get there. I truly hate the fact that these people are so rich. It makes me want to move to Alaska and just try to ignore society for the rest of my days.This came off as pretty bitter. I apologize, but I am bitter, and I&#39;m having a shit couple weeks."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel bad for people losing money, but crypto has not lived up to its potential at all, remains a solution looking for a problem, and is an environmental disaster.I used to be a huge believer. Brian Armstrong gave me my first Bitcoin in 2011 at District in SOMA. Electricity was included in my rent so I bought 10 video cards and mined for about two years on 5 systems. At a company I founded, I use Bitcoin to pay for food and drinks. According to the Barista, I was the first person to ever pay for coffee with Bitcoin at Coupa Cafe (despite having to stand there and wait 10 minutes while the transaction cleared).But nothing has come of it. All the years of promises and applications, nothing. Ether DApps, sure, but how much of the modern internet runs on those? I also mined StorJ and Monero for years. Apart from a way of making money and storing value, crypto is useless. Processing fees are way too high to even be considered as a replacement for payments not to mention other barriers such as the ability to integrate with antiquated point of sale systems entirely designed around credit/debit and cash.So I put all of my holdings into a retirement account and don&#39;t worry about the price. But I&#39;ve given up on crypto and everyone who babbles on endlessly like they know something I don&#39;t about how it&#39;s going to change the world. So even if Crypto loses its value some, I&#39;m glad because the lack of easy, effortless gains will disappear for a lot of those people and most of these short term hucksters will fade away. I&#39;ll gladly exchange crypto&#39;s price for less crypto bros. My cost basis is around $150 so I have a long ways to go before I care that much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s a Macro crash. SP500 is down -%5 YTD. Meta -37%, Netflix -65%. Lots of pain spreading. You shouldn&#39;t gloat or be happy. Give it a couple of more months like this, and lots of the HN audience would be worried about layoffs.The security of your average software developer job is strongly tied to market cycles.If you want a place to direct your hate and bitterness, I would do it at the architects of the BOOM/BUSTS cycles that keeps happenings and destroys people lives."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve only ever &#34;shipped&#34; two independent projects, and they are the the best things I have ever done for myself in terms of development, both from a personal career growth perspective but even financially.I work at a nonprofit and I had done some ABSURDLY SIMPLE data analysis on a relatively annoying public data set to consume. I&#39;d done it for our institution, but it was sort of straightforward to generalize it to any institution for which this would be applicable. The code was... awful. Rather than doing it &#34;properly,&#34; since I already had all the code I had written to do the analysis for my institution, I literally just ran it on the entire data set (10GB or so) for every organization that existed and then just put some result file on S3. My &#34;site&#34; would just let folks search for their institution, and present the data with a couple graphs, some nice visuals, and have them print it out. I was ashamed of it in a technical sense.But I just bought a domain and tweeted at a journalist. Whelp, two weeks later, I had my picture in the city&#39;s biggest paper, my org got some positive press, did a service for other non-profits, had folks reaching out to me about jobs, etc. It took SO LITTLE effort, and every instinct I had was that it was bad and I shouldn&#39;t publish it. But the reality is I had already done 95% of the work... committing to just do the extra 5% was so hard to do, but in hindsight, so obviously amazing ROI, even if it hadn&#39;t gotten the attention it did.Secondly, I built a reading app for a teacher at my school to let him do an activity where kids would jumble up sentences and paragraphs in order to help them understand transition words. The only reason I agree to try to do this was that I was learning React at the time and wanted to play with the React drag and drop library. After a weekend, I had it essentially working, and it was a success in his classroom. And here, too, it was to be the end of it... but I pushed myself through it, added a simple login mechanic, user account, etc. I had a small technical question as I was wrapping up, and I posted it on reddit. Someone who worked at a nonprofit mentioned to me that the app could potentially qualify for a grant that the Verizon foundation was running for learning apps. I applied... and we got it. The money award helped pay for my entire grad school tuition.Really... just ship it!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A big fallacy that I always see - and that is implied by this post - is that the work ends after shipping, a.k.a. &#34;build it and they will come&#34;. That doesn&#39;t happen any more. So after you &#34;ship&#34; it, you need to promote it, advertise it, create buzz around it and make people use it. 
And that is a totally different kind of beast than coding something.But on the flip side, if you develop a side project just for yourself, you most certainly learn something. Heck, the author explicitly mentioned learning React Native, which is absolutely great and definitely worth investing time into.Learning things is valuable in itself."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; My app is officially dead.Most markets are large enough to accommodate several businesses. There&#39;s really no reason to stop working on something just because you find that there is already someone solving that same problem.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I noticed this too when I used steam to stream a game to my laptop over good wifi. Every minute it would stutter for a second. I set up iperf3 tests and noticed the wifi lag increasing every minute between my macbook and my server and between my windows desktop pc and my server (when connected over wifi). Of course no lag when using cables, so I reasoned it was wifi related, and had noting to do with my setup (I used different clients, and different AP&#39;s). I then took my macbook (only portable computer I had) it too a nearby coffee shop with good wifi and I could still measure lag spikes every minute. So then I was really puzzled, was there some rogue device interfering with wifi all over the neighborhood? Finally I found a suggestion to turn off location services (or whatever it is called), and the spikes disappeared. And I learnt that even when it is not used (not sure it the lid was closed) a macbook can cause significant interference to the wifi for all other nearby devices."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is normal across all wifi clients; they can&#39;t scan for networks and transfer data simultaneously so there will always be increased latency during that event. You can test this yourself by doing a low-interval ping and clicking the wifi icon to show you nearby networks - you&#39;ll notice a brief latency spike.I agree that it&#39;s not a good default to have an app doing this, though."</p>

I was about to make a joke about it but I&#39;m actually serious.Once I, a former Houstonian with no experience driving on ice, was driving through the snowy mountains and lost control of my car. Instead of panicking, my video-game-induced laser focus kicked in and I calmly piloted the car until the wheels gained traction and I could park the car on the side of the road.But learning how to focus in the midst of chaos, instead of panicking, is a technique I specifically had to learn in childhood to beat challenging levels of Super Mario Brothers.Thanks, video games."</p>

And they aren’t SPIC insured in the situations where crypto is a security.It’s funny to see people shocked (SHOCKED!) when crypto doesn’t have the protections of regular banking and investments. That’s why you don’t invest with stuff that isn’t insured. Those aren’t real rates, they are risk adjusted rates for not having insurance.It’s fine to invest in these products, but scary because people aren’t doing due diligence and have unrealistic expectations.The CEO’s statement that they won’t go bankrupt it just comical. Of course he thinks they won’t. Few bank CEOs think that. But real banks and brokerages have insurance for their customers in the rare situation that they go bankrupt."</p>

Ship the SQL statements that did the write and reapply them? Lots of performance and other tradeoffs here.What&#39;s the latency like? This likely doesn&#39;t run in every edge location. Does the database ship out on the first request. Get cached with an expiry? Does the request itself move to the database instead of running at the edge - like maybe this runs on a select subset of locations?So many questions, but no details yet."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I once sent out a proposal on the FreeBSD lists to merge /sbin with /bin, and /usr/sbin with /usr/bin. People were concerned that this would slow down the system, due to PATH lookups taking longer. Even when I demonstrated the opposite was true (it being faster due to fewer directories needing to be scanned), I wasn&#39;t able to get consensus. What a shame."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve read this explanation a couple of times, and if you go all the way back to PDP-11 the split does indeed sound ridiculous. I had my first contact with Linux from some magazine CDs in the late 90s, I think it was Red Hat or SUSE based. The documentation there had a much clearer explaination:/sbin, /usr/sbin is for binaries that need root. You put them in separate directories so their permissions all match up, and so they don&#39;t show up when completing in bash.The paths without /usr - /bin and /sbin - are available from the get go. It is the very first partition that is mounted, and what is guaranteed to be available if you do &#34;init 1&#34; or boot in single user mode. You can also do fsck from there (assuming the boot partition is not damaged). I don&#39;t know how this integrated with initrd (initramfs wasn&#39;t a thing yet). I think there was only one &#34;base system&#34; - either initrd was very basic, or the whole base was in initrd, or something similar.The paths with /usr were managed by the package manager. Word of mouth was: don&#39;t install anything manually there. If you do (via make install), keep around the source so you can do make uninstall. But better install to /usr/local or /opt."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bad/illogical/outdated directory structure is one of the most annoying things I&#39;ve encountered while using Linux, because it makes the admin job feel unnecessarily messy (things are all over the place), and it feels as if there&#39;s a fundamental imbalance in the system that you can&#39;t get rid of."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I recently left a stressful job after developing shingles and then celiac disease. My life is much worse now, I went into that job healthy and strong and now I&#39;m sick all the time. Perhaps celaic disease was always in the genetic cards for me, or maybe the stress triggered it? The worst part is the job wasn&#39;t especially bad, it was a reasonable job, and I can expect my next job to have similar stress I think. What am I going to do?I&#39;m always amazed at the change in perspective after being in a job for a while. While unemployed, I feel competent, I make progress on hard problems nobody else in the world is working on, and I feel good. While employed, stupid crap stresses me constantly, I can&#39;t leave the stress at work, I bring it home, I obsess about social hierarchies that can vanish in an instant. Everytime I&#39;ve left a job I&#39;m amazed that after just a couple days I can barely remember what I was working on before and what stressed me, like my brain knows all of that no longer matters and let&#39;s it go in an instant.How can I keep a healthy outside perspective while remaining employed? How do I avoid becoming mentally trapped in the workplace mindset? I&#39;ve been giving this a lot of thought, but no answers so far."</p>

Everyone was either coasting and depressed/disengaged, or overworked and stressed (I would say 80% were the former). People were frustrated about the bureaucracy, the promo process, the slow pace, the meaninglessness of the work an individual IC does, the stress for managers. Even on a super sexy project dealing with cutting edge AI that got tons of press coverage, everyone was frustrated. This company has a serious cultural issue."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; In 2020, the pandemic destroyed bucket #3 for most people. We were no different. Friends from back home in Canada couldn’t visit us. Even meeting up with local friends became hard. In January 2021 I tore my achilles tendon playing pick-up basketball. There goes bucket #2.&gt; Only then did I realize bucket #1 had been running low for a while.I&#39;m somewhat puzzled. If the author is struggling to socialize with friends (bucket #3) and struggling to pay attention to physical health (bucket #2) then why does he think that this is going to help improve work-life balance:&gt; I work more hours. I’m more likely to be working in the evening or on the weekend now.I can empathize with the desire to get caught up in a high-energy startup (it&#39;s fun!) but this whole blog post reads like someone trying to replace an increasingly disappointing personal life with excessive workaholism. Filling your days with extra work can fill the &#34;bucket #1&#34; (career) but it seems like a nail in the coffin for the author&#39;s problems with bucket #2 (physical health) and bucket #3 (social life).Posts like this are a dream come true for investors and startup founders. &#34;Lacking satisfaction in your life? Come work harder for less money at someone else&#39;s startup!&#34; I suspect this blog post is going to become a staple on VC Twitter and in startup recruiting pitches for the next few years."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Bias up front: I work at Google.Something I try to do whenever I read articles like this: Whenever you see the name of the giant corporation that the author worked at, replace it with &#34;my team&#34;. Google has over 100,000 employees, so there&#39;s no real &#34;here&#39;s what it&#39;s like to work at Google&#34;. At that scale, there is too much variance for any simple neat summary (though there are certainly trends and commonalities).I&#39;ve met people who worked at Amazon who described it as a hellscape of misery and others who felt it was incredibly rewarding. There&#39;s been times when I worked at EA when I loved my job and times when I hated it.A single data point is useful, but it&#39;s only a single data point. I&#39;m glad the author found a better job that fits what they&#39;re looking for. That&#39;s all any of us really want in our careers."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What will the author blog in 5 years?I am noticing a (darkish?) pattern in these recurring “I transitioned jobs” reports. Worryingly, they represent many of the words I imagine myself writing if I were again a blogger.It’s basically the honeymoon/wanderlust cycle. Person gets job. It is a dream job. It is described as a dream job because of reasons a1, b1, and c1. Delta t passes. Things have changed. Because of reasons x1, y1, and z1, job is no longer a good dream job. It’s now a bad dream/nightmare job. Person has awakened now, and for reasons, a2, b2, and c2 is living a new dream. Blink, flinch, repeat.The nagging suspicion is that while things change, they don’t so much actually. They shift around. What does change is how we come to see things. At one point, we convince ourselves things are awesome. Later we believe it’s not. Which is the real truth we ought to accept? It’s like trying to measure the one way speed of light. You can’t, just the sum of the round trip.So do we make the assumption that somewhere in the middle of this good-to-bad cycle is the reality? Or suspect it was always that bad, we were just able to initially gaslight ourselves? Or perhaps that it was and still is good, we’ve just let the negatives creep in and take over?Some would philosophize that all happiness is an illusion. Or a choice. Or whatever.But what frustrates me about this (having been through this cycle 3-4 times now), is that it is not a universal life experience. I have relationships with family, friends, and various institutions that grow stronger and stronger over time. They do NOT loop like work relationships do. Is there something inherit in work relationships that makes this loop inevitable? Do all experience it, or only a certain mindset of persons? Are there cases where this loop is broken, but they just rare enough, you don’t hear about them? Should I despair or hope?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Despite many maturity issues in practice Flutter is the only realistic option for true cross platform UIs that run everywhere. Apart from Qt , but the licensing issue is a hindrance. And yes, the web backend isn&#39;t ideal, but it will improve over time.I just wish Google had built Flutter on a low level core that isn&#39;t tied to Dart, so it would be usable from other languages.Dart isn&#39;t horrible and is getting better, but it is still a somewhat awkward mish mash of Java and JavaScript,  and  I  don&#39;t really enjoy using it.The only reason to use Dart is Flutter, which really hurts ecosystem health / library availability and prevents code sharing with the backend."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I was recently tasked to build a mobile app at my work, that would have maybe 5% of the feature-set of our gargantuan web product. However, this 5% was mission critical. Coming from React-TS, building with Flutter was a bit weird at first (where&#39;s my CSS???) but the productivity gains came quickly. The Pub ecosystem is fairly mature, in that all the third party packages are pretty high quality and address most common use cases. Unlike npm where there are 10+ solutions for the same problem, there will only be one - maybe 2 in Flutter land.I was very pleased to find out, that Flutter supported web as well. Now, it&#39;s not as good as mobile yet - some of the animations are render blocked by the JS main thread - but it is a very nice &#39;middle&#39; solution to somebody who needs to use the app who doesn&#39;t have iOS or Android (for example, Surface tablet). Also great for internal testing - push up the latest changes to a dev web environment, and everyone can test without installing APKs or using TestFlight.In my use case, I was actively discouraged against making something that looked beautiful or pretty - the software is designed to be spartan, minimalist and essential. Flutter is perfect for that.All in all, Flutter is awesome. Is it the right answer for everything? No. But when you only have one developer to spare whose job it is to build a mobile app, it&#39;s perfect for that. The web support is a nice bonus - haven&#39;t tried any of the desktop stuff yet.Dart, as a language, is nice. Not spectacular, but certainly tidier than Java or JavaScript. I&#39;ve gotten used to functionality programming, so writing everything in classes was jarring at first."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Flutter 3 comes with an upgrade to Dart 2.17 [1], which has quite a few improvements as well... including state on enums.While that&#39;s great, I was hoping it would be like in Rust, where each enum variant can declare its own state components, but unfortunately it seems to be more like Java: same state for all variants.Well, at least there&#39;s quite a few other small but useful improvements... and they showed how they really listen to the community by implementing the new syntax for passing on constructor parameters to a super-class... and by improving the docs of the 200 most popular packages with lots of examples, as requested by the people.I like how they&#39;re listening to the community as well to implement meta-programming (like macros) [2] to solve the main pain point, currently, in Dart, which is how verbose it is to generate code for things like serialization and data types.Once they get that, Dart will be a really good language to work on (it&#39;s already quite ok IMO, despite most people, usually those who don&#39;t actually use it much, hating on it).[1] https://medium.com/dartlang/dart-2-17-b216bfc80c5d[2] https://github.com/dart-lang/language/issues/1482"</p>
