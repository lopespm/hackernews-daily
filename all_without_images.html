								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Early in my career I got a Monday morning meeting invite on a Friday afternoon just after I left the office. The meeting was called “The future of &lt;business unit I was in&gt;“Entire weekend was a write off. I was so anxious.  And yep. They shut down the unit (but I got to keep my job).As a result this is forefront in my mind as a manager. One thing that works great is whenever I ask questions about something, anything, I also say “this is on my mind because…” and I find that both calms people and gets me more useful information. Context matters so much."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; When you’re communicating with your team, lead with context and reassurance. Never message someone on your team, “let’s talk when you get a minute”. That’s void of information and scary as heck!This should be engraved on a plaque in every office building."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The way I see it, if &#34;let&#39;s talk when you get a minute&#34; comes across as spooky that means you already have a communication breakdown and mistrust has already blossomed. Here&#39;s a slightly different scenario: You have a disagreement with management; there are many subsequent conversations happening behind the scenes; but no one keeps you in the loop or updates you on what is being decided. In that situation, practically any message (apart from &#34;here is exactly what we are thinking..&#34;) comes across as spooky, and you will start reading into what _isnt_ said.
In short, if you think someone might want to know something, and they have a reasonable claim on deserving to know, let them know. Keep people informed, and if you do that then &#34;let&#39;s talk when you get a minute&#34; won&#39;t feel like such a lurking shadow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Even in relatively technical circles, like HN, many people are not aware of this and I use every opportunity I have to reiterate:A SIM card is a full blown computer with its own CPU and memory.Your carrier can upload and run arbitrary code without your consent or knowledge.  They can do this at any time.This means that your &#34;phone&#34; is actually three different computers running in concert - the actual phone itself (iOS or Android or Symbian), the baseband processor running the baseband code, and the SIM card."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Ahh this is so useful that it&#39;s at the top of HN.We&#39;ve (probably) arrived at one of those &#34;hidden&#34; dominant operating systems out there in the world: JavaCard OS. It&#39;s not just (probably) in your cell phone SIM, it&#39;s also (probably) in your credit cards. Add all of those devices up, and you realize that, in a weird way, if aliens were to inspect the activity of humans, they&#39;d say, &#34;the humans seem to be using some sort of weird thing they call &#39;JavaCard OS&#39; to run their society.&#34;If anyone is a JavaCard OS master, shoot me an email - numair@numair.com. I&#39;m having some IC card issues that could use some external input...In terms of the linked article, I think this part makes it clear what&#39;s going on, if we are to take an innocent view on things:&gt; After the lab work, deposition of an AT&amp;T employee revealed that the only other trigger is a firmware update of the baseband processor. That is also consistent with the SIM requesting the IMEISV, since the “SV” part means “software version”, and it is updated every time the baseband processor loads new firmware. In this particular case, the phone had recently downloaded an update that included new baseband firmware. That was almost certainly the trigger for this message.If I was a network engineer, I&#39;d probably want a way to figure out whenever someone&#39;s putting new equipment on my network. This is a brilliantly sneaky way to do it. There&#39;s probably other uses for this, though, and you can imagine that your favorite intelligence agencies have thought about it long before it showed up in a Hacker News article..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Would eSIM[0] improve the state of affairs with respect to privacy?On the one hand, as SIM circuits are now being shipped with phones, I can imagine the manufacturers having the opportunity, for the first time ever, to control the operations of a SIM such that it’s no longer a black-box. On the other hand, due to legislative and practical reasons, eSIM modules would likely be no different than those black-box baseband processors with the further downside than we would also become unable to intercept the communication between a SIM (whose circuitry is now embedded) and a phone.I would love to read the answers of those who are more knowledgeable on the subject.[0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ESIM"</p>

You can use tools to convert it to plain text and grep through, or anything else you want.That being said, it&#39;s not perfect, but still pretty awesome.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Nuclear is one of a number of alternatives that needs to be seriously considered but due to the long timelines and high costs of nuclear it is also one of the best stalling tactics for the fossil fuel industry seeking to extend the life of their assets. Possible increased adoption of nuclear in the future is not a reason to avoid setting sunset dates for emitting technologies now and commence transition to whatever low emission technologies are the most available and affordable right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;d be fine with more nuclear power plants, but if wind/solar plus batteries are cheaper, that&#39;s what&#39;s going to get built.Also, renewables don&#39;t require a high degree of trust in the human operators to manage risks appropriately.  I think that&#39;s really the main sticking point with nuclear; reliable reactors can be made, but how do you manage the humans who maintain the plants in a way that&#39;s not susceptible to corruption or corner-cutting?If nuclear can be made to handle more of our energy needs for a reasonable cost, then that&#39;s a good thing, and if it can be made cheaper by updating regulations without sacrificing safety, then I think that would be awesome.  But I think we should plan for the future under the assumption that most of our energy will come from renewables.  That&#39;s the lowest-risk plan that doesn&#39;t require major regulatory changes or new technology.  (Apparently there are also some major lithium iron phosphate patents that are expired or expiring soon, which should open up cheap battery manufacturing to companies outside of China.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&#34;When your company won&#39;t be the first to market, because about 20% of your total development capacity needs to spent on keeping up&#34;In the world of JS and Typescript this ratio looks more like 80%. I swear that node hipsters at my last job spent four out of five of their working days wrangling with dependencies or their transpilers, linters, packagers, bundlers and whatever the hell else needs to happen to actually make a node program run. Meanwhile the geezers that worked on Java services reliably pushed new versions of their code sprint after sprint, no heroics, no drama required. What the fuck happened to those &#34;modern stacks&#34; that babysitting them takes the vast majority of developers time? It&#39;s a nightmare."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I appreciate the contrarian point of view, and I don&#39;t want to pick on the author, but this sounds like words of wisdom from someone who doesn&#39;t have much real world experience.I worked in such a project who never upgraded once. And then Specter/Meltdown hit, and we had the mandate to patch all our systems (and the threat was very real). Welcome to a hellish mess of outdated deps that took weeks to sort out.But is not only me. I watched a talk from a Principal Engineer from Amazon builder tools, and one of their biggest mistakes was not to upgrade often enough, which made each upgrade more painful.So what do we do now working in multiple, large, multi-year projects?First, we set tools that tell us when deps are outdated, and alarm when vulnerabilities are found.Second, upgrading deps is part of the regular dev process. When you make a change, take the chance to upgrade the deps. Vulnerabilities are addressed proactively. The vast majority of times upgrades require no code changes.Third, we regularly upgrade deps of inactive packages.Lastly, if a dependency upgrade requires significant work, we create a ticket for it and address it as a new feature. In practice this happens very rarely, so it doesn&#39;t disrupt the development process much.As other&#39;s said, the key is to upgrade often, and then it wont be as painful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Corollary: Do hard things more often, per Martin Fowler - https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FrequencyReducesDifficulty.ht...Upgrade everything all the time and it will never be hard. You&#39;ll have full context for breaking changes, and the diff from A to B is always smaller than from A to Q, and less likely to break in strange and confusing ways."</p>

If the second would also be a boy we could no longer give it this beautiful name. We knew the second would become a girl and we wanted to include the name Roan in it. After really long puzzling we came to the name: Norah. It contains all letters or Roan and an added H. Something for her specifically. When we had our third we wanted to do this again. Norah was already at the daycare by then and played a lot with a child called Roos. Somehow we liked the combination but it did not contain all the letters or Roan.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; Pfizer’s phase 2/3 trial randomized non-hospitalized adult COVID-19 patients who were at high risk of progressing to severe illness to receive placebo or Paxlovid, a combination of the protease inhibitors  PF-07321332 and ritonavir. The efficacy analysis is based on 1,219 patients.One noteworthy feature is the newness of this drug:&gt; PF-07321332 was developed from scratch during the current pandemic. It’s a reversible covalent inhibitor that reacts with one of the main protease’s cysteine residues. Owen [director of medicinal chemistry at Pfizer] also discussed the chemistry involved in scaling up the compound. The first 7 mg of the compound were synthesized in late July 2020. Encouraged by the early biological data, the Pfizer team aimed to scale up the synthesis. By late October, they’d made 100 g of the compound. Just two weeks later, the chemists had scaled up the synthesis to more than 1 kg. Owen said 210 researchers had worked on the project.https://cen.acs.org/acs-news/acs-meeting-news/Pfizer-unveils...Less than two years from lab to clinic is highly unusual. If approved, I believe this would be the fastest lab-to-approval for a small molecule drug in the history of the FDA."</p>

This would a huge achievement for the field of drug design, and will hopefully lead to all kinds of great medicine."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am thinking: if and when this is approved, we have to think about distribution.This drug is fantastically effective at preventing hospitalisation and death, if administered within three days of symptom onset.That gives quite a long time! But we still need to make it easy to take. Do pharmacies give it out? ER rooms? We don&#39;t want to wait until people are hospitalised; we are trying to avoid that.So when you test positive, does the government send you out a pill with the &#34;sorry, you have to isolate&#34; SMS?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"One of the under appreciated legal precedents set a couple years ago was the Ohio V AmEx anti trust case. The case predicated against AmEx’s merchant contract forbidding merchants to steer customers away from using their Amex card. This was a common practice for many years, especially at restaurants since AmEx charged restaurants 6%.The Supreme Court ruled that amex was able to keep the anti-steering provision in merchant contracts because they defined credit cards as a two sided market, and the harm to customers couldn’t be proven. In essence, the Supreme Court set a precedent that in any 2 sided market, in order for something to be considered anti competitive, a high bar needed to be met: the government must show that both sides of a 2 sided market be harmed in order for something to be anti competitive.Had the ruling been the other way, almost every industry would have been impacted- Uber, App Stores, Advertising…etc are all 2 sided markets.In essence, Credit cards have had a huge impact to our lives this century for reasons that are not appreciated enough."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; It’s often forgotten, but prior to credit cards, many Main Street retailers like e.g. pharmacies maintained hundreds or thousands of credit accounts for customers individually, necessitating their own back offices, accounting, and collections headache.This article is a great history of how the modern credit card came into being https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/magazine/19..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Debit cards are a very similar product with enough under-the-hood differences that they deserve their own moment in the sun. In particular, due to a quirk of U.S. interchange regulation, they basically fund most of the fintech industryBasically, the Durbin Amendment caps interchange on debit cards at a far, far lower rate than credit cards; they also have different networks (not MC or Visa) that can be run at least for in person transactions. However, the limit does not apply to banks with less than $10 billion in assets.This is why some online banks can offer lower fees and sometimes even debit cash back (1% is the most I&#39;ve seen though, so not competitive with credit). But its also why ever fintech under the sun pushes debit cards so heavily--the debit card is issued by a (small, non Durbin-covered) partner bank who then shares revenue with the fintech company.At the end of the day, credit cards are still significant better for customers. You can have multiple cards with different benefits while keeping all your money in one place, and you can prevent overdrafts because you don&#39;t have random subscriptions taking out unpredictable amounts of money in the middle of the night and causing a check to bounce the next day. You are no longer obsessing over &#34;early payday&#34; features or ACH speeds.Credit cards also provide a nice hack to allow cash deposit for those with only online banks--you can often use a big bank&#39;s ATM to make a payment towards the credit card, allowing you to get rid of ordinary amounts of cash."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Helion hasn&#39;t published the triple product results for their latest Trenta reactor, but for the previous Venti they achieved a triple product of ~10^19 keV.s/m^3 at an ion temperature of 2 keV. The Trenta reactor has achieved an ion temperature of 9 keV. For D-T fusion, you need a triple product of about 3x10^21 kev.s/m^3 at 10 keV. For the D-He reaction that helion intends to use, they need to achieve a similar triple product at 50 keV. So it looks like they&#39;re still 2-3 orders of magnitude off from where they need to be to achieve ignition. Their neutron production rate is comparable to industrial fusors at ~10^11 n/s, which while useful as neutron sources are nowhere near producing net power. Compare this with tokamaks that have achieved a triple product around 1.5x10^21 keV.s/m^3, or about half of what they need to achieve ignition.While it&#39;s possible that helion has made improvements to ion density and confinement allowing them to achieve a significantly higher triple product and close the gap to power production, I see no reason why a company looking for investment would hide such a result, especially while putting out press releases celebrating other milestones. I doubt they&#39;re anywhere near the point where an economical plant could even be considered, though I&#39;d love to be proven wrong."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The DoE is complicit in this as well (from the original article):&gt; In the letter to teachers, Education Commissioner Margie Vandeven said “an individual took the records of at least three educators, unencrypted the source code from the webpage, and viewed the social security number (SSN) of those specific educators.”&gt; But in the press release, DESE called the person who discovered the vulnerability a “hacker” and said that individual “took the records of at least three educators”This squares perfectly with my own experience. As a middle schooler I had several interactions with my school system&#39;s IT department where they baselessly accused me of hacking and malicious intent; I responsibly disclosed a method of bypassing their web content filter and they responded by going through my roaming profile and leveling charges at me of &#34;remotely hacking computer systems&#34; because of a screenshot of a terminal emulator they found. I was a good kid with a perfect disciplinary record. In retrospect it was a series of incompetent staffers covering for their inability by bullying a child.The US needs to stop using public facilities (schools, the military, etc) as white-collar welfare and hire more people that actually care. Ignorance is forgivable but when combined with a steadfast opposition to personal growth it becomes malicious. It&#39;d be better for society to fire clowns like these and administer them unemployment than to have them crowd out those that actually give a shit.*EDIT: To clarify for anybody that would read the above as &#34;government workers don&#39;t care&#34;: there are plenty that do.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Previous thread from 3 weeks ago: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28867562Recent developments:- The CS professor whose expert opinion was quoted by the newspaper article is demanding an apology and legal expenses from the state, alleging that the governor defamed and violated his free speech rights.- The governor&#39;s political fundraising committee is running ads making this a &#34;fake news&#34; issue.The email that the reporter sent, in advance of publishing the article revealing the state education website&#39;s data leakage:&gt; “I recently discovered a significant exposure of the sensitive data of more than 100,000 teachers on a DESE website,” Renaud wrote to the agency’s communications chief, Mallory McGowin. “At this point I am confident what I found is a genuine vulnerability — I have confirmed with three teachers from different districts that their data was exposed. I also have consulted an UMSL cybersecurity researcher who verified my findings. The P-D plans to publish a story about this sensitive data exposure, but we wanted to inform DESE first so that you would have a chance to mitigate the problem.”&gt; Renaud shared his timeline for publishing the story and asked for interviews with officials from DESE and the Missouri Office of Administration’s Information Technology Services Division. In a second email sent about 45 minutes later, he described the steps he’d taken in finding and confirming the vulnerability."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The governor&#39;s stance is just posture. &#34;We take these matters seriously&#34;.It reminds me of that time, a few years after I was out of college and into a job. My professor contacted me to demo my class project to her students. To give them an idea of what they can do with web development. Her assistant told me that they couldn&#39;t figure out how to run it.Of course, I took a day off from work, opened back up my school project, fixed the annoying bug. The web page required IIS to run so I could make Ajax requests. I decided to hardcode the data in json instead. So I went to school to present my project.The professor was double clicking the file and it wasn&#39;t displaying properly. I inserted my USB stick, and ran it from there instead. The coral reef restaurant website appeared on the big screen. I explained that I had to make some changes so it would work locally. Before, I was using a web server.&#34;Web server?&#34; she shouted. &#34;You are not allowed to use a web server. So you guys cheated!&#34;At first, I thought she was just kidding. I explained that Chapter 12 specifically asks to boot up IIS in order to make use of Ajax. During my time, the rest of the class stopped at chapter 10. I completed the entire book because I was just in love with learning JavaScript. So unless you get to chapter 12, you don&#39;t learn about Ajax.&#34;I&#39;ll have to report you. They board might revoke your grade. Not just you but all your group.&#34;You can only imagine how pale I became. But I understood what was happening. She had tried to run the project multiple times and failed. She couldn&#39;t debug it or figure out the issue. To save face in front of the class, she accused me of having cheated. This is the exact thing the Missourians officials are doing.No, at the end of the day my grades were not revokes. Plus I had dropped out of college and was working in the field for a few couple years already. But it goes to show you the length people would go just to save face."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I used to lead Sys Eng for a FTSE 100 company. Our data was valuable but only for a short amount of time. We were constantly scraped which cost us in hosting etc. We even seen competitors use our figures (good ones used it to offset their prices, bad ones just used it straight).
As the article suggest, we couldn&#39;t block mobile operator IPs,  some had over 100k customers behind them. Forcing the users to login did little as the scrapers just created accounts. 
We had a few approaches that minimised the scraping:Rate Limiting by login,Limiting data to know workflows
...But our most fruitful effort was when we removed limits and started giving &#34;bad&#34; data. By bad I mean alter the price up or down by a small percentage. This hit them in the pocket but again, wasn&#39;t a golden bullet. If the customer made a transaction on the altered figure we we informed them and took it at the correct price.It&#39;s a cool problem to tackle but it is just an arms race."</p>

Works like a charm and I can actualy see what it&#39;s doing and where it&#39;s going wrong. (though it&#39;s not scalable, of course)We use it for data-entry on a government website. A human would average around 10 minutes of clicking and typing, where the bot takes maybe 10 seconds. Last year we did 12000 entries. Good bot."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s somewhat refreshing that the underlying bug isn&#39;t from some C or C++ utility, but instead a Perl program using eval: https://github.com/exiftool/exiftool/blob/11.70/lib/Image/Ex... Another instance of &#34;avoid eval as much as possible&#34; for languages that have it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this article could have been far more useful with the following points being explicitly mentioned, or at least summarized:  - the problem appeared in GitLab 11.9.0
  - the problem seems to have been fixed in GitLab 13.8.8
  - the vulnerability uses ExifTool, so to exploit it, a user needs to be able to upload images
  - if an update is not (yet) possible, DjVu format file uploads can be blocked to avert this vulnerability
  - this vulnerability isn&#39;t relevant for GitLab instances that just have 1 user, or are not publicly accessible on the Internet

Now, i&#39;m not saying that the above is entirely true, but after reading something like the above, one should be able to figure out how to best act:  - if you have a public GitLab instance with open registrations, consider updating it immediately (with backups in place, of course)
  - if you have a private GitLab instance with many users in your own corporate network (that somehow isn&#39;t updated yet) - this is a good reason to put updating it into your agenda today, even if your users aren&#39;t necessarily hostile
  - if you have a private GitLab instance or one with registrations closed (e.g. you&#39;re the only user or people that you trust use it), mark this down and update whenever possible, however it&#39;s probably not necessary right this moment

Of course, i can&#39;t say the above with 100% confidence, because the article itself lacks this actionable information to aid in decisionmaking and so i&#39;m left to piece things together on my own, because of which i could be wrong.On an unrelated note, DjVu is a pretty interesting file format, though sadly i&#39;ve only seen it be used very sparsely, on some Russian forums for tractor manuals or something: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DjVu"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&#34;..Bowling said he discovered a way to abuse how ExifTool handles uploads for DjVu file format used for scanned documents to gain control over the entire underlying GitLab web server&#34;Ah, the good old &#34;File upload vulnerability&#34;.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s encouraging seeing all the work going into making tagged unions a natural part of TS. I&#39;ve tried to introduce them multiple times, and have been shot down by my team on every attempt. I think they still come across as &#34;hacky,&#34; and more JS-minded people who are totally cool validating with if-else everywhere still can&#39;t appreciate the benefits of annotating data in this manner. I hope TS eventually arrives at a standard, low impact way to create and manipulate such structures; maybe more people will be on board then. It looks like we&#39;re moving in the right direction."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very nice!The very, very related thing I found myself wishing I had just today is the ability to destructure discriminated union fields which only exist on one component type of the union.As an example, with the following type system:    type Output = OutputExists | OutputDoesntExist;
    interface OutputExists { exists: true, url: string };
    interface OutputDoesntExist { exists: false };

The ability to destructure like:    const f = ({ exists, url }: Output) =&gt; {}

Such that, at the time of destructuring:    exists: true | false
    url: string | undefined

I believe, with this PR, if we re-structured the types above to:    interface OutputDoesntExist { exists: false, url: undefined };

That destructuring would be possible, with all the control flow analysis necessary to make it useful. Today, even that wouldn&#39;t be possible, so definitely excited for this change.But, I&#39;m curious if anyone knows if this change can extend to situations where a field isn&#39;t even defined in one of the unions, and the compiler can just insert an undefined type for those fields. Or, maybe this would have some unresolveable side-effects I&#39;m not considering."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"One thing I&#39;m wondering: with all the bells and whistles and insanely complex things TS now supports, why does it still fail to catch seemingly simple mistakes?For instance, it&#39;s sooo easy to write a React component taking in another component as a prop and some props for that other component, to rendering it. But somehow lose the type safety of the props being passed in. Like, you write some generics and the compiler stops complaining inside your component. But if you go back out and then try to pass some weird props instead, it doesn&#39;t care. I feel it&#39;s too easy to write code that looks tyoe safe but subtly isn&#39;t."</p>

I see new projects almost every couple months, and I&#39;m often working on multiple projects simultaneously due to work, freelance, and personal projects. Managing the development environments between many projects on a local machine became a huge burden and a coworker once mentioned developing in a virtual machine. I thought this was a great idea, and Vagrant was eventually born from it.Really amazing achievement in such short space of time.

We&#39;re a small startup, and I haven&#39;t had the time (or motivation) to learn what Docker, Kubernetes, containers, etc are. Seems overly complex.But, virtual servers I can understand. I&#39;ve been using Vagrant since 2013 and it ... just works. We&#39;ve built our own custom box to standardize our development environment as well.If there is one company and person I&#39;d like to mimic, it&#39;s Hashicorp and Mitchell. Work to build an amazing product or products, get it ready for a sale or IPO, and then transition into an IC to continue doing what I love: hacking.Congratulations on the success!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was the person who first deployed Python at Goldman Sachs. At the time it was an &#34;unapproved technology&#34; but the partner in charge of my division called me and said (This is literally word for word because partners didn&#39;t call me every day so I remember)    Err....hi Sean, It&#39;s Armen.  Uhh.... So I heard you like python.... well if someone was to uhh.... install python on the train... they probably wouldn&#39;t be fired.  Ok bye.

&#34;Installing python on the train&#34; meant pushing it out to all the computers globally in the securities division that did risk and pricing.  Within 30mins every computer in goldman sachs&#39;s securities division had python and I was the guy responsible for keeping the canonical python distribution up to date with the right set of modules etc on Linux, Solaris and Windows.Because it was unapproved technology I had a stream of people from technology coming to my desk to say I shouldn&#39;t have done it.  I redirected them to Armen (who was a very important dude that everyone was frightened of).The core engineers from GS went on to build the Athena system at JP and the Quartz platform at BAML.//Edit for grammar"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m seeing a lot of people speculating about which bank this might be; I think the point is that it&#39;s all of them. I could loosely describe a previous job as implementing Morgan Stanley&#39;s Walpole and integrating more source code management into Minerva (even though that system wasn&#39;t actually Python-based).Having a global view on everything is large banks&#39; value-add, it&#39;s why they haven&#39;t been outcompeted by their more nimble competitors. Being able to calculate the risk of the whole bank isn&#39;t just a cool feature, it&#39;s the core value proposition of this platform.Being able to just upload your code and run it is really cool, and if you squint it looks a bit like what the outside world is trying to set up with serverless/lambda-style platforms - just write a function, submit it, and there, it&#39;s running. (But it&#39;s worth remembering that Python is not a typical programming language; python build, dependency and deployment management is exceptionally awful in every respect, this isn&#39;t as big a pain point in other languages). Obviously there&#39;s a tension between this and having good version control, diffs, easy rollbacks etc. - but because Minevera is already designed to do all that for data (because you need that kind of functionality for modifications to your bonds or whatever), doing it this way strikes a much better compromise than something like editing PHP files directly on your live server.What this article calls data-first design has a lot in common with functional programming. I hope that as the outside world adopts more functional programming and non-relational datastores, Minerva-style programming will get more popular. It really is a much better way to write code in many ways. The difficulty of integrating with outside libraries is a shame though."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"BAML Quartz was conceived by a bunch of front-office quants who had not the first idea about the software needs of a big bank beyond the front office. There was an arrogant assumption that front office software is obviously the most complicated/difficult variety of software within a bank and therefore any system designed with front office requirements at the forefront would, of course, be perfect for universal use.This assumption was challenged at the time by various groups - I was closest to the Equities Operations software team (although not part of it) who absolutely dug in their heels and refused to use Quartz. The assumption was explosively invalidated when people started implementing in Quartz applications that fell under Sarbanes/Oxley regulations and Quartz picked up a severity 1 audit finding - because Quartz was explicitly designed for &#34;Hyper Agility&#34; (literal quote from the quartz docs) - and anyone-can-change-anything-at-any-time does not make for applications that the regulators trust.There was an interesting trajectory of Python hiring during my time at BAML. I joined just as Quartz was getting started and we managed to easily hire tens of python devs in London because it was easy to sell the fact that BAML was making a strategic investment in Python and therefore their (at the time relatively uncommon) skills would be highly valued. But as Quartz matured, Python developers generally came to dislike it (for reasons see original article) and it became hard to retain the best ones. And after a while Python 2.x became a massive embarrassment and, as Python became a more common skill in the marketplace, it became harder to hire good developers into BAML."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The first thing that jumps out is Sweden has a national identity system, BankID. The APIs appear to be protected using those credentials. With that in mind I have two questions:1. Who owns the data?2. Should public funds be used for the creation of private APIs that manage the data?The answer to (1) has consequences for (2).I think many HN readers, including myself, and certainly these parents would argue that the data is the property of the parents. If you see the data as being the property of the parents then you would see the APIs as being the means for retrieving and manipulating your data - data that&#39;s protected by this national BankID identification.It appears the school system believes the data is their data, and not the parents&#39; data. Therefore retrieving the data through any other means than the &#34;official&#34; app is a potential data breach.So who is right? Think about the data we manage on behalf of our customers, for example. Who owns that data? What rights do our customers have in accessing and managing that data?This is a really interesting case and hopefully will force the answer to these questions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; In some cases, people’s personal information could be accessed from Google searches.SEO providers should take a note here.&gt; It warned parents to stop using the app and alleged that it might be illegally accessing people’s personal informationIf your API allows data extraction, it probably isn&#39;t a fault of any client. Perhaps they meant that creators could steal credentials. A problem with any software.I think this digital child managing system sounds moderately dystopian to be honest. I would have hated to give my parents access to anything like this. Kids will of course learn from how their parents behave...An open API is a must in my opinion, but the rest of the App should be open source too.That said, I don&#39;t really see the Swedish strategy as a model for other countries to follow. You don&#39;t need to give children chromebooks to learn. These are skills they have already mastered far better than their parents. They will learn about domain specific apps and there are indeed some really good ones, but such platform can also limit creativity because they are essentially sandpits. Depending on age that might be appropriate, but kids may have greater ambitions than their parents."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Good tips... but in reality if you&#39;re working full-time (especially in a software related role), you may find yourself depleted before you get to the keyboard.It took us 5 years to finish our game (everyone started from 0 knowledge on how to make games, so it was a rocky road), and for the last 1.5-2 years my life was absolute hell.I&#39;d push hard at work for 9 hours a day, eat, then push hard on the side project for 8-9 hours a day, sleep, wake up, and just keep going. One day a week maybe I&#39;d just sleep. Not having &#34;pure energy&#34; for the side project meant that everything suffered.We had to learn-by-trial virtually _everything_, I don&#39;t recommend ever doing a big project that way.If you want to finish a game, choose a small game. Start doing game jams. Practice _finishing_. You can do more and more later.Or, go for it, do it our way, all in to win (win is subjective, the pride is real, the monetary result didn&#39;t really do anything meaningful for so much investment). I wouldn&#39;t do it this way again, but I understand people who do.All that said, the joy of doing something for us by us is not something I&#39;ve encountered in my 15 year career yet. So... if you&#39;ve never built something (and truly finished!), but you want to try... go for it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not discussed in the article: You have to have the support of the people in your life this will impact. For example, the 7-9am timeslot for working, as listed in the article, will impact my family, as that is when I&#39;m getting the kids up and off to school. OK, so I could move it to 5am to 7am, but that would mean I&#39;d need to go to bed earlier, which eliminates important evening time with my wife. Similarly, I could do it from 8pm to 10pm, but that also affects my relationship with my wife, and my social life in general.This isn&#39;t to say that people with a family can&#39;t do these things, but that you need to acknowledge the impact it will have on other people, and plan with them to make it work. For example, I often make the time for my wife to work on her novels between 7pm and 9pm. I get the kids to bed and do some cleaning, while she writes, and we still get to connect before sleep."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Here are my side project tips:1) As the article states, work on your side project first in the morning before your work. You will be too tired after work. Yes, this means your not really giving 100% at work. Hopefully your good enough at your job that this is OK.2) Create little task lists, with short little tasks... Then knock those tasks out one by one. If you find yourself procrastinating about some task do another little task first, then later make a quick spur of the moment decision to go do the procrastination task.3) It&#39;s OK to dream about the best case scenario, but also have realistic side goals: &#34;worst case scenario, I&#39;ve built a cool engine for my next project.&#34;4) DO create the right amount of tests (too little and your going to be creating buggy crap code, too many and you&#39;re bogged down updating your tests constantly)... get a feel for what your right amount is.5) Don&#39;t type so much, think more... think through designs... use paper, be messy and redraw... all of this is faster than building the wrong thing.6) I think its OK to be quirky. Make the thing YOU want to make. This is another way to monetize: your mental health is worth a lot and personally I find bringing shit that I want to exist into the world just the way I want them to be is a good trick for staying happy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wow, what a fascinating article. It still blows my mind that annually his organization made seven times more than the Sinaloa Cartel. I think the last paragraph says it all:&gt;What gave traditional organized crime its strength in the past—the violence, the control of territory, the ethnic loyalty and defined hierarchies—are the heart of its weakness in the present. Tse had a better system. Instead of ethnic loyalty, transnational and inter-organizational co-operation. Instead of territory, logistics. Instead of hierarchy, metrics. Instead of centralized control, connections. Tse Chi Lop is easily the most significant criminal in Toronto’s history, and he represents, in an entirely diseased way, a perverse triumph of the city. His vast criminal organization flourished through open-mindedness and entrepreneurship, by creating markets and exploiting them in a spirit of eager globalization and cosmopolitanism.Imagine how much money criminal syndicates could make if they took notes from this guy and all worked together."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There&#39;s a National Geographic documentary series called Drugs, Inc. [1] that I find fascinating.Let&#39;s set aside what an abject failure the so-called War on Drugs has been in the US and the violence of the drug trade and just appreciate the market economics for a second.One episode listed all the stages coca leaves took to becoming crack cocaine. Processing in jungle labs, transportation to smugglers, further processing, flying to Mexico, entering the US and distribution. And each stage there is loss to law enforcement, rival gangs, theft, etc and that loss rate is reflected in how the price jumps at each stage.In another, it detailed how meth (IIRC) entered the US primarily in Phoenix. As a result, Phoenix has (so the show said) the cheapest meth in the US. For every 1000 miles you radiated away from Phoenix, the price doubled.To me it was fascinating to see people who generally had little education, came from terrible backgrounds and grew up amidst crime and violence talk about the math of distance and price and how it impacted his distribution organization. It&#39;s sad to see someone who actually has a talent for hustling and basically sales be lost to the drug world.This is yet another reason why I think the &#34;are you a felon?&#34; question should basically be outlawed in the US.Additionally you  see how organizations have evolved to insulate themselves from disruption (from rivals or law enforcement). Most people know very little and certainly not the big picture. Merchandise frequently changes hands.I don&#39;t know what the solution here is. I fully support legalization of recreational cannabis in any world where alcohol consumption is legal. I certainly don&#39;t think we should be sending people to prison for possession.At the same time, you have cities like Seattle, Portland and San Francisco that are literally being destroyed by non-policing of drugs and small property crime.But the US prison industrial complex is and always has been a direct attack on the poor and minorities.[1]: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drugs,_Inc."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"From https://luau-lang.org/typecheck&gt; Luau’s type system is structural by defaultI think that makes it the second (production-ready) language to have a primarily-structural type system, after TypeScript/Flow(/and Closure to some extent) for JS. I wonder if it will follow in their impressive footsteps or if it will tread new territory.One of the things that Flow gets right that TypeScript doesn&#39;t yet support is switching to nominal type-checking between class instances. In TypeScript you can assign an instance of one class to an instance of another as long as they have compatible fields. Compare:Flow: https://bit.ly/3jZx4rBTS: https://tsplay.dev/mZaL1NTypeScript doesn&#39;t have any understanding of prototypes or prototypal inheritance, which is a big gap considering that it&#39;s a fundamental aspect of JS.I&#39;m really hoping Luau will come to do the right thing with tables and prototypes. Perhaps it already does, but unfortunately there doesn&#39;t seem to be a Luau playground to try in the browser."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"If any of the Luau devs are watching this, please flesh out the metamethods. I&#39;d switch almost everything to Luau if they were improved.They&#39;re the biggest PITA right now as designed in PUC-Rio, and I see that while you&#39;ve improved upon __eq, other metamethods are still lacking.In PUC-Rio, boolean equality operators FORCE a boolean result, regardless of what you return. Ideally they would allow returning any result type, which then can be coerced to boolean later (e.g. by an `if` statement), just like the arithmetic operators do.Further, `__neq`, `__ge` and `__gt` do not exist. They should.The lack of a proper metamethod design means that binding to e.g. Kiwi[0] is impossible without some incredibly fugly hacks. It has been a long-standing annoyance with Lua in an otherwise beautiful little scripting language (that I use frequently).This looks quite nice - lots of attempts in this space but nothing that attempts to match Lua to this degree.[0] https://github.com/nucleic/kiwi"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Heck yeah.I don&#39;t know what this fork changes, but I love how many game engines will take lua and expand it to fit their exact needs like this.Very few scripting languages make it as easy to do as lua.This is an interesting related project:https://moonscript.org/It compiles down to lua, and really beefs everything up. Interface is super nice too. You just put `require &#34;moonscript&#34;` at the top of the file and you&#39;re done, now just write your code in moon script."</p>

Many of you might roll your eyes at that, but it’s a real problem: when you’re organizing something, you feel pressured to know everything, or else you’ll lose people’s confidence. So all the people who try to act confident also rarely ask basic questions.Hackers are the opposite. We’re always focused on breaking down problems into the most basic components, and then building up complexity once we understand the system.When Nat reached out to me, I didn’t know what to expect. But I certainly didn’t expect him to be a fellow hacker that happened to be famous. I think it’s incredible that someone can go so long without losing that spirit — imagine suddenly having a boatload of money. Most of us would probably take things easier.Another surprise is how incredibly chill he is. When things go seriously wrong, he’s totally cool about it, in a way that’s hard to put into words. I learned the phrase “No stress, friend” from him, and I’ve used it a few times to soothe other people. As cliche as it sounds, sometimes it’s the one thing in the world you need to hear.I wish I could tell a certain story to underscore the point, but Nat’s stories are his to tell. I hope he writes a book someday — nothing fancy, just a raw thought stream of all his experiences.And I wish I could share his future ambition. It’s so exciting that I can hardly contain myself. It might not work out, but that’s true of everything.I don’t know if anyone will see this. But I just wanted to write a little note to say how rare Nat is. He actually cares — deeply — and also cares about you. Most leaders don’t.If someone reading this has the opportunity to work with him on his new project, I encourage you to leave your cushy job on that basis alone. It’ll be fun in a way you won’t experience elsewhere."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"No, it is not. Neither is Roblox or Fortnite, or VRchat. A single game or world is NOT the metaverse, what is so hard to understand about that for journalists and companies?The metaverse is the immersive internet, as a successor to our current one that is more 2D oriented around photos/videos/text today. It&#39;s a paradigm shift in how we interact, but most importantly there will be many of these virtual worlds/spaces interconnected together to form an actual network that nobody outright owns. To get to this future, we need protocols/standards to allow virtual worlds to talk to one another and agree that users can hop back in forth between them seamlessly, across all platforms.More specifically, the way we use the web today to navigate from webpage to another is how we we traverse the metaverse. The core problem that needs to get solved right now is interoperability, to enable the &#34;web of 3D&#34;.Look to WebGPU, WebAssembly, and WebXR as cornerstone technologies here. Our startup is building the &#34;3D/VR web&#34; in this way, and our current focus is getting proper HTML5 exporting from the native game engines, currently Unreal Engine. We&#39;re also building out a suite of tooling to empower developers and creators along with our hosting/discovery platform that includes advanced texture compression + asynchronous asset fetching to enable 3D/VR websites that load as quickly as a regular 2D page. If you&#39;re a developer and are interested in our work, you can join our Discord here:https://discord.gg/zUSZ3T8"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"“What is so hard for people to understand” says HN commenter: “the metaverse clearly means [my definition of the metaverse] why can’t people see this?!!”Well, Zuckerberg didn’t give a clear definition, the term itself is made up, and it doesn’t currently exist (otherwise, what would we be building?).So no you don’t know what it means or how it will turn out, and neither does Zuckerberg. He might have a vision of what he’d like it to be and how he’s going to make money out of it, but he’s very probably very wrong.It’s obvious a deeply immersive experience will eventually arrive but it seems far from obvious how it will be used, much like predicting the rise of Tik Tok in 1990 based on email and usenet.The best way to predict the future is to make it. Hackers built much of the early internet, so let’s go build the early metaverse and at least make something insanely experimental and magical and beautiful before the next Zuckerberg comes alone and devalues it."</p>

You have the very very last computer on earth running
an ancient version of Backblaze (version 1.5.2.390) that
NO LONGER WORKS (too old, needs updating).You are paying for a service you are not using.
You have two choices:1) Upgrade your Mac OS X 10.5 computer called &#34;rlmmbp&#34;
    to the latest Backblaze.  Just visit our homepage
    and download it and install right over the top of
    what you have already, here is a URL:
    https://secure.backblaze.com/update.htm
    (Will take less than 5 seconds, totally free,
    you are already paying!)2) Do nothing -&gt; in 7 more days I will delete that
     machine&#39;s backup and all of the files in the backup,
     and you will be paying for an unused license.
     (I can provide instructions on how to cancel your
     billing if you need them.)If you have any questions, feel free to contact me
at the email address below:- Brian Wilson

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is an interesting moment to reflect on the wacky nature of IPO vs ICO valuations.  Backblaze and Filecoin are, roughly speaking, in the same business (providing bulk file storage).  Backblaze is looking to raise ~$100 million at a valuation of about $0.7 billion.  Filecoin raised $250 million in their ICO, and the coin has a current &#34;market cap&#34; of about $7 billion.  Backblaze owns about 1.8 EiB of storage, Filecoin has about 13 EiB &#34;pledged&#34;, so if you consider those measurements comparable the $ of valuation per EiB is similar.  Businesses generally get valued more on what they bring in than what they own however, and Backblaze takes in ~$65 million/year revenue (~$175K/day).   I&#39;m not entirely clear what would be analogous to revenue for Filecoin, but they &#34;mine&#34; ~330K coins per day, which at current prices is about $21 million (or $7.8 billion per year?).  Now here&#39;s where it gets crazy... based on the current average reward if Backblaze dedicated all of their storage to Filecoin mining they could (theoretically) generate about $2.5 million a day (or $900 million/year, about 13x what they bring in now).Backblaze did look into farming Chia at some point[1], don&#39;t know if they&#39;ve done similar experiments with Filecoin, but it definitely seems like there is a profound disconnect between these two worlds (which could be the result of some other factor, like the USD value of Bitcoin).[1] https://www.backblaze.com/blog/chia-analysis-to-farm-or-not-..."</p>

Great, talented coworkers who I could constantly learn from, management chain from bottom to top of former engineers, so they understood when you would say, &#34;I worked on this for a week but have no results because it didn&#39;t work&#34;.  Plenty of resources to do what you needed to do, and lots of autonomy to do what you thought was right.  Very little process and upper management actively moved to eliminate what little process there was.  Unlimited vacation time that was real -- management took long vacations to set an example and would actively encourage everyone to do the same.  And of course a great paycheck which included 10%+ raises because they made sure that new people didn&#39;t make more than veterans.I&#39;ll be the first to admit it&#39;s not for everyone.  As they say, they are a sports team, not a family.  Perform well and be rewarded handsomely, perform poorly and get cut with a big check.

Avoid public firms. A corporation cannot show loyalty, but a HUMAN can. A manager has no real control -- their manager can reverse them. When you work for the owner, you can trust things a bit more IF you&#39;re working for a trustworthy person.This means small.

That doesn&#39;t mean we never have disagreements, but they tend to be technical disagreements about the best approach to reach the same goal. Before the pandemic, and hopefully after it, the kitchen was the center of the company: casual questions turned into great discussions, explanations... there&#39;s a big whiteboard wall in the kitchen, and it got used a lot.That goal, incidentally, is to drive down the cost of good portfolio analysis until it&#39;s within everyone&#39;s reach. We&#39;re succeeding: there are clients who have programs where people start their investments with $50/week.Our folks are reasonably diverse in terms of background and talents.

It’s able to mill wood and aluminium, up to ~20mm thick.As with all my other projects, I think they should be executed in the open where other people can learn from my mistakes and get inspired to build their own things! Therefore I’ve spend a lot of time writing a free complete tutorial of the build, documenting every step with text and detailed images, creating a complete bill of materials (including STL-files for the 3d-printed parts) etc. I don’t want any dependencies on DIY-websites, so I’ve hosted it on GitHub, where anyone can clone it locally.I built this machine to gain more knowledge about mechanical engineering, electrical wiring, stepper motors, GRBL, CAD, CAM etc. Also, I guess I can build new fun things with the machine? Overly-engineered birdhouses maybe?Setup:* It’s running on an Arduino Uno, CNC-shield and GRBL.* 40 parts are 3d-printed (all the red parts in the video)* It’s based on Ivan Miranda’s blueprints, but I’ve adjusted some parts and structured the bill of materials.* It uses 2x 19:1 geared NEMA17 stepper motors for the Y-axis and 1x for the X-axis. The Z-axis is using a standard NEMA17 motor.* HTD5M belts and pulleys are used for X-axis and Y-axis. GT2 belt and pulleys are used for the Z-axis.If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.

Ideally a whole house and most of the furniture...If anyone has any ideas on how to accelerate build times of open hardware, that&#39;s something I&#39;m trying to solve. Creating high quality instructionals is a huge amount of work and I think instructionals should be automatically generated by computer vision and have interactable elements, ideally AR, but even just highlighting wiring diagrams on hovering would be hugely helpful. Even if things are well documented, replication is still insanely pyrrhic without economy of scale or universal fabrication.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This bit really caught my attention:&gt; In contrast, this website runs on an off-the-grid solar power system with its own energy storage, and will go off-line during longer periods of cloudy weather. Less than 100% reliability is essential for the sustainability of an off-the-grid solar system, because above a certain threshold the fossil fuel energy used for producing and replacing the batteries is higher than the fossil fuel energy saved by the solar panels.This, in particular, is an amazing take:&gt; Less than 100% reliability is essential for the sustainability of an off-the-grid solar systemSaying that sacrificing uptime is a good thing for achieving a particular goal is a take that&#39;s so wildly out of line with what most of the industry believes is refreshing, because it really makes you think. What would the world look like, if instead of being obsessed with SRE we simply assumed or accepted that there will be downtime, and treated it like something perfectly normal. Maybe a nice message at ingress/load balancer level, telling everyone that the site will be back in a bit.I have no illusions that any company would want something like that, or that it&#39;s even feasible for many industries, e.g. healthcare, though the Latvian &#34;e-health&#34; system is an accidental experiment of this at the cost of around 15 million euros of taxpayer money: https://www-lsm-lv.translate.goog/raksts/zinas/latvija/par-e... .However, if companies have working hours, why couldn&#39;t websites? What a funny thought.Edit: on an unrelated note, it&#39;s wild how different setups can be.For example:&gt; The web server uses between 1 and 2.5 watts of power...While at the same time, i have two servers with 200GEs (essentially consumer hardware) running in my homelab, with a TDP of 35W each, though with the UPS and its inefficiencies, as well as the 4G router, the total energy consumption that i have to deal with is around 100W. Granted, i also use them for backups and as CI nodes, but there&#39;s still a difference of 20 - 50 times more power usage between one of my servers and one of theirs. I guess one can definitely talk about the differences between x86 and ARM there as well."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As they describe being open to ideas and feedback: maybe using static compression could help. The concept is to pre-compress files (have foo.html.gz available next to foo.html) so that the web server does not have to compress on-the-fly. nginx supports it[0] and gzip_static does not appear in their nginx config[1].It might not make a difference if nginx has a in-RAM cache of the compressed files. Otherwise, it has the potential to be pretty significant assuming most requests are made using &#34;Accept-Encoding: gzip&#34; and assuming the web server does not prefer other compression algorithms (eg. Brotli).[0]: https://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_gzip_static_module.h...[1]: https://homebrewserver.club/low-tech-website-howto.html#full..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The amount of energy wasted due to poor caching strategies alone could power small countries.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The way the last administration rolled this out was certainly with a political narrative, but my guess is it originated with people that weren&#39;t thinking at all about politics.The simple story is that core infrastructure is of strategic national importance, and an elevated risk that infrastructure is compromised can never be worth whatever the benefits are of using a particular supplier&#39;s equipment.  There is no practical way to 100% ensure that every piece of software, and every chip, in every piece of equipment is clean.  Chips are especially scary (the push to have domestic chip fab by the US and other countries is about more than just supply chain).This is true when it comes from what are considered trustworthy suppliers as well, but you&#39;re dealing with probabilities.  I think that regardless of whether this move fits into a political narrative about China, or &#34;economic warfare&#34;, the practical basis is that for some types of equipment, the risk is just too large and the ability to mitigate too limited, in general.Unfortunately this was figured out with Huawei/ZTE after the fact, but tbh I don&#39;t think the specific company matters at all, it just happened to be they were in this business at the time &amp; based in the wrong country."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"ANSSI, the French agency for information systems security, has severely tightened authorizations for vital infrastructure. Though Huawei is still kosher in many network functions, French telcos have had to remove a few thousand nodes they had already deployed, especially in network cores. All authorizations are temporary - between three and eight years.This is not just about security in a narrow definition, but in a large part about ensuring that mastery of strategic functions remains with European firms.Like armaments, telecommunication infrastructures are not a normal market."</p>

Because Huawei is a de facto company owned by the Chinese government, it stands to reason that the distrust must be extended to Huawei. The product may be good, but China has very little credibility anymore, and should absolutely not be trusted."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Thank you, whomever did this!  I asked for it in a comment recently.This video basically is making fun of a common situation of Google at the time, where a person wants to serve up some data for analytics, but the sysadmins expect the person to follow a process intended for much more complex and high availability services run by teams of skilled engineers.It parodies SRE as a BOFH sysadmin, even though in general SRE are quite easygoing and helpful.It helped poked fun at a number of overly stuffy processes and also helped push people to make hosting modest datasets (like this 5TB one) easier."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Background: https://rachelbythebay.com/w/2021/10/30/5tb/This video was hugely influential on changing the way Google does internal tools and operations."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a Googler, it&#39;s often easier for me to setup a GCP consumer account, AWS, or Heroku account to demo something, compared to using anything internal. I remember the most annoying situation was like 10 years ago when me and other engineers ported Quake 2 to run in Chrome, we were in a time crunch to demo it multiplayer, and I ended up setting up an AWS account to serve it. But then I left it running and forgot and ended up getting a few hundred dollars billed to me because the Quake2 server was chewing CPU."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is really cool.  I&#39;m 30 right now, and only just recently finished my bachelors and have been looking to get a PhD, but it&#39;s really hard to find a program that will let you work full time while doing it. It doesn&#39;t help that a part of me does sort of feel &#34;too old&#34; to do this sometimes.  The PhD system in the US is really tailored around the assumption that you haven&#39;t entered the corporate world yet.Anyway, it&#39;s really inspiring that someone almost three times my age pushed himself through the program. I guess it&#39;s important to remember that you really shouldn&#39;t give up on your dreams."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is very inspiring. I too am young and been in the work force for several years, but unlike the other comments in this thread I am
not settled down as an older student returning to school.I am willing to give up a high paying salary to return back to school as a PhD student and I am
not tied down with a mortgage or anything else.I find mathematics simply too interesting to not learn at the highest level. Working in industry will simply not teach me the material I want to learn. I’m considering going back for either a  PhD in Math or a math heavy PhD in CS. I read math textbooks for fun and worked with tutors to ensure my proofs are done correctly. I can do this for hours on end without external motivation. I taught myself a lot of math and can see myself doing this as a career. I want to do research.Most people my age say the same things in the comment sections in this thread (tied down to a mortgage, make too much money to return). I’m glad generalizations like these don’t apply to me and can’t wait to get back to school"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As a university student in my last year of undergrad, I&#39;ve been tempted to go work as a software engineer, even though I&#39;m interested in doing research. The opportunity cost just seems too large to give up. Working as a SWE will allow me to earn a massive income in my 20s, during which I have few defendants and a lot of leisure time. While many of my peers are planning to do graduate school right away, I feel like my quality of life would simply be better by going to work in industry right now.With that said, I still love learning and diving deeply into topics like math and the history of science. I hope that I can one day retire off my savings as a SWE and return to graduate school (maybe in my late 30s or 40s). Has anyone done this before? Is there a stigma against graduate students (both Masters and PhD) who are not in their 20s?"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A lot of the engineering math associated with splines (NURBs) and surface approximations came from Citroen, Peugeot and Renault, the car makers, in the mid-20th century. I read a great book on this back in the 80&#39;s and can&#39;t remember the name. It was about the early days of CAD and its origins.Like, the control points on splines were called &#34;ducks&#34;, which were weights attached to spring steel suspended from the ceiling of the studio, which caused the steel to bend into particular shapes computed mathematically beforehand by the design engineers. These curves were used to guide model making. It was a fascinating book."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did this after seeing this before on HN. There were a few processes that were manual that benefitted from the technique in the article.Learn from my folly: I even called them “do nothing scripts,” referencing this article. However; I was judged by peers for not writing the full automation versions as they didn’t appreciate the idea of gradual automation (programmer hubris?). Saying “do nothing scripts” in meetings did catch the awkward attention of leadership.As a description, “do nothing” communicates a lot. As a brand, “do nothing” can use some improvements.My short prescription of turning “do nothings” into “do some things” into “do all the things” didn’t help. We had some new people join the team and they had fun turning the do nothing scripts into a document. * Sigh *I still build these type of process description scripts still. I usually don’t advertise them to peers until they do some of the things nowadays."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My experience in corporate IT convinced me that even if an entire release could be automated down to a single press of a giant red button (and even if undoing the release could be another, single button), then culturally our organization would still figure out a way to turn the pressing of that button into a six hour ordeal requiring the participation of twelve people."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The idea here can be generalized to a primitive programming construct: The magic function &#34;wish&#34;, which can do anything you want, just give it a string description.For example:    wish(&#39;copy these files to this host&#39;, files, host)

You can augment this further by allowing the program to specify a return type from the wish, and magically the wish will produce the type you want. So for example:    data = wish(Path, &#39;the path of the data files I need&#39;)

Of course, the wish is actually implemented by sending a request to some human user. In my &#34;wish&#34; library for Python http://rsyscall.org/wish/ you can have a stack of handlers for wishes, just like exception handlers.  If later you want to automate some wish, you can specify a handler which intercepts certain wishes and forwards the other ones on (by wishing again, just like an exception handler can re-raise)."</p>

Basically, all videos start half decent but for some reason end in a big noisy mess, weird sounds, spoiling food, questionable product placements, zero creativity and always incentivize more watching and trapping viewers in the infinite ‘next video’ loop.Instead, one of the goals for my videos will be to take a step back and inspire to create, zero commercial interest, not too much distractions and something parents can trust.Still in the process of figuring out all the parameters, camera, editing, setup etc but its a lot of fun learning new skills. I have a million ideas for the content already so enough work to be done. If there is little to no ‘success’ in terms of viewers, i really don’t care since i enjoy all aspects of it and im building a nice catalog of creative videos to watch with my kid later.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hah this thread is perfect. I just finished building my new four axis robot arm design. It’s all open source. Three months ago I started playing with a new planetary gearbox concept, where the first stage is in the middle with second stages on both sides. The first sun is driven by a shaft that goes through a hole in the second stage sun. The result is a very balanced joint design with parallel outputs. A good configuration for weak materials like plastic. And then the gearboxes and the frame are all integrated together, so this is not something where you assemble a gearbox and bolt it to the frame. The gearbox members and the frame members are unified.I’m very happy with it so far! Video here:https://twitter.com/tlalexander/status/1455320442642714625?s...It’s open source, CC0 licensed. Please fork the design files here!https://cad.onshape.com/documents/d663661f8c0c34e7a29bbfa6/w...EDIT: you may prefer to watch the project and wait to fork it until I have fleshed out a few more things. In that case feel free to star this git repo and I will update it as I make progress.https://github.com/tlalexander/brushless_robot_arm/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Does a history of enforcement help in cases like this? The article itself says that Truth Social is &#34;antithetical&#34; to Mastodon&#39;s values, but that there&#39;s nothing they can do about the usage of their software other than license violations. It sounds like they have a bias to enforce their license in this case.If Mastodon has a weak history of enforcing their license to other organizations, does it weaken the case? I&#39;m wondering if selective enforcement in the software-licensing world hurts the authority or credibility of a license, in the eyes of the law.My wondering was somewhat inspired by the way Nintendo aggressively polices the appearance of its video game trademarks on places like YouTube and basically the rest of the internet. I hear an argument is that if they don&#39;t aggressively enforce their trademark policing, their legal position wouldn&#39;t be as strong if they want to pursue a big violation in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"In terms of &#34;antithetical values&#34;, the machine learning project ml5js.org actually did something about this.  They bound their open-source license to a Code of Conduct¹, which forbids the use of their ML software for (1) discriminating against marginalized communities, (2) building tools that disingenuously manipulate public opinion, (3) building tools of mass surveillance and prediction to repress the rights of people, and (4) building tools that control weapons, including tools that automate the deployment, operation, and targeting of weapons.Reported violations of the Code of Conduct are sent to a Steering Committee, made up of members of the community, who determine if the reported project is in violation of the Code of Conduct.  If so, the Committee takes steps to remedy the situation (e.g. realigning project with the Code of Conduct, or removing ml5.js from the project) — and if no resolution is found, the project falls out of compliance with the terms of the software license.It&#39;s an interesting experiment.² Software is a tool to help us solve problems and reach desired outcomes.  Licenses are also a tool to help us solve problems and reach desired outcomes.  When desired outcomes exclude certain things (e.g. discrimination of marginalized communities, manipulation of public opinion, autonomous weapons, values antithetical to that of a community), it seems a Code of Conduct can also be a worthwhile tool to solve problems and support the outcomes that the community is working towards.  (Of course, wisdom and governance are crucial and not to be taken for granted.  Shout out DKP servers³ for showing some light there.)¹ ml5.js Code of Conduct: https://github.com/ml5js/Code-of-Conduct/² Analysis from KE Mitchell on ml5.js licensing: https://writing.kemitchell.com/2021/01/12/ml5js-Takes-a-Stan...³ On Dragon Kill Points and governance systems in World of Warcraft: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=958945"</p>

Within hours Opendoor came back matching that same selling price. The kicker? It was a unit that Zillow bought.The algorithms are fooling themselves... Opendoor matches Zillow who matches Opendoor and that&#39;s how you get ever increasing offers.Edit: oh, and now Zillow has that unit on the market, priced 14% lower than they paid for it, after 3 price cuts so far.Edit 2: Phoenix/Scottsdale AZ market"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; ‘We’ve determined the unpredictability in forecasting home prices far exceeds what we anticipated and continuing to scale Zillow Offers would result in too much earnings and balance-sheet volatility,’ CEO tells investors.That&#39;s quite a statement. The head of a company with a privileged view of the US residential real estate sector says that the market is &#34;unpredictable.&#34; Not the good kind of unpredictable where you can&#39;t figure out how heavy the money bags that get dropped at your door will be. No, it&#39;s the bad kind of unpredictability where you can... lose money.Reading between the lines, I conclude that Zillow sees a major shakeout in real estate on the horizon. They&#39;ve already been hit with losses and see a lot more where that came from. In an effort to get ahead of whatever is approaching, the company is making an abrupt exit from the home flipping business.Zillow was founded in 2006, as the last US housing market bubble was furiously inflating. It has seen a complete cycle of boom/bust. If anybody knows the US residential real estate sector, it is Zillow."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"General grumpiness about this particular design decision aside, it appears that since the T2 Macs, the main SSD was being used to store core system firmware. On T2 I think it&#39;s BridgeOS that sends the EFI image to the Intel side to boot it, and it does the firmware verification and loading.This setup has a benefit; namely, it is now impossible to brick the system with a bad BIOS/EFI flash, and you&#39;ll never need to use a hardware SPI flasher to recover. Just like the iPhone, you can enter Boot ROM DFU mode, which can&#39;t easily be overwritten, and restore all of the firmware on the system that&#39;s writable.This is great for restoring systems to a known good firmware state, including SSD, EFI, BridgeOS, RecoveryOS. On a normal system, there is plenty of non volatile storage that is difficult to recover or reset.The primary argument against soldering the SSD, or really any other part, down like this tends to be that &#34;Oh, now you can&#39;t just save money by upgrading it yourself|replacing it when it breaks&#34;. On the other side, these machines are engineered as appliances that should achieve a certain degree of reliability. The SSD is reasonably considered to last the &#34;lifetime&#34; of the product, and should it fail, I don&#39;t consider the inability to externally boot to be a huge problem, since whatever failure damaged the SSD is statistically likely to compromise the reliability of the rest of the board. Any failure is grounds for &#34;rework&#34; of the board on a hardware level if necessary,up to and including repair/replacement of the onboard flash, and not just a simple workaround in my opinion. Note that they don&#39;t force you to actually USE the internal SSD - you can still netboot or USB boot I think. It just has to work.Trivia:
-At least on T2 systems, the flash memory itself (the NAND chips) on the mainboard can actually be swapped between units after a DFU restore by unsoldering them and transferring them.The person that did this on YouTube notes that a common reason for SSD failure on T2 machines is due to SSD power regulator circuitry being located close to the intake vents on the side of the MacBook Pro. They recommend that users of these machines open them and clean the dust out often, since dust buildup on the actual power regulator combined with moisture sometimes causes a short circuit, sending high voltage to the SSD and damaging it.This kind of failure (high voltage parts close to low voltage ones, close to liquid damage prone areas, without any underfilling) is documented by Louis Rossmann. It is, however, not always feasible or possible to entirely prevent."</p>

Two stablecoins have crashed so far, SafeDollar SDO, and $TITAN.  They went all the way to zero.Can Tether survive a net outflow? Probably not. They don&#39;t have the collateral.Dai is really a derivative of Etherium. Dai is backed by Etherium at 150%. So
value in Dai is at risk if the price of Etherium drops more than 1/3.  Etherium dropped by half back in May 2021, but recovered. DAI could have crashed at that time if it faced a net outflow. It didn&#39;t, though.The real question is what happens in the next recession."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; To address risks to stablecoin users and guard against stablecoin runs, legislation should require stablecoin issuers to be insured depository institutions, which are subject to appropriate supervision and regulation, at the depository institution and the holding company level.&gt; To address concerns about payment system risk, in addition to the requirements for stablecoin issuers, legislation should require custodial wallet providers4 to be subject to appropriate federal oversight. Congress should also provide the federal supervisor of a stablecoin issuer with the authority to require any entity that performs activities that are critical to the functioning of the stablecoin arrangement to meet appropriate risk-management standards.&gt; To address additional concerns about systemic risk and concentration of economic power, legislation should require stablecoin issuers to comply with activities restrictions that limit affiliation with commercial entities. Supervisors should have authority to implement standards to promote interoperability among stablecoins. In addition, Congress may wish to consider other standards for custodial wallet providers, such as limits on affiliation with commercial entities or on use of users’ transaction data.AKA StableCoin operators should be banks. (Stable Coins will be bank notes)?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting to read this with an eye on the authors&#39; mindset.  Their understanding of stablecoins seems largely centered on Tether (and to a lesser extent, BUSD/USDC).  A lot of their understanding is incorrect when applied to algorithmic stablecoins like Dai, eg. there is no central issuing authority; Dai is minted in exchange for Ethereum (and other cryptocurrencies), not fiat currencies; the effect of a run on Dai is unlikely to spill over into the mainstream financial system; a &#34;custodial wallet&#34; in DeFi is not a company but just an Ethereum address, i.e. a hash of a public/private keypair.Overall I get the sense that the government is still people/organization centric and cannot wrap its head around a future where reality is determined by computer code and people are bit players in the script."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This was a pretty interesting thing to mitigate - we added some support around it to GitLab after it was reported to us, which shipped in the latest security release: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/3fb44197195b57... (you can actually see it in effect on that commit&#39;s examples, which is quite meta). These characters have valid use-cases in right-to-left languages like Arabic, Japanese etc, so it had to be configurable for project-owners if they have legitimate use-cases for it. Our focus was on making sure that repository maintainers could see these characters in code reviews.The homoglyph attack is interesting but it really should be noticed as part of a code review process, as it requires adding the imitation function calls at some point too. It&#39;d also likely be pretty frustrating to end users if we were to highlight every single unicode character that looks like the latin alphabet.It&#39;s certainly a good lesson in not copy/pasting random snippets from the internet and pasting them into a root shell, however :D (we do always highlight the bidi characters on GitLab snippets, though)Aside: this was a royal pain in the arse to figure out if I had live examples in the specs, because vim also just rendered them &#34;correctly&#34;. I ended up checking the files in Windows Notepad on another machine to sanity check them.Thanks to the authors for responsible disclosure."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"As I previously noted on a related post:Interesting paper. Note, however, that the general problem is already known and there are a number of pre-existing works that discuss it. This is typically called &#34;underhanded code&#34; or sometimes &#34;maliciously misleading code&#34;. I&#39;m surprised that they didn&#39;t use the normal term for the problem nor cite the previous work on it - maybe they didn&#39;t realize this was a widely-known problem? Previous works on underhanded code didn&#39;t discuss Bidi to my knowledge (though other attacks on text like this have exploited Bidi).
Here are a number of other materials about underhanded code:The Obfuscated V Contest (http://graphics.stanford.edu/~danielh/vote/vote.html) was created by Daniel Horn in 2004 and is the earliest “underhanded” programming contest that I found. It was a contest to create source code that looked like it did one thing, but actually did another.Underhanded C Contest (http://www.underhanded-c.org/) has run in many years. Per its FAQ, &#34;The Underhanded C Contest is an annual contest to write innocent-looking C code implementing malicious behavior.&#34;My PhD dissertation &#34;Fully Countering Trusting Trust through Diverse Double-Compiling&#34; discusses how to counter the &#34;trusting trust&#34; problem &amp; includes a section about maliciously misleading source code. See: https://dwheeler.com/trusting-trust/The JavaScript Misdirection Contest announced the winner on September 27, 2015 http://misdirect.ion.land/My paper &#34;Initial Analysis of Underhanded Source Code&#34;, (by David A. Wheeler, April, 2020, IDA document: D-13166), discusses underhanded code and the effectiveness of several potential countermeasures. It also includes a number of citations to other works on underhanded code.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Cambridge research clearly shows that most compilers can be tricked with Unicode into processing code in a different way than a reader would expect it to be processed.Unless I misunderstand the premise, this in not right. The compiler is not &#34;tricked&#34; into doing anything different - it interprets the code the same way as it always did. It&#39;s like saying &#34;rm&#34; command &#34;can be tricked into&#34; deleting important files. The rm tool doesn&#39;t know which files are important to you, and the compiler doesn&#39;t - and shouldn&#39;t - know what you consider to be &#34;correct&#34; code. It would correctly compile any code that is syntactically correct - if there are strings inside that look weird to you, it doesn&#39;t matter to the compiler.The entity that can be &#34;tricked&#34; here is the reviewer of the code - who, indeed, might probably be tricked into accepting code that does something different than they&#39;d think it does (though it&#39;d require a very clever attacker to for the code to both do something nefarious with Unicode and still look innocent and not weird to the reviewer). Fortunately, this is quite easy to fix - just don&#39;t accept any patches with source code that have any non-ASCII outside small set of localization resources (proper code would have localizable resources outside the code anyway, tbh) and no Unicode would ever trick you."</p>

What used to cost me 100 something in groceries now regularly goes into the 200s.I&#39;m nothing if not an observationalist, but this CPI is horse dung.For someone like my family, I wouldn&#39;t believe any number less than 20%.The sad thing is, I&#39;ve never talked to a single friend or family member that said otherwise.So what is the government reporting?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Many older people saved large amounts of money in their bank accounts, and were expecting to live off the interest in their savings account once they retired. The interest they were due was effectively stolen when the central banks started giving away free money, it was a massive transfer of wealth.Many of that same generation counted on Social Security, and CPI adjustments to help save them from poverty.  The CPI numbers were pushed down to keep the costs of benefits those retirees were entitled to receive artificially low.  Another transfer of wealth / theft.Now the rest of the population has seen their crappy but steady wages evaporate on a whim, and will no longer settle for less than an actual living wage.  A rebalancing is going to have to take place, and somehow the wealth needs to be transferred back to the working class, or things will get very violent, very quickly. Once that kicks off, our near peers will funnel weapons into the US, and a civil war will make us the latest 3rd world country."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My read on this is that it seems like the equivalent of a subtweet about pay inequality.If that is indeed the case then they should be arguing for something I wrote the SEC about a couple of years ago which is to have public companies report their salary costs broken down by executive pay and non-executive management pay and non-executive non-management pay. And to report the population of individuals in each cohort.That &#39;pie&#39; of payroll costs can be split up anyway a company chooses, but the weighting of it will allow investors to understand the future prospects of a company that under pays its rank and file relative to its executives and management."</p>

Political horse trading to advance the agendas of special interests, at great expense to millions of people.I wonder if the tech community could get involved to increase transparency around this stuff. Imagine if we had an open graph of the money flow so we could write a SQL query like (pseudo code) &#34;select * from donors where payee in (select id from trustees)&#34;. Let people crowdsource the data and then maintain a page of declarative queries so that anyone can instantly see the web of money around public officials. It could be part of a build system that automatically creates a NASCAR jacket for each official so we could see who their donors are in AR.Maybe such a thing already exists. It&#39;s traditionally been accomplished by investigative journalists and lawyers, but why couldn&#39;t it be public? It seems like it would be an effective way to end the bribe system."</p>

All of this despite most of their dopamine loops being totally burned out from hours of smartphone use before they even get to school.The whole education system is heading towards &#34;totally fucked&#34;. This UF politics issue is just 1% of the puzzle behind why everything sucks so hard now. If you personally know any teachers working in K12, lend them your ear.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I have a Model 3. The autopilot was acting weird while driving on the freeway, sometime disengaging, but mostly not tracking the lane smoothly. For an unrelated reason, I opted to view my camera footage, and was shocked to find that my camera was completely blurry. I’m driving down the freeway at 75mph, being guided by a camera that couldn’t pass a standard driver’s vision test.Tesla came out to replace the camera, and it appeared that a film had been deposited on the windshield, obscuring the camera.Living in Phoenix, my car is parked outside, facing south west. During Covid, I’d go many days at a time without driving, and in the summer, the interior temperatures can easily rise over 150f. Within the camera enclosure, there’s a reflection absorbing material, which likely creates a perfect miniature greenhouse.I believe the glue in the camera housing melted/evaporated at these elevated temperatures and deposited on the windshield.Concerned that others would experience this problem, I opened a case with the NHTSA. Crickets.There could be many people driving around on autopilot, with obstructed vision, due to this same failure mode. It’s something Tesla could easily check, and something NHTSA should be investigating.For something as safety critical as a forward facing camera, you’d expect both Tesla and NHTSA would be investigating. I have no indication that anything has happened as a result of my filing. Possibly because nobody else has reported the issue - maybe because nobody else is actively viewing their camera footage? There’s no other way for a Tesla owner to be aware of the issue. Frustrating."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I drive a Tesla. If my car rear ends another car, that&#39;s my fault. Doesn&#39;t matter if I had Autopilot on or not.Imagine if you were rear ended by a Toyota and the driver said &#34;it was on cruise control, shrug.&#34; Would you talk to NTSB or NHTSA about that? Probably not.The only scenario I can imagine that&#39;d warrant investigation is if the driver were completely unable to override Autopilot. Similar investigations have been started by NTSB when Toyota had issues with their cruise control systems several years ago."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The driver said she was using Autopilot, that an OTA update had had a problem earlier in the day, and that she had actually had the same kind of collision on Autopilot previously!So she continued to use it? That&#39;s insane.It&#39;s worrying that there are tons of videos on YouTube reviewing Tesla&#39;s Autopilot and FSD where the cars do something incredibly scary and dangerous, and the drivers just laugh it off, go &#34;well, it&#39;s a beta!&#34; and continue using it instead of turning off the feature that almost got them into a car accident. I don&#39;t want to share the road with drivers who think dangerous driving is a funny game."</p>

(the songs are produced in similar DAWs.) You won&#39;t be able to recreate the vocals, but you should be able to recreate the backing track almost identically. Put the original in right ear, your version in the left ear, and iterate until switching between versions sounds identical.Over 100s of hours, this will train you ears, and you will appreciate the production quality of today&#39;s pop music.This just covers the production and mixing, not the writing. Catchy pop songs sound deceivingly simple, which is the point and why they are so difficult to write."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I used to make music as a teenager. Spending many hours in the &#34;studio&#34; certainly shapes your aesthetics and how you approach new music. Even understanding just the basics and tiny bits of underlying techniques makes you listen differently, makes it easy to become a snob to be honest. Overall though, and generally, making things of any sort lets you appreciate the creative process as an overarching art in itself, an appreciation you can often transport to other fields, even those not conventionally regarded as artistic."</p>

Anti-bot software is nonsense. Its snake oil sold to people without technical knowledge for heavy bucks.If this guy got to experience how systemically bad the credential stuffing problem is, he&#39;d probably take down the whole repository.None of these anti-bot providers give a shit about invading your privacy, tracking your every movements, or whatever other power fantasy that can be imagined.

I guess the other sides of those we don&#39;t see much. People doing actual black-hat work probably don&#39;t post about it on public forums, and most of the over-broad anti-abuse is probably a side effect of taking some anti-abuse tech and blindly applying it to the whole site just because that&#39;s simpler, often no tech people may be really involved at all."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Getting anything out of a subshell that isn&#39;t from STDOUT is impossible. So you can&#39;t define an array in a subshell and then use it outside the subshell, and you can&#39;t return an array (or anything that isn&#39;t a string) from a subshell. If you only use subshells and want to use any kind of data structure that isn&#39;t a string passed from STDOUT, you have to do it globally. And subshells are slow. So nobody uses subshells.If you use Bash for programming, you have to stop thinking in terms of the holier-than-thou software engineer, whose ego believes that a superior, &#34;clean&#34; design makes a superior program. You should embrace globals. You should switch between using or not using the enforcement of set variables or program exit status. You should stop using Bashisms and subtle, obscure language features unless you absolutely have to.Bash is not a &#34;real&#34; programming language, so do not treat it as one. Do not look for hidden features, or try to do things in cute ways that nobody else uses. There is no superior method or hidden knowledge. Just write extremely simple code and understand the quirks of the shell."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Well, because it simply doesn&#39;t work for them: returning from a function does not trigger the EXIT signal.It doesn&#39;t trigger EXIT, but it does trigger RETURN. Just trap both:    #!/bin/bash

        trap &#34;echo &#39;Cleanup!&#39;&#34; RETURN EXIT

It&#39;s the single most controversial book that I&#39;ve read about piano technique and playing that I&#39;ve found.The author, is not even a player himself (!!!). There&#39;s a great summary of reviews about the book here (https://www.pianostreet.com/smf/index.php?topic=38247.0), if you&#39;re starting into piano, stay away, get a decent teacher."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"From the last section in Chapter One, titled &#34;Jazz, Fake Books, and Improvisation&#34;:&gt; In summary, the process of learning this genre consists of practicing the chords and scales sufficiently so that, given a melody, you can “feel” the right and wrong chords that go along with it.That&#39;s only scratching the surface and will not get you playing jazz. Listening to and copying the greats - Bird, Monk, Evans, Coltrane, Rollins, et al. That&#39;s how you learn to play jazz.&gt;It is clear that this genre is here to stay, has great educational and practical value, is relatively easy to learn, and can be a lot of fun.Relatively easy to learn??? Clearly the author hasn&#39;t or isn&#39;t playing jazz."</p>

Had no idea hay exchange existed, the vast majority of our sales were via craigslist and Facebook marketplace, with most being small-scale (50 bales or fewer). The rest came from word of mouth and our local 4-H group.Producing hay at this scale is extremely difficult. The start-up costs are in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and you&#39;re typically barely breaking even. This year is unusual in that supply was way down, so prices were a lot higher than normal. The only reason we can do it is that we have a relationship with someone who cuts &amp; bales a number of small fields for a per-ton fee.I could see a tool like this being useful for large-scale operations that are doing the big round bales yet don&#39;t have an established relationship with a buyer. For an operation like ours, where we are producing small ~60lb traditional square bales, I don&#39;t think we&#39;re going to find anyone local enough who wants to buy at the quantity and size we have.

Dried ink on dead trees. And in the early internet age this book seller outperformed many more &#34;forward looking visionary&#34; startups.Billions and billions spent on making movies as polished as possible, yet &#34;I thought the book was better&#34; is what we always hear.The Metaverse will be programmed with text.The quarterly reports outlining its financial losses will be written in text.When journalists ultimately write its obituary, they will write text."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Metaverse is not bullshit. It&#39;s a sign of desperation.Facebook has _nothing_ for the future.* Blue app is already on it&#39;s death bed.* Instagram is already seeing a massive decline in quality and engagement as its getting close to the end of its lifecycle.* They managed to survive Snapchat, but I think that made them think Instagram is too big to fail. Thus, they didn&#39;t go after TikTok. It was a mistake.* What&#39;s App is not monetizable.* Oculus is not becoming the next PS4/Xbox like they hoped.Facebook is usually being compared to the likes of Apple, Google and Amazon. It&#39;s nothing compared to them. It&#39;s not even gonna be able to do a Microsoft/IBM pivot as it has no monetizable developer ecosystem.I personally think they should&#39;ve acquired TikTok last year when TikTok was looking to be acquired by Microsoft.

The shape of the metaverse will be formed by a new generation, not by older guys (and not by fortnite addicts who play by the rules of the former) who know nothing better than drive a fancy “car” on the “road”, as if roads or a concept of physical movement or the euclidean rule would still be there for common use and not for museums. Virtual worlds up to date, like second life, were mostly just stupid copies of “real life”, which was designed after some physical limitations, or fantasy worlds of parallel earth-likes with a limited magic.If the only limitation of metaverse is Code and Content, and if that would be much easier to create, then in a blink of an eye it will turn into something absolutely inconceivable to mercedes benz drivers. What really is bullshit, is lack of imagination in people and a shitload of thought inertia. Personally, it feels like the article author has never ever been in the internet, confining themselves at a small circle of “social” networks bs. Those will live in an exact copy of their current environment, paying to bigcorps with their work hours to achieve “expensive” toys, to impress similar narrow-minded guys.

Was super disappointed when I bought one for our daughter last year and found that they had changed it to a digital music player that only uses the records for song selection.A lot of the modern day versions of the original Fisher-Price toys don&#39;t hold up to the originals.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m not sure how common this is in other countries, but here in Germany we have quite a few &#34;water playgrounds&#34;. There are some pumps in the sand, sometimes small aqueducts and the likes, so during summer, the kids can play with water. The pumps used to be real pumps. Now they are electronic. They have a sensor to detect how fast the handle is moving and at a certain speed you&#39;ll hear a clicking sound, a valve opens and the water starts flowing.I think some children will realize how these things work. They might start to find them dumb if they find out that the strenuous repetitive movement is in fact unnecessary. At least to me it feels like a dishonest contraption and I&#39;d prefer if they simply put a button on it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"When you make housing an investment, by definition, it has to become less affordable in the future.Until a country decides to stop making policy to support this notion that a basic need should be an appreciating asset and not a depreciating one like food, transportation, etc, this completely unsurprising trend will continue. It is a strange world we live in where we collectively believe that a basic need should increase in price over time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m always a bit amused at this sort of article.At it&#39;s heart it is an attempt by someone who makes their living selling a thing (real estate) to instill a since of FOMO in order to motivate you to buy something now rather than perhaps later. You can&#39;t really fault them, it does tend to work.I happen to live in the &#34;red hot&#34; Bay Area and twice wince I&#39;ve been living in my house its value has gone DOWN year over year rather than up. I have never considered it an &#34;investment&#34;, rather it is a fixed cost that I have to pay to live indoors. My parents live in Las Vegas, and that housing market, which has been largely unconstrained, demonstrated exactly what that means. Houses in Vegas for a long time depreciated after you bought them, just like cars. They did that because there was so much new housing being built that you could buy a &#34;new&#34; house for the same price as a &#34;used&#34; house. Guess what, people opted for &#34;new&#34; and used houses needed to sell at a discount if they wanted to sell.One of the truisms for years was the value of a house was intimately tied to its location. This because it was close to jobs, or schools or what not. It is my hope that remote work really takes hold and you can work just as reasonably in a $100,000 house in Missouri as you can in a million dollar house in the Bay Area. That would really create some downward pressure on prices because of simple market dynamics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unfortunately the article is extremely sloppy with the numbers and that makes it very hard to understand what is really going on.Primarily, they keep mentioning &#34;average house-price-to-income ratio&#34; but appear to be using average home price and median income.  Both housing price and income distributions are enormously skewed.  In the Unites States average income is almost double median income and that difference has been increasing over time.  So right there, even if median house price to median income has stayed constant, you would notice the pattern pointed out.I don&#39;t doubt the central premise that housing prices are rising faster than income within household, but unfortunately the article does nothing to show it."</p>

Even getting motivated to do things you want to do is hard, resorting to the laziest activity is often what happens, phone, social media, television. Sometimes I can&#39;t even get myself to play a video game and I love video games.And when the night comes, you&#39;d think sleep is what you need, but that same day of desk job actually gives you insomnia, falling asleep is hard, and while you sleep it&#39;s as if all of that mental activity is still happening in your head from the work day.If physical labor work paid me as well and provided the same benefits, I&#39;d probably switch back to it honestly."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This analysis is solely focused on the &#34;job&#34; aspects of pre-industrial life and includes almost none of the domestic considerations. I&#39;m not sure if it would be fair to call all non-wage time &#34;leisure&#34;. Once work was still over there were still things to clean, fix, prepare, butcher, etc.Although, I think it goes without saying that before affordable lighting and heating, we all underestimate how lazy winters were for the average peasant, whether idyllic or not (accounts I have read make it sound incredibly, incessantly dull).And I think the best evidence we have that we are overrating the quality of pre-industrial leisure time is that people developed almost no leisure activities! Common people had almost no sports, no games (beyond precursors to Bocce or backgammon), no literature! They supposedly had half a year of doing nothing, and perhaps singing and drinking was sufficient to fill the time, but you&#39;d think they would show lots of other innovations. Or even steal the activities of the rich (organized sports)!Instead you don&#39;t see leisure activities develop until the rise of the 40 hour workweek and the availability of consumer appliances.Edit: I hope people understand that the argument the article presents is largely a romanticization of poverty."</p>

With code making use of the fact that we are running on known hardware, so we can optimize it rigorously.If you focused on supporting the official raspberry pi keyboard, mouse, and touchscreen you could circumvent a lot of the pains around driver issues. Then people could actually get up and running with your OS with real hardware, and you could start dogfooding it.I’ve heard people say that the software we use is up to 100 times slower than it needs to be. So my hypothesis is that if the software was written smarter, and used the fact that we know the hardware ahead of time, we should easily hit a 100 times performance increase across the OS.Also if it were possible, it would be cool if this OS supported a minimal boot mode, that could be configured to only run the bare minimum amount of apps required for a certain piece of software. So for example a game mode that ran the game, and the bare minimum amount of OS the game needed to run.And since we are in full on fantasy land we can take this one step further.

You then figure out how those pieces can work together to solve the problem. After that you can see the system as nested subsystems and interactions, which you can draw as diagrams and call it an architecture.So I see &#34;architecture&#34; more as a teaching and communication technique, applied after the fact. Altho since we&#39;re always moving between the details and the big picture, having organized abstractions (ie an architecture) in mind will help keep the design clean.The architecture evolves and sharpens as a system comes together. And this evolving architecture provides the team with a common terminology and overall direction.But you rarely start by choosing a specific architecture.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I’m kinda confused by the criticism of the industry and NASA not designing for Starship.The author argues that NASA doesn’t understand Tempe game changer that Starship is, but I don’t think that’s accurate. I think the risk to NASA of assuming the benefits of Starship before it’s proven are just too high.If NASA (or other industry players), assume Starship will deliver the benefits it promises, they to fundamentally alter their approach to space. But that leaves them with no backup plan in the event that Starship fails to materialize or deliver on its promises.Whereas this other approach, of treating Starship like a much better vehicle but integrating it into its old processes, gives them an out if Starship fails in some way. Because they’re still using the “old” assumptions, they can fall back to other “old space” style providers.I think once Starship has proven itself capable of deliver on its promises, you’ll see NASA changing its approach radically in the manner the author describes.So, fundamentally, I think it’s not a lack of “understanding”, but a different calibration of “risk”. This also applies to many existing space companies, and I also think this gives opportunities for new companies that have a higher risk tolerance to take advantage."</p>

When Miller showed his results to Urey, the latter suggested a paper should be published as soon as possible. (Urey was senior but generously declined to be listed as co-author, lest this lead to Miller getting little to no credit for the work.)As if Urey doesn&#39;t deserve enough respect, the story is better than described:Sub-article Quote:
After Miller showed the impressive results to Urey, they decided to submit them to Science. Urey
declined Miller’s offer to coauthor the report because otherwise Miller would receive little or no credit. Knowing that a graduate student could have a difficult time getting a paper like this published, Urey contacted the Science editorial office to explain the importance of the work and ask that the paper be published as soon as possible. Urey kept mentioning the results in his lectures, drawing considerable attention from the news media.The manuscript was sent to Science in early February of 1953. Several weeks went by with no news. Growing impatient, Urey wrote to Howard Meyerhoff, chairman of AAAS’s Editorial Board, on 27 February to complain about the lack of progress. Then, on 8 March 1953, the New York Times reported in a short article entitled, “Looking Back Two Billion Years” that W. M. MacNevin and his associates at Ohio State University had performed several experiments simulating the primitive Earth—including a discharge experiment with methane wherein “resinous solids too complex for analysis” were produced. The next day, Miller sent Urey a copy of the clipping with a note saying “I am not sure what should be done now, since their work is, in essence, my thesis. As of today, I have not received the proof from Science, and in the letter that was sent to you, Meyerhoff said that he had sent my note for review.”Infuriated by this news, Urey had Miller withdraw the paper and submit it to the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Ironically, at the same time (11 March), Meyerhoff, evidently frustrated by Urey’s actions, wrote to Miller that he wanted to publish the manuscript as a lead article and that he wanted Miller—not Urey—to make the final decision about the manuscript. Miller immediately accepted Meyerhoff’s offer, the paper was withdrawn from the Journal of the American Chemical Society and returned to Science, and was published on 15 May 1953.https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Prebiotic-Soup--Revisi..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Glad to hear about this. I sued Facebook in a California small-claims court to rescind my purchase of the Quest 1 (and all accessories and game purchases) after I declined the change in ToS adding the FB account requirement. It took a while (negotiated with their customer support, then sued, then finally months later got an intelligent response), but we settled for what I asked for. I can&#39;t be the only one who got my money back. I liked the product except for the added account requirement, and I would now consider buying again."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It begs the question: if they host the social media account and VR account and can reliably identify / link them on their end, and the laws and terms allow them to do so, does it really matter if they’re different accounts?It&#39;s still a win if you don&#39;t have a facebook account.  For everyone else: I would assume that they will identify your accounts reliably."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Mark&#39;s statement was worded carefully in that he stated access would not longer require your _personal_ Facebook account. I interpreted this to mean you&#39;ll still need a Facebook account, but it would be through a Facebook for Work account (although I&#39;m not sure if today these are distinct entities)."</p>

Admittedly, that 37 cycle fixed cost is probably quite a bit higher, and I don&#39;t know how well the bit mixing compares.Parenthetically, a time equation (like t_cycles = coef * bytes + fixedCost) is a more convenient way to summarize performance of this kind of thing than the constant short string/long string mumble-mumble.  Yes, loop unrolling/etc. can create step-ish functions and a linear regression is pretty approximate (but my stderrs are pretty small above), but even so..much less tripping over words."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Very grateful that my employer has committed to remaining flexible with remote work. Full time in the office, hybrid, or full time remote. It’s up to the individual. Full time remote has done wonders for my health - instead of a 2 hour commute I get to exercise. Instead of coming home stressed, annoyed, and sitting in front of the TV, I go outside for a solid hour+ after I close my laptop. I travel more liberally now that I don’t have to take time off to do so. My quality of life has never been better, and my gratefulness translates into feelings of loyalty towards my employer. Why would I quit if I’m treated well and have a nice work life balance? Why would I risk this situation by slacking off when I am on the clock?Prior to the remote shift, I was unhappy and I didn’t even realize. No exercise, no passion outside of work. All my energy went into my 10+ hour day (when you consider the commute).Since then I’ve lost 30lbs, become enamored with new sports and hobbies, and my social life outside of work exists again. I feel more “alive” than I have in a decade.I’ll never work for a company that doesn’t allow me that flexibility for the rest of my career, as long as I can help it. Companies that want access to good talent would be wise to follow this example."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; ... There is a more intriguing possibility, however. Work that is largely done remotely may be more efficient compared with an office-first model.I don&#39;t think in-person real-time communication is always effective. No, I personally think it&#39;s one of the least method of communication that can happen in an office environment when the topic gets slightly complex (that is, if the topic is complex enough for you to write a memo about it).For those topics, I love to communicate with some &#34;written&#34; form, such as in an email, posts etc. Because doing the &#34;writing&#34; part allow me to conduct some research and analyses on the topic (usually took 10 minutes), which will in turn increase the quality of my reply.If you standing right in front of me and asked a question that require a complex answer, then my reply will probably make me look like an idiot, because I might not able to discover all the information that I need to process and output within 30 seconds. Not very effective in my opinion."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Blender is such an amazing tool. I have a side business where I create 3d printed jewelry with my customer&#39;s fingerprints on it in gold and silver (https://lulimjewelry.com) and I use Blender on the backend for all of the jewelry creation.I run blender headless in a docker container on google cloud run. When needed I invoke it with an image and have a blender script &#34;engrave&#34; that image on the jewelry and output an STL file.It is incredibly flexible to script in python, although its not very &#34;pythonic&#34;. The UI is quite stateful (edit mode, object mode, which items are selected, etc) and you have to keep track of that state in your program. But once you get around those issues you can do quite a lot, and its all a free program!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I love Blender, but have been stuck on version 2.7 due to what I can only describe as some sort of icon dyslexia.For 2.8, all the Blender icons were replaced with monochromatic ones. This is a very popular trend and a lot of programs are replacing their icons in this way, so it&#39;s obviously fine for most people, and I realize this is probably a niche accessibility need I have.But, to use the new icons, I find I have to check each one every time to find the one I want. Instant recognition is no longer possible. For me, this extra cognitive load makes it difficult to use Blender for more than a few minutes at a time.Blender is a fantastic product and one of the best examples of what open-source can be, but I for one will be appreciating it from afar, and remaining on 2.7 until there is a way to get more usable icons."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; The general guideline will be to keep Blender functionally compatible with 2.8x and later. Existing workflows or usability habits shouldn’t be broken without good reasons – with general agreement and clearly communicated in advance.Oh boy. How I wish so much that other software developers would follow this principle... It seems nearly every software I use and rely on has to change its appearance and interface every 6-12 months, breaking familiarity for no objective reason, and simply because &#34;it looks better&#34; to look at (and not necessarily to use!) to the subjective eyes of someone."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"&gt; * The POSIX-blessed way of finding an executable program is command -v, which is consequently built into most shells. Given the standard alternative, Adams said, &#34;surely no one competent would choose to have a package depend on `which` when a standard POSIX utility can do a better job&#34;.*This feels a little tone-deaf to me.  I&#39;ve been using the *nix command-line and writing (and reading) shell scripts for 20+ years, and I&#39;d never heard of &#34;command -v&#34; until now.  Now that I know about it, I&#39;ll probably start trying to retrain my muscle memory to use it (though it requires 2x the number of keystrokes).Despite its lack of true standardization, &#34;which&#34; (along with &#34;type -p&#34;) has been the de-facto &#34;standard&#34; I&#39;ve seen in shell scripts for figuring out if a command exists.  It was a surprise to me to learn that &#34;which&#34; isn&#39;t a part of POSIX, even."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Regardless of whether &#39;command -v&#39; is a better alternative, &#39;which&#39; is ensconced as standard practice in many shell scripts, and I would go so far as to say I think the majority of them that actually have to choose between the two use &#39;which&#39;.Given that, having it print out a deprecation warning without considering what that means to all the people that use it is irresponsible.  I help manage a few hundred servers.  We send root email to a list and actually review it all every day.  We make sure to sanitize anything run from cron so that we only get email output on error (STDERR).  Given that some of those cron jobs run quite often, this would have been thousands of emails to sift through if we used Debian.There were many possible solutions, as the maintainer notes.  Unfortunately in trying to remove themself from the decision, they forced a non-solution on everyone that is disruptive.  I can&#39;t think of any way this is a good choice for this particular set of facts (I can see a deprecation warning being warranted for some other things, but this case has little to do factually with those theoretical situations)."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m a descriptivist when it comes to standards. When everyone uses `which`, POSIX should add it. &#34;but it&#39;s non-standard!&#34; can be fixed by making it a standard."</p>

If China tried to extradite a U.S. citizen acting within the U.S. who published leaked information allegedly in violation of Chinese law, we&#39;d laugh them out of the courtroom, and rightly so.Adding insult to injury, publishing leaked military secrets is not even illegal in the U.S. due to the first amendment right to a free press. When the New York Times publishes leaked classified information, there&#39;s no trial or extradition. In the U.S., those who will have legitimate access to classified information first sign legally binding agreements not to disseminate it, and those who violate that agreement can be prosecuted.And in this case, that already happened: Manning served 7 years in jail for leaking the very information that Assange is being extradited over. With the leaker found and prosecuted, convicted, and sentence served, the U.S. Department of Justice should congratulate itself on a job well-done and move on to other things. It&#39;s absurd that they continue to pursue the publisher of the information almost a decade later."</p>

Ubuntu / Arch / Fedora were about 11% faster overall than Windows 11 Pro on this system. Meanwhile, Clear Linux was about 18% faster than Windows 11 and enjoyed about 5% better performance overall than the other Linux distributions."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I wonder how much of these results were actually due to compiler/benchmark implementation rather than operating system mechanisms.I expect file system related (not I/O) benchmarks would differ significantly in Linux&#39; favor as we&#39;d observed with WSL1 vs WSL2; but the rest? Are we to believe that DirectX 12, the API that’s supported by hardware vendors themselves, optimized to no end for first-class gaming, is actually slower than whatever&#39;s on Linux? (Not downplaying the significant achievements of Linux in graphics, but meagerly pointing out the fact that Windows is way ahead in graphics performance because of politics)For example, Windows 11 loses in all Java benchmarks. Coincidentally, Oracle has great investment in Linux as a platform. Is this really a fair operating system comparison?Similarly, GCC is optimized primarily for Linux. Windows is a second-class citizen there. It could be the same case with clang as well, I don&#39;t know. How are we supposed to be sure that compilers treat two OS&#39;s the same? Do benchmark apps get compiled with MSVC on Windows?I think OS performance can only be compared fairly with benchmarks specifically designed to measure OS performance, not performance of a specific application per se, simply because the developers have varying priorities for optimizing their apps for a platform.An OS benchmark could measure context switch latency, I/O latency, raw I/O throughput, certain responsiveness metrics etc, compiled with the preferred compiler of the platform."</p>

Over the course of the pandemic there was a staggering re-balancing of consumer spending [0] from services to goods, to which supply chains have not caught up.If the spending doesn&#39;t re-balance again as restrictions are lifted this is not a temporary supply chain issue caused by just-in-time methodology, it&#39;s just the new normal.[0] https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?ReqID=19&amp;step=2#reqid...EDIT: That link is broken, should have been this https://apps.bea.gov/iTable/iTable.cfm?reqid=19&amp;step=3&amp;isuri..."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I worked at a company who made products on contract, but the contract stipulated the vendor we had to use to get the raw materials. The raw materials were just aluminum castings, but they were a custom shape specifically for this customer of ours. They could only be used for this one product.I noticed that the inventory levels of our vendor were dropping, but we weren&#39;t buying. Meaning our customer was ordering the same product from a competitor.I proposed that we spend the money to buy the rest of the material at the vendor. Basically denying our competitor the materials and forcing either them to come to us or the customer dropping the order and reordering through us. This would have been a risk because that&#39;s about a year supply of proprietary castings that we can&#39;t use for anything else, but I really thought it was a worthwhile opportunity. But it went against lean principles so we didn&#39;t do it.Fast forward 6 months and our competitor basically did the same thing to us."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I believe the claim is completely defensible and ultimately correct.A) This was a multi-factoral event certainly but all of these other factor are &#34;immediate causes&#34; which can themselves be traced to absolute maximum return on equity as a more final cause.B) No doubt &#34;hard to restart&#34; process are were involved. But the world relies on single-source, hard to restart, large scale production of many things today because these produce the highest returns for those who invest in them and the lowest prices for those who buy from them. And both kinds of actors have been willing to just stop producing rather than doing something that might be costly to keep production going (and they decided they didn&#39;t want backup before this for the same reason).C) Supply lines that stretch around world exist as a combination of economies of scale and &#34;labor market arbitrage&#34; and both these are driven by return, even though &#34;labor market arbitrage&#34; doesn&#39;t increase efficiency or robustness.D) Chip manufactures put money into &#34;up-date&#34; chip processes, notably leaving the sorts of chips actually used in cars woah fully under-invested and generally many sorts of lack of robustness can be traced down to money flowing only to the normally profitable. Shutting down production isn&#39;t necessarily that bad for a company - they don&#39;t wages and they can start back up once things stabilize. It&#39;s much less disastrous than making a bunch of stuff and not being able to sell it. Clearly, that thinking is guiding a lot of decisions."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been testing one for a couple weeks, and a quick rundown on it: it has a quad-core A53, same CPU/SoC core as the Pi 3, with 512 MB of RAM.This means it can run 64-bit Pi OS, but it is memory-limited and even some of the benchmarks I ran needed extra swap space to complete. But for anything that does run in the 512 MB of LPDDR2 RAM, it is at least twice as fast as the Zero/Zero W, and sometimes 3-8x faster, depending on how things handle threading (4 cores is better than 1!).My biggest concern is overheating—even at the base 1 GHz clock, it will start to throttle after a few minutes in a case with no airflow or heat sink. You can overclock to 1.2, 1.4, or even in some cases 1.5 GHz, but it starts throttling a lot more quickly unless you have really good cooling."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Original RPi0 supposedly can idle at 0.4W, where-as the 3 (whose cpu this is based on) idles at &gt;1.5W. It&#39;s cool to have this great small package, but this is a very different offering than the first RPi0W.It&#39;s felt really weird seeing so little progress in available low power ARM over the years. Atmel/Microships SAMA5D3 / SAMA5D2 with it&#39;s 600 MHz Cortex A5 (2009) still seems like- half a decade latter- one of a rare few genuinely low power Linux running SoC available for purchase/use. I&#39;m forgetting what&#39;s available in the Cortex A7 line, which is a little higher power but which still has some very low power chips available for it, &amp; at significantly higher performance ranges. A7 has a lot of chips you can&#39;t buy, only available in some tablets &amp; or hard to get wearable chips, but I think there are some good offerings about too. ST has the ~$20 STM32MP1, to name one.Yet I just see so much non-materialization, non-availability. It feels like the rule. 2015&#39;s Cortex A35, 2016&#39;s Cortex A32, 2019&#39;s Cortex-A34... none of these chips seem to have really materialized in any genuinely available form. There are some off-brand tablets with A35 chips but generally that&#39;s about it. The low power segment has been rather ignored."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been running one of these for a few months too and was excited when I saw an ARMv7 CPU. In the open source and container world, many projects have stopped supporting the Zero and RPi1 due to its lack of RAM and slow CPU speed. Even running &#34;go build&#34; can take multiple seconds on a simple program. Starting Node.js was also fairly slow.The RPi zero shines for Python scripts that access hardware - for sensors and camera projects that are low power and cheap to make. It was actually perfect for the GrowLab project that we did over the summer with 20 others from the community https://growlab.dev - sensor data and camera images were aggregated to a more powerful RPi3/4 and then either uploaded to a static GitHub Pages site, fed into InfluxDB to create beautiful charts with Grafana.The new Zero 2 means that I can start to run ARMv7 or even ARM64 containers on the zero again, but with the limit of 512GB of RAM. The launch blog post explains why this couldn&#39;t be made higher.The first thing I tried out was not K3s, which I knew already suffers on a Raspberry Pi 3, but faasd. Faasd is OpenFaaS but built for pure containerd, no multi-node networking and no Kubernetes. It works fairly well for a few functions, even with NATS and Prometheus being deployed as part of the stack.So whilst you&#39;re not going to be building K3s clusters with these, they can run containers - with Docker, containerd, nerdctl and even as a full application stack with faasd.Where this gets more interesting for me, is hosting small applications, integrations or APIs. Perhaps with Ingress via a tunnel that can penetrate NAT/firewalls like Inlets, Argo or Ngrok.I&#39;ve ordered one of the release models to see how it performs. Look out for a blog post from me soon."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Many good points. I&#39;d like to add a common open secret that I believe is wrong: 1 upvote = 1 karma point.This might be true internally and initially, before any ant-spam, anti-upvote-ring detection takes place. Effectively, from a user point of view it is not - at least for me.When I look at the points one of my submissions get and compare my increase in overall karma it is very roughly 50% most of the time.   Needless to say that I never participated in things that would be considered unethically (voting-ring etc.). Also not a complaint at all, just an observation that goes against what is often written in &#34;about HN&#34; type posts (but not OP).EDIT:1. My observation is from more than a year ago, so things might well have changed.2. As lordnacho points out below this seems to be true only for stories. Regardless why it happens, awarding stories with less points than comments makes a lot of sense to me. After all posting a suitable story is much less effort than writing a decent comment."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A collaborative resource with more information about undocumented/norms on HN: https://github.com/minimaxir/hacker-news-undocumented&gt; Personally, I’d stay at 3. I’d also wait at least a day between re-posts (and try re-posting at different time slots).Wow, that&#39;s not how I parsed the very same reposting rules. If I&#39;m about to submit something and I found an older submission with the same URL, my personal rule is that it should be older than a year ago before I&#39;d submit it again. Three posts with the same URL for three consecutive days seems a bit too much.&gt; Hacker News is moderated mainly by dang aka Dan Gackle (pronounced ‘Gackley’). He’s not of asian descent???

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;ve been doing web development for 20 years now. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s strictly endemic to web or frontend, but I feel like we&#39;re solving the same problems over and over again, using the same low levels of abstraction.There&#39;s no reason for lists to scroll slowly after so many years of scrolling lists. There should just be one way to do a scrolling list, implemented natively and left alone. Yet, in web development, there&#39;s always a new and different way to do a thing, with either new, or pretty much the same ways for things to be broken.Grumble grumble"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/containThe contain CSS property allows an author to indicate that an element and its contents are, as much as possible, independent of the rest of the document tree. This allows the browser to recalculate layout, style, paint, size, or any combination of them for a limited area of the DOM and not the entire page, leading to obvious performance benefits.I wonder how much of this is browser specific because isn&#39;t this is all about implementation?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"TIL: Chrome DevTools Layers tab, accessible by going to to the three-dot menu &gt; More Tools &gt; Layers, which allows you to see things rendered outside of the browser viewing area (among many other things I&#39;m sure).If you have something that &#34;unmounts&#34; things as they scroll off the screen (&#34;virtualized rendering&#34; as the article calls it, a common feature for data grids), this is great tool for verifying that behavior."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great news!  This is a wonderful project, and the fact that it wasn&#39;t accessible from Germany made me profoundly sad and angry.I hope the responsible copyright lawyers have a hard time sleeping because of this and consider changing their line of work.  If you are blocking people from reading books in the public domain, it is a good indication that you are one of the bad guys.Even worse, they only blocked people from Germany that didn&#39;t know how to use a VPN.  German courts really don&#39;t get how the internet works."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I want state here on fact, the &#34;copyright&#34; is an rather new  anglon-saxon invention and was only later imported to Germany[1]. Interestingly, the era of the &#34;land of poets and thinkers&#34; and the economic rise of Germany was boosted by the fact - that there were no copyrights laws which hindered. Authors had to publish good and more work.[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright#BackgroundQuote from WikipediaPrinting brought profound social changes. The rise in literacy across Europe led to a dramatic increase in the demand for reading matter. Prices of reprints were low, so publications could be bought by poorer people, creating a mass audience. In German language markets before the advent of copyright, technical materials, like popular fiction, were inexpensive and widely available; it has been suggested this contributed to Germany&#39;s industrial and economic success. After copyright law became established (in 1710 in England and Scotland, and in the 1840s in German-speaking areas) the low-price mass market vanished, and fewer, more expensive editions were published; distribution of scientific and technical information was greatly reduced.And from the history arctileHeinrich Heine, in a 1854 letter to his publisher, complains: &#34;Due to the tremendously high prices you have established, I will hardly see a second edition of the book anytime soon. But you must set lower prices, dear Campe, for otherwise I really don&#39;t see why I was so lenient with my material interests.&#34;It is not okay to claim other works as yours, publish private material or just don&#39;t give you a fair share upon your work. Probably we should have opted for another approach than &#34;copyright&#34; or &#34;patents&#34;. Luckily the US at least got &#34;Fair Use&#34; and maybe the idea of a &#34;Culture Flatrate&#34; from Germany is also a good idea."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious as to what changed PGLAF&#39;s mind. Blocking those specific works was all that the court ordered 3 years ago. Blocking everything was PGLAF&#39;s own decision based on perceived risk of further lawsuits about other works. Nothing has really changed to decrease that risk. The plaintiffs may have agreed that those are the only works they own that were in violation, and won&#39;t sue about anything else, but any other German who hold the copyright to works are still valid there but not the US still could."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; There was a rule in the Port of Los Angeles saying you could only stack shipping containers two containers high.This is incorrect.
There was a zoning rule which affected truck yards in Long Beach and Los Angeles. Truck yards. Not the port itself.As stated in the linked tweets actually.But if you don&#39;t believe that you can just google an image of the Port of Los Angeles from let&#39;s say 2019 and count how high the container piles go. Here is a randomly selected image from 2019 where 5 high piles can be clearly counted: https://www.joc.com/sites/default/files/field_feature_image/...Accuracy is important. I&#39;m not an expert on logistics, or zoning laws. But how could I trust the article&#39;s author when they clearly unable to parse their own sources?&gt; Normally one would settle this by changing prices, but for various reasons we won’t get into price mechanisms aren’t working properly to fix supply shortages.It&#39;s nice that the article is not going into that. Instead it hammers on that politicians regulate where and how many containers can you plop down. That is not the real issue.If you are moving containers into an area, and you are not moving an equal amount out then you are going to run out of space to store the containers. It is that simple. You can tweak rules to make a bit more space, for example by stacking them higher in the truck yards. But the real question is: why are the people who own these containers incentivised to move them back to where they want them to be filled?  If you solve that the problem solves itself. If you can&#39;t solve that piles of containers will fill up what little more space you won by tweaking. So the very point the article decides to &#34;not go into&#34; is the only one worth going into."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Someone correct me if I&#39;m wrong, but my understanding is that the &#39;stacking rule&#39; meant that people with more empties than they could stack 2 high on their property were &#34;storing&#34; empties on trailer chassis that carry one container.As I understood it, by letting them stack empties higher, it freed up trailers to be used by trucks to go get containers out of the port. When that happens the port then wants empties to put back on the ship (or full if they are going somewhere) and then the ship can continue on.So the &#34;win&#34; here was that more trailers would be available to take full containers from ships and that would move things along."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m a big fan of this form factor, specifically just big enough to fit a motherboard/CPU/RAM plus a real-size GPU. These all use SFX PSUs and typically just an M2 SSD on the motherboard. They also have only 2 RAM slots.The days of needing a tower are over for most people. I&#39;m all about space-saving while still having a full-power PC.It&#39;s a niche, boutique market but there are some really interesting cases. My personal favourite is the Louqe Ghost S1 [1]. I&#39;ve built one PC with this (the Mk II). I bought a Mk III case but couldn&#39;t source a GPU so ended up just buying a CyberpowerPC prebuilt (which is actually a pretty nice PC, to be fair).They&#39;re not cheap and they&#39;re kind of annoying to buy. Louqe in particular has had huge distribution problems in the US (through Amazon&#39;s logistics service).Another popular one is the Dan A4 [2]. It&#39;s smaller. I personally prefer the Ghost for having better airflow, being more modular and being able to expand the case with &#34;top hats&#34;. This allows you to add a 240mm AIO and bottom fans for some pretty darn good cooling and airflow.Anyway, I&#39;m always excited to see entrants in this market.[1]: https://www.louqe.com/ghost-s1/[2]: https://www.dan-cases.com/dana4.php"</p>
