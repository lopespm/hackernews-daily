By downloading, installing and/or using the font software, you confirm that you have read and agree to be bound by the terms of this End-User License Agreement...Sigh.  I guess I need to read that EULA.Anyway, clicking on that then downloads a pdf rather than a nice link to some web page text.  Sigh.So then anyway, trying to open that pdf then fails in the first two readers I tried.  Sigh.Why must everything in the world be so hard?  Fuck it, never mind.  I&#39;ll let someone else change the world and wait for widespread adoption for this font to reach me in whatever other ways."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"With a few tweaks (monospaced variant), it could make a great coding font.Coding fonts have essentially the same goal: make similar looking characters different: 1liI|, 0O, etc... Code naturally strains our visual acuity: we want to see as much as possible, it means that we may use a smaller font size than we would find comfortable reading text with. Single letter, punctuation, etc... can be really important, in regular text, you can understand even if you can&#39;t read all the characters. So a hyperlegible font can help coders, even those with good vision, and many coding fonts already have &#34;hyperlegible&#34; features."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be honest, what I love about legos is the free play aspect.When I play with my kids, (now 8 and 10), I find that the key thing is not what pieces we have (admittedly, we have a lot of pieces), or instructions, but developing some theme or challenge.The theme could be ‘space’ or ‘under water’ or ‘I’m going to build the taller possible leg structure’ or ‘I’m going to build a vehicle that can be blown across the floor with a fan.’  Once they have a theme, they will do amazing stuff.Also, I believe it’s important to have a big slush pile of pieces.  It’s amazing how much builds change when your are scrounging for piece X, and you see piece Y and think, actually…I see that this app is technologically interesting for the developer, but it doesn’t address my core problem: inspiring kids to get started on free creativity.  For that, I’d more like a Lego theme of the day app, maybe slightly inspired or guided by the kids ages or genders.  If I did that, I’d have the kids submit pictures of their results, and use those over time to assess and improve the quality of my suggested themes at different ages and Lego piles sizes (there is your AI, if you must).The pitch would be ‘inspire your kids to new creativity.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just tested it on my kids lego clone bricks; there are like 800 of them but they are almost exclusively basic shapes (1x1, 1x2, 2x2, 2x3, 2x4 and 1x4) in red/black/blue/green/yellow/gray. This is a picture of the box: https://static-v3.e-jumbo.gr/uploads/resources/137879/201611... ; you&#39;ll see they are exactly like legos.The app identified 400 pieces (of the 800) and unfortunately the resulting ideas were not possible to be constructed because it required pieces we don&#39;t have. Of the 50 ideas I was only able to construct 1 or 2 that had very few pieces.I tried it a couple of times with diferent layout in pieces or lights, nothing really changed.Sorry but it doesn&#39;t work, at least with my kind of bricks."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The Death of Yugoslavia (1996) [1] [2]. Won the BAFTA and Peabody awards that year.It&#39;s a BBC documentary in six episodes about the conflict that caused the dissolution of Yugoslavia and the wars in the Balkans.It stands out among many documentaries for being a truly dispassionate moment-to-moment record of events. No sensationalism, no grand-standing, just the facts.If you&#39;re tired of the Netflix style of documentary — lots of talking heads quickly edited together for sound bites, dramatic music, re-enactments — then this is for you. Sadly, too few documentaries are produced in this style anymore.Edit: Looks like the episodes are on YouTube [3].[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Yugoslavia[2] https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00gfbpy[3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tj9Zw5fN3rE&amp;list=PLdw7wnKe0w..."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This really is a one-click installer, which is excellent. As far as I know it&#39;s the first and only one for M1. It&#39;s quite a polished UI, but there are a lot of features missing. The first ones that come to mind are:- No way to specify a seed. This is an important part of SD workflows, letting you redo an image with a slightly tweaked a prompt.- No way to specify a custom model. Alternative models (such as Waifu Diffusion) are fun to play with too.- No way to generate batches of images.- No way to specify which sampler to use.- No way to adjust the weight of specific sub-phrases, or use negative weights.There&#39;s also no img2img yet, but it sounds like that&#39;s a planned feature.Other GUIs such as https://github.com/sd-webui/stable-diffusion-webui, https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui have many more features - but not all will be trivial to port to M1.P.S.: For the people asking - yes, it can do NSFW images. I checked."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can confirm that this works great on the M1 Max. It has been taking less than a minute to run the model and generate the images. So far I have been really satisfied with the output. Let&#39;s please make one-click installers the norm for future technology. I love nerding out, but wading through dependency hell is not worth it most of the time."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Diffusion Bee is the easiest way to run Stable Diffusion locally on your M1 Mac. Comes with a one-click installer. No dependencies or technical knowledge needed.Features:
- Full data privacy - nothing is sent to the cloud
- Clean and easy to use UI
- One click installer
- No dependencies needed
- Multiple image sizes
- Optimized for M1/M2 Chips
- Runs locally on your computer"</p>

Today firefox &#34;helps&#34; you out and changes what you typed into something else because it knows better than you do what web site you want.It&#39;s run by a character named Vince Cate who moved to Anguilla to protest taxes or something.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Some have A records pointing to the root servers. I’m not sure why this is - I think it might be because no DNS has been configured in the TLD zone for these TLDs.I was also curious about this. It turns out that it&#39;s because dig interprets some TLDs as DNS record types (MD, MG, MR, MX) or DNS classes (IN and CH) of the same name! Not sure why, but when given only a type or class (without a domain name), dig actually queries for a list of the root servers, which explains the strange results. Looks like using the -q option to specify the domain name works around this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I was responsible for the Turbo C (later Borland C/C++) run-time library in the late 80s and early 90s.Tanj Bennett created our original 8087 floating point emulator. It was real mode, 16-bit code, that kept an 80-bit float in five 16-bit CPU registers as a working value during its internal math calculations. If you ever coded for the PC you will appreciate just how precious register space was on the 8086/8088.It&#39;s been a few decades and my memory is fuzzy but I don&#39;t recall any critical places where the registers had to be saved and restored. He choose math algorithms and code paths specifically to keep all five live at all times. Tanj&#39;s code flowed with an economy of motion that brought to mind the artistic performance of a professional dance troupe. I did not have the math skill and could not have ever created it as he had. It brought me genuine pleasure just to read his code.Eventually, it came time to port it to 32-bits (real and protected modes.) I wrote new exception handlers and replaced the instruction-decode logic with a nice table-driven scheme but did not touch the core math library. It still ran in 16-bits under the hood exactly as Tanj designed it.Tanj, if you happen to see this, I have fond memories of your emulator. It was beautiful."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Nobody has mentioned Knuth’s corpus of work in Pascal-Web for the TeX ecosystem. This is code written for an era where there wasn’t an ecosystem of libraries for common tasks and even things like being able to access a file in random access order couldn’t be counted on. Even 7-bit ASCII couldn’t be counted on as a given (EBCDIC-based IBM mainframes were a significant element of the computing landscape still).Against all that, Knuth wrote code that could be ported to other systems (I first used TeX on an IBM mainframe running VM/CMS, then later on a VAX minicomputer running VMS, then on a PC with DOS, PC with OS/2, PC with Windows and now a Mac with OS X/MacOS. His presentation of code and internal documentation intermingled is something which I could see still being useful now, although sadly, literate programming seems all but dead now. I still go back to Knuth’s code to understand how to solve some problems on occasion even though it’s about 30 years since I last wrote a line of Pascal."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Postgres code is very good, redis as well. Some of the core parts of Linux also totally worth learning from.I also remember how Qt UI code and docs were a revelation after the nightmare of win32 and related frameworks.Bellard&#39;s original Tinycc was very entertaining and took a while to digest.Most old and well-maintained projects are worth learning from.Apart from some local tips and tricks what is more important is understanding that there&#39;s nothing special about other people&#39;s code."</p>

Pretty much sums up what rich people think about technology: make it sexy and powerful but I don&#39;t want to hear about ongoing maintenance costs. According to Wikipedia, new clients needed £500k in disposable funds to set up an account back in 2001.[0][0] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coutts"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"What I find really amazing is that we have here an incredibly elite service that the vast majority of people will never be able to afford, and yet its elite clients are dependent on essentially the same mobile devices that everyone else is. You can spend ~$2k on a phone, and it will be the best phone you can buy. There&#39;s no $20k phone that will be any better.It&#39;s like flying in first class and then having to queue up in the same immigration line as everybody else - except in that scenario you can pay your way into a priority lane.True, ~$2k is still a lot for a phone, but it&#39;s within reach of so many more people than the gatekept world of private banking and jets.This is not a comment about wealth disparity - it&#39;s about goods which seem to resist the impact of wealth disparity; where there is a relatively low upper bound on how good of a thing you can buy."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a road cyclist commuter, I find that the most aggressive motorists tend to also be in larger vehicles. Whenever I&#39;m taking the lane to attempt to prevent an unsafe pass, it&#39;s almost always the driver of a large truck that will still execute an unsafe pass anyway (forcing oncoming traffic to take evasive action) or will tailgate, rev their engine, yell out their window, and/or wiggle back and forth in apparent frustration and intent to intimidate me."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Using three separate identification strategies we show that, controlling for own-vehicle weight, being hit by a vehicle that is 1000 pounds heavier generates a 40–50% increase in fatality risk. [...] We consider two policies for internalizing this external cost, a weight-varying mileage tax and a gas tax, and find that they are similar for most vehicles. The findings suggest that European gas taxes may be much closer to optimal levels than the US gas tax.In an environment of wealth inequality, this seems like another way that the wealthy can benefit: easily afford to drive heavier vehicles that increase their personal safety while increasing the lethal threats against the poor.How about instead: if larger vehicles are more dangerous for the population overall, then they should be banned for everyone, not only effectively off-limits to the poor."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like heavier cars being a separate license or an endorsement on your existing car license is a sensible idea. They have very different handling characteristics, and it&#39;s pretty noticeable a lot of their drivers lack the skill required to operate them safely.I mean the idea that you can sit your license test in a subcompact and then go out and drive a 4 door high displacement ute/pickup truck is pretty absurd on the face of it."</p>

This is in the Caddy 2.6 beta already: https://github.com/caddyserver/caddy/releases/tag/v2.6.0-bet... - please try it out!Thanks to Marten Seemann for maintaining the quic-go library we use. (I still haven&#39;t heard whether Go will add HTTP/3 to the standard library.)Caddy 2.6 should be the first stable release of a general-purpose server to support and enable standardized HTTP/3 by default. HTTP versions can be toggled on or off. (Meaning you can serve only HTTP/3 exclusively if you&#39;re hard-core.)PS. Caddy 2.6 will be our biggest release since 2.0. My draft release notes are about 23 KB. We&#39;re looking at huge performance improvements and powerful new features like events, virtual file systems, HTTP 103 Early Hints, and a lot of other enhancements I&#39;m excited to show off on behalf of our collaborators!"</p>

Certs &#34;just work&#34; across the cluster once consul is wired up.  I recently added IPv6 which also &#34;just works.&#34;greenpau/caddy-security is fantastic and &#34;just works&#34; for OIDC sso.mholt, thanks for recently adding the ability to bind to multiple specific IP addresses by default, this help me conserve precious public IPv4 addresses."</p>

They write:&gt; In this course, we’ll be looking for the following trifecta: (i) ideas that are non-obvious, even to the well-trained computer scientist, so that we’re not wasting your time; (ii) conceptually simple — realistically, these are the only ideas that you might remember a year or more from now, when you’re a start-up founder, senior software engineer, PhD student, etc. (iii) fundamental, meaning that there is some chance that the idea will prove useful to you in the future.In the first lesson, they discuss consistent hashing, and they seem to have achieved their goals.ETA: Must include this anecdote on the history of the algorithm:1. 1997: The implementation of consistent hashing given in this lecture first appeared in a research paper in STOC (“Symposium on the Theory of Computing”) [...] Ironically, the paper had previously been rejected from a theoretical computer science conference because at least one reviewer felt that “it had no hope of being practical.”2. 1998: Akamai is founded.3. March 31, 1999: A trailer for “Star Wars: The Phantom Menace” is released online, with Apple the exclusive official distributor. apple.com goes down almost immediately due to the overwhelming number of download requests. For a good part of the day, the only place to watch (an unauthorized copy?) of the trailer is via Akamai’s Web caches. This put Akamai on the map.4. April 1, 1999: Steve Jobs, having noticed Akamai’s performance the day before, calls Akamai’s President Paul Sagan to talk. Sagan hangs up on Jobs, thinking it’s an April Fool’s prank by one of the co-founders, Danny Lewin or Tom Leighton."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"VMLS by Stephen Boyd (also of Stanford) would be great background reading for the vector/matrix stuff (i.e. most of this course): https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18678314I love this book. As opposed to the way that linear algebra is typically introduced, this book focuses on concrete applications (like text analysis, image/signal processing, finance, ML, etc.) and eschews more arcane concepts (like eigen). To me, building practical intuition is the best way to learn* the subject.A more advanced but still accessible manuscript by Boyd et al: Generalized Low Rank Models (establishes connections between PCA/SVD and many other matrix factorization methods, and shows you how to roll your own): https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/pdf/glrm.pdf"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is a really elegant point.&gt; Doing upfront authorization of powers is relatively efficient, and is also pleasingly self regulating. If an agency overloads or confuses its ex ante regulator, they simply won’t get permission to do things. This provides a strong incentive for clear and concise requests to the regulator.It is very easy for regulators, even well-meaning, to focus on what they require of an individual transaction.  But we live in a world where automation and dynamic workforces make it possible to break every expectation about how a system will be used."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"That last line made me laugh, but it&#39;s funny because it&#39;s true. It&#39;s down to the &#34;sit where you&#39;re sitting&#34; effect.Noam Chomsky famously told Andrew Marr during an interview that he was sure Marr was sincere and believed everything he was saying, but if he&#39;d believed anything else, he wouldn&#39;t sit where he was sitting.It follows from that true observation that the only time such appointed watchdogs (whether oversight board members or news personalities) are actually doing something, is when they quit, or at least threaten to quit."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"To be clear, this is an extremely tiny subset of JS. It looks like they only implemented the features needed to run a very specific function. For example, the only symbol allowed after &#34;new&#34; is &#34;Date&#34;, everything else throws an exception.It&#39;s still fun that it&#39;s there, but it&#39;s not as big a deal as it sounds from the tweet."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Anyone who has ever pulled a website from a script knows the pain that is Javascript. Normally you want to just get some text and work out the API actions but a lot of sites use horribly obfuscated Javascript -- either because that&#39;s what modern web development is (lolz) -- or because its part of their &#39;security.&#39; That means if you want to write browser-based bots properly -- you ought to use a browser. There are special browsers that run &#39;headlessly&#39; or are designed mostly for bot use. Like https://www.selenium.dev/ which plugs into a few different &#39;browser engines.&#39;But now you have another problem. Your simple script goes from being small, simple, self-contained, and elegant gem, to requiring a full browser, specialized drivers, and/or daemons running just to work. If you&#39;re using something like Python you just frankly don&#39;t have very good packaging. So it&#39;s hard to string together all that into a solution and have it magically work for everyone. What YouTube-dl have done is good engineering. Even though it&#39;s not a full JS interpreter: they&#39;ve kept their software lean, self-contained, and easier to use."</p>

I&#39;ve found it&#39;s excellent for communicating with people in general during conflict (especially patients). The author is a counsellor and describes real counselling sessions with parents who want better relationships with their children. I enjoyed how the author uses the same techniques on the adults and obtains the same manner of response as when used on the kids.Understanding Complexity is not a book but a part of the Great Courses. It&#39;s hard to say what it directly changed but it did affect how I view everyday life, from traffic to physiology.Hui&#39;s Approach to Internal Medicine was very helpful for transitioning from knowing about medical facts to practical medical knowledge useful to everyday care. It&#39;s focus is on &#39;approach&#39; rather than facts. It has a practical approach to medical issues.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"The key reason web frameworks dominate these days is that it&#39;s very hard to keep the UI in sync with state.That&#39;s it - that&#39;s the problem they solve. People started writing vanilla HTML/CSS/JS and struggling to make &#34;reactivity&#34; (hence React) work well when web applications got complex with a lot of state to manage. So we started building frameworks on frameworks and abstractions on abstractions and ended up where we are today.It&#39;s gone a bit far but the overall purpose is a valid one.(From someone who has used React professionally but uses vanilla HTML/CSS/JS for his personal website)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Honestly, I&#39;m turned off by these frameworks. Javascript is an easy language, and these frameworks raise the bar to entry. Many will say they make things &#39;easier&#39; but that&#39;s not my personal experience. Some context: I wrote a lot of JS in the early/late 2000s (Anyone remember WebFX by Erik Arvidsson?). His follow-up gig became WebOS[0]Back then it was called DHTML or Dynamic HTML and then evolved into the HTML5 standard later on. The syntax of React &amp; Vue is just too weird for me. Frankly I&#39;ve reached a framework fatigue after learning jQuery inside out which was a hard-won battle, and then having to learn React/Vue/Svelte just to stay &#39;in the game&#39; is too much for me. Excuse me if I&#39;m biased here.[0] https://newmedia.fandom.com/wiki/Web_Operating_System"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The web was originally created to share documents, so interactivity and extra functionality was an afterthought. As the web became more popular, websites started to add more functionality similar to traditional software programs.Eventually, the original guideline of HTML for structure, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity started to not really make sense anymore for many websites, because as pages became more interactive, the lines became blurred. If you look at a site like GMail, where does the page structure end and interactivity begin?With large parts of a page being interactive, it becomes difficult to manage all the state involved, especially if it’s a “live” page that updates in real time and may have several people viewing it.Frameworks were introduced as a way to manage state and allow websites to re-render efficiently without hard page refreshes."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I remember when I was a young assembly programmer and I looked down on those obtuse C programmers who needed such a slow high-level language. After high-school, having read all those fantastic W. Richard Stevens books I simply could not understand why anybody on earth wanted to use C++ when C was easily capable of modeling complex object structures. When they forced us to use Java, I was deeply in shock: was this really a programming language or more a toy for little kids and why would they want to slow down computers to a crawl?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The &#34;letters to the editor&#34; are really fun to read -- it&#39;s like reading the HN comments of the time, with the same combination of insight and cynicism.&gt; In response to Gregg Williams&#39; editorial (&#34;The New Generation of Human- Engineered Software,&#34; April, p. 6), the mouse of Lisa, Visi On, and their predecessor, the Xerox Star, is a truly fascinating hardware device, and on those few occasions that I have seen these devices in use, I have been impressed. But the mouse is not revolutionary, and, as its name suggests, it is really nothing more than a rodent. Its functional predecessor was the light pen. Some years ago, light pens were fashionable devices for selecting a particular function, and they are still in use. But displays attaching light pens had to have an appropriate phosphor, and they were not as easy to program as function keys. About the same time, touch- sensitive screens were introduced, and they are still used in applications such as online catalogs in libraries; here, too, however, programming appears to be the chief stumbling block.&gt; If the name of the game is &#34;ease of use,&#34; the industry would be far wiser to develop touch-sensitive displays than mice. Because a display has no moving parts, it is likely to prove more durable than a mouse. And a finger placed on a display screen does not require additional desk space, as a mouse does. If an executive were having an office conference, don&#39;t you think he might rather touch his screen a couple of times than roll a mouse around his desk pressing buttons on it?&gt; There are, obviously, many considerations at work in the development of new products. My bet, simply stated, is that the mouse is not a viable product. At best, it will limp along like bubble memory. - John P. Rash, President, Acorn Data Ltd.There&#39;s also:- Several refutations to a previous letter which claimed CRT monitors are a radiation hazard- An engineer from Intel responding to criticisms of their FORTRAN compiler with &#34;those issues have been fixed in the latest version&#34;- Debate over structured programming and strong typing- Debate on what &#34;computer literacy&#34; means and whether the general population needs it (including a claim that WYSYWIG editors and desktop file managers do not make computers easier to use because &#34;a desktop manager is only a sophisticated analog for being able to copy one file into another&#34;)- Conversations on software prices and piracy- And, of course, someone pointing out a typo in an article."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The things that made C successful are rarely recognized even by its fans, but much moreso by its critics and competitors. Things it is most criticized for are among them. They have made C hard to unseat. Too-easy conversion between arrays and pointers is one such criticism, but such conversion was essential to its success.C++ succeeded not just because it can call C libraries -- most languages can -- but because it retained every advantage C has, even those that few recognize. C++&#39;s STL is a success because it built on what made C a success, deliberately. Alex Stepanov, anyway, understood. Most STL components are really just examples.Today we are locked in battle against C&#39;s weaknesses, particularly in how easy it is to exploit C programs. We lose that battle when new languages leave behind what made C successful. Too-easy accidental conversions bad; deliberate conversions possible, good.C got various other things subtly right, too: manifestly enough to make up for its blatant failings. If you would displace C, it is much more important to retain its strengths than to fix its flaws. You can do that without understanding by copying. Retaining strengths while leaving behind flaws requires understanding, which has proven too hard for most."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Good article, though I think it missed explicitly making the point that the reason &#34;engagement&#34; is the metric is because that&#39;s what platforms monetize. Engagement is a euphemism for attention, and social platforms exist to sell your to advertisers.Since the article is written for &#34;community builders,&#34; understanding that engagement is a metric to quantify the advertising potential of a platform should make it obvious that people who aren&#39;t in the business of selling attention to advertisers don&#39;t need to copy social media and optimize for engagement; instead they should target better measurements of value creation for their community. Of course Goodhart&#39;s law[1] still applies.1: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law(edited for readability)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I enjoyed the Monsters Inc reference and the turning of it on its head central to this piece.  But we&#39;ve said/argued this for years and at the end of the day engagement = ad reach = profits and until the economics there change any for-profit social media will gravitate towards engagement.  Hell ANY media gravitates toward engagement and outrage bait.  An actual community built around Mastodon seems possible, and there&#39;s community discussions around private group chats but they will always remain niche and not profitable.I don&#39;t get what https://savannahhq.com is and what the value add is there but that seems to be what he&#39;s interested in, niche + small communities."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I worked in public accounting with some major corporations as clients. Every single company I interacted with used SAP. It is the de facto software in its field and is deeply entrenched. Its UX is the most horribly wicked thing I’ve ever come across. We would conduct walkthroughs with process control owners that showed us what they would do in SAP to perform their job functions, and it would take multiple, intelligent people to capture all of the processes. The knowledge that the users at the client had built up was extensive and highly specialized. If something happened to that person, I don’t think you could quickly plug in a new person and have them take over. The initial learning curve felt far too high. I’m sure it gave those people a sense of job security.I feel there is a lot of room to develop better tools that are not so horrid, however, the process for replacing SAP will be long and close to impossible. SAP feels like one of those businesses that’s too big to fail because it’s so entrenched in the corporate world. Somewhat jokingly, I think it would be easier to switch the US over to the metric system. Any challenger will have to be massive, accept losses for over a decade to gain market share, and have incredible support for their clients if they ever want to takeover in the Fortune 500 world. Challenges too great for a mere startup to accomplish.It’s easier to just hire people to learn the SAP workflow and then hire external auditors to make sure the accounting policies are properly being followed."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"My mother works for a fairly large textile lab. For decades, they used an internally developed system for lab reports (they had a few programmers and admins they called the &#34;nerds&#34; that did nothing else than extend and maintain the system). The company switched to a SAP solution a few years ago. Chaos ensued. The SAP solution missed so many edge cases that a huge number of lab reports were either inaccurate or completely wrong because information was lost in SAP translation between different labs. Sometimes clients (huge international players) noticed the mistakes, which then led to costly product delays. It became so bad that communication between labs eventually had to be done on two levels - within SAP, and &#34;informally&#34; by mail, telephone, or by simply walking to the other lab, adding a huge time overhead to every report.SAP removed virtually every automation advantage of the old system, and added the additional complexity of navigating the SAP GUI. Because of this additional workload and the reluctance of the company to hire more people to counter it (after all, SAP was implemented to streamline everything!), employee turnover suddenly skyrocketed. Everytime I talk with my mother, she complains about the system and tells me that another colleague has quit. She only stays because she only has 2 years until retirement."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am an SAP developer since kind of forever, my first job after university (since 2009). First I hated it, but the deeper I am entrenched, the more I see why you choose SAP: Because there really is no alternative. The data model is so complex because it is growing iteratively since the 80s. Hacker News is valuing businesses that adjust to the customer instead of going for some kind of purity. Another complexity especially now is the different paradigm changes in between. ABAP, the programming language of SAP, is quite nice nowadays. CDSViews are a great invention, and so on. There&#39;s really a lot of innovation buried in the bad documentation, it&#39;s getting better. In summary as bad as it is, I don&#39;t see an alternative for all of the backoffice work. SAP is really flexible and supports a lot of different processes. A thing that makes it so costly is a lot of time culture, no small releases, MVP, and so on. But you can be agile with SAP, especially if you move to the cloud."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Well this part is very familiar:&gt;  its work was given prominence in the engineering operation by former Chief Technology Officer Michael Schroepfer, who announced last year that he was stepping down.At the end of 2016, I joined Twitter to lead one of the anti-abuse engineering teams. My boss, who led the effort, was great: loved Twitter, hated abuse, very smart. 6 months later the CTO, who had been behind the creation of the anti-abuse engineering effort, left. My boss, previously gung ho, left in a way that made me think he was getting signals from his boss. And shortly after that, said boss&#39;s boss said that our team had succeeded so well that there was no need for us. He scattered the engineers, laid of the managers, me included, and declared victory. We all laughed bitterly.What these have in common for me is a high-level executive launching a special team with great fanfare in a way that addresses a PR problem. But because PR problems are generally fleeting, as soon as do-goodery loses its executive sponsor, everybody goes right back to the short-term incentives, meaning things like &#34;responsibility&#34; go right out the door. At least beyond the level that will trigger another PR disaster.And if you&#39;re wondering why you don&#39;t hear more about things like this, you&#39;re not supposed to. At least for the managers laid off, it was a surprise meeting and then getting walked out the door. In the surprise meeting, they offered a fair chunk of money (for me, $40k) to sign an additional NDA plus non-disparagement agreement. I happen to have a low burn rate and good savings, so I didn&#39;t sign. But I know plenty of people who have looked at the mortgage and kid expenses versus the sudden lack of income and eventually signed."</p>

Also, it&#39;s easier to write mods for, partly because mods are written in Lua, and you don&#39;t have to install mods on the client, just the server.https://www.minetest.net/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g6Fyav6FiIsThe video&#39;s author doesn&#39;t mention it by name, but the quantum computing tutorial game he&#39;s playing in a couple of the clips is called QiskitBlocks; it&#39;s a series of puzzles designed to teach you how quantum computing works.The (public) games that run on the Minetest engine are listed on https://content.minetest.net/packages/?type=game.  QiskitBlocks in particular is https://content.minetest.net/packages/JavaFXpert/qiskitblock...."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s apparently a minority voice opinion here on HN, but I for one appreciate what Microsoft is trying to do. As a parent of a 6 and 9 year old who have really gotten into Minecraft during COVID, I appreciate them basically deciding &#34;We want Minecraft to be a game for kids and an online community that is nice.&#34; I get why people are frustrated, but I also like the idea of a global decision that forces servers open to &#34;the public&#34; to have an enforced global standard of behavior. Correct me if I&#39;m wrong, I don&#39;t see anything in their process that suggests that a group of adults playing with their friends are at risk of having their chat audited in the absence of a complaint?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Hi, orsond from the fifth column here.The Fifth Column is a Minecraft hacking and griefing group. We created Project Copenhiemer which is a Minecraft server scanning tool. Copenhiemer scans the internet every 20 minutes for minecraft servers, logs players, server versions, mods and more.Originally we had created it to find players and grief their server worlds, highlighting how much information about players is leaked from Mojangs default server configuration. They have put some features into the game to stop this information from being leaked but have made it an opt in system which no one uses or is even aware of.We have become increasingly worried about the direction of Mojang&#39;s safety policies and we believe they are just playing lip service to the actual problems at hand.Online gaming and gaming coms has a seriously unaddressed problem with child safety.
Mojang&#39;s reasoning for chat reporting is to protect children. Chat reporting does absolutely nothing to solve this problem. You can report people for swearing, drug/alcohol references, etc. You cannot report a player for child exploitation unless they use the chat system to do so.As an example, I know one server admin that disabled chat entirely on his large server only to have pedophiles use in game signs to message and groom children over Skype and Discord.If Mojang were serious about protecting children, they would stop developing their paternalistic chat surveillance system and split multiplayer children and 18+ play from each other.For example, children should only be able to join under 18&#39;s Mojang hosted servers (realms) where conduct can be heavily monitored and 18+ players join multiplayer servers where children cannot play.It is clear they have thought about this problem for a total of 5 minutes and have shut down healthy &amp; reasonable debate about their solution to avoid embarrassment and scrutiny."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Patreon’s comment on this so far is on their creator Discord, so I can’t link to it, I’m afraid, but this is what one of their team members posted about an hour ago (7:29 PM EST):- - -“As a global platform, Patron will always prioritize the security of our creators&#39; and customers&#39; data. As
part of a strategic shift of a portion of our security program, we have parted ways with five employees. We also partner with a number of external organizations to continuously develop our security capabilities and conduct regular security assessments to ensure we meet or exceed the highest industry standards. The changes made this week will have no impact on our ability to continue providing a secure and safe platform for our creators and patrons, including the upcoming adult ID verification requirement.”- - -I have no idea how big their security team is (five may in fact be the entire group they called “the security team”), but I am not convinced that this is necessarily the end of the world for those who use Patreon. I don’t know how much financial data they even store directly (I would assume best practices entail letting their payment processors store actual credit card and bank account numbers, for instance, although I’m aware that may be easier said than done depending on their infrastructure).While I do think Patreon is going to have Issues (tm) due to having accepted so much VC money, it’s not clear to me that these layoffs were forced by their funders—they haven’t accepted any money recently, and I haven’t heard anything that suggests their revenues have been dropping to a point where there’d need to do serious belt-tightening.(Also, to people who seem to think any creator could just slap up “a basic microblog” and get all of Patreon’s functionality, that kind of falls into the “not even wrong” category. Replicating what they do would be a lot of work even for the technically-minded, many creators who use them are not technical, and even if you pull it off, there are things that just literally can’t be duplicated as a solo endeavor: all of your patrons may be supporting multiple creators, not just you; patrons may discover other creators based on who their friends support and who those they support are supporting; creators who support other creators just have those charges automatically deducted from their earnings; etc.)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Sounds rather scary but I would like to hear both sides of the story. I don&#39;t like guessing and passing judgment with basically a single sentence describing something that could have more to it than meets the eye."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"There seems to be some speculation that this is credit card details being hacked. Firing your _entire_ security team sounds like the sort of action taken if basic security practices are not being done. Until we know more, hold out on hiring these people.Xe has commented on this and is suggesting to simply enable 2FA to deal with security concerns [1], as apparently a more measured response to security issues at Patreon. This seems to be more self-serving advice rather than good advice [2], the better suggestion would be to simply move to one of the many alternatives.The assumption is that the login system is somehow insecure, instead of the bank details themselves being stored insecurely. (Hypothetically) If you suffered a large leak of payment details, when payment processing is your _main_ income revenue, and you find out your security team of X people at probably $100k+ a year for N years have done nothing to secure payment details, you too may fire them on the spot.Until Patreon explain why they fired their _entire_ security team, the best advice is to remove your card details immediately. You can always add it back at a later date, or use an alternative payment processor.[1] https://xeiaso.net/blog/patreon-happening[2] https://www.patreon.com/cadey(Edit: As pointed out, Xe didn&#39;t mention credit card details.)"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m curious how much other major brands pay to stay in their placesCoke arguably pays megabucks to have giant displays in prime locations. Those locations have limited space so Coke taking up one isSimilarly, IIUC, companies pay to have their products put in conspicuous places in stores like Walmart, Target, etc. Only rich companies can afford to always get the spots that stick out the most.I don&#39;t know if those are compariable. Google pays Apple to be the default search engine seems no different than Coke paying to be the first soda on the aisle or to be featured on the edge of the aisle. People are still free to pick a different search engine or go into the soda aisle.Of course in retail another tactic is to make a bunch of products that appear to be different but are all basically the same. I think Crest or Colgate and 15 kinds of mouthwash all of which have the same &#34;active ingredient&#34; at the same concentration. The goal is to fill up the shelves with your products so there is no room left for the competition&#39;s products since shelf space is limited."</p>

It started as a hobby and sideline to my main work (which at the time was classroom teaching of the same content).  While I&#39;m no longer working in classrooms (pandemic plus other reasons led to this), I&#39;m still producing content, which I think is of good quality and worthwhile.The issue I have with it is that I refuse to produce attention-grabbing clickbaity titles or thumbnails.  I don&#39;t like the whole algorithmically-driven race to the bottom of the brain stem, and have zero interest in producing the same.  I&#39;ve had plenty of comments from viewers who say the videos are great and informative, but if I&#39;d just jazz things up a bit then I&#39;d get more views.I&#39;m just wondering how this will change (if at all) with this new program.  It takes a LOT of time to produce decent content, and even more if you&#39;re going to provide a course and backup materials etc.. Writing curricula is HARD work, and writing tests, etc., that are actually valid is reasonably challenging and time consuming.I currently get about £100 a month from YT, which definitely doesn&#39;t reflect the time I put into it (but I know it has other benefits as I sell a fair number of books partly as a result of the viewership).  I know that the beasts of the platform (3b1b spring to mind) would do really well from this (and deservedly so), but I do wonder if things really need to change to make YT work well for genuinely-produced non-clickbait educational content."</p>

Viewers who choose to buy a Course can watch the video ad-free and play it in the background.So you&#39;re cloning Udemy? Meh. Not much to be excited about so far.Finally, to help learners apply what they’ve learned, we’re introducing Quizzes — a new way for creators to help viewers test their knowledge.That could be somewhat useful, but..For example, a math creator who recently posted a series on algebra can create a Quiz on the Community tab to ask their viewers a question related to a concept taught in their latest video.Does anybody ever actually visit the &#34;Community&#34; tab of a channel? Why add this extra friction? Hasn&#39;t the technology progressed to the point that quizzes could be integrated right into the video player? For that matter, why not have &#34;adaptive&#34; videos where your quiz results can affect the video that you see (like triggering an extra in-depth explanation for notoriously tricky topic if the quiz taker scores below a certain level, etc.).I hope this works out and provides some value, but I have my doubts as it stands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It just occurred to me, Zig could be a great learning-language for CSWhen I was in college we mostly used C++, which exposed (and thereby taught) a lot of core concepts around how computers and low-level languages work. But it was also a bit of a nightmare for... unrelated, obvious reasons.Rust is great for building software, but as a learning language I think it introduces too many additional concepts, has too many additional constraints, and has too many magical abstractions. Eg, doing manual deallocation helps you later appreciate what the borrow-checker does and why it existsZig is supposed to be C++ without all the pain and misery (esp around tooling). That could make it perfect for teaching people about pointers and heap allocations and working with bytes, with minimal extra pain and friction"</p>

And it seems like they&#39;re planning to double down on this by making you adjust even more trivial things like public/private and var/const before it will even compile your code. https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/335 https://github.com/ziglang/zig/issues/224Maybe I&#39;m a bad developer, but my code is never perfect the first time around. I always spend time experimenting and refining my designs. I want to find a design that works, and only then spend time polishing and prettifying before I git push.I do understand the reasoning (they don&#39;t want people committing poor quality code), but this implementation just seems completely backwards to me. It breaks the natural order. It&#39;s like saying we won&#39;t let you ctrl+s until your tests pass to make sure you don&#39;t commit broken code.

The result is a list of the most popular products across many subreddits.No platform (including Reddit) is resistant to fake reviews and spam, but we think it&#39;s happening less frequently here for various reasons:- Redditors and other forum members are more interested in boosting their ego by showing their depth of knowledge on the topic (and correcting others on the topic), whereas corporate websites are more interested in raking profit by displaying (potentially) dishonest information.- Enthusiasts in subreddits are pretty good at spotting dishonest or fake content, which results in immediate downvotes. The whole karma system helps with trustworthiness.- Most subs are moderated well and spam gets removed quite quicklyThat being said, good fake reviews are technically almost impossible to detect, even with sophisticated network analysis of the reviewer&#39;s profile.Looria is still in Beta and we&#39;re working on improving our classification, summarization, and sentiment analysis. Let me know what you think!"</p>

Take these &#39;negative&#39; reviews for the Staples Hyken office chair:&gt; For months i was waiting for the Staples Hyken Mesh chair to drop to a good price. I pulled the trigger at 150ish, received it really fast, and set it up right away. I actually really love the chair, totally worth it. Perfect size for me and i can sit in in for 12+ hours just fine.&gt; I personally haven&#39;t found the thinks to be more comfortable than other chairs, I&#39;d rather go with a staples Hyken. Also, I see these go for much less. This looks like a V1. I sold one like that for $200 in Virginia.&gt; Hello all, I went on a deep plung into chairs over the weekend to find a good new chair (instead my junky racer/gaming chair that hurt my back and neck. I ended up finding the Staples Hyken and Staples Dexley. I went to store and tried them both out. I really liked the Hyken way more than the dexley....In the small number of negative reviews I&#39;ve looked at it seems like around half of them are categorised incorrectly."</p>

But by 1926, he “claimed that he had counted 946 different sandwich varieties stuffed with fillings such as watermelon and pimento, peanut butter, fried oyster, Bermuda onion and parsley, fruit salad, aspic of foie gras, spaghetti, red snapper roe, salmi of duck, bacon and fried egg, lettuce and tomato, spiced beef, chow-chow, pickled herring, asparagus tips, deep sea scallops, and so on ad infinitum.”I ordered it off Amazon right away only to immediately realize, to my horror, that the hardcover version I had chosen would not arrive until Saturday, a full fortnite after my aspic of foie gras, salmi of duck, and the $5 esp32-wroom dev kits that were part of the same order.What is this, the 1930s?

I suspect that mechanistic, meaningless, purely mimetic pursuit of success has some pretty negative consequences on society. I suspect it might explain why so many people are interested in engaging in politics (or company politics) and zero-sum value extraction schemes instead of just adding value... They&#39;re not interested in the process at all, only in the outcome; financial success and social approval from authority figures.Many people are spending most of their lives doing stuff that they don&#39;t want to do, so of course they tend to look for shortcuts instead of trying to do things the right way. They have no intrinsic pride in the work they do; it&#39;s all about status, money and power.

If the weather is nice, I&#39;ll hop on my bicycle and forget about work.But when something sparks my interest, I have stores of energy to throw at it. My appetite for work is unrestrained by the frogs I&#39;ve had for breakfast.I embraced the fact that I am not a machine, and that my output is neither constant nor predictable.

Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life that one exists for other people -- first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by the ties of sympathy. A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same measure as I have received and am still receiving...I have never looked upon ease and happiness as ends in themselves -- this critical basis I call the ideal of a pigsty. The ideals that have lighted my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Kindness, Beauty, and Truth. Without the sense of kinship with men of like mind, without the occupation with the objective world, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific endeavors, life would have seemed empty to me. The trite objects of human efforts -- possessions, outward success, luxury -- have always seemed to me contemptible.My passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility has always contrasted oddly with my pronounced lack of need for direct contact with other human beings and human communities. I am truly a &#39;lone traveler&#39; and have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family, with my whole heart; in the face of all these ties, I have never lost a sense of distance and a need for solitude.&#34;-- Albert Einstein"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I approve (of both the release and the name).I see plenty of folks in here lamenting this release at all - in the hopes that the lack of it will push folks to Firefox.  It won&#39;t.  Those who care about this are already on Firefox, and frankly - Firefox isn&#39;t going to be the answer here (to be clear, this is opinion).I&#39;m also not thrilled at manifest v3, although for very different reasons than the adblocking limitations - I do lots of extension development, and I think the service worker approach taken is a bad mistake, forcing a distributed consensus model onto extensions without understanding the limitations that model imposes given how often extensions span multiple js contexts (across tabs/frames/content_scripts/windows/etc).Frankly - the environment is also still riddled with bugs... everything from docs that are wrong, to serious issues like a service worker not activating on simple, basic, required events (like chrome.action.onClicked, which is literally about as basic as it gets for extensions).Overall - my first impression of the manifest v3 upgrade was fairly neutral (it&#39;s not really solving any of my pain points, and it requires a lot of changes to support - but it seemed functional).  My opinion after porting several large extension projects to the space is... bad.  It&#39;s a bad set of changes as implemented in chromium right now."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Just so I understand correctly: This version removes *all* of the features that read or modify a user&#39;s data, so as to abide by the &#34;&#34;stated intent&#34;&#34; of MV3, rather than taking full advantage of all of the actual MV3 APIs? For example, this commit removes the &#34;scriplet injection&#34; and cosmetic filtering features, which AFAIK work perfectly fine on MV3?    if broad &#34;read/modify data&#34; permission is to be used, than there is not much point for an MV3 version over MV2, just use the MV2 version if you want to benefit all the features which can&#39;t be implemented without broad &#34;read/modify data&#34; permission.

Huh? But ... the &#34;read/modify data&#34; permission isn&#39;t getting removed by MV3? I don&#39;t understand how this follows. This is like saying &#34;Google implemented all of the same things we could do in MV2 in MV3, so we went ahead and removed all of the features anyway&#34;. I don&#39;t see any way to interpret this as anything except cutting off your own nose to spite the face of Google. It certainly doesn&#39;t seem to be a good faith attempt to reproduce the features of uBlock within the new technical framework of MV3."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I rely on Otter pretty heavily these days. 100% agree that recording and sending the transcript to meeting attendees without their knowledge is a really bad move from several angles.I work sales calls set up with Calendly and Otter joins them all. These are very technical so normally it&#39;s fantastic - EXCEPT if we start talking early or the prospect doesn&#39;t follow the invite and never joins the call, then they would get a transcript of my team&#39;s chatter. I learned to not allow Otter to join the call until everyone is in attendanceWhats more frustrating is that you can&#39;t disable this auto-email &#34;feature&#34; unless you are on a business plan of some sort. But I have a paid plan through the iPhone app and apparently can&#39;t convert it to a business plan associated with my company. So no good way to disable itI get the network effect of referral business but sharing private conversations without consent is not the way to achieve it."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I just deleted my account because of that, also they share conversations with everyone in the meeting by DEFAULT, it wasn&#39;t nice receiving a message from a co-worker telling me that he received an email with the transcription it generated."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"THANK YOU for posting this. My partner uses Otter, and HIS Otter bot will join my work meetings that he is not even invited to. He&#39;s sent me some recordings within the app in the past and we share calendars, but it still doesn&#39;t explain why this would happen. We&#39;ve emailed Otter multiple times since July 2021 without any satisfactory response or investigation. You&#39;d think they would take this privacy issue more seriously. Truly absurd."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"As a newbie in nuclear fusion, this explanation is the most interesting part:&gt; Lee Margetts at the University of Manchester, UK, says that the physics of fusion reactors is becoming well understood, but that there are technical hurdles to overcome before a working power plant can be built. Part of that will be developing methods to withdraw heat from the reactor and use it to generate electrical current.&gt; “It’s not physics, it’s engineering,” he says. “If you just think about this from the point of view of a gas-fired or a coal-fired power station, if you didn’t have anything to take the heat away, then the people operating it would say ‘we have to switch it off because it gets too hot and it will melt the power station’, and that’s exactly the situation here.”"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"When I was at school in Abingdon, Oxfordshire (UK) around 1988 my physics class (A level aged 17) was somewhat enlivened by a visit by a bunch of clever chaps from JET at the Culham labs from up the road.This was the first time I heard the &#34;nuclear fusion is 25 years away&#34; joke and it was told as such.  We were also shown a graph of how many orders of magnitude away from ignition (for want of the correct word) by date.  It had an initial steep decline but then turned right quite sharply and had annoying looking tendency to avoid the magic value.Now, once you have ignition, you have to sustain it and extract power from it.  That&#39;s quite tricky too!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"It&#39;s interesting to see that South Korea has such strong nuclear research facilities. Taiwan lost a lot of nuclear researchers in the past decades. Some of it due to US lobby work and some of it due to stupid governmental policies in the recent past. Japan which is also quite strong in nuclear seems to be trying to sell part of their nuclear industry, a move which turned out disastrously for the french."</p>

					<div class="story__comment">
						<a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=32748592">
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Two things...First, looking through their design guide (https://www.wikihouse.cc/guides/design), the only thing they mention is that space (32mm in walls, I guess, and 70mm under ceilings) is provided.Given that the plumbing, electrical, ventilation, appliances, etc. are the majority of the cost of a home, I find this a bit odd.  A typical American full bathroom costs something like $5k to $20k (and up... way up) depending on the quality.  A kitchen can cost multiple times more.  Sure, you can build them cheaper, but that&#39;s the rub... most people who are in the market to purchase a home don&#39;t want low-end bathrooms and kitchens.  Or windows.  Or lighting.  Or wall fixtures.  Or anything really.Second, IMO, the problem with affordable housing is not a construction cost problem.  We can build small, livable (for various definitions) homes for $50k (or less) today, ignoring land costs.  But the regulatory costs, the land costs, the market demands all make building such homes a non-profitable endeavor.   Why build 20 $50k homes on the land and make $200k profit when you can build 10 $500k homes and make $1mil in profit?The affordable housing crisis in the America do not have a technical solution, only a socio-political one.  And since nearly all the power related to zoning, building costs, etc are managed at the local and state level, that means engaging with local politics."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I really like the concept of this, it&#39;s basically a step further on from SIPs (structural insulated panels) by having standard composable blocks. The things I think are particularly good:- Standardising on screw pile foundations. Standard concrete foundations are often be about 30% of the build cost, with the quantity of earth removed and cement used it&#39;s a massive part of the carbon footprint of a home. For a &#34;light weight&#34; timber construction, screw piles are the future.- Having services recesses and notches built into the panels, and there is no need to batten the internal walls for boarding. this will increase the speed of construction significantly.- Being an &#34;Open&#34; standard allows any timber frame or prefab construction company to adopt it.My one concern (I wouldn&#39;t go as far as criticism) is that the panels have a somewhat complex manufacturing process by having to be CNC machined. Realisticly they almost always will be, but I would have liked to see the panels designed to be constructed a little more simply - you will always have to make changes on site.I wander why they went with ply over OSB, they have similar structural properties but OSB can be cheeper."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think this is overly complicating the process. If you want an open source DIY method of building a home, just learn basic framing and construction. It&#39;s not hard, lots of people have built their own homes, you just need some common sense and a willingness to learn.If you want to go all in on modular, wood based, zero carbon housing then learn how to build a timber frame house. If you really want zero carbon you can use only hand tools and harvest your own trees.Wikihouse seems more for people who want to buy something off the shelf, pretty much a kit house. That&#39;s not a bad thing since it takes a lot of effort to build something as big as a house and lots of people don&#39;t want to do that. But I don&#39;t think this should be sold as a solution for DIYers since the existing methods already satisfy the listed requirements."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"These blog posts have been great. I&#39;d love to see a deep dive on the query planner at some point.I&#39;ve done lots of benchmarking SQLite while writing ducks [1], and found some interesting stuff. It seems like SQLite will only use one index, even in cases where two indexes would better suit the query. Or, in cases where the query is fetching most of the table, it will use an index even though a full scan would actually be much faster.Don&#39;t get me wrong, SQLite is awesome, and it&#39;s quite possible to work around these behaviors. Just interested in why they&#39;re not built in.[1] https://github.com/manimino/ducks"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; SQL was originally designed for non-technical users to interact with the database, however, it&#39;s used almost exclusively by software developers peppering it throughout their applications.Interesting claim! In my experience, the # of data analysts / BI analysts / etc that write and have mastered SQL vastly exceeds the # of web developers (especially if we focus on developers actually writing SQL instead of using ORMs)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The EXPLAIN keyword is really awesome. It also allows you to quickly validate SQLite command text without actually executing it. We have found this to be useful for real-time validation of user inputs when working on SQL-based config tools.Note that EXPLAIN also seamlessly incorporates any application-defined functions, so you can validate everything is as expected. Useful when being clever with DSLs and such."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Of course, the other plausible explanation is that (at least at the time) Weird Al didn&#39;t know the difference between RAM and hard drive space (especially likely, because he&#39;s talking about defragging a hard drive).  In fact, I&#39;d be surprised if that wasn&#39;t what he meant.  I will, however, leave room for him knowing the difference, but intentionally being absurd (it is Weird Al, after all).That problem (referring to things that are not conventional fast, volatile random access memory as RAM) seems to have only gotten worse in the last twenty years - exacerbated, I believe by the increased use of flash technology (SSDs, etc - which have, admittedly blurred the lines some).It also doesn&#39;t help that smart phone and tablet manufacturers/advertisers have long insisted on referring to the device&#39;s long-term storage (also flash tech) as &#34;memory&#34;.  I doubt that will ever stop bugging me, but I&#39;ve learned to live with it, albeit curmudgeonly.Whippersnappers! :-D"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Interesting point that RAM has basically not moved up in consumer computers in 10+ years... wonder why.The article answers its own question by pointing out SSDs allow better swapping, bus is wider and RAM is more and more integrated into processor, etc.But I think this misses the point. Did these solutions make it uneconomic to increase RAM density, or did scaling challenges in RAM density lead to a bunch of other nearby things getting better to compensate?I&#39;d guess the problem is in scaling RAM density itself because performance is just not very good on 8gb macbooks, compared to 16gb. If &#34;unified memory&#34; was really that great, I&#39;d expect there to be largely no difference in perceived quality.Does anyone have expertise in RAM manufacturing challenge?"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I think a big piece that is ignored is how much normal compute/memory usage has been shifted to the Cloud.I no longer need to have local resources to do amazing things. I don&#39;t need an 10GB+ GPU in my phone to be able to hit some website and use AI to generate images. I have fast web/email search capabilities that don&#39;t require me to have a local index of all of it. I can spin up a remote compute cluster with as much RAM as I need if I want some heavy lifting done, and then throw it all away when I&#39;m finished.&#34;Back in the day&#34; we would try to build for all that we could perceive we would do in the next 5 years, and maybe upgrade memory half way through that cycle if things changed. We ran a lot of things locally, and would close apps if we needed to open something needy. I think also systems have gotten a lot better at sharing and doing memory swapping (see comments about SSD helping here). Back in the old days, if you ran out of memory, the app would just not open at all, or crash."</p>

The second I lose trust in that kind of service, I don&#39;t just stop using it, I will most likely never even consider coming back as a customer and I will warn people against them.  I don&#39;t give second chances to services that are trust based.I&#39;m pretty happy with Bitwarden so far.  But if they betray my trust I&#39;ll be out of there in a day, never to return.

I&#39;m happy for the new investment, but I hope they don&#39;t start adding new things just for the sake of growing.Also - to the people who analyze funding rounds - $100M sounds like a huge amount to me.

It&#39;s the CLA that allows them the ability to dual-license for the server.The VCs must really believe the company can produce a product based on Enterprise sales which would deliver a value North of $1B. And perhaps they can, as Bitwarden as we know it could be considered a strong beachhead to allow them to expand into other auth markets that have high value (hello Okta, Auth0, etc).But this doesn&#39;t seem that scary for Bitwarden users at this point."</p>

If US healthcare spending were a country, it would have the third largest GDP in the world. Accidents of history and the massive federal beauracracy created the crazy monster of ICD/CPT codes that results in the very clumsy way of pricing healthcare services that results in this massive matrix of data.As pointed out elsewhere there is a tremendous amount of cost distribution that goes into the code matrix and this plays a large role in negotiations with health insurers as well. Ground is given in one set of procedures and lost in others.This is a big step in shining light into areas that need it to improve the system overall."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I work in data at https://www.carrumhealth.com/, and I&#39;ve been parsing this data for weeks. The transparency prices allow us to meaningfully negotiate with providers, and make tangible, incremental progress toward cheaper health care. Providers and existing insurance carriers leverage information asymmetry to control the market otherwise.For context, we bundle the 100&#39;s of itemized costs into a single, static bill per surgery type. In doing so, we&#39;ve built a custom virtual-network with the most efficient surgeons. These surgeons are able to meet the volume and quality requirements to allow for lower margins. We&#39;re able to get negotiated rates that are 10-40% cheaper than traditional insurance contracts when we have data that we trust.Unfortunately, this data alone isn&#39;t enough to properly determine prices because organizations will spread costs across procedure and billing codes that often occur in aggregate groups. For example, in a joint replacement surgery, some organizations may dump the cost into the billing for the implant itself, while others may put it under the procedure code. You have to gather billing data en masse to see which charges occur together, then combine this pricing data to determine what costs will actually look like for someone experiencing a procedure.It&#39;s a nightmare!"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"At a previous company I worked at, we had an issue with our software (Windows-based, written in a proprietary language) randomly crashing. After some debugging, we found that this happened whenever the user made some specific actions, but only if, in that session, the user had previously printed something or opened a file picker. The culprit was either a printer driver or a shell extension which, when loaded, changed the floating point control word to trap. That happened whenever the culprit DLL had been compiled by a specific compiler, which had the offending code in the startup routine it linked into every DLL it produced.Our solution was the inverse of the one presented in this article: instead of wrapping our routines to temporarily set the floating point control word to sane values, we wrapped the calls to either printing or the file picker, and reset the floating point control word to its previous (and sane) value after these calls."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The Julia package ecosystem has a lot of safeguards against silent incorrect behavior like this. For example, if you try to add a package binary build which would use fast math flags, it will throw an error and tell you to repent:https://github.com/JuliaPackaging/BinaryBuilderBase.jl/blob/...In user codes you can do `@fastmath`, but it&#39;s at the semantic level so it will change `sin` to `sin_fast` but not recurse down into other people&#39;s functions, because at that point you&#39;re just asking for trouble. There&#39;s also calls to rename it `@unsafemath` in Julia, just to make it explicit. In summary, &#34;Fastmath&#34; is overused and many times people actually want other optimizations (automatic FMA), and people really need to stop throwing global changes around willy-nilly, and programming languages need to force people to avoid such global issues both semantically and within its package ecosystems norms."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The problem here is that enabling FTZ/DAZ flags involves modifying global (technically thread-local) state that is relatively expensive to do. Ideally, you&#39;d want to twiddle these flags only for code that wants to work in this mode, but given the relative expense of this operation, it&#39;s not entirely practicable to auto-add twiddling to every function call, and doing it manually is somewhat challenging because compilers tend to support accessing the floating-point status rather poorly. Also, FTZ/DAZ aren&#39;t IEEE 754, so there&#39;s no portable function for twiddling these bits as there is for other rounding mode or exception controls. I will note that icc&#39;s -fp-model=fast and MSVC&#39;s /fp:fast correctly do not link code with crtfastmath.As a side note, this kind of thing is why I think a good title for a fast-math would be &#34;Fast math, or how I learned to start worrying and hate floating point.&#34;"</p>

After glancing over the API I guess it&#39;s because FPEs are too high-level to implement FUSE properly, but I&#39;d be glad if you can share any details to satisfy my curiosity.[1] https://developer.apple.com/documentation/fileproviderEDIT: Errata, I assumed it was open-source, but it is not.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A4 is so ubiquitous around me (Europe) that, no matter its merits or not, it&#39;s really a major PITA when you get documents that are not A4.  They don&#39;t line up nicely with the A4 stuff.  They don&#39;t go gently in the A4 folders / sleeves / pockets / ring binders (files) / etc.Typical offenders in my case are medical bills printed on dot-matrix printers.I don&#39;t even know if there&#39;s perforated continuous stationery/form paper with tractor holes that, once you strip the holes, is A4 sized?  I guess it&#39;s really uncommon if it exists for I don&#39;t ever recall seeing any actually used.Now don&#39;t get me wrong: hearing the song of a dot-matrix printer makes me happy (brings back lots of memories as my first printer was a dot-matrix one) and it&#39;s nice that that tech is still in use here and there.  I just wish the dot-matrix printers in Europe would use A4 continuous paper (which may or may not even exist).And don&#39;t get me started on oversized continuous paper that is not perforated: this is the kind of stuff that can trigger obsessive-compulsive disorder!I guess all this rant to say that even in Europe, where A4 is ubiquitous, you still have places using other sizes than A3/A4/A5 etc."</p>

The C sizes, often used for envelopes, are defined as the geometric mean between the equivalent A and B size.As a child of an architect, when I was a kid my dad would bring old A0 drawings home as paper we could draw and paint on the back of.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This is great, because Unreal is a C++ project that&#39;s not so easy to just Rewrite In Rust.It&#39;s also nice it uses bevy&#39;s ECS. It&#39;s made to fit Rust&#39;s type system and borrow checking model, and is highly parallel. It&#39;s really awesome how easy it is to distribute work across cores with it, without risk of heisenbugs thanks to Rust&#39;s data-race-safety guarantees.I know game development sees traditional software best practices as not applicable to them, but then games struggle with showstopping bugs and single-core performance bottlenecks. I hope someone will bet that Rust, despite being stricter and seemingly slower to iterate with, can be a net benefit from lower defect rates. Rust users outside of game dev praise the &#34;if it compiles, it&#39;s usually correct&#34;, and that junior devs can be told not to write unsafe code, so they can&#39;t cause UB and memory corruption."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This is great, because Unreal is a C++ project that&#39;s not so easy to just Rewrite In Rust.True. Although rewriting Nanite in Rust would be useful. Nanite is a very clever data structure for meshes. It&#39;s brittle, and full of internal relative addresses within the data item, so it&#39;s very vulnerable to buffer overflows. If it becomes widely used outside of UE, it might become something that gets supported in GPU hardware."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am always skeptical about these type of projects. Out of the box Unreal Engine supports C++ and Blueprint.The problem with C++ is the slow compile times, and if you make mistakes the engine crashes. In general you produce stuff slower by using  C++.Blueprint is a visual scripting tool, it compiles fast. But it stores code as a binary blob in source control. And I&#39;m personally not a fan of visual scripting, I would prefer scripting by just writing code.So generally I prototype in Blueprint and then rewrite in C++ later on. I would love an intermediate language that has fast compile times and saves as a source file instead of a binary blob.The problem is most of the projects that integrate with another language get abandoned after a while. MonoUE was abandoned, USharp was abandoned, now the newest attempt to integrate UE with C# UnrealCLR looks abandoned. SkookumScript doesn&#39;t support UE5. Haxe support for UE was abandoned.Do I really want to risk writing a ton of code in a language that might not support future engine versions? To be honest, I don&#39;t want to take that risk."</p>

With recent developments in AI, there is renewed discussion about cheating as the best AIs have no trouble beating anything from PLO to NLHE.It was only a matter of time before this started to spread offline, and just a few weeks ago, I heard a story from a friend of a friend who caught a player using a device similar to this during a private game he was hosting. It&#39;s only a matter of time before these sorts of devices continue to spread, and I&#39;m not sure how the world will respond.It would be a huge deal to cheat at events like the World Chess Tournament, but the consequences of getting caught will likely stop at complete disgrace.

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I did fairly well in the test (I didn&#39;t remember that you couldn&#39;t shift into the sign bit), but it really helps highlight how stupid the C promotion rules are. In C as soon as I have to do arithmetics with anything but unsigned ints all sorts of alarm bells start going off and I end up casting and recasting everything to make sure it does what I think it does, coupled with heavy testing. Now add floats and doubles into the mix and all bets are off.Rust not having a default &#34;int&#34; type and forcing you to explicitly cast everything is such an improvement. Truly a poster child for &#34;less is more&#34;. Yeah it makes the code more verbose, but at least I don&#39;t have to worry about &#34;lmao you have a signed int overflow in there you absolute nincompoop, this is going to break with -O3 when GCC 16 releases 8 years from now, but only on ARM32 when compiled in Thumb mode!&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These examples do look scary. However, in my 16 years of experience of mostly writing In C, I have never found a single chance that I need to actually use the expressions that I got the answers wrong.Never mix unsigned and signed integer comparison unless you know exactly what you are doing.And never do arithmetic on boundaries definitions like INT_MAX, they are boundaries , why you need to compute a derived value on boundaries?If you do not need arithmetic behavior, do not use signed integer, use unsigned. Because computer does not understand sign, so if you do not need a sign, do not use it.You do not need to be a language committee member to write C , you just need to understand the reason behind its design."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Found a disappointing bug in the test:  (unsigned short)1 &gt; -1 

Correct answer is: implementation-defined.The left operand of &gt; has type unsigned short, before promotion. On C implementations for today&#39;s popular, mainstream machines, short is narrower than int; therefore, whether it is signed or unsigned it goes to int.In that common case, we are doing a 1 &gt; -1 comparison in the int type.However, unsigned short may be exactly as wide as int, in which case it cannot promote to int, because its values do not fit into that type. It promotes to unsigned int in that case.  Both sides will go to unsigned int{*}, and so we are comparing 1 &gt; UINT_MAX which is 0.Maybe the author should name this &#34;GCC integer quiz for 32 bit x86&#34;, and drop the harder choices like &#34;implementation-defined&#34;.---{*} It&#39;s more nuanced here. If we have a signed and unsigned integer operand of the same rank, it could go either way. If the unsigned type has a limited range so that all its vallues are representable in the signed type, then the unsigned type goes to signed. My remark represents only the predominant situation whereby signed and unsigned types of the same rank have overlapping ranges that don&#39;t fit into each other: the unsigned version of a type not only lacks negatives, but has extra positives."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;m surprised no-one in the comments has mentioned MailInABox [0].On recommendations here, I switched to it 2 or 3 months ago from Gmail, after Google announced they were going to start charging for Gmail on custom domains.  I&#39;d no previous experience at all with running my own mailservers and had always been put off by how complicated it seemed.Even with a non supported configuration setup [running the mailserver for my domain on a separate VPS from the domain itself] MIAB setup was pretty easy. I had it installed and was up and running in no time. I then spent a couple of days setting up the various DMARC MTA-STS policies etc. [most of that time involved looking up what they were and why I needed them!] and [after testing with an unimportant account] migrating the rest of mine and my family&#39;s and friends&#39; emails across from Gmail. I was able to import half a dozen accounts from Gmail with about 8GB of emails between them, using ImapSync [1]So far [fingers crossed] it&#39;s been almost painless. Giving the lie to the commonly held belief that running your own mailservers needs constant hands-on maintenance. My MIAB setup runs quite happily on a $5/month Linode [I checked the IP was not on any blacklists, before I started] and the whole thing has been pretty much &#39;fire and forget&#39;. MIAB sends me weekly reports on what&#39;s been happening. Software updates are a one-liner in the terminal and I&#39;ve had no trouble whatsoever with Google, Microsoft etc. as regards the mail not getting through.If you&#39;ve always hankered after running your own mailserver but [as I did] thought it was too difficult and required too much &#39;hands on&#39; tinkering, I heartily recommend you give MIAB a go.DISCLAIMER: I run a couple of dozen email addresses on 3 or 4 domains on my MIAB. Probably sending and receiving a few hundred emails a week between them. YMMV if you&#39;re a heavier user than this.[0] https://mailinabox.email/[1] https://imapsync.lamiral.info/"</p>

The tactics were different, but the goal is effectively the same.The key differences are Kiwifarms is targeting individuals personally. And that they’re doing it kind of randomly, for the lulz. Whereas their main opponents here are targeting a company/community, and acting in self-defence.I know who I think is more worthy of protection."</p>

After learning about the situation from the last couple threads here and going down the rabbit hole of sources, the future of the internet seems pretty sad... If cloudflare doesn&#39;t reinstate the website after dealing with said immediate danger they claimed was the reason to remove its protection it just shows how hard you can shut someone down by just twitter outrage.If the threat really was so dire, and if there really was something of the sort sure i can see allowing the obvious DDOS in the background go thru and take the website down. But not reinstating it after the time they were claiming to buy by doing it was already bought it means if you scream loud enough on twitter, even while having an obvious army of arsonists behind you, the firefighters will just stop serving said target.Sure, cloudflare is a private company and all that, nobody questions it, but it doesn&#39;t make it any less unsettling."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Interesting to see the comment thread digging into all sorts of criticism of the article (is it 2 kWh / fridge? Or 1.1? Should the author discuss renewable earlier or more seriously?)The main point I got from the article was a helpful reminder that a large part of the world doesn&#39;t have basic things that I take for granted (not just refrigeration, but you might also include air conditioning, transportation, etc). And that if we did want the entire world to live a life that includes things like that, we just don&#39;t have the energy right now.EDIT: I kept thinking about this and it doesn&#39;t stop at just basics. It&#39;s also things like living in a comfortable, well-manufactured home. Being able to buy toys for your kids. Taking airplanes to visit family or to vacation. Enjoying the consumption of meat, or food delicacies. The list goes on as you expand the threshold from basic necessities, to comfort, to luxuries, and you can decide where you want to draw the line."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not really.A lot of poverty is societal poverty (of order, collaboration, help, education, distribution, and so on) and is worse, even all other things (like relative cost of energy to average salary) being equal.You can be a slum-living destitute poor in a country even though you have financial access personally to several times the energy expenditure of someone in another country (or area of same country) with a different lifestyle."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This article is exceptional. It may be reductive or even wrong but at least it&#39;s trying to quantify these issues and it uses actual data. Not only does this allow for analysis, it also makes it, in theory, falsifiable.If the article is right and all it takes is around a doubling of the current global energy, at 1.1% population growth and a global annual increase in energy usage of 2.5%, this gives around 50 years before we start producing enough energy to push poverty levels below 1%."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"I&#39;m on 12 years of self hosting email and counting. Once every so often, I do end up being blocked, usually by Outlook and once by Yahoo. I&#39;m in their &#39;sender program&#39; and they still don&#39;t actually bother to contact postmaster@, but a few emails is usually enough to unblock the block within 24h.Agree with a sibling comment that many major providers fail to operate the SPF/DKIM/DMARC tools they insist you do.Each to their own, but ultimately if we don&#39;t hold on to the freedom to operate our own mailservers, it will be taken away through inaction. This means doing some things right: DMARC, DKIM, SPF of course, server maintenance, good password policies and of course IP reputation. The best way I can recommend for IP reputation is to use a dedicated provider or VPS provider that disallows things like VPN endpoints, where it is less likely they&#39;ll assign an address with a poor reputation. A good provider might also ask you what you intend to host, and you might be able to discuss IP addresses with them."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I&#39;ve been hosting my mail for 20+ years now, with minor issues. I guess I&#39;ve been lucky.Reading the comments here makes me incredibly sad. Every answer that tells me to use a provider misses the point. The Internet was created so that there could be many independent nodes, not so that everybody has to rely on one of several blessed providers. I should be able to run my own E-mail.The real problem is lack of incentives. The big corps do not care about e-mail. It doesn&#39;t make money and isn&#39;t easily controllable. You can&#39;t turn it into a walled garden and lock users in. So, it gets minimal attention, and only defensive measures are developed.Either we solve the spam problem, or things will get worse. The big tech corps won&#39;t solve it for us."</p>

It is about 36 years that I am writing software for a living.The longer I am a software engineer the longer I begin to understand that the soft skills are much more important than all the technical skills. For me software engineering is much about dealing with my insecurities and coming to term with my weaknesses.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; “Try different things” is the key, of course.32 year programmer here (started at 19).I cannot “amen” this sentiment enough. But probably not in the way most will read it.Most will interpret this at a macro level: Learn some Smalltalk! Now go learn Lisp! And then Clojure followed by Haskell, throw in some Java or C++ so you know what pain feels like! This is OK, it is good to be somewhat travelled in your journeys as a programmer.But I find that there is a micro application that gets overlooked. You can do a lot of “try new things” right in the stack you’re in without having to bust strange new worlds. Most languages end up with many ways to do things. You can and should take time to explore those. Learn the conventions/idioms, but then push/challenge those.I was afraid of C macros until I took time to really try some things with them. It didn’t mean I suddenly used them for everything, but overusing them for a bit helped me better make good choices about them.C pointers intimidated a peer until I forced him to forego index based for statements, using all pointer math instead.Smalltalk context objects were kind of “behind the scene” magic until I decided I’d like to figure out how to implement goto in Smalltalk. After that, they opened up for me.Python decorators are “magic” until you make a few of your own.The examples could go on and on.Try new things."</p>

The last thing the world needs is more software.The web is the crappiest platform ever conceived; I won&#39;t touch it. Social media is poison. Smartphones didn&#39;t impress me in 2007 and they don&#39;t impress me now. They&#39;re annoying and intrusive. I still like desktop software. I know, I&#39;m a dinosaur.I just don&#39;t care about computers any more. I don&#39;t care what direction the industry goes in. I&#39;m not depressed and I don&#39;t need to learn a new language or work on a different project.I love creative problem solving. What I do not love is solving whatever problems are handed to you without asking whether they truly need solutions, or whether it&#39;s good for the world. Much of what people want computers to do is a waste of time and of life.

In that case, the police should initiate a request to take them down that Cloudflare or ISPs etc. are obligated to follow. The problem is the government is completely ineffective and regularly offloads their responsibility to platforms like Facebook, Cloudflare etc. A private company should not be making decisions on essentially freedom of speech.

Instead of being convenient, USB C has become a confusing ordeal of varying capabilities and quality control. It is like we&#39;ve gone back to having many different types of connectors, but it is even worse because they share the same form factor. For any of the devices that use USB C to charge, I only use the cable that came with it when I purchased it.While I complain, I would also like to mention the USB forum&#39;s insane naming strategy and non-obvious labeling system. Remember when USB 3 was easily identifiable because of the blue plastic in the port?"</p>

It seems so much strictly worse than the old world of having different cables with different connectors - yes you had to have a lot of different cables but you couldn’t get it wrong.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been a big pain, for me.The only docks that have worked for me, have been the CalDigit TSX docks, which I have used for a long time. The TS4 is out of stock on the CalDigit site, and I&#39;m never using Amazon again, for anything over about $100. I&#39;ll get it, eventually.I have the latest 14-inch MBP (M1Max).The biggest issues that I encounter are:1) External keyboard wake up/recognized.If I use a dock, the keyboard is often not recognized. I found that I need to plug directly into the Mac. Otherwise, it sometimes won&#39;t wake the computer, or the computer sometimes &#34;forgets&#34; the keyboard.2) Monitor Handling.I use a 49&#34; LG Ultrawide (5120 X 1440). I used to have it split into two monitors (3840 X 1440, 1680 X 1440), but now use it as a single, ultrwawide, after Apple started natively supporting that resolution.I found that many docks (even &#34;Thunderbolt&#34; ones) and adapters, refused to allow me to select the ultrawide size. Also, the monitor would often fail to be recognized, after the computer wakes, and I would have to reach under, and unplug/replug, to get it recognized. I have the monitor plugged directly into one of the TB ports, with a TB-to-DP cable, and it works great.From what I understand, the new CalDigit should fix these issues."</p>

Unfortunately Luxe is still not publicly available (closed beta), which I admit is a bit of a frustration for me as I&#39;ve been following development for a few years, but it does show a lot of promise and in the meantime I&#39;ve become a happy user of Godot. I keep Wren in the back of my mind as an easy-to-embed scripting language in cases where you could integrate Lua (which Wren outspeeds) but not LuaJIT.[1] https://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=munificent[2] https://luxeengine.com/"</p>

								<p class="story__comment_others">"Wren seems pretty elegant, but it makes the same mistake a lot of languages do when it comes to operator overloading.  If you put the binary operator as a method on the first object, then there isn&#39;t a simple way to have &#34;builtin_object &lt;operator&gt; your_object&#34;.For instance, Wren doesn&#39;t provide complex numbers, so you aren&#39;t going to get a nice syntax for &#34;1/z&#34; or similar.  I could make similar examples with scalar multiplication for vectors, matrices, or Numpy-style arrays, etc...Python and other languages have fallbacks to work around this, but Wren does not.  And really, I think of binary operators as 2 argument functions, not methods on the left object."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Buyer beware - my wife hates Amazon and goes out of her way to not purchase from them. She has encountered several vendors on Walmart marketplace that simply place orders with Amazon at 100% markup - the packages arrive in Amazon boxes w/ a receipt showing the actual cost paid at Amazon. Total rip-off.When ordering electronics from Walmart Marketplace, particularly TVs, I’ve found that the marketplace sellers freely substitute makes and models. Maybe nobody notices if you are shipping a gift to someone else, but since I need specific models from specific manufacturers for development it gets noticed when I order LG model XYZ and get a no-name tv instead. I stopped ordering from Walmart altogether after the second time (out of two, consecutive) that happened.So my advice is anything you buy online at Walmart, make sure it is not a marketplace seller, just save yourself the trouble.In all cases Wal-Mart refunded my money after waiting for a week for the vendor to respond, though I had to lug the stuff to the UPS store to return it. Amazon usually suggests I donate stuff rather then return it.I’ve not had any issues with the items sold by Wal-mart actual, those you can buy with confidence."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Amazon let’s the same thing happen in their store: https://www.amazon.com/s?k=1+tb+flash+drive&amp;crid=1XK7KPUOQ4X...It’s horrible and they won’t do anything about it despite contacting them via help requests and Twitter.3 of the top 5 listings are total scams.And Amazon’s choice for 1TB flash drive is a scam: USB Flash Drive 1TB, Flash Memory Stick for PC/Laptop, Ultra Large Storage USB Drive, Portable Thumb Drives (Black) https://a.co/d/cTi7XqZ"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Flash drives with hacked firmware to pretend to be bigger capacity than they were (along with other evildoing, like counterfeits targeting people paying a premium to get Sandisk quality) were already rampant on eBay IIRC 15+ years ago.I was still seething over some of the storage ones when, a few years ago, I joined an anti-counterfeiting startup.  (Sadly, our successful MVP launch integrated into a high-end factory production line happened just as Covid was breaking out, which spooked our flagship customer, and impacted followthrough we needed, then we ran out of runway while pivoting.)As a consumer, I can imagine a lot of things that the marketplaces like Amazon.com and Walmart.com could do to improve trustworthiness.  I don&#39;t know whether those make business sense.  I&#39;d love to see consumers reward a marketplace that conspicuously kept out the scammers.Ideally, the solution would protect integrity of all brands, not only house brands."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"There&#39;s 2 different things going on here:- The optimal amount of fraud in society is 0- The optimal amount of fraud a business/industry should accept is non-zeroThe simple observation that the cost to prevent each marginal fraud attempt increases; the last 0.1% of fraud costs way too much to prevent compared to the first 99%. Obviously society would be better off if fraud didn&#39;t exist, but since it does the effort expended is only worth it up until when the marginal cost of prevention exceeds an acceptable threshold (when it starts to lose you money).The optimal amount of fraud is still 0, but the optimal amount of fraud prevention lies somewhere on the margin.This is why important transactions like banking have KYC checks, and buying a pair of sneakers don&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This whole article is one giant time sapping piece of click bait.The author makes the unexpected claim that businesses want a non zero amount of fraud. And so as a reader you are tempted to read on because you haven&#39;t heard this before. But essentially the argument is that fraud is needed as an unavoidable byproduct of allowing trust/credit in the system to facilitate transactions. However, if businesses could have the trust without the fraud of course they would. I wouldn&#39;t be so upset if the author had been more upfront about what this was about. I&#39;m sure there are plenty of people out there who are learning about the fraud and trust/credit relationship for the first time. Just don&#39;t try and spin this in a way that it isn&#39;t."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I feel like this starts with an agreeable premise. Some fraud is egregious, costly, and/or easy to detect. These low-hanging or high-impact cases are most worth pursuing. At some point you reach diminishing returns, where the amount of time / effort / capital you&#39;re putting in to eliminating fraud outstrips the losses from the fraud itself.I don&#39;t know that I agree with the ethical conclusion that the optimal amount of fraud is therefore non-zero. The leap from &#34;anti-fraud efforts are expensive&#34; to these sentences in the final paragraph was not, in my opinion, convincingly made here:&gt;We should, as a society, accept non-zero amounts of benefits fraud. We should accept non-zero amounts of cheating on taxes."</p>

This is included not allowing the creation of new accounts and reminding everyone that their data will be turned over to the authorities should it be requested.The only thing that picked up steam in the last two weeks is the campaign to drop Cloudflare and the media attention on the situation.

								<p class="story__comment_others">"To be maybe controversial...I&#39;m still thinking about it, but I do wonder if diverse casting works in European fantasy stories. The problem I have is that it generally pulls me out of the experience/ makes it less immersive. I welcome diverse castings in modern shows (though we don&#39;t need every show to follow a template &#39;diverse&#39; casting). 
A common counter argument is, well you can suspend your disbelief and imagine a dragon, so why is a diverse community in a small village not ok? It just feels less immersive. Yes, I can go along with it - but I&#39;m not sure it works. It feels like the modern world superimposed in a fantasy setting. I&#39;d prefer to be sent to an alien world.It is problematic, as years of discrimination in the real world for women/ethnic minorities were wrong and we should encourage equality in the corporate world. However the entertainment industry I wonder should in some ways be exempt. Maybe. One area where there isnt a discussion on &#39;diversity&#39; is music and also novels. This is because there are tons of tons of novels and music bands to listen to. No one cares if a particular band is &#39;diverse&#39;. 
So I wonder if the only solution out of all of this, is to have more shows - yes, make diverse inclusive European fantasy shows, but also make traditional european fantasy shows too etc. What I think will happen is that in such a scenario most European fantasy fans will choose traditional like shows. Because the story is more immersive and you are brought more into this old world. Maybe. Like I say, I&#39;m still undecided. For modern/futuristic films I find diverse castings just as immersive."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I don&#39;t get reviews saying that TRoP, or some other new prestige TV series, is &#34;terrible&#34;, or &#34;a disaster&#34;, based on the first couple of episodes.Some really excellent TV series have taken more than a whole 26-episode season before they find their rhythm and get properly good. ST:TNG is a classic example, but I&#39;m pretty sure you can come up with others. And some people are claiming that a new series totally worthless, not based on the first series, but based on the first episode? Are you kidding me?I mean, is it OK if the first episode of a series is unevenly paced, and contains too much exposition, and clunky &#34;tell, don&#39;t show&#34; dialogue about who the main characters are and what their deal is? No, no it isn&#39;t. We should ask that writers do better, and trust audiences to have the patience to learn who characters are through action over the course of a few episodes.But just because they don&#39;t do those things, is it really worth writing off the next 5 (or however many) seasons of a show, based on one episode? Who does that? What does anyone gain from that?OK, there&#39;s a lot of prestige serialised TV out there now, and you probably can&#39;t watch all of it even if you wanted to, so some culling is probably necessary at some stage. But does anyone really have to write something off quite so soon? You can&#39;t even give it half a season to try and get up to speed?I don&#39;t get it."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Everyone here is so incredibly focused on money as the primary motivator, which I guess given the thread question makes some sense. But I&#39;d like to just put in a little word for money not being everything, and client type / work type actually being a really important part of the equation.HN is a forum where increasingly I see posts every single day about the high level of misery in tech / how can I get out of this rat race / high levels of stress / undervalued / etc etc.I charge £500 a day. It&#39;s not much compared to some of the rates on here, but I work with lovely, interesting clients in the non-profit sector. My clients love what they do and I do good work for them so they love what I do. I have long term, low stress, friendship-like relationships with my clients, not shouty / nasty / high stress ones. I&#39;ve done this work for 12 years, and had to work with maybe a handful of assholes during that time.FWIW I think there is a &#34;lower budget bar&#34; under which demands are insane for the money being offered, and we should all avoid this work unless we actively want to take a race to the bottom. But - I think there is undoubtedly a &#34;higher budget bar&#34; over which the stress level and expectation is made exceedingly high. This (I would imagine; I don&#39;t know, I&#39;ve worked in non profits my whole life) is probably also equated with sector - if you&#39;re in a FinTech environment I would imagine you&#39;re looking at high budgets but also an insane number of highly pressured assholes shouting at you all the time.What am I basically saying? I guess - yes, charge enough (and this is probably more than you think it should be) - but also, look at the bigger picture of your work / sector. Think about happiness, work-life balance, client motivations, etc - and use this to inform what you charge and how you charge for it. That&#39;d be my advice."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Anybody who did PS1 dev back in the day will have had to do some crazy hacking stuff to get performance or memory.  The first project [1] I worked on I had a C version of my graphics engine and animation system, and in parallel I&#39;d have a MIPS assembly version which was super optimised (the C version was effectively a reference).I made the whole engine and animation system fit in 4K so it would fit into the instruction cache of the CPU.  The whole frame update cycle wouldn&#39;t need to touch main memory (for the code).Also, because loading from main memory was slow (4 cycles) and the chip was RISC (1 operation per cycle), you&#39;d need 3 NOPs after the Load-op for the register to be loaded. The C compiler (if I remember right) never really filled those 3 NOPs with useful stuff.  So, I&#39;d do hand written concurrency (in MIPS assembly) by loading other stuff I&#39;d need into those NOPs - this was particularly effective when working with 3 dimensional vectors or 4 dimensional matrices.Trying to keep super-optimised hand-written concurrency in assembly, in my head, was a challenge and not something I&#39;d recommend!  Still, the engine had more throughput than Sony claimed of their machine.  Every bit of performance gained would mean an edge over the other games.Then the game was canned by Eidos.

Or prevent it from producing pornography? Or CP? The last one should be fairly straightforward (kid + nudity = get it out), but the first two are very broad limitations. I understand if you want to make it not super racist, but with pornography, I&#39;m not sure it has a point... even more so given the fact that erotic art is very common in the real world and I&#39;m pretty sure this model (and others like it) can&#39;t distinguish between erotic art and pornography (which you can&#39;t blame it for given the legal standard seeming to be &#34;I recognize it when I see it&#34;), meaning it can only ever be used to produce SFW imagery scrubbed of any &#34;risque&#34; factors or themes, because the authors didn&#39;t want to deal with any kind of erotic art due to this impossibility of separating erotic art from pornography.If the point of all of these models is to get to something resembling an artist, then why intentionally kneecap it from the start and prevent it from producing art?"</p>

We used to do that (certainly to a massively greater extent than we do now), and the result was that although a few of them managed to construct monuments we can all be proud of, most of them built a pile of crap and/or damaged the places they built in and the people they nominally built for. This is true of literal buildings, but it&#39;s also true of a great many other things that we &#34;build&#34;.The author of this delightfully titled but almost content-free piece seems not to consider Chesterton&#39;s Fence at all: before you criticize let alone dismantle regulation, you should be able to demonstrate a sound understanding of why it came to exist in the first place. For bonus points, a rigorous explanation of why the reasoning no longer applies in the current time period is helpful. TFA provided neither."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Unspoken and underlying the author&#39;s entire worldview seems to be, &#34;the more new things, the better,&#34; a not uncommon tunnel view in the engineering world. The purpose of regulation, ideally, is to ensure that whatever activity/process is being regulated is worth the cost(s) for the majority of people. Defining those terms and making that decision is precisely the job of regulators, who are ideally accountable to a democratic base. In the worldview where all that matters is &#34;growth,&#34; people suffer. Running water is a huge quality of life win for EVERYONE. If you ask most people what would really help make their lives better, it&#39;s not gonna be colonizing mars, building tunnels under LA, whatever, it&#39;s gonna be access to resources we already have. Healthcare, clean water, clean air...perhaps we should think more about engineering as it can be applied to expanding access, and not so much to &#34;making new things,&#34; which most people don&#39;t need or care at all about."</p>

Why bother constructing housing when you can just have other people&#39;s labour increase your land values? Why should I increase the supply of residency spots when constraining that supply increases my salary by $100k? Why bother with bold bets when you have net work effect monopolies?

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"A better question might be: Why is the private sector responsible for providing accurate health information? As this article shows, the incentives for people running medical websites and the people reading them are not aligned. I&#39;d say the UK NHS website and symptoms/medications pages hit the nail on the head - https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/. It has no advertising and provides short, easily readable and actionable information on the majority of conditions and the correct way to use and take many different sorts of medication.And crucially - if the information present is not sufficient, clear and obvious UI elements that direct the next best steps to get the help you need, whether that be ringing the non emergency helpline or immediately going to A&amp;E. (It&#39;s been commented on before, but the new UK government sites are very consistently structured and open source their design systems https://service-manual.nhs.uk/design-system)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"The phenomenon they describe for health information is, IMHO, absolutely rife across many different domains. Try looking up information about gardening, plant management, home improvement, etc - you&#39;ll find the same thing. Search results dominated by sites that have mastered the art of producing SEO-optimised &#34;content&#34; that is not authoritative, full of waffle, and not especially helpful.For whatever reason, the business model of &#34;draw a huge amount of traffic&#34; outcompetes the business model of &#34;provide a really good source of information&#34;.It&#39;s interesting to ponder why in very specific domains, that&#39;s not the case: for instance, StackOverflow dominates in programming queries, and provides very useful content.Someone much smarter than me should write a really good blog post about this."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"You are trying to solve a real-world problem experienced by a lot of profitable companies, so there is already a market of paying customers waiting for this.  One of my clients is actively trying to reduce their dependence on Amazon and instead integrate with other marketplaces.I see it&#39;s just Shopify-to-Shopify for now - bravo for starting with probably one of the most costly integrations.  I&#39;m working with a client right now who had to build these integrations using a low-code drag-n-drop platform which allows a quick MVP but has slow job processing, so isn&#39;t great for high order volume.The &#34;amazon&#34; comparison is good for marketing - sure you&#39;re not doing all their marketing, or having their reach but you are connecting suppliers, buyers and fulfilment which is a genuine problem.The companies who would use this often have developers on board already, so providing open source, accepting contributions and turning this into a useful dev-friendly service will almost certainly find paying customers.Following :)"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"A few points I&#39;m skeptical of:  simply connect to the seller’s infra instead of locking them in.

One of the value-adds of Amazon is there&#39;s a whole bunch of tech sellers don&#39;t need to know how to write, run, and maintain. You&#39;d need to understand how big the niche &#34;technically literate to run their own e-commerce business, but selling on Amazon for other reasons&#34; is, then how your operation would answer those &#34;other reasons&#34; to make you competitive to the niche.  If, for some reason, the seller is removed from the marketplace, their software stays with them and they can continue accepting orders directly.

Apart from the software systems, there&#39;s a whole bunch of basic business processes that Amazon takes care of, which are less portable. Using FBA? Leaving means learning how to run a warehouse, shipping logistics, pricing, staffing, etc. Not using FBA? How&#39;s your Marketing department doing? Hopefully you didn&#39;t let it get too anemic or too fitted to &#34;people who are good at gaming Amazon&#39;s algorithm.&#34;In short, if your value add is: &#34;Amazon, but you get to take the tech home with you if you leave the platform,&#34; then that feels like a small niche of highly competent businesses, then you&#39;re stuck with &#34;well if they could do all this on their own anyway, why are they choosing Amazon?&#34;Hope that helps and wasn&#39;t just me blabbering. Good luck!"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Love open source projects in the eCommerce domain, especially ones that are JavaScript instead of PHP! Two pieces of feedback:- Using a copyleft license like AGPL makes this an automatic non-starter for most businesses, no matter how impressive your tech might be. You&#39;ll have a lot more luck with mid-size and enterprise adoption with an MIT license.- You&#39;ve really built an Order Management System for marketplace use cases, which is in industry typically a distinct domain from a Warehouse Management System (WMS) or a Transportation Management System (TMS) which at large-scale tend to handle how orders actually get fulfilled and shipped to customers. Your naming is a bit misleading - at the very least I&#39;d emphasize somewhere on your landing page that this is an open source Order Management System if you want eCommerce domain folks to grok quickly what you&#39;ve built and how it plugs into a broader architecture."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"It&#39;s always great to see different ways folks are using Firecracker. Snapshot-and-restore is a particularly cool capability, especially if you solve the data movement problems (like these folks have).One challenge to clone-and-restore that they don&#39;t talk about here is making sure that clones don&#39;t behave too similarly (like returning the same cryptographic random numbers). We wrote a paper about that a while back (https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12892), and the Linux kernel community has been doing some great work in that area recently too."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Beware that such techniques slow down memory access for the newly running VM quite substantially.For example, a simple memset() call across a few gigabytes of RAM inside the VM might slow down a factor of 1000x after a VM clone like this.Both &#39;parent&#39; and &#39;child&#39; VM&#39;s see the slowdowns.Some types of garbage collector also see really substantial slowdowns.It was a deal-breaker for my project where I did similar sorts of things."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Not to diminish this work, but I think it&#39;s worth noting that it&#39;s increasingly possibly to launch new VMs extremely quickly too.  FreeBSD/Firecracker can reach userland in 33 ms, and the OSv unikernel boots in under 10 ms.I think increasingly we&#39;ll see Firecracker used with EC2-like setups of &#34;create a disk image with everything preinstalled and then boot it&#34; rather than using snapshots of running (suspended) VMs."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"Both Kagi and Orion are deeply impressive products. Even though I try every new general purpose web browser and search engine that comes out, this combo is the only one that stuck.Orion: Finally a non-chrome based web browser that can compete with the likes of Brave and Arc. It works much better on Mac than the alternatives, with the same engine as Safari it also benefits from deeper system integration such as native Sign-in with Apple and password management. Also, like Brave, comes with powerful ad and tracker blocker so you don&#39;t need a separate extension. I also love its built-in tree-style tabs implementation.Kagi: It is Google without all the bad parts. It is user centric like some other alternatives, without the poor index and search results.Props to the team, I am looking forward to what&#39;s to come. It is mind blowing how a single small company can make one of the best desktop browser AND search engine AND mobile browser on the market. Hope they are not spreading themselves too thin and can fund the development of all these for a long time!My only complaints are the slow performance of Orion on iOS, and its poor handling of app urls. Latter caused some issues when I had Orion set as the default browser on my iPhone and some payment flow that used app redirects between my banking app and the store app got stuck. I was lucky and I could manually launch the app by pasting the app link in Safari, but I hope it can handle these cases as well as Mobile Safari in the future."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I joined the Kagi beta two weeks before it ended and have been a paying user ever since. I find the price to be quite steep but so far it have no regrets and will most likely continue my subscription. I average over 2000 queries per month.- Search result quality is at least equal to Google for most queries and far superior for queries involving discussions or technical topics. Sadly, it is inferior for queries in my area of expertise (Swiss law).- Kagi is the only alternative to Google that I know of (and I have tried many) which is able to produce good regional results and mix them - when appropriate - with international results. Most privacy focused search engines are very US centric.- Blog spam and copy cats are not completely gone but the situation is at least bearable, especially after continuosly filtering them and boosting credible sites instead.- Customization options, filtering options, speed and site layout are also far superior when compared to Google.Apart from the lower quality results from queries involving my area of expertise, the only thing that still keeps me using Google Search are the reviews from Google Maps.All in all, I recommend supporting this product."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I can&#39;t stress how much better Kagi is than Google, I&#39;m a paying user. No more scrolling through tons of ads. Filtering by time and language is great, no more GitHub and Stackoverflow clones in the result. 
Thank you, I actually haven&#39;t realized how small Kagi still is, given how polished that product already is."</p>

I’m here questioning my life, and reduced to worthlessness."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"These styles of multi-round interviews inspired by the FAANG collective started picking up in Australia before the pandemic, but it got to a point where most of my more talented colleagues and I all agreed it just wasn’t worth the time for the salaries being offered. 4 round interviews for a ‘senior’ developer position on $120k?When interviewing my own candidates, I use a 1 hour interview mostly focused on approach and personality. We have a probation period to work out if they’ve over-promised, and most of our tech industry is big banks that won’t notice if they waste a few weeks salary trying someone out. Honestly, for the salaries the local market provides, I think 1 interview is fair. Any more and I think we’re wasting peoples time for nothing.Personally, I’ve dropped out of application processes when they’ve indicated there are multiple rounds, and my salary hasn’t suffered for it relative to my friends who put up with them, so I feel like I’m ahead."</p>

But we&#39;re not going to move forward with you! Good luck!!!&#34;) and on my side while pretending I was excited when in fact I was worried about money and the gap on my resume.I dread the next one."</p>

Sure. But like I said, the Meetup docs are pretty clear what happens when you follow their instructions.It&#39;s hard not to read OP as &#34;we took an action without doing due diligence to fully understand the consequences of doing so.&#34; The point at which you make an assumption like this is the point at which you bear equal responsibility for unfavorable outcomes.Edit—the UI is actually very clear about this, and has been for at least the last couple of years: &#34;Your members will be given the chance to become the organizer and keep the group running without you.&#34;"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"This has been an issue with Meetup for as long as I remember. The problem is there are two distinct scenarios.One is that the organizer has lost interest or is stepping down for some reason. Allowing the community to continue on Meetup in that case makes sense, by having someone step up to continue paying Meetup.The other is that the community as a whole has decided to move to a new platform. In this case keeping the now defunct community around and making it seem viable is bad. The current active members will know where to go, but new potential members or former members that want to re-engage are going to get confused.I got burned by this a couple of times, finding a group on meetup only to discover that it’s a ghost group, to the point where I’m now suspicious of any meetup group I find that hasn’t had an active event in the last couple of months.This is where I think Meetup is shooting themselves in the foot by not having a way to dissolve a group if the group as a whole decides to move."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"This really sucks to hear. What’s unclear to me is whether Twitter is being negligent or abnormal here or whether this is just shitty world politics unfolding partly on Twitter. Twitter is being used by both sides to fight over a narrative. Nothing new in that respect.The author doesn&#39;t really propose a solution other than Twitter essentially siding with him and take (what appears to me to be) a political stance. Of course moderating political topics isn’t outside Twitter’s wheelhouse, but this is what you get as a society when you let arbitrary entities arbitrate speech: ambiguity and unclear expectations.On the one hand, it’s reasonable for the author to expect that Twitter removes clear misinformation from their platform since that’s what they purportedly claim to do. On the other hand doing so would go against a national narrative and piss off lots of Pakistanis. Uh oh.Maybe Twitter was never about being arbiters of facts and instead just pandering to the popular political narrative of the time? Or maybe they are objective and they’re just trying their best and we’re all human and we’ll do better next time? Regardless, this is the reason people get so frustrated with censorship: it cannot be applied objectively and fairly in every case.Twitter and social commentary aside: sounds like the author needs political asylum or at least real protection. Twitter is not the right entity to depend on to handle this situation, I fear."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I am sorry for the responses I am seeing on HN. People with cushy lives who&#39;ve likely never faced similar danger seem to just not really get it.I will say that your framing is one that most Westerners will have trouble taking seriously.It might go over better to document known cases where this pattern occurred and show the similarities.  Walk people through it like they are five, so to speak.I know it&#39;s hard to do that kind of objective writing when you are feeling so threatened due to genuine threats, but in my experience that approach works better.I know you didn&#39;t ask for advice. I apologize for my bad habit of trying to be helpful in the only way I know how.I hope something improves soon."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"&gt; Twitter, despite millions of Pakistani users, it seems has no moderation system that understands local dynamics.Many would argue they don&#39;t even understand the local dynamics of the U.S. It&#39;s impossible for twitter to be an arbiter of the truth around the world, and you shouldn&#39;t expect them to be. However, I understand that&#39;s cold comfort for someone facing the threat of torture, death, or exile from their home, and I think your decision to call out twitter using your own platform to act with respect to your specific circumstances is the right thing to do and really the only way to handle this kind of thing.Good luck, I hope you stay safe and that the government doesn&#39;t succeed in silencing you."</p>

								<p class="story__comment_first line-clamp">"My favorite Stephenson&#39;s novel is Anathem with superb world building (as usual) but also a pretty good story and ending.But it&#39;s also a book whose world (specifically the avout society) attracts me. I&#39;ve grown up in a Catholic setting, but &#34;converted&#34; to atheism/agnosticism pretty early. But even with its many failings, there are certain aspects of religions which seem worth preserving - the focus on community, the rituals, a particular rule framework, meditation (prayers) and introspection.The book presents a (on a certain level) pretty attractive model of society which combines the practical religious patterns with a full rationalism.I kind of understand why such &#34;atheist religion&#34; is unlikely to get off in the real world, but it&#39;s still something I would wish for."</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"I agree, I don&#39;t think diamond age gets enough interest. It&#39;s one of my favorite books and the ending is unsatisfying but at least upbeat. Seveneves is also tons of fun. And if you know anyone who likes history, his older Baroque Cycle is pretty greatI haven&#39;t heard this in an interview or anything but I think now Stephenson is older and successful enough, he just writes the books exactly how he likes. Diamond age feels like he was agonizing over every word to keep everything so short. But Fall, and his newest book Termination Shock (which I also didn&#39;t like most of) ,just feels like an author who likes writing. Both have these amazing moments, which reminds me like a jazz musician, where it&#39;s almost effortlessly insightful and funny. But with no editing or second thoughts"</p>
							
						
							
								<p class="story__comment_others">"Much as I love Neal Stephenson&#39;s novels, I really wish he&#39;d stayed around at the writer&#39;s class he surely took until they had learned how to wrap up books and write endings; more often than not, I turn the page on a Stephenson novel only to find it was the last...(While I exaggerate a little, his stories do not end as much as END - I would be thrilled if he could spend a few pages wrapping it up in the end before leaving us waiting for the next title...)The yarns he constructs are definitely entertaining enough for me to cope with this very minor annoyance, though."</p>
